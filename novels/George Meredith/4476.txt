of the great undelivered speech xlii the last chapter i across london bridge a gentleman noteworthy for a lively countenance and a waistcoat to match it crossing london bridge at noon on a gusty april day was almost magically detached from his conflict with the gale by some sly strip of slipperiness abounding in that conduit of the markets which had more or less adroitly performed the trick upon preceding passengers and now laid this one flat amid the shuffle of feet peaceful for the moment as the uncomplaining who have gone to sabrina beneath the tides he was unhurt quite sound merely astonished he remarked in reply to the inquiries of the first kind helper at his elbow and it appeared an acceptable statement of his condition he laughed shook his coat tails smoothed the back of his head rather thoughtfully thankfully received his runaway hat nodded bright beams to right and left and making light of the muddy stigmas imprinted by the pavement he scattered another shower of his nods and smiles around to signify that as his good friends would wish he thoroughly felt his legs and could walk unaided and he was in the act of doing it questioning his familiar behind the waistcoat amazedly to tell him how such a misadventure could have occurred to him of all men when a glance below his chin discomposed his outward face 'oh confound the fellow' he said with simple frankness and was humorously ruffled having seen absurd blots of smutty knuckles distributed over the maiden waistcoat his outcry was no more than the confidential communication of a genial spirit with that distinctive article of his attire at the same time for these friendly people about him to share the fun of the annoyance he looked hastily brightly back seeming with the contraction of his brows to frown on the little band of observant samaritans in the centre of whom a man who knew himself honourably unclean perhaps consequently a bit of a political jewel hearing one of their number confounded for his pains and by the wearer of a superfine dashing white waistcoat was moved to take notice of the total deficiency of gratitude in this kind of gentleman's look and pocket if we ask for nothing for helping gentlemen to stand upright on their legs and get it we expect civility into the bargain moreover there are reasons in nature why we choose to give sign of a particular surliness when our wealthy superiors would have us think their condescending grins are cordials the gentleman's eyes were followed on a second hurried downward grimace the necessitated wrinkles of which could be stretched by malevolence to a semblance of haughty disgust reminding us through our readings in journals of the wicked overblown prince regent and his court together with the view taken of honest labour in the mind of supercilious luxury even if indebted to it freshly for a trifle and the hoar headed nineteenth century billow of democratic ire craved the word to be set swelling 'am i the fellow you mean sir' the man said he was answered not ungraciously 'all right my man' but the balance of our public equanimity is prone to violent antic bobbings on occasions when for example an ostentatious garment shall appear disdainful our class and ourself and coin of the realm has not usurped command of one of the scales thus a fairly pleasant answer cast in persuasive features provoked the retort 'there you're wrong nor wouldn't be' 'what's that' was the gentleman's musical inquiry 'that's flat as you was half a minute ago' the man rejoined 'ah well don't be impudent' the gentleman said by way of amiable remonstrance before a parting 'and none of your dam punctilio' said the man their exchange rattled smartly without a direct hostility and the gentleman stepped forward it was observed in the crowd that after a few paces he put two fingers on the back of his head they might suppose him to be condoling with his recent mishap but in fact a thing had occurred to vex him more than a descent upon the pavement or damage to his waistcoat's whiteness he abominated the thought of an altercation with a member of the mob he found that enormous beat comprehensible only when it applauded him and besides he wished it warmly well all that was good for it plentiful dinners country excursions stout menagerie bars music a dance and to bed he was for patting stroking petting the mob for tossing it sops never for irritating it to show an eye tooth much less for causing it to exhibit the grinders and in endeavouring to get at the grounds of his dissension with that dirty fisted fellow the recollection of the word punctilio shot a throb of pain to the spot where his mishap had rendered him susceptible headache threatened and to him of all men but was there ever such a word for drumming on a cranium puzzles are presented to us now and then in the course of our days and the smaller they are the better for the purpose it would seem and they come in rattle boxes they are actually children's toys for what they contain but not the less do they buzz at our understandings and insist that they break or we and in either case to show a mere foolish idle rattle in hollowness or does this happen to us only after a fall he tried a suspension of his mental efforts and the word was like the clapper of a disorderly bell striking through him with reverberations in the form of interrogations as to how he of all men living could by any chance have got into a wrangle in a thoroughfare on london bridge of all places in the world he so popular renowned for his affability his amiability having no dislike to common dirty dogs entirely the reverse liking them and doing his best for them and accustomed to receive their applause and in what way had he offered a hint to bring on him the charge of punctilio 'but i am treating it seriously' he said and jerked a dead laugh while fixing a button of his coat that he should have treated it seriously furnished next the subject of cogitation and here it was plainly suggested that a degradation of his physical system owing to the shock of the fall must be seen and acknowledged for it had become a perverted engine to pull him down among the puerilities and very soon he was worrying at punctilio anew attempting to read the riddle of the application of it to himself angry that he had allowed it to be the final word and admitting it a famous word for the closing of a controversy it banged the door and rolled drum notes it deafened reason and was it a london cockney crow word of the day or a word that had stuck in the fellow's head from the perusal of his pothouse newspaper columns furthermore the plea of a fall and the plea of a shock from a fall required to account for the triviality of the mind were humiliating to him who had never hitherto missed a step or owned to the shortest of collapses this confession of deficiency in explosive repartee using a friend's term for the ready gift was an old and a rueful one with victor radnor his godmother fortune denied him that she bestowed it on his friend fenellan and little else simeon fenellan could clap the halter on a coltish mob he had positively caught the roar of cries and stilled it by capping the cries in turn until the people cheered him and the effect of the scene upon victor radnor disposed him to rank the gift of repartee higher than a certain rosily oratorical that he was permitted to tell himself he possessed in bottle if not on draught let it only be explosive repartee the well fused bomb the bubble to the stone echo round the horn fenellan would have discharged an extinguisher on punctilio in emission victor radnor was unable to cope with it reflectively no but one doesn't like being beaten by anything he replied to an admonishment of his better mind as he touched his two fingers more significantly dubious than the whole hand at the back of his head and checked or stemmed the current of a fear for he was utterly unlike himself he was dwelling on a trifle on a matter discernibly the smallest an incident of the streets and although he refused to feel a bump or any responsive notification of a bruise he made a sacrifice of his native pride to his intellectual in granting that he must have been shaken so childishly did he continue thinking yes well and if a tumble distorts our ideas of life and an odd word engrosses our speculations we are poor creatures he addressed another friend from whom he stood constitutionally in dissent naming him colney and under pressure of the name reviving old wrangles between them upon man's present achievements and his probable destinies especially upon england's grandeur vitality stability her intelligent appreciation of her place in the universe not to speak of the historic dignity of london city colney had to be overcome afresh and he fled but managed with two or three of his bitter phrases to make a cuttle fish fight of it that oppressively shadowed his vanquisher the daniel lambert of cities the female annuitant of nations and such like wretched stuff proper to colney durance easily dispersed and out laughed when we have our vigour we have as much as we need of it in summoning a contemptuous pooh to our lips with a shrug at venomous dyspepsia nevertheless a malignant sketch of colney's in the which hengist and horsa our fishy saxon originals in modern garb of liveryman and gaitered squire flat headed paunchy assiduously servile are shown blacking ben israel's boots and grooming the princely stud of the jew had come so near to victor radnor's apprehensions of a possible if not an impending consummation that the ghastly vision of the jew dominant in london city over england over europe america the world a picture drawn in literary sepia by colney with our poor hang neck population uncertain about making a bell rope of the forelock to the satyr snouty master and the norman lord de warenne handing him for a lump sum son and daughter both to be hebraized in their different ways fastened on the most mercurial of patriotic men and gave him a whole length plunge into despondency it lasted nearly a minute his recovery was not in this instance due to the calling on himself for the rescue of an ancient and glorious country nor altogether to the spectacle of the shipping over the parapet to his right the hundreds of masts rising out of the merchant river london's unrivalled mezzotint and the city' rhetorician's inexhaustible argument he gained it rather from the imperious demand of an animated and thirsty frame for novel impressions commonly he was too hot with his business and airy fancies above it when crossing the bridge to reflect in freshness on its wonders though a phrase could spring him alive to them a suggestion of the foreigner jealous condemned to admire in despair of outstripping like satan worsted or when a premier's fine inflation magnified the scene at city banquets exciting while audible if a waggery in memory or when england's cherished bard the leading article blew bellows and wind primed the lieges that a phrase on any other subject was of much the same effect in relation to it may be owned he was lightly kindled the scene however had a sharp sparkle of attractiveness at the instant down went the twirling horizontal pillars of a strong tide from the arches of the bridge breaking to wild water at a remove and a reddish northern cheek of curdling pipeing east at shrilly puffs between the tower and the custom house encountered it to whip and ridge the flood against descending tug and long tail of stern ajerk empty barges with a steamer slowly noseing round off the wharf cranes preparing to swirl the screw and half bottom upward boats dancing harpooner beside their whale along an avenue not fabulously golden of the deputy masts of all nations a wintry woodland every rag aloft curling to volume and here the spouts and the mounds of steam and rolls of brown smoke there variously undulated curved to vanish cold blue sky ashift with the whirl and dash of a very tartar cavalry of cloud overhead surely a scene pretending to sublimity gazeing along that grand highway of the voyageing forest your london citizen of good estate has reproached his country's poets for not pouring out succinctly and melodiously his multitudinous larvae of notions begotten by the scene for there are times when he would pay to have them sung and he feels them big he thinks them human in their bulk they are londinensian they want but form and fire to get them scored on the tablets of the quotable at festive boards this he can promise to his poets as for otherwhere than at the festive commerce invoked is a goddess that will have the reek of those boards to fill her nostrils and poet and alderman alike may be dedicate to the sublime she leads them after two sniffs of an idea concerning her for the dive into the turtle tureen heels up they go poet first a plummet he and besides it is barely possible for our rounded citizen in the mood of meditation to direct his gaze off the bridge along the waterway north eastward without beholding as an eye the glow of whitebait's bow window by the riverside to the front of the summer sunset a league or so down stream where he sees in memory savours the elysian end of commerce frontispiece of a tale to fetch us up the out wearied spectre of old apicius yea and urge crispinus to wheel his purse into the market for the purchase of a costlier mullet but is the jew of the usury gold becoming our despot king of commerce in that case we do not ask our country's poets to compose a single stanza of eulogy's rhymes far from it far to the contrary we bid ourselves remember the sons of whom we are instead of revelling in the fruits of commerce we shoot scornfully past those blazing bellied windows of the aromatic dinners and beyond thames away to the fishermen's deeps old england's native element where the strenuous ancestry of a race yet and ever manful at the stress of trial are heard around and aloft whistling us back to the splendid strain of muscle and spray fringes cloud and strong heart rides the briny scoops and hillocks and death and man are at grip for the haul there we find our nationality our poetry no hebrew competing we do or there at least we left it whether to recover it when wanted is not so certain humpy hengist and dumpy horsa quitting ledger and coronet might recur to their sea bowlegs and red stubble chins might take to their tarpaulins again they might renew their manhood on the capture of cod headed by harald and hardiknut they might roll surges to whelm a dominant jew clean gone to the fleshpots and effeminacy aldermen of our ancient conception they may teach him that he has been backsliding once more and must repent in ashes as those who are for jewels titles essences banquets for wallowing in slimy spawn of lucre have ever to do they dispossess him of his greedy gettings and how of the law but the law is always and must ever be the law of the stronger ay but brain beats muscle and what if the jew should prove to have superior power of brain a dreaded hypothesis why then you see the insurgent saxon seamen of the names in two syllables with accent on the first and their danish captains and it may be but a remnant of high nosed old norman lord de warenne beside them in the criminal box and presently the jew smoking a giant regalia cigar on a balcony giving view of a gallows tree but we will try that on our side to back a native pugnacity is morality humanity fraternity nature's rights aha and who withstands them on his a troop of mercenaries and that lands me in red republicanism a hop and a skip from socialism said mr radnor and chuckled ironically at the natural declivity he had come to still there was an idea in it a short run or attempt at running after the idea ended in pain to his head near the spot where the haunting word punctilio caught at any excuse for clamouring yet we cannot relinquish an idea that was ours we are vowed to the pursuit of it mr radnor lighted on the tracks by dint of a thought flung at his partner mr inchling's dread of the jews inchling dreaded scotchmen as well and americans and armenians and greeks latterly germans hardly less but his dread of absorption in jewry signifying subjection had often precipitated a deplorable shrug in which victor radnor now perceived the skirts of his idea even to a fancy that something of the idea must have struck inchling when he shrugged the idea being he had lost it again definition seemed to be an extirpation enemy of this idea or she was by nature shy she was very feminine coming when she willed and flying when wanted not until nigh upon the close of his history did she return full statured and embraceable to victor radnor chapter ii through the vague to the infinitely little the fair dealing with readers demands of us that a narrative shall not proceed at slower pace than legs of a man in motion and we are still but little more than midway across london bridge but if a man's mind is to be taken as a part of him the likening of it at an introduction to an army on the opening march of a great campaign should plead excuses for tardy forward movements in consideration of the large amount of matter you have to review before you can at all imagine yourselves to have made his acquaintance this it is not necessary to do when you are set astride the enchanted horse of the tale which leaves the man's mind at home while he performs the deeds befitting him he can indeed be rapid whether more active is a question asking for your notions of the governing element in the composition of man and of hid present business here the tale inspirits one's earlier ardours when we sped without baggage when the impossible was wings to imagination and heroic sculpture the simplest act of the chisel it does not advance 'tis true it drives the whirligig circle round and round the single existing central point but it is enriched with applause of the boys and girls of both ages in this land and all the english critics heap their honours on its brave old simplicity our national literary flag which signalizes us while we float subsequently to flap above the shallows one may sigh for it an ill fortuned minstrel who has by fateful direction been brought to see with distinctness that man is not as much comprised in external features as the monkey will be devoted to the task of the fuller portraiture after his ineffectual catching at the volatile idea mr radnor found repose in thoughts of his daughter and her dear mother they had begged him to put on an overcoat this day of bitter wind or a silken kerchief for the throat faithful to the spring it had been his habit since boyhood to show upon his person something of the hue of the vernal month the white of the daisied meadow and although he owned a light overcoat to dangle from shoulders at the opera crush he declined to wear it for protection his gesture of shaking and expanding whenever the tender request was urged on him signified a physical opposition to the control of garments mechanically now while doating in fancy over the couple beseeching him he loosened the button across his defaced waistcoat exposed a large measure of chest to flaws of a wind barbed on norwegian peaks by the brewers of cough and catarrh horrid women of the whistling clouts in the pay of our doctors he braved them he starved the profession he was that man in fifty thousand who despises hostile elements and goes unpunished calmly erect among a sneezing and tumbled host as a lighthouse overhead of breezy fleets the coursing of his blood was by comparison electrical he had not the sensation of cold other than that of an effort of the elements to arouse him and so quick was he through this fine animation to feel think act that the three successive tributaries of conduct appeared as an irreflective flash and a gamester's daring in the vein to men who had no deep knowledge of him and his lightning arithmetic for measuring sounding and deciding naturally he was among the happiest of human creatures he willed it so with consent of circumstances a boisterous consent as when votes are reckoned for a favourite candidate excepting on the part of a small band of black dissentients in a corner a minute opaque body devilish in their irreconcilability who maintain their struggle to provoke discord with a cry disclosing the one error of his youth the sole bad step chargeable upon his antecedents but do we listen to them shall we not have them turned out he gives the sign for it and he leaves his buoying constituents to outroar them and he tells a friend that it was not as one may say an error although an erratic step but let us explain to our bosom friend it was a step quite unregretted gloried in a step deliberately marked to be done again were the time renewed it was a step necessitated emphatically by a false preceding step and having youth to plead for it in the first instance youth and ignorance and secondly and o how deeply truly love deep true love proved by years is the advocate he tells himself at the same time after lending ear to the advocate's exordium and a favourite sentence that judged by the powers to them only can he expose the whole skeleton cupboard of the case judged by those clear sighted powers he is exonerated to be exonerated by those awful powers is to be approved as to that there is no doubt whom they all seeing discerning as they do acquit they justify whom they justify they compliment they seeing all the facts are not unintelligent of distinctions as the world is what to them is the spot of the error admitting it as an error they know it for a thing of convention not of nature we stand forth to plead it in proof of an adherence to nature's laws we affirm that far from a defilement it is an illumination and stamp of nobility on the beloved who shares it with us it is a stamp of the highest nobility our world has many ways for signifying its displeasure but it cannot brand an angel this was another favourite sentence of love's grand oration for the defence so seductive was it to the powers who sat in judgement on the case that they all when the sentence came turned eyes upon the angel and they smiled they do not smile on the condemnable she then were he rebuked would have strength to uplift him and who calling her his own could be placed in second rank among the blissful mr radnor could rationally say that he was made for happiness he flew to it he breathed dispensed it how conceive the clear sighted celestial powers as opposing his claim to that estate not they he knew for he had them safe in the locked chamber of his breast to yield him subservient responses the world or puritanic members of it had pushed him to the trial once or twice or had put on an air of doing so creating a temporary disturbance ending in a merry duet with his daughter nesta victoria a glorious trio when her mother natalia sweet lily that she was shook the rainwater from her cup and followed the good example to shine in the sun he had a secret for them nesta's promising soprano and her mother's contralto and his baritone a true baritone not so well trained as their accurate notes should be rising in spirited union with the curtain of that secret there was matter for song and concert triumph and gratulation in it and during the whole passage of the bridge he had not once cast thought on a secret so palpitating the cause of the morning's expedition and a long year's prospect of the present day it seemed to have been knocked clean out of it punctilioed out fenellan might say nor had any combinations upon the theme of business displaced it just before the fall the whole drama of the unfolding of that secret was brilliant to his eyes as a scene on a stage he refused to feel any sensible bruise on his head with the admission that he perhaps might think he felt one which was virtually no more than the feeling of a thought what his friend dr peter yatt would define as feeling a rotifer astir in the curative compartment of a homoeopathic globule and a playful fancy may do that or anything only sanity does not allow the infinitely little to disturb us mr radnor had a quaint experience of the effects of the infinitely little while threading his way to a haberdasher's shop for new white waistcoats under the shadow of the representative statue of city corporations and london's majesty the figure of royalty worshipful in its marbled redundancy fronting the bridge on the slope where the seas of fish and fruit below throw up a thin line of their drift he stood contemplating the not unamiable reposefully jolly guelphic countenance from the loose jowl to the bent knee as if it were a novelty to him unwilling to trust himself to the roadway he had often traversed equally careful that his hesitation should not be seen a trifle more impressible he might have imagined the smoky figure and magnum of pursiness barring the city against him he could have laughed aloud at the hypocrisy behind his quiet look of provincial wonderment at london's sculptor's art and he was partly tickled as well by the singular fit of timidity enchaining him cart omnibus cab van barrow donkey tray went by in strings broken here and there and he could not induce his legs to take advantage of the gaps he listened to a warning that he would be down again if he tried it among those wheels and his nerves clutched him like a troop of household women to keep him from the hazard of an exposure to the horrid crunch pitiless as tiger's teeth and we may say truly that once down or once out of the rutted line you are food for lion and jackal the forces of the world will have you in their mandibles an idea was there too but it would not accept pursuit 'a pretty scud overheard' said a voice at his ear 'for fine to day at least' mr radnor affably replied to a stranger and gazing on the face of his friend fenellan knew the voice and laughed 'you' he straightened his back immediately to cross the road dismissing nervousness as a vapour asking between a cab and a van 'anything doing in the city' for mr fenellan's proper station faced westward the reply was deferred until they had reached the pavement when mr fenellan said 'i'll tell you' and looked a dubious preface to his friend's thinking but it was merely the mental inquiry following a glance at mud spots on the coat 'we'll lunch lunch with me i must eat tell me then' said mr radnor adding within himself 'emptiness want of food' to account for recent ejaculations and qualms he had not eaten for a good four hours fenellan's tone signified to his feverish sensibility of the moment that the matter was personal and the intimation of a touch on domestic affairs caused sinkings in his vacuity much as though his heart were having a fall he mentioned the slip on the bridge to explain his need to visit a haberdasher's shop and pointed at the waistcoat mr fenellan was compassionate over the 'poor virgin of the smoky city' 'they have their ready made at these shops last year's perhaps never mind do for the day' said mr radnor impatient for eating now that he had spoken of it 'a basin of turtle i can't wait a brush of the coat mud must be dry by this time clear turtle i think with a bottle of the old veuve not bad news to tell you like that old veuve' 'too well to tell bad news of her' said mr fenellan in a manner to reassure his friend as he intended 'you wouldn't credit it for the spring of the year without the spotless waistcoat' 'something of that i suppose' and so saying mr radnor entered the shop of his quest to be complimented by the shopkeeper while the attendants climbed the ladder to upper stages for white waistcoat boxes on his being the first bird of the season which it pleased him to hear for the smallest of our gratifications in life could give a happy tone to this brightly constituted gentleman chapter iii old veuve they were known at the house of the turtle and the attractive old veuve a champagne of a sobered sweetness of a great year a great age counting up to the extremer maturity attained by wines of stilly depths and their worthy comrade despite the wanton sparkles for the promoting of the state of reverential wonderment in rapture which an ancient wine will lead to well you wot the silly girly sugary crudity his given way to womanly suavity matronly composure with yet the sparkles they ascend but hue and flavour tell of a soul that has come to a lodgement there it conducts the youthful man to temples of dusky thought philosophers partaking of it are drawn by the arms of garlanded nymphs about their necks into the fathomless of inquiries it presents us with a sphere for the pursuit of the thing we covet most it bubbles over mellowness it has in the marriage with time extracted a spice of individuality from the saccharine by miracle one would say were it not for our knowledge of the right noble issue of time when he and good things unite there should be somewhere legends of him and the wine flask there must be meanings to that effect in the mythology awaiting unravelment for the subject opens to deeper than cellars and is a tree with vast ramifications of the roots and the spreading growth whereon half if not all the mythic gods inferior and superior infernal and celestial might be shown sitting in concord performing in concert harmoniously receiving sacrificial offerings of the black or the white and the black not extinguishing the fairer fellow tell us of a certainty that time has embraced the wine flask then may it be asserted assuming the great year for the wine ie combinations above that a speck of the white within us who drink will conquer to rise in main ascension over volumes of the black it may at a greater venture but confidently be said in plain speech that the bacchus of auspicious birth induces ever to the worship of the loftier deities think as you will forbear to come hauling up examples of malarious men in whom these pourings of the golden rays of life breed fogs and be moved since you are scarcely under an obligation to hunt the meaning in tolerance of some dithyrambic inebriety of narration quiverings of the reverent pen when we find ourselves entering the circle of a most magnetic polarity take it for not worse than accompanying choric flourishes in accord with mr victor radnor and mr simeon fenellan at their sipping of the venerable wine seated in a cosy corner near the grey city window edged with a sooty maze they praised the wine in the neuter and in the feminine that for the glass this for the widow branded bottle not as poets hymning it was done in the city manner briefly part pensively like men travelling to the utmost bourne of flying flavour a dell in infinite nether and still masters of themselves and at home such a wine in its capturing permeation of us insists on being for a time a theme 'i wonder' said mr radnor completely restored eyeing his half emptied second glass and his boon fellow 'low' mr fenellan shook his head 'half a dozen dozen left' 'nearer the half of that and who's the culprit' 'old days they won't let me have another dozen out of the house now' 'they'll never hit on such another discovery in their cellar unless they unearth a fifth corner' 'i don't blame them for making the price prohibitive and sound as ever' mr radnor watched the deliberate constant ascent of bubbles through their rose topaz transparency he drank that notion of the dish of turtle was an inspiration of the right he ought always to know it for the want of replenishment when such a man as he went quaking his latest experiences of himself were incredible but they passed as the dimples of the stream he finished his third glass the bottle like the cellar wine was at ebb unlike the cellar wine it could be set flowing again he prattled in the happy ignorance of compulsion 'fenellan remember i had a sort of right to the wine to the best i could get and this old veuve more than any other is a bridal wine we heard of giulia sanfredini's marriage to come off with the spanish duke and drank it to the toast of our little nesta's godmother i 've told you we took the girl to the opera when quite a little one that high and i declare to you it was marvellous next morning after breakfast she plants herself in the middle of the room and strikes her attitude for song and positively almost with the sanfredini's voice illusion of it you know trills us out more than i could have believed credible to be recollected by a child but i've told you the story we called her fredi from that day i sent the diva with excuses and compliments a nuptial present necklace roman goldwork locket pendant containing sunny curl and below a fine pearl really pretty telling her our grounds for the liberty she replied accepting the responsible office touching letter we found it so framed in fredi's room under her godmother's photograph fredi has another heroine now though she worships her old one still she never abandons her old ones you've heard the story over and over' mr fenellan nodded he had a tenderness for the garrulity of old veuve and for the damsel chatter on that subject ran pleasantly with their entertainment mr radnor meanwhile scribbled and despatched a strip of his note book bearing a scrawl of orders to his office he was now fully himself benevolent combative gay alert for amusement or the probeing of schemes to the quick weighing the good and the bad in them with his fine touch on proportion 'city dead flat a monotonous key but it's about the same as fetching a breath after a run only true it lasts too long not healthy skepsey will bring me my letters i was down in the country early this morning looking over the house with taplow my architect and he speaks fairly well of the contractors yes down at lakelands and saw my first lemon butterfly in a dell of sunshine out of the wind and had half a mind to catch it for fredi and should have caught it myself if i had the truth is we three are country born and bred we pine in london good for a season you know my old feeling they are to learn the secret of lakelands to morrow it 's great fun they think i don't see they've had their suspicion for some time you said somebody said the eye of a needle for what they let slip of their secrets and the point of it for penetrating yours women but no my dear souls didn't prick and bother and they dealt with a man in armour i carry them down to lakelands to morrow if the city's flat' 'keeping a secret's the lid on a boiling pot with you' mr fenellan said and he mused on the profoundness of the flavour at his lips 'i do it' 'you do up to bursting at the breast' 'i keep it from colney' 'as vesuvius keeps it from palmieri when shaking him' 'has old colney an idea of it' 'he has been foretelling an eruption of an edifice' the laugh between them subsided to pensiveness mr fenellan's delay in the delivery of his news was eloquent to reveal the one hateful topic and this being seen it waxed to such increase of size with the passing seconds that prudence called for it 'come' said mr radnor the appeal was understood 'nothing very particular i came into the city to look at a warehouse they want to mount double guard on your idea of the fireman's night patrol and wires has done wonders for the office' 'i guarantee the city if all my directions are followed' mr fenellan's remark that he had nothing very particular to tell reduced it to the mere touch upon a vexatious matter which one has to endure in the ears at times but it may be postponed so mr radnor encouraged him to talk of an insurance office investment where it is all bog and mist as in the city to day the maxim is not to take a step they agreed whether it was attributable to an unconsumed glut of the markets or apprehension of a panic had to be considered both gentlemen were angry with the birds on the flags of foreign nations which would not imitate a sawdust lion to couch reposefully incessantly they scream and sharpen talons 'they crack the city bubbles and bladders at all events' mr fenellan said 'but if we let our journals go on making use of them in the shape of sham hawks overhead we shall pay for their one good day of the game with our loss of the covey an unstable london's no world's market place' 'no no it's a niggardly national purse not the journals' mr radnor said 'the journals are trading engines panics are grist to them so are wars but they do their duty in warning the taxpayer and rousing parliament dr schlesien's right we go on believing that our god neptune will do everything for us and won't see that steam has paralyzed his trident good you and colney are hard on schlesien or at him i should say he's right if we won't learn that we have become continentals we shall be marched over laziness cowardice he says' 'oh be hanged' interrupted fenellan 'as much of the former as you like he 's right about our individualismus being another name for selfishness and showing the usual deficiency in external features it's an individualism of all of a pattern as when a mob cuts its lucky each fellow his own way well then conscript them and they'll be all of a better pattern the only thing to do and the cheapest by heaven it's the only honourable thing to do' mr radnor disapproved 'no conscription here' 'not till you've got the drop of poison in your blood in the form of an army landed that will teach you to catch at the drug' 'no fenellan besides they've got to land i guarantee a trusty army and navy under a contract at two thirds of the present cost we'll start a national defence insurance company after the next panic' 'during' said mr fenellan and there was a flutter of laughter at the unobtrusive hint for seizing dame england in the mood both dropped a sigh 'but you must try and run down with us to lakelands to morrow' mr radnor resumed on a cheerfuller theme 'you have not yet seen all i 've done there and it 's a castle with a drawbridge no exchangeing of visits as we did at craye farm and at creckholt we are there for country air we don't court neighbours at all perhaps the elect it will depend on nataly's wishes we can accommodate our concert set and about thirty or forty more for as long as they like you see that was my intention to be independent of neighbouring society madame callet guarantees dinners or hot suppers for eighty and armandine is the last person to be recklessly boasting when was it i was thinking last of armandine' he asked himself that as he rubbed at the back of his head mr fenellan was reading his friend's character by the light of his remarks and in opposition to them after the critical fashion of intimates who know as well as hear but it was amiably and trippingly on the dance of the wine in his veins his look however was one that reminded and mr radnor cried 'now whatever it is' 'i had an interview i assure you' mr fenellan interposed to pacify 'the smallest of trifles and to be expected i thought you ought to know it an interview with her lawyer office business increase of insurance on one of her city warehouses' 'speak her name speak the woman's name we're talking like a pair of conspirators' exclaimed mr radnor 'he informed me that mrs burman has heard of the new mansion' 'my place at lakelands' mr radnor's clear water eyes hardened to stony as their vision ran along the consequences of her having heard it 'earlier this time' he added thrummed on the table and thumped with knuckles 'i make my stand at lakelands for good nothing mortal moves me' 'that butler of hers ' 'jarniman you mean he's her butler yes the scoundrel h'm pah heaven forgive me she's an honest woman at least i wouldn't rob her of her little fifty nine or sixty next september fifteenth of the month with the constitution of a broken drug bottle poor soul she hears everything from jarniman he catches wind of everything all foreseen fenellan foreseen i have made my stand at lakelands and there's my flag till it's hauled down over victor radnor london kills nataly as well as fredi and me that is i can use the words to you i get back to primal innocence in the country we all three have the feeling you're a man to understand my beasts and the wild flowers hedge banks and stars fredi's poetess will tell you quiet waters reflecting i should feel it in paris as well though they have nightingales in their bois it's the rustic i want to bathe me and i had the feeling at school biting at horace well this is my sabine farm rather on a larger scale for the sake of friends come and pure air water from the springs walks and rides in lanes high sand lanes nataly loves them fredi worships the old roots of trees she calls them the faces of those weedy sandy lanes and the two dear souls on their own estate fenellan and their poultry cows cream and a certain influence one has in the country socially i make my stand on a home not empty punctilio' mr fenellan repeated in a pause 'punctilio' and not emphatically 'don't bawl the word' said mr radnor at the drum of whose ears it rang and sang 'here in the city the woman's harmless and here' he struck his breast 'but she can shoot and hit another through me ah the witch poor wretch poor soul only she's malignant i could swear but colney 's right for once in something he says about oaths dropping empty buckets or something' 'empty buckets to haul up impotent demons whom we have to pay as heavily as the ready devil himself' mr fenellan supplied the phrase 'only the moment old colney moralizes he's what the critics call sententious we've all a parlous lot too much pulpit in us' 'come fenellan i don't think' 'oh yes but it's true of me too' 'you reserve it for your enemies' 'i 'd like to distract it a bit from the biggest of 'em' he pointed finger at the region of the heart 'here we have skepsey' said mr radnor observing the rapid approach of a lean small figure that in about the time of a straight aimed javelin's cast shot from the doorway to the table chapter iv the second bottle this little dart of a man came to a stop at a respectful distance from his master having the look of an arrested needle in mechanism his lean slip of face was an illumination of vivacious grey from the quickest of prominent large eyes he placed his master's letters legibly on the table and fell to his posture of attention alert on stiff legs the hands like sucking cubs at play with one another skepsey waited for mr fenellan to notice him 'how about the schools for boxing' that gentleman said deploring in motion the announcement he had to make skepsey replied 'i have a difficulty in getting the plan treated seriously a person of no station it does not appear of national importance ladies are against they decline their signatures and ladies have great influence because of the blood which we know is very slight rather healthy than not and it could be proved for the advantage of the frailer sex they seem to be unaware of their own interests ladies the contention all around us is with ignorance my plan is written i have shown it and signatures of gentlemen to many of our city notables favourable in most cases gentlemen of the stock exchange highly the clergy and the medical profession are quite with me' 'the surgical perhaps you mean' 'also sir the clergy strongly' 'on the grounds of what skepsey' 'morality i have fully explained to them after his work at the desk all day the young city clerk wants refreshment he needs it must have it i propose to catch him on his way to his music halls and other places and take him to one of our establishments a short term of instruction and he would find a pleasure in the gloves it would delight him more than excesses beer and tobacco the female in her right place certainly' skepsey supplicated honest interpretation of his hearer and pursued 'it would improve his physical strength at the same time add to his sense of personal dignity' 'would you teach females as well to divert them from their frivolities' 'that would have to be thought over sir it would be better for them than using their nails' 'i don't know skepsey i'm rather a conservative there' 'yes with regard to the female sir i confess my scheme does not include them they dance that is a healthy exercise one has only to say that it does not add to the national force in case of emergency i look to that and i am particular in proposing an exercise independent of i have to say sex not that there is harm in sex but we are for training i hope my meaning is clear' 'quite you would have boxing with the gloves to be a kind of monastic recreation' 'recreation is the word sir i have often admired it' said skepsey blinking unsure of the signification of monastic 'i was a bit of a boxer once' mr fenellan said conscious of height and breadth in measuring the wisp of a figure before him 'something might be done with you still sir' skepsey paid him the encomium after a respectful summary of his gifts in a glimpse mr fenellan bowed to him mr radnor raised head from the notes he was pencilling upon letters perused 'skepsey's craze regeneration of the english race by boxing nucleus of a national army' 'to face an enemy at close quarters it teaches that sir i have always been of opinion that courage may be taught i do not say heroism and setting aside for a moment thoughts of an army we create more valuable citizens protection to the weak in streets and by places shocking examples of ruffians maltreating women in view of a crowd' 'one strong man is an overmatch for your mob' said mr fenellan skepsey toned his assent to the diminishing thinness where a suspicion of the negative begins to wind upon a distant horn 'knowing his own intentions and before an ignorant mob strong you say sir i venture my word that a decent lad with science would beat him it is a question of the study and practice of first principles' 'if you were to see a rascal giant mishandling a woman' skepsey conjured the scene by bending his head and peering abstractedly as if over spectacles 'i would beg him to abstain for his own sake' mr fenellan knew that the little fellow was not boasting 'my brother dartrey had a lesson or two from you in the first principles i think' 'captain dartrey is an athlete sir exceedingly quick and clever a hard boxer to beat' 'you will not call him captain when you see him he has dismissed the army' 'i much regret it sir much that we have lost him captain dartrey fenellan was a beautiful fencer he gave me some instruction unhappily i have to acknowledge too late it is a beautiful art captain dartrey says the french excel at it but it asks for a weapon which nature has not given whereas the fists' 'so' mr radnor handed notes and papers to skepsey 'no sign of life' 'it is not yet seen in the city sir' 'the first principles of commercial activity have retreated to earth's maziest penetralia where no tides are is it not so skepsey' said mr fenellan whose initiative and exuberance in loquency had been restrained by a slight oppression known to guests especially to the guest in the earlier process of his magnification and illumination by virtue of a grand old wine and also when the news he has to communicate may be a stir to unpleasant heaps the shining lips and eyes of his florid face now proclaimed speech with his puckish fancy jack o' lanterning over it 'business hangs to swing at every city door like a ragshop doll on the gallows of overproduction stocks and shares are hollow nuts not a squirrel of the lot would stop to crack for sight of the milky kernel mouldered to beard percentage like a cabman without a fare has gone to sleep inside his vehicle dividend may just be seen by tiptoe stockholders twinkling heels over the far horizon too true and our merchants brokers bankers projectors of companies parade our city to remind us of the poor steamed fellows trooping out of the burst boiler room of the big ship leviathan in old years a shade or two paler than the crowd o' the passengers apparently alive and conversible but corpses all of them to lie their length in fifteen minutes' 'and you fenellan' cried his host inspired for a second bottle by the lovely nonsense of a voluble friend wound up to the mark 'doctor of the ship with this prescription' mr fenellan held up his glass 'empty' mr fenellan made it completely so 'confident' he affirmed an order was tossed to the waiter and both gentlemen screwed their lips in relish of his heavy consent to score off another bottle from the narrow list 'at the office in forty minutes' skepsey's master nodded to him and shot him forth calling him back 'by the way in case a man named jarniman should ask to see me you turn him to the rightabout' skepsey repeated 'jarniman' and flew 'a good servant' mr radnor said 'few of us think of our country so much whatever may be said of the specific he offers colney has impressed him somehow immensely he studies to write too pushes to improve himself altogether a worthy creature' the second bottle appeared the waiter in sincerity a reluctant executioner heightened his part for the edification of the admiring couple 'take heart benjamin' said mr fenellan 'it's only the bottle dies and we are the angels above to receive the spirit' 'i'm thinking of the house' benjamin replied he told them that again 'it 's the loss of the fame of having the wine that he mourns but benjamin' said mr fenellan 'the fame enters into the partakers of it and we spread it and perpetuate it for you' 'that don't keep a house upright' returned benjamin mr fenellan murmured to himself 'true enough it 's elegy though we perform it through a trumpet and there's not a doubt of our being down or having knocked the world down if we're loudly praised' benjamin waited to hear approval sounded on the lips uncertain as a woman is a wine of ticklish age the gentlemen nodded and he retired a second bottle just as good as the first should one thoughtlessly supposes procure us a similar reposeful and excursive enjoyment as of men lying on their backs and flying imagination like a kite the effect was quite other mr radnor drank hastily and spoke with heat 'you told me all tell me that' mr fenellan gathered himself together he sipped and relaxed his bracing but there really was a bit more to tell not much was it not likely to puff a gale on the voluptuous indolence of a man drawn along by nereids over sunny sea waves to behold the birth of the foam goddess 'according to carling her lawyer that is he hints she meditates a blow' 'mrs burman means to strike a blow' 'the lady' 'does he think i fear any does he mean a blow with a weapon is it a legal at last fenellan' 'so i fancied i understood' 'but can the good woman dream of that as a blow to strike and hurt for a punishment that's her one aim' 'she may have her hallucinations' 'but a blow what a word for it but it's life to us life it's the blow we've prayed for why you know it let her strike we bless her we've never had an ill feeling to the woman utterly the contrary pity pity pity let her do that we're at her feet my nataly and i if you knew what my poor girl suffers she 's a saint at the stake chiefly on behalf of her family fenellan you may have a sort of guess at my fortune i'll own to luck i put in a claim to courage and calculation' 'you've been a bulwark to your friends' 'all fenellan all stocks shares mines companies industries at home and abroad all at a sweep to have the woman strike that blow cheerfully would i begin to build a fortune over again singing ha the woman has threatened it before it's probably feline play with us' his chin took support he frowned 'you may have touched her' 'she won't be touched and she won't be driven what 's the secret of her i can't guess i never could she's a riddle' 'riddles with wigs and false teeth have to be taken and shaken for the ardently sought secret to reveal itself' said mr fenellan his picture with the skeleton issue of any shaking smote mr radnor's eyes they turned over 'oh her charms she had a desperate belief in her beauty the woman 's undoubtedly charitable she's not without a mind sort of mind well it shows no crack till it's put to use heart yes against me she has plenty of it they say she used to be courted she talked of it my courtiers mr victor there heaven forgive me i wouldn't mock at her to another' 'it looks as if she were only inexorably human' said mr fenellan crushing a delicious gulp of the wine that foamed along the channel to flavour 'we read of the tester of a bandit bed and it flattened unwary recumbents to pancakes an escape from the like of that seems pleadable should be none but the drowsy would fail to jump out and run or the insane' mr radnor was taken with the illustration of his case 'for the sake of my sanity it was to preserve my but any word makes nonsense of it could i must ask you could any sane man you were abroad in those days horrible days and never met her i say could you consent to be tied i admit the vow ceremony so forth tied to i was barely twenty one i put it to you fenellan was it in reason an engagement which is i take it a mutual plight of faith in good faith that is with capacity on both sides to keep the engagement between the man you know i was in youth and a more than middle aged woman crazy up to the edge of the cliff as colney says half the world is and she positively is when her spite is roused no fenellan i have nothing on my conscience with regard to the woman she had wealth i left her not one penny the worse for but she was not one to reckon it i own she could be generous was with her money if she had struck this blow i know she thought of it or if she would strike it now i could not only forgive her i could beg forgiveness' a sight of that extremity fetched prickles to his forehead 'you've borne your part bravely my friend' 'i' mr radnor shrugged at mention of his personal burdens 'praise my nataly if you like made for one another if ever two in this world you know us both and do you doubt it the sin would have been for us two to meet and but enough when i say that i am she she me till death and beyond it that's my firm faith nataly teaches me the religion of life and you may learn what that is when you fall in love with a woman eighteen nineteen twenty years' tears fell from him two drops he blinked bugled in his throat eyed his watch and smiled 'the finishing glass we should have had to put colney to bed few men stand their wine you and i are not lamed by it we can drink and do business my first experience in the city was that the power to drink keeping a sound head conduces to the doing of business' 'it's a pleasant way of instructing men to submit to their conqueror' 'if it doubles the energies mind' 'not if it fiddles inside i confess to that effect upon me i've a waltz going on like the snake with the tail in his mouth eternal and it won't allow of a thought upon investments' 'consult me to morrow' said mr radnor somewhat pained for having inconsiderately misled the man he had hitherto helpfully guided 'you've looked at the warehouse' 'that's performed' 'make a practice of getting over as much of your business in the early morning as you well can' mr radnor added hints of advice to a frail humanity he was indulgent the giant spoke in good fellowship it would have been to have strained his meaning for purposes of sarcasm upon him if one had taken him to boast of a personal exemption from our common weakness he stopped and laughed 'now i 'm pumping my pulpit eh you come with us to lakelands i drive the ladies down to my office ten am if it's fine train half past we take a basket by the way i had no letter from dartrey last mail' 'he has buried his wife it happens to some men' mr radnor stood gazing he asked for the name of the place of the burial he heard without seizing it a simulacrum spectre spark of hopefulness shot up in his imagination glowed and quivered darkening at the utterance of the dutch syllables leaving a tinge of witless envy dartrey fenellan had buried the wife whose behaviour vexed and dishonoured him and it was in africa one would have to go to africa to be free of the galling but dartrey had gone and he was free the strange faint freaks of our sensations when struck to leap and throw off their load after a long affliction play these disorderly pranks on the brain and they are faint but they come in numbers they are recurring always in ambush we do not speak of them we have not words to stamp the indefinite things generally we should leave them unspoken if we had the words we know them as out of reason they haunt us pluck at us fret us nevertheless dartrey free he was relieved of the murderous drama incessantly in the mind of shackled men it seemed like one of the miracles of a divine intervention that dartrey should be free suddenly free and free while still a youngish man he was in himself a wonderful fellow the pick of his country for vigour gallantry trustiness high mindedness his heavenly good fortune decked him as a prodigy 'no harm to the head from that fall of yours' mr fenellan said 'none' mr radnor withdrew his hand from head to hat clapped it on and cried cheerily 'now to business' as men may who have confidence in their ability to concentrate an instant attention upon the substantial 'you dine with us the usual quartet peridon pempton colney yatt or catkin priscilla graves and nataly the rev septimus cormyn and his wife young dudley sowerby and i flutes he has precision as naughty fredi said when some one spoke of expression in the course of the evening lady grace perhaps you like her' 'human nature in the upper circle is particularly likeable' 'fenellan' said mr radnor emboldened to judge hopefully of his fortunes by mere pressure of the thought of dartrey's 'i put it to you would you say that there is anything this time behind your friend carling's report' although it had not been phrased as a report mr fenellan's answering look and gesture and a run of indiscriminate words enrolled it in that form greatly to the inspiriting of mr radnor old veuve in one to the soul of old veuve in the other they recalled a past day or two touched the skies and merriment or happiness in the times behind them held a mirror to the present or the hour of the reverse of happiness worked the same effect by contrast so that notions of the singular election of us by dame fortune sprang like vinous bubbles for it is written that however powerful you be you shall not take the winegod on board to entertain him as a simple passenger and you may captain your vessel you may pilot it and keep to your reckonings and steer for all the ports you have a mind to even to doing profitable exchange with armenian and jew and still you shall do the something more which proves that the winegod is on board he is the pilot of your blood if not the captain of your thoughts mr fenellan was unused to the copious outpouring of victor radnor's confidences upon his domestic affairs and the unwonted excitement of victor's manner of speech would have perplexed him had there not been such a fiddling of the waltz inside him payment for the turtle and the bottles of old veuve was performed apart with benjamin while simeon fenellan strolled out of the house questioning a tumbled mind as to what description of suitable entertainment which would be dancing and flirting and fal lallery in the season of youth london city could provide near meridian hours for a man of middle age carrying his bottle of champagne like a guest of an old fashioned wedding breakfast for although he could stand his wine as well as his friend his friend's potent capacity martially after the feast to buckle to business at a sign of the clock was beyond him it pointed to one of the embodied elements hot from nature's workshop it told of the endurance of powers that partly explained the successful astonishing career of his friend among a people making urgent if unequal demands perpetually upon stomach and head chapter v the london walk westward in that nationally interesting poem or dramatic satire once famous the rajah in london london limbo and sons now obliterated under the long wash of press matter the reflection not unknown to philosophical observers and natural perhaps in the mind of an oriental prince produced by his observation of the march of london citizens eastward at morn westward at eve attributes their practice to a survival of the zoroastrian form of worship his minister favourable to the people or for the sake of fostering an idea in his master's head remarks that they show more than the fidelity of the sunflower to her god the rajah it would appear frowns interrogatively in the princely fashion accusing him of obscureness of speech princes and the louder members of the grey public are fraternally instant to spurn at the whip of that which they do not immediately comprehend it is explained by the minister not even the flower he says would hold constant as they to the constantly unseen a trebly cataphractic invisible the rajah professes curiosity to know how it is that the singular people nourish their loyalty since they cannot attest to the continued being of the object in which they put their faith he is informed by his prostrate servant of a settled habit they have of diligently seeking their divinity hidden above below and of copiously taking inside them doses of what is denied to their external vision thus they fortify credence chemically on an abundance of meats and liquors fire they eat and they drink fire they become consequently instinct with fire necessarily therefore they believe in fire believing they worship worshipping they march eastward at morn westward at eve for that way lies the key this way the cupboard of the supplies their fuel according to stage directions the rajah and his minister enter a gin palace it is to witness a service that they have learnt to appreciate as anglicanly religious on the step of the return to their indian clime they speak of the hatted sect which is most or most commercially succoured and fattened by our rule there they wave adieu to the conquering islanders as to 'parsees beneath a cloud' the two are seen last on the deck of the vessel in perusal of a medical pamphlet composed of statistics and sketches traceries horrid blots diagrams with numbers referring to notes of the various maladies caused by the prolonged prosecution of that form of worship 'but can they suffer so and live' exclaims the rajah vexed by the physical sympathetic twinges which set him wincing 'science' his minister answers 'took them up where nature in pity of their martyrdom dropped them they do not live they are engines insensible things of repairs and patches insteamed to pursue their infuriate course to the one end of exhausting supplies for the renewing of them on peril of an instant suspension if they deviate a step or stop nor do they' the rajah is of opinion that he sails home with the key of the riddle of their power to vanquish in some apparent allusion to an indian story of a married couple who successfully made their way he accounts for their solid and resistless advance resembling that of the doubly wedded man and wife pledged to each other and against the world with mutual union one would like to think of the lengthened tide flux of pedestrian citizens facing south westward as being drawn by devout attraction to our nourishing luminary at the hour mark when the norland cloud king after a day of wild invasion sits him on his restful bank of bluefish smack o' cheek red above whitechapel to spy where his last puff of icy javelins pierces and dismembers the vapoury masses in cluster about the circle of flame descending upon the greatest and most elevated of admirals at the head of the strand with illumination of smoke plumed chimneys house roofs window panes weather vanes monument and pedimental monsters and omnibus umbrella one would fair believe that they advance admireing they are assuredly made handsome by the beams no longer mere concurrent atoms of the furnace of business from coal dust to sparks rushing as it were on respiratory blasts of an enormous engine's centripetal and centrifugal energy their step is leisurely to meet the rosy dinner which is ever a see saw with the god of light in his fall the mask of the noble human visage upon them is not roughened as at midday by those knotted hard ridges of the scrambler's hand seen from forehead down to jaw when indeed they have all the appearance of sour scientific productions and unhappily for the national portrait in the poem quoted the rajah's minister chose an hour between morning and meridian or at least before an astonished luncheon had come to composure inside their persons for drawing his master's attention to the quaint similarity of feature in the units of the busy antish congregates they had travelled so far to visit and to study these britons wear the driven and perplexed look of men begotten hastily 'twixt business hours it could not have been late afternoon these orientals should have seen them with victor radnor among them fronting the smoky splendours of the sunset in

song but first there must be the cleansing when night has fallen upon london the rajah remarks monogamic societies present a decent visage and a hideous rear his minister satirically or in sympathetic conservatism would have them not to move on that they may preserve among beholders the impression of their handsome frontage night however will come and they adoreing the decent face are moved on made to expose what the rajah sees behind his courteousness he is an antagonistic observer of his conquerors he pushes his questions farther than the need for them his minister the same apparently to retain the discountenanced people in their state of exposure up to the time of the explanation of the puzzle on board the departing vessel on the road to windsor at the premier's reception in the cell of the police in the presence of the magistrate whose crack of a totally inverse decision upon their case when he becomes acquainted with the titles and station of these imputedly peccant refreshes

an alley some olive mechanic of street organs has quickened little children's legs to rhythmic footing they strike on thoughts braver than pastoral victor radnor lover of the country though he was would have been the first to say it he would indeed have said it too emphatically open london as a theme to a citizen of london ardent for the clear air out of it you have roused an orator you have certainly fired a magazine and must listen to his reminiscences of one of its paragraphs or pages the figures of the hurtled fair ones in sky were wreathing nelson's cocked hat when victor distinguishably bright faced amid a crowd of the irradiated emerged from the tideway to cross the square having thoughts upon art which were due rather to the suggestive proximity of the national gallery than to the flemish mouldings of cloud forms under venetian brushes his purchases of pictures had been his unhappiest ventures he had relied and reposed on the dicta of newspaper critics who are sometimes unanimous and are then taken for guides and are fatal he was led to the conclusion that our modern lauded pictures do not ripen they have a chance of it if abused but who thinks of buying the abused exalted by the critics they have during the days of exhibition a glow a significance or a fun abandoning them where examination is close and constant and the critic's trumpet note dispersed to the thinness of the fee for his blowing as to foreign pictures classic pictures victor had known his purse to leap for a raphael with a history in stages of descent from the master and critics to swarm a raphael of the dealers exposed to be condemned by the critics universally derided a real raphael in your house is aristocracy to the roof tree but the wealthy trader will reach to title before he may hope to get the real raphael or a titian yet he is the one who would it may be after enjoyment of his prize bequeath it to the nation presented to the nation by victor montgomery radnor there stood the letters in gilt and he had a thrill of his generosity for few were the generous acts he could not perform and if an object haunted the deed it came of his trader's habit of mind he revelled in benevolent projects of gifts to the nation which would coat a sensitive name say an ornamental city square flowers fountains afternoon bands of music comfortable seats in it and a shelter and a ready supply of good cheap coffee or tea tobacco why not rolls of honest tobacco nothing so much soothes the labourer a volume of plans for the benefit of london smoked out of each ascending pile in his brain london is at night a moaning outcast round the policeman's' legs what of an all night long cosy brightly lighted odoriferous coffee saloon for rich or poor on the model of the hospitable paduan owner of a penny no soul among us shall be rightly an outcast dreams of this kind are taken at times by wealthy people as a cordial at the bar of benevolent intentions but victor was not the man to steal his refreshments in that known style he meant to make deeds of them as far as he could considering their immense extension and except for the sensitive social name he was of single minded purpose turning to the steps of a chemist's shop to get a prescription made up for his nataly's doctoring of her domestics he was arrested by a rap on his elbow and no one was near and there could not be a doubt of the blow a sharp hard stroke sparing the funny bone but ringing his head at the punctilio bump throbbed responsively owing to which or indifference to the prescription as of no instant requirement he pursued his course resembling mentally the wanderer along a misty beach who hears cannon across the waters he certainly had felt it he remembered the shock he could not remember much of pain how about intimations his asking caused a smile very soon the riddle answered itself he had come into view of the diminutive marble cavalier of the infantile cerebellum recollecting a couplet from the pen of the disrespectful satirist peter he thought of a fall his head and his elbow responded simultaneously to the thought all was explained save his consequent rightabout from the chemist's shop and that belongs to the minor involutions of circumstances and the will it passed like a giver's wrinkle he read the placards of the opera reminding himself of the day when it was the single opera house and now we have two or three we have also a distracting couple of clowns and pantaloons in our pantomimes though colney says that the multiplication of the pantaloon is a distinct advance to representative truth and bother colney two columbines also we forbear to speak of men but where is the boy who can set his young heart upon two columbines at once victor felt the boy within him cold to both and in his youth he had doated on the solitary twirling spangled lovely fairy the tale of a delicate lady dancer leaping as the kernel out of a nut from the arms of harlequin to the legalized embrace of a wealthy brewer and thenceforth living by repute with unagitated legs as holy a matron despite her starry past as any to be shown in a country breeding the like abundantly had always delighted him it seemed a reconcilement of opposing stations a defeat of puritanism ay and poor women women in the worser plight under the puritan's eye they may be erring and good yes finding the man to lift them the one step up read the history of the error but presently we shall teach the puritan to act by the standards of his religion all is coming right must come right colney shall be confounded hereupon victor hopped on to fenellan's hint regarding the designs of mrs burman his nataly might have to go through a short sharp term of scorching godiva to the gossips she would come out of it glorified she would be reconciled with her family with her story of her devotion to the man loving her the world would know her for the heroine she was a born lady in appearance and manner an empress among women it was a story to be pleaded in any court before the sternest public mrs burman had thrown her into temptation's way it was a story to touch the heart as none other ever written of over all the earth was there a woman equalling his nataly and their nesta would have a dowry to make princesses envious she would inherit he ran up an arithmetical column down to a line of figures in addition during three paces of his feet dartrey fenellan had said of little nesta once that she had a nature pure and sparkling as mid sea foam happy he who wins her but she was one of the young women who are easily pleased and hardly enthralled her father strained his mind for the shape of the man to accomplish the feat whether she had an ideal of a youth in her feminine head was beyond his guessing she was not the damsel to weave a fairy waistcoat for the identical prince and try it upon all comers to discover him as is done by some excuseably if we would be just nesta was of the elect for whom excuses have not to be made she would probably like a flute player best because her father played the flute and she loved him laughably a little maiden's reason her father laughed at her along the street of clubs where a bruised fancy may see black balls raining the narrow way between ducal mansions offers prospect of the sweep of greensward all but touching up to the sunset to draw it to the dance formerly in his very early youth he clasped a dream of gaining way to an alliance with one of these great surrounding houses and he had a passion for the acquisition of money as a means and it has to be confessed he had sacrificed in youth a slice of his youth to gain it without labour usually a costly purchase it had ended disastrously or say a running of the engine off the rails and a speedy re establishment of traffic could it be a loss that had led to the winning of his nataly can we really loathe the first of the steps when the one in due sequence cousin to it is a blessedness if we have been righted to health by a medical draught we are bound to be respectful to our drug and so we are in spite of nature's wry face and shiver at a mention of what we went through during those days those horrible days hide them the smothering of them from sight set them sounding he had to listen colney durance accused him of entering into bonds with somebody's grandmother for the simple sake of browsing on her thousands a picture of himself too abhorrent to victor to permit of any sort of acceptance consequently he struck away to the other extreme of those who have a choice in mixed motives he protested that compassion had been the cause of it looking at the circumstance now he could see allowing for human frailty perhaps a wish to join the ranks of the wealthy compassion for the woman as the principal motive how often had she not in those old days praised his generosity for allying his golden youth to her withered age mrs burman's very words and she was a generous woman or had been she was generous in saying that well and she was generous in having a well born well bred beautiful young creature like nataly for her companion when it was a case of need for the dear girl and compassionately insisting against remonstrances they were spoken by him though they were but partial how then had she become at least how was it that she could continue to behave as the vindictive fury who persecuted remorselessly would give no peace poisoned the wells round every place where he and his dear one pitched their tent but at last she had come to charity as he could well believe not too late victor's feeling of gratitude to mrs burman assured him it was genuine because of his genuine conviction that she had determined to end her incomprehensibly lengthened days in reconcilement with him and he had always been ready to 'forget and forgive' a truly beautiful old phrase it thrilled off the most susceptible of men his well kept secret of the spacious country house danced him behind a sober demeanour from one park to another and along beside the drive to view of his townhouse unbeloved of the inhabitants although by acknowledgement it had as fredi funnily drawled to express her sense of justice in depreciation 'good accommodation' nataly was at home he was sure time to be dressing sun sets at six forty he said and glanced at the stained west with an accompanying vision of outspread primroses flooding banks of shadowy fields near lakelands he crossed the road and rang upon the opening of the door there was a cascade of muslin downstairs his darling fredi stood out of it a dramatic undine chapter vi nataly 'il segreto' the girl cried commandingly with a forefinger at his breast he crossed arms toning in similar recitative with anguish 'dove volare' they joined in half a dozen bars of operatic duet she flew to him embraced and kissed 'i must have it my papa unlock i've been spying the bird on its hedgerow nest so long and this morning my own dear cunning papa weren't you as bare as winter twigs tomorrow perhaps we will have a day in the country to go and see the nest only please not a big one a real nest where mama and i can wear dairymaid's hat and apron all day the style you like and strike roots we've been torn away two or three times twice i know' 'fixed this time nothing shall tear us up' said her father moving on to the stairs with an arm about her 'so it is' 'she's amazed at her cleverness' 'a nest for three' 'we must have a friend or two' 'and pretty country' 'trust her papa for that' 'nice for walking and running over fields no rich people' 'how escape that rabble in england as colney says it's a place for being quite independent of neighbours free as air' 'oh bravo' 'and fredi will have her horse and mama her pony carriage and fredi can have a swim every summer morning' 'a swim' her note was dubious 'a river' 'a good long stretch fairish fairish bit of a lake bathing shed the naiad's bower pretty water to see' 'ah and has the house a name' 'lakelands i like the name' 'papa gave it the name' 'there's nothing he can conceal from his girl only now and then a little surprise' 'and his girl is off her head with astonishment but tell me who has been sharing the secret with you' 'fredi strikes home and it is true you dear i must have a confidant simeon fenellan' 'not mr durance' he shook out a positive negative 'i leave col to his guesses he'd have been prophesying fire the works before the completion' 'then it is not a dear old house like craye and creckholt' 'wait and see to morrow' he spoke of the customary guests for concert practice the music instrumental and vocal quartet duet solo and advising the girl to be quick as she had but twenty five minutes he went humming and trilling into his dressing room nesta signalled at her mother's door for permission to enter she slipped in saw that the maid was absent and said 'yes mama and prepare i feared it i was sure' her mother breathed a little moan 'not a cottage' 'he has not mentioned it to mr durance' 'why not' 'mr fenellan has been his confidant' 'my darling we did wrong to let it go on without speaking you don't know for certain yet' 'it's a large estate mama and a big new house' nataly's bosom sank 'ah me here's misery i ought to have known and too late now it has gone so far but i never imagined he would be building' she caught herself languishing at her toilette glass as if her beauty were at stake and shut her eyelids angrily to be looking in that manner for a mere suspicion was too foolish but nesta's divinations were target arrows they flew to the mark could it have been expected that victor would ever do anything on a small scale o the dear little lost lost cottage she thought of it with a strain of the arms of womanhood's longing in the unblessed wife for a babe for the secluded modest cottage would not rack her with the old anxieties beset her with suspicions 'my child you won't possibly have time before the dinner hour' she said to nesta dismissing her and taking her kiss of comfort with a short and straining look out of the depths those bitter doubts of the sentiments of neighbours are an incipient dislike when one's own feelings to the neighbours are kind could be affectionate we are distracted perverted made strangers to ourselves by a false position she heard his voice on a carol men do not feel this doubtful position as women must they have not the same to endure the world gives them land to tread where women are on breaking seas her nesta knew no more than the pain of being torn from a home she loved but now the girl was older and if once she had her imagination awakened her fearful directness would touch the spot question bring on the scene to come necessarily to come dreaded much more than death by her mother but if it might be postponed till the girl was nearer to an age of grave understanding with some knowledge of our world some comprehension of a case that could be pleaded he sang he never acknowledged a trouble he dispersed it and in her present wrestle with the scheme of a large country estate involving new intimacies anxieties the courtship of rival magnates followed by the wretched old cloud and the imposition upon them to bear it in silence though they knew they could plead a case at least before charitable and discerning creatures or before heaven the despondent lady could have asked whether he was perfectly sane who half so brilliantly depreciation of him fetched up at a stroke the glittering armies of her enthusiasm he had proved it he proved it daily in conflicts and in victories that dwarfed emotional troubles like hers yet they were something to bear hard to bear at times unbearable but those were times of weakness let anything be doubted rather than the good guidance of the man who was her breath of life whither he led let her go not only submissively exultingly thus she thought under pressure of the knowledge that unless rushing into conflicts bigger than conceivable she had to do it and should therefore think it this was the prudent woman's clear deduction from the state wherein she found herself created by the one first great step of the mad woman her surrender then might be likened to the detachment of a flower on the river's bank by swell of flood she had no longer root of her own away she sailed through beautiful scenery with occasionally a crashing fall a turmoil emergence from a vortex and once more the sunny whirling surface strange to think she had not since then power to grasp in her abstract mind a notion of stedfastness without or within but say not the mad say the enamoured woman love is a madness having heaven's wisdom in it a spark but even when it is driving us on the breakers call it love and be not unworthy of it hold to it she and victor had drunk of a cup the philtre was in her veins whatever the directions of the rational mind exulting or regretting she had to do it as one in the car with a racing charioteer or up beside a more than titanically audacious balloonist for the charioteer is bent on a goal and victor's course was an ascension from heights to heights he had ideas he mastered fortune he conquered nataly and held her subject in being above his ambition which was now but an occupation for his powers while the aim of his life was at the giving and taking of simple enjoyment in spite of his fits of unreasonableness in the means and the woman loving him could trace them to a breath of nature his gentle good friendly innocent aim in life was of this very simplest so wonderful by contrast with his powers that she assured of it as she was by experience of him was touched in a transfusion of her feelings through lucent globes of admiration and of tenderness to reverence there had been occasions when her wish for the whole world to have proof and exhibition of his greatness goodness and simplicity amid his gifts prompted her incitement of him to stand forth eminently 'lead a kingdom' was the phrase behind the curtain within her shy bosom and it revealed her to herself upon reflection as being still the nataly who drank the cup with him to join her fate with his and why not was that regretted far from it in her maturity the woman was unable to send forth any dwelling thought or more than a flight of twilight fancy that cancelled the deed of her youth and therewith seemed to expunge near upon the half of her term of years if it came to consideration of her family and the family's opinion of her conduct her judgement did not side with them or with herself it whirled swam to a giddiness and subsided of course if she and victor were to inhabit a large country house they might as well have remained at craye farm or at creckholt both places dear to them in turn such was the plain sense of the surface question and how strange it was to her that he of the most quivering sensitiveness on her behalf could not see that he threw her into situations where hard words of men and women threatened about her head where one or two might on a day some day be heard and where in the recollection of two years back the word 'impostor' had smacked her on both cheeks from her own mouth now once more they were to run the same round of alarms undergo the love of the place with perpetual apprehensions of having to leave it alarms throbbing suspicions like those of old travellers through the haunted forest where whispers have intensity of meaning and unseeing we are seen and unaware awaited nataly shook the rolls of her thick brown hair from her forehead she took strength from a handsome look of resolution in the glass she could always honestly say that her courage would not fail him victor tapped at the door he stepped into the room wearing his evening white flower over a more open white waistcoat and she was composed and uninquiring their nesta was heard on the descent of the stairs with a rattle of donizetti's il segreto to the skylights he performed his never omitted lover's homage nataly enfolded him in a homely smile 'a country house we go and see it to morrow' 'and you've been pining for a country home my dear soul' 'after the summer six weeks the house in london does not seem a home to return to' 'and next day nataly draws five thousand pounds for the first sketch of the furniture' 'there is the creckholt' she had a difficulty in saying 'part of it may do lakelands requires but you will see to morrow' after a close shutting of her eyes she rejoined 'it is not a cottage' 'well dear no when the slave of the lamp takes to building he does not run up cottages and we did it without magic all in a year which is quite as good as a magical trick in a night' he drew her close to him 'when was it my dear girl guessed me at work' 'it was the other dear girl nesta is the guesser' 'you were two best of souls to keep from bothering me and i might have had to fib and we neither of us like that' he noticed a sidling of her look 'more than the circumstances oblige to be frank but now we can speak of them wait and the change comes and opportunely i have found it's true we have waited long my darling has had her worries however it 's here at last prepare yourself i speak positively you have to brace up for one sharp twitch the woman's portion as natata says and it's over' he looked into her eyes for comprehension and not finding inquiry resumed 'just in time for the entry into lakelands with the pronouncement of the decree we present the licence at an altar we've stood before in spirit one of the ladies of your family to support you why not not even then' 'no victor they have cast me off' 'count on my cousins the duvidney ladies then we can say that those two good old spinsters are less narrow than the dreightons i have to confess i rather think i was to blame for leaving creckholt only if i see my girl wounded i hate the place that did the mischief you and fredi will clap hands for the country about lakelands' 'have you heard from her of her is it anything victor' nataly asked him shyly with not much of hope but some readiness to be inflated the prospect of an entry into the big new house among a new society begirt by the old nightmares and fretting devils drew her into staring daylight or furnace light he answered 'mrs burman has definitely decided in pity of us to be free herself who can say she 's a woman with a conscience of a kind slow but it brings her to the point at last you know her know her well fenellan has it from her lawyer her lawyer a mr carting a thoroughly trustworthy man ' 'fenellan as a reporter' 'thoroughly to be trusted on serious matters i understand that mrs burman her health is awful yes yes poor woman poor woman we feel for her she has come to perceive her duty to those she leaves behind consider she has used the rod she must be tired out if human and she is one remembers traits' victor sketched one or two of the traits allusively to the hearer acquainted with them they received strong colouring from midday's old veuve in his blood his voice and words had a swing of conviction they imparted vinousness to a heart athirst the histrionic self deceiver may be a persuasive deceiver of another who is again though not ignorant of his character tempted to swallow the nostrums which have made so gallant a man of him his imperceptible sensible playing of the part on a substratum of sincereness induces fascinatingly to the like performance on our side that we may be armed as he is for enjoying the coveted reality through the partial simulation of possessing it and this is not a task to us when we have looked our actor in the face and seen him bear the look knowing that he is not intentionally untruthful and when we incline to be captivated by his rare theatrical air of confidence when it seems as an outside thought striking us that he may not be altogether deceived in the present instance when suddenly an expectation of the thing desired is born and swims in a credible featureless vagueness on a misty scene and when we are being kissed and the blood is warmed in fine here as everywhere along our history when the sensations are spirited up to drown the mind we become drift matter of tides metal to magnets and if we are women who commonly allow the lead to men getting it for themselves only by snaky cunning or desperate adventure credulity the continued trust in the man is the alternative of despair 'but victor i must ask' nataly said 'you have it through simeon fenellan you have not yourself received the letter from her lawyer' 'my knowledge of what she would do near the grave poor soul yes i shall soon be hearing' 'you do not propose to enter this place until until it is over' 'we enter this place my love without any sort of ceremony we live there independently and we can we have quarters there for our friends our one neighbour is london there and at lakelands we are able to entertain london and wife our friends in short with some what we have to call satellites you inspect the house and grounds to morrow sure to be fair put aside all but the pleasant recollections of craye and creckholt we start on a different footing really nothing can be simpler keeping your town house you are now and then in residence at lakelands where you entertain your set teach them to feel the charm of country life we have everything about us could have had our own milk and cream up to london the last two months was it very naughty i should have exploded my surprise you will see you will see to morrow' nataly nodded as required 'good news from the mines' she said he answered 'dartrey is yes poor fellow dartrey is confident from the yield of stones that the value of our claim counts in a number of millions the same with the gold but gold mines are lodgeings not homes' 'oh victor if money but why did you say poor fellow of dartrey fenellan' 'you know how he's' 'yes yes' she said hastily 'but has that woman been causing fresh anxiety' 'and natata's chief hero on earth is not to be named a poor fellow' said he after a negative of the head on a subject they neither of them liked to touch then he remembered that dartrey fenellan was actually a lucky fellow and he would have mentioned the circumstance confided to him by simeon but for a downright dread of renewing his painful fit of envy he had also another more distant very faint idea that it had better not be mentioned just yet for a reason entirely undefined he consulted his watch the maid had come in for the robeing of her mistress nataly's mind had turned to the little country cottage which would have given her such great happiness she raised her eyes to him she could not check their filling they were like a river carrying moonlight on the smooth roll of a fall he loved the eyes disliked the water in them with an impatient 'there there' and a smart affectionate look he retired thinking in our old satirical vein of the hopeless endeavour to satisfy a woman's mind without the intrusion of hard material statements facts even the best of women even the most beautiful and in their moments of supremest beauty have this gross ravenousness for facts you must not expect to appease them unless you administer solids it would almost appear that man is exclusively imaginative and poetical and that his mate the fair the graceful the bewitching with the sweetest and purest of natures cannot help being something of a groveller nataly had likewise her thoughts chapter vii between a general man of thin world and a professional rather earlier in the afternoon of that day simeon fenellan thinking of the many things which are nothing and so melancholy for lack of amusements properly to follow old veuve that he could ask himself whether he had not done a deed of night to be blinking at his fellow men like an owl all mad for the reveller's hoots and flights and mice and moony roundels behind his hypocritical judex air of moping composure chanced on mr carling the solicitor where lincoln's inn pumps lawyers into fleet street through the drain pipe of chancery lane he was in the state of the wine when a shake will rouse the sluggish sparkles to foam sight of mrs burman's legal adviser had instantly this effect upon him his bubbling friendliness for victor radnor and the desire of the voice in his bosom for ears to hear combined like the rush of two waves together upon which he may be figured as the boat he caught at mr carling's hand more heartily than their acquaintanceship quite sanctioned but his grasp and his look of overflowing were immediately privileged mr carling enjoying this anecdotal gentleman's conversation as he did liked the warmth and was flattered during the squeeze with a prospect of his wife and friends partaking of the fun from time to time 'i was telling my wife yesterday your story of the lady contrabandist i don't think she has done laughing since' mr calling said fenellan fluted 'ah' he had scent in the eulogy of a story grown flat as election hats of a good sort of man in the way of men a step or two behind the man of the world he expressed profound regret at not having heard the silvery ring of the lady's laughter carling genially conceived a real gratification to be conferred on his wife 'perhaps you will some day honour us' 'you spread gold leaf over the days to come sir' 'now if i might name the day' 'you lump the gold and make it current coin says the blushing bride who ought not to have delivered herself so boldly but she had forgotten her bashful part and spoilt the scene though luckily for the damsel her swain was a lover of nature and finding her at full charge named the very next day of the year and held her to it like the complimentary tyrant he was' 'to morrow then' said carling intrepidly on a dash of enthusiasm through a haggard thought of his wife and the cook and the netting of friends at short notice he urged his eagerness to ask whether he might indeed have the satisfaction of naming to morrow 'with happiness' fenellan responded mrs carling was therefore in for it 'to morrow half past seven as for company to meet you we will do what we can you go westward' 'to bed with the sun' said the reveller 'perhaps by covent garden i must give orders there' 'orders given in covent garden paint a picture for bachelors of the domestic paradise an angel must help them to enter ah dear me is there anything on earth to compare with the pride of a virtuous life' 'i was married at four and twenty' said carling as one taking up the expository second verse of a poem plain facts but weighty and necessary 'my wife was in her twentieth year we have five children two sons three daughters one married with a baby so we are grandfather and mother and have never regretted the first step i may say for both of us' 'think of it good luck and sagacity joined hands overhead on the day you proposed to the lady and i'd say that all the credit is with her but that it would seem to be at the expense of her sex' 'she would be the last to wish it i assure you' 'true of all good women you encourage me touching a matter of deep interest not unknown to you the lady's warm heart will be with us probably she sees mrs burman' 'mrs burman radnor receives no one' a comic severity in the tone of the correction was deferentially accepted by fenellan 'pardon she flies her flag with her captain wanting and she has queerly the right so then the worthy dame who receives no one might be treated it struck us conversationally as a respectable harbour hulk with more history than top honours but she has the indubitable legal right to fly them to proclaim it for it means little else' 'you would have her if i follow you divest herself of the name' 'pin me to no significations if you please o shrewdest of the legal sort i have wit enough to escape you there she is no doubt an estimable person' 'well she is she is in her way a very good woman' 'ah you see mr carling i cannot bring myself to rank her beside another lady who has already claimed the title of me and you will forgive me if i say that your word good has a look of being stuck upon the features we know of her like a coquette's naughty patch or it's a jewel of an eye in an ebony idol though i've heard tell she performs her charities' 'i believe she gives away three parts of her income and that is large' 'leaving the good lady a fine fat fourth' 'compare her with other wealthy people' 'and does she outshine the majority still with her personal attractions carling was instigated by the praise he had bestowed on his wife to separate himself from a female pretender so ludicrous he sought fenellan's nearest ear emitting the sound of 'hum' 'in other respects unimpeachable' 'oh quite' 'there was a fishfag of classic billingsgate who had broken her husband's nose with a sledgehammer fist and swore before the magistrate that the man hadn't a crease to complain of in her character we are condemned mr carling sometimes to suffer in the flesh for the assurance we receive of the inviolability of those moral fortifications' 'character yes valuable i do wish you had named to night for doing me the honour of dining with me' said the lawyer impulsively in a rapture of the appetite for anecdotes 'i have a ripe pichon longueville '' 'a fine wine seductive to hear of i dine with my friend victor radnor and he knows wine there are good women in the world mr carling whose characters' 'of course of course there are and i could name you some we lawyers' 'you encounter all sorts' 'between ourselves' carling sank his tones to the indiscriminate where it mingled with the roar of london 'you do' fenellan hazarded a guess at having heard enlightened liberal opinions regarding the sex 'right' 'many' 'i back you mr carling' the lawyer pushed to yet more confidential communication up to the verge of the clearly audible he spoke of examples experiences fenellan backed him further 'acting on behalf of clients you understand mr fenellan' 'professional but charitable i am with you' 'poor things we if we have to condemn we owe them something' 'a kind word for poor polly venus with all the world against her she doesn't hear it often' 'a real service' carling's voice deepened to the legal 'without prejudice' 'i am bound to say it a service to society' 'ah poor wench and the kind of reward she gets' 'we can hardly examine mysterious dispensations here we are to make the best we can of it' 'for the creature society's indebted to true and am i to think there's a body of legal gentlemen to join with you my friend in founding an institution to distribute funds to preach charity over the country and win compassion for her as one of the principal persons of her time that society's indebted to for whatever it's indebted for' 'scarcely that' said carling contracting 'but you 're for great reforms' 'gradual' 'then it's for reformatories mayhap' 'they would hardly be a cure' 'you 're in search of a cure' 'it would be a blessed discovery' 'but what's to become of society' 'it's a puzzle to the cleverest' 'all through history my dear mr carling we see that 'establishments must have their sacrifices beware of interfering eh' 'by degrees we may hope' 'society prudently shuns the topic and so 'll we for we might tell of one another in a fit of distraction that t' other one talked of it and we should be banished for an offence against propriety you should read my friend durance's essay on society lawyers are a buttress of society but come i wager they don't know what they support until they read that essay' carling had a pleasant sense of escape in not being personally asked to read the essay and not hearing that a copy of it should be forwarded to him he said 'mr radnor is a very old friend' 'our fathers were friends they served in the same regiment for years i was in india when victor radnor took the fatal' 'followed by a second not less' 'in the interpretation of a rigid morality arming you legal gentlemen to make it so' 'the law must be vindicated' 'the law is a clumsy bludgeon' 'we think it the highest effort of human reason the practical instrument' 'you may compare it to a rustic's finger on a fiddlestring for the murdered notes you get out of the practical instrument 'i am bound to defend it clumsy bludgeon or not' 'you are one of the giants to wield it and feel humanly when by chance down it comes on the foot an inch off the line here's a peep of old london if the habit of old was not to wash windows i like these old streets' 'hum' carling hesitated 'i can remember when the dirt at the windows was appalling' 'appealing to the same kind of stuff in the passing youngster's green scum eye it was and there your law did good work you're for bordeaux what is your word on burgundy' 'our falernian' 'victor radnor has the oldest in the kingdom but he will have the best of everything a romanee a musigny sip my friend you embrace the goddess of your choice above you are up beside her at a sniff of that wine and lo venerable drury we duck through the court reminded a bit by our feelings of our first love who hadn't the cleanest of faces or nicest of manners but she takes her station in memory because we were boys then and the golden halo of youth is upon her' carling as a man of the world acquiesced in souvenirs he did not share he said urgently 'understand me you speak of mr radnor pray believe i have the greatest respect for mr radnor's abilities he is one of our foremost men proud of him mr radnor has genius i have watched him it is genius he shows it in all he does one of the memorable men of our times i can admire him independent of well misfortune of that kind a mistaken early step misfortune it is to be named between ourselves we are men of the world if one could see the way she occasionally as i have told you i have ventured suggestions as i have mentioned i have received an impression' 'but still mr carling if the lady doesn't release him and will keep his name she might stop her cowardly persecutions' 'can you trace them' 'undisguised' 'mrs burman radnor is devout i should not exactly say revengeful we have to discriminate i gather that her animus is in all honesty directed at the i quote state of sin we are mixed you know' the winegod in the blood of fenellan gave a leap 'but fifty thousand times more mixed she might any moment stop the state of sin as she calls it if it pleased her' 'she might try our judges look suspiciously on long delayed actions and there are too women who regard the marriage tie as indissoluble she has had to combat that scruple' 'believer in the renewing of the engagement overhead well but put a by word to mother nature about the state of sin where do you imagine she would lay it you'll say that nature and law never agreed they ought' 'the latter deferring to the former' 'moulding itself on her swelling proportions my dear dear sir the state of sin was the continuing to live in defiance of in contempt of in violation of in the total degradation of nature' 'he was under no enforcement to take the oath at the altar' 'he was a small boy tempted by a varnished widow with pounds of barley sugar in her pockets and she already serving as a test vessel or mortar for awful combinations in druggery gilt widows are equal to decrees of fate to us young ones upon my word the cleric who unites and the law that sanctions they're the criminals victor radnor is the noblest of fellows the very best friend a man can have i will tell you he saved me after i left the army from living on the produce of my pen which means if there is to be any produce the prostrating of yourself to the level of the round middle of the public saved me from that yes mr carling i have trotted our thoroughfares a poor polly of the pen and it is owing to victor radnor that i can order my thoughts as an individual man again before i blacken paper owing to him i have a tenderness for mercenaries having been one of them and knowing how little we can help it he is an olympian who thinks of them below the lady also is an admirable woman at all points the pair are a mated couple such as you won't find in ten households over christendom are you aware of the story' carling replied 'a story under shadow of the law has generally two very distinct versions' 'hear mine and by jove a runaway cab no all right but a crazy cab it is and fit to do mischief in narrow drury except that it's sheer riff raff here to knock over' 'hulloa come' quoth the wary lawyer 'there's the heart i wanted to rouse to hear me one may be sure that the man for old burgundy has it big and sound in spite of his legal practices a dear good spherical fellow some day we'll hope you will be sitting with us over a magnum of victor radnor's romance conti aged thirty one a wine you'll say at the second glass high priest for the celebration of the uncommon nuptials between the body and the soul of man' 'you hit me rightly'said carting tickled and touched sensually excited by the bouquet of victor radnor's hospitality and companionship which added flavour to fenellan's compliments these came home to him through his desire to be the 'good spherical fellow' for he like modern diplomatists in the track of their eminent berlinese new type of the time put on frankness as an armour over wariness holding craft in reserve his aim was at the refreshment of honest fellowship by no means to discover that the coupling of his native bias with his professional duty was unprofitable nowadays wariness however was not somnolent even when he said 'you know i am never the lawyer out of my office man of the world to men of the world and i have not lost by it i am mrs barman radnor's legal adviser you are mr victor radnor's friend they are as we see them not on the best of terms i would rather at its lowest as a matter of business be known for having helped them to some kind of footing than send in a round bill to my client or another i gain more in the end frankly i mean to prove that it's a lawyer's interest to be human' 'because now see' said fenellan 'here's the case miss natalia dreighton of a good yorkshire family a large one reads an advertisement for the post of companion to a lady and answers it and engages herself previous to the appearance of the young husband miss dreighton is one of the finest young women alive she has a glorious contralto voice victor and she are encouraged by mrs barman to sing duets together well why euclid would have theorem'd it out for you at a glance at the trio you have only to look on them you chatter out your three acts of a drama without a stop if mrs barman cares to practise charity she has only to hold in her fury forked tongue or her jarniman i think 's the name' carting shrugged 'let her keep from striking if she's christian' pursued fenetlan 'and if kind let her resume the name of her first lord who did a better thing for himself than for her when he shook off his bars of bullion to rise the lighter and left a wretched female soul below with the devil's own testimony to her attractions thousands in the funds houses in the city she threw the young couple together and my friend victor radnor is of a particularly inflammable nature imagine one of us in such a situation mr carting' 'trying' said the lawyer 'the dear fellow was as nigh death as a man can be and know the sweetness of a woman's call to him to live and here's london's garden of pines bananas oranges all the droppings of the hesperides here we don't reflect on it mr carling' 'not enough not enough' 'i feel such a spout of platitudes that i could out with a leading article on a sheet of paper on your back while you're bending over the baskets i seem to have got circularly round again to eden when i enter a garden only here we have to pay for the fruits we pluck well and just the same there and no end to the payment either we're always paying by the way mrs victor radnor's dinner table's a spectacle her taste in flowers equals her lord's in wine but age improves the wine and spoils the flowers you'll say maybe you're for arguing that lovely women show us more of the flower than the grape in relation to the course of time i pray you not to forget the terrible intoxicant she is we reconcile it mr carling with the notion that the grape's her spirit the flower her body or is it the reverse perhaps an intertwining but look upon bouquets and clusters and the idea of woman springs up at once proving she's composed of them i was about to remark that with deference to the influence of mrs burman's legal adviser an impenitent or penitent sinner's pastor the reverend gentleman ministering to her spiritual needs would presumptively exercise it in this instance in a superior degree' carling murmured 'the rev groseman buttermore' and did so for something of a cover to continue a run of internal reflections as that he was assuredly listening to vinous talk in the streets by day which impression placed him on a decorous platform above the amusing gentleman to whom however he grew cordial in recognizing consequently that his exuberant flow could hardly be a mask and that an indication here and there of a trap in his talk must have been due rather to excess of wariness habitual in the mind of a long headed man whose incorrigibly impulsive fits had necessarily to be rectified by a vigilant dexterity 'buttermore' ejaculated fenellan 'groseman buttermore mrs victor's father confessor is the rev septimus barmby groseman buttermore septimus barmby is there anything in names truly unless these clerical gentlemen take them up at the crossing of the roads long after birth the names would appear the active parts of them and themselves mere marching supports like the bearers of street placard advertisements now i know a septimus barmby and you a groseman buttermore and beyond the fact that reverend starts up before their names without mention i wager it's about all we do know of them they're society's trusty rock limpets no doubt' 'my respect for the cloth is extreme' carling's short cough prepared the way for deductions 'between ourselves they are men of the world' fenellan eyed benevolently the worthy attorney whose innermost imp burst out periodically like a dutch clocksentry to trot on his own small grounds for thinking himself of the community of the man of the world 'you lawyers dress in another closet' he said 'the rev groseman has the ear of the lady' 'he has one ear' 'ah she has the other open for a man of the world perhaps' 'listens to him listens to me listens to jarniman and we neither of us guide her she's very curious a study you think you know her next day she has eluded you she's emotional she's hard she's a woman she's a stone anything you like but don't count on her and another thing i'm bound to say it of myself' carling claimed close hearing of fenellan over a shelf of saladstuff 'no one who comes near her has any real weight with her in this matter' 'probably you mix cream in your salad of the vinegar and oil' said fenellan 'try jelly of mutton' 'you give me a new idea latterly fond as i am of salads i've had rueful qualms we'll try it' 'you should dine with victor radnor' 'french cook of course' 'cordon bleu' 'i like to be sure of my cutlet' 'i like to be sure of a tastiness in my vegetables' 'and good sauces' 'and pretty pastry i said cordon bleu the miracle is it 's a woman that victor radnor has trained french but a woman devoted to him as all who serve him are do i say but a woman there's not a frenchman alive to match her vatel awaits her in paradise with his arms extended and may he wait long' carling indulged his passion for the genuine by letting a flutter of real envy be seen 'my wife would like to meet such a frenchwoman it must be a privilege to dine with him to know him i know what he has done for english commerce and to build a colossal fortune genius as i said and his donations to institutions odd to read his name and mrs burman radnor's at separate places in the lists well we'll hope it's a case for a compromise of sentiments and claims' 'a friend of mine spiced with cynic declares that there's always an amicable way out of a dissension if we get rid of lupus and vulpus' carling spied for a trap in the citation of lupus and vulpus he saw none and named the square of his residence on the great russell property and the number of the house the hour of dinner next day he then hung silent breaking the pause with his hand out and a sharp 'well' that rattled a whirligig sound in his head upward his leave of people was taken in this laughing falsetto as of one affected by the curious end things come to fenellan thought of him for a moment or two that he was a better than the common kind of lawyer who doubtless knew as much of the wrong side of the world as lawyers do and held his knowledge for the being a man of the world as all do that have not alpine heights in the mind to mount for a look out over their own and the world's pedestrian tracks i could spot the lawyer in your composition my friend to the exclusion of the man he mused but you're right in what you mean to say of yourself you're a good fellow for a lawyer and together we may manage somehow to score a point of service to victor radnor chapter viii some familiar guests nesta read her mother's face when mrs victor entered the drawing room to receive the guests she saw a smooth fair surface of the kind as much required by her father's eyes as innocuous air by his nostrils and it was honest skin not the deceptive feminine veiling to make a dear man happy over his volcano mrs victor was to meet the friends with whom her feelings were at home among whom her musical gifts gave her station they liked her for herself they helped her to feel at home with herself and be herself a rarer condition with us all than is generally supposed so she could determine to be cheerful in the anticipation of an evening that would at least be restful to the outworn sentinel nerve of her heart which was perpetually alert and signalling to the great organ often colouring the shows and seems of adverse things for an apeing of reality with too cruel a resemblance one of the scraps of practical wisdom gained by hardened sufferers is to keep from spying at horizons when they drop into a pleasant dingle such is the comfort of it that we can dream and lull our fears and half think what we wish and it is a heavenly truce with the fretful mind divided from our wishes nesta wondered at her mother's complacent questions concerning this lakelands the house the county the kind of people about the features of the country physically unable herself to be regretful under a burden three parts enrapturing her the girl expected her mother to display a shadowy vexation with a proud word or two that would summon her thrilling sympathy in regard to the fourth part namely the aristocratic iciness of country magnates who took them up and cast them off as they had done she thought at craye farm and at creckholt she remembered it of the latter place wincingly insurgently having loved the dear home she had been expelled from by her pride of the frosty surrounding people or no not all but some of them and what had roused their pride striking for a reason her inexperience of our modern england supplemented by readings in the england of a preceding generation had hit on her father's profession of merchant it accounted to her for the behaviour of the haughty territorial and titled families but certain of the minor titles headed city firms she had heard certain of the families were avowedly commercial 'they follow suit' her father said at creckholt after he had found her mother weeping and decided instantly to quit and fly once more but if they followed suit in such a way then mr durance must be right when he called the social english the most sheepy of sheep and nesta could not consent to the cruel verdict she adored her compatriots incongruities were pacified for her by the suggestion of her quick wits that her father besides being a merchant was a successful speculator and perhaps the speculator is not liked by merchants or they were jealous of him or they did not like his being both she pardoned them with some tenderness on a suspicion that a quaint old high frilled bleached and puckered puritanical rectitude her thoughts rose in pictures possibly condemned the speculator as a description of gambler an erratic severity in ethics is easily overlooked by the enthusiast for things old english she was consciously ahead of them in the knowledge that her father had been without the taint of gambling a beneficent speculator the montgomery colony in south africa and his dealings with the natives in india and his railways in south america his establishment of insurance offices which were savings banks and the stores for the dispensing of sound goods to the poor attested it o and he was hospitable the kindest helpfullest of friends the dearest the very brightest of parents he was his girl's playmate she could be critic of him for an induction to the loving of him more justly yet if he had an excessive desire to win the esteem of people as these keen young optics perceived in him he strove to deserve it and no one could accuse him of laying stress on the benefits he conferred designedly frigidly to wound a man so benevolent appeared to her as an incomprehensible baseness the dropping of acquaintanceship with him after the taste of its privileges she ascribed in the void of any better elucidation to a mania of aristocratic conceit it drove her despite her youthful contempt of politics into a radicalism that could find food in the epigrams of mr colney durance even when they passed her understanding or when he was not too distinctly seen by her to be shooting at all the parties of her beloved england beneath the wicked semblance of shielding each by turns the young gentleman introduced to the radnor concert parties by lady grace halley as the hon dudley sowerby had to bear the sins of his class though he was tall straight featured correct in costume appearance deportment second son of a religious earl and no scandal to the parentage he was less noticed by nesta than the elderly and the commoners her father accused her of snubbing him she reproduced her famous copy of the sugared acid of mr dudley sowerby's closed mouth a sort of sneer in meekness as of humility under legitimate compulsion deploring christianly a pride of race that stamped it for this cowled exhibition the wonderful mimicry was a flash thrown out by a born mistress of the art and her mother was constrained to laugh and so was her father but he wilfully denied the likeness he charged her with encouraging colney durance to drag forth the sprig of nobility in the nakedness of evicted shell fish on themes of the peril to england possibly ruin through the loss of that ruling initiative formerly possessed in the days of our glory by the titular nobles of the land colney spoke it effectively and the hon dudley's expressive lineaments showed print of the heaving word alas as when a target is penetrated centrally and he was not a particularly dull fellow 'for his class and country' colney admitted adding 'i hit his thought and out he came' one has reluctantly with victor radnor to grant that when a man's topmost unspoken thought is hit he must be sharp on his guard to keep from coming out we have won a right to him 'only it's too bad it 's a breach of hospitality' victor said both to nesta and to nataly alluding to several instances of colney's ironic handling of their guests especially of this one whom nesta would attack and nataly would not defend they were alive at a signal to protect the others miss priscilla graves an eater of meat was ridiculous in her ant'alcoholic exclusiveness and scorn mr pempton a drinker of wine would laud extravagantly the more transparent purity of vegetarianism dr peter yatt jeered at globules dr john cormyn mourned over human creatures treated as cattle by big doses the rev septimus barmby satisfactorily smoked mr peridon traced mortal evil to that act dr schlesien had his german views colney durance his ironic fenellan his fanciful and free lance and here was an optimist there a pessimist and the rank radical the rigid conservative were not wanting all of them were pointedly opposed extraordinarily for so small an assembly absurdly it might be thought but these provoked a kind warm smile with the exclamation 'they are dears' they were the dearer for their fads and foibles music harmonized them music strangely put the spell on colney durance the sayer of bitter things manufacturer of prickly balls in the form of discord's apples of whom fenellan remarked that he took to his music like an angry little boy to his barley sugar with a growl and a grunt all these diverse friends could meet and mix in victor's concert room with an easy homely recognition of one another's musical qualities at times enthusiastic and their natural divergencies and occasional clashes added a salient tastiness to the group of whom nesta could say 'mama was there ever such a collection of dear good souls with such contrary minds' her mother had the deepest of reasons for loving them so as not to wish to see the slightest change in their minds that the accustomed features making her nest of homeliness and real peace might be retained with the humour of their funny silly antagonisms and the subsequent march in concord excepting solely as regarded the perverseness of priscilla graves in her open contempt of mr pempton's innocent two or three wine glasses the vegetarian gentleman's politeness forbore to direct attention to the gobbets of meat priscilla consumed though he could express disapproval in general terms but he entertained sentiments as warlike to the lady's habit of 'drinking the blood of animals' the mockery of it was that priscilla liked mr pempton and admired his violoncello playing and he was unreserved in eulogy of her person and her pure soprano tones nataly was a poetic match maker mr peridon was intended for mademoiselle de seilles nesta's young french governess a lady of a courtly bearing with placid speculation in the eyes she cast on a foreign people and a voluble muteness shadowing at intervals along the line of her closed lips the one person among them a little out of tune with most was lady grace halley nataly's provincial gentlewoman's traditions of the manners indicating conduct reproved unwonted licences assumed by lady grace who in allusion to hymen's weaving of a cousinship between the earldom of southweare and that of cantor of which mr sowerby sprang set her mouth and fan at work to delineate total distinctions as it were from the egg to the empyrean her stature was rather short all of it conversational at the eyebrows the shoulders the finger tips the twisting shape a ballerina's expressiveness and her tongue dashed half sentences through and among these hieroglyphs loosely and funnily candid anybody might hear that she had gone gambling into the city and that she had got herself into a mess and that by great good luck she had come across victor radnor who with two turns of the wrist had plucked her out of the mire the miraculous man and she had vowed to him never again to run doing the like without his approval the cause of her having done it was related with the accompaniments brows twitching flitting smiles shrugs pouts shifts of posture she was married to a centaur out of the saddle a man of wood 'an excellent man' for the not colloquial do not commit themselves but one wants a little animation in a husband she called on bell motion of the head to toll forth the utter nightcap negative he had not any out of the saddle he was asleep 'next door to the last trump' colney durance assisted her to describe the soundest of sleep in a husband after wooing her to unbosom herself she was awake to his guileful arts and sailed along with him hailing his phrases if he shot a good one prankishly exposing a flexible nature that took its holiday thus in a grinding world among maskers to the horrification of the prim so to refresh ourselves by having publicly a hip bath in the truth while we shock our hearers enough to be discredited for what we reveal was a dexterous merry twist amusing to her but it was less a cynical malice than her nature that she indulged 'a woman must have some excitement' the most innocent appeared to her the stock exchange the opinions of husbands who are not summoned to pay are hardly important they vary colney helped her now and then to step the trifle beyond her stride but if he was humorous she forgave and if together they appalled the decorous it was great gain her supple person pretty lips the style she had gave a pass to the wondrous confidings which were for masculine ears whatever the sex nataly might share in them but women did not lead her to expansiveness or not the women of the contracted class miss graves mrs cormyn and others at the radnor concerts she had a special consideration for mademoiselle de seilles owing to her exquisite french as she said and she may have liked it but it was the young frenchwoman's air of high breeding that won her esteem girls were spring frosts to her fronting nesta she put on her noted smile or wood cut of a smile with its label of indulgence except when the girl sang music she loved she said it was the saving of poor dudley it distinguished him in the group of the noble evangelical cantor family and it gave him a subject of assured discourse in company and oddly it contributed to his comelier air flute this would be the german blockeflute or our recorder dw in hand his mouth at the blow stop was relieved of its pained updraw by the form for puffing he preserved a gentlemanly high figure in his exercises on the instrument out of ken of all likeness to the urgent insistency of victor radnor's punctuating trunk of the puffing frame at almost every bar an apollo brilliancy in energetic pursuit of the nymph of sweet sound too methodical one too fiery the other in duets of hauptmann's with nesta at the piano the contrast of dull smoothness and overstressed significance was very noticeable beside the fervent accuracy of her balanced fingering and as she could also flute she could criticize though latterly the flute was boxed away from lips that had devoted themselves wholly to song song being one of the damsel's present pressing ambitions she found nothing to correct in mr sowerby and her father was open to all the censures but her father could plead vitality passion he held his performances cheap after the vehement display he was a happy listener whether to the babble of his 'dear old corelli' or to the majesty of the rattling heavens and swaying forests of beethoven his air of listening was a thing to see it had a look of disembodiment the sparkle conjured up from deeps and the life in the sparkle as of a soul at holiday eyes had been given this man to spy the pleasures and reveal the joy of his pasture on them gateways to the sunny within issues to all the outer edens few of us possess that double significance of the pure sparkle it captivated lady grace she said a word of it to fenellan 'there is a man who can feel rapture' he had not to follow the line of her sight she said so on a previous evening in a similar tone and for a woman to repeat herself using the very emphasis was quaint she could feel rapture but her features and limbs were in motion to designate it between simply and wilfully she had the instinct to be dimpling and would not for a moment control it and delighted in its effectiveness only when observing that winged sparkle of eyes did an idea of envy hardly a consciousness inform her of being surpassed and it might be in the capacity to feel besides the gift to express such a reflection relating to a man will make women mortally sensible that they are the feminine of him 'his girl has the look' fenellan said in answer she cast a glance at nesta then at nataly and it was true that the figure of a mother not pretending to the father's vividness eclipsed it somewhat in their child the mother gave richness of tones hues and voice and stature likewise and the thick brown locks which in her own were threads of gold along the brush from the temples she gave the girl a certain degree of the composure of manner which victor could not have bestowed she gave nothing to clash with his genial temper she might be supposed to have given various qualities moral if you like but vividness was lady grace's admirable meteor of the hour she was unable to perceive so as to compute the value of obscurer lights under the charm of nataly's rich contralto during a duet with priscilla graves she gesticulated ecstasies and uttered them and genuinely and still when reduced to meditations they would have had no weight they would hardly have seemed an apology for language beside victor's gaze of pleasure in the noble forthroll of the notes nataly heard the invitation of the guests of the evening to lakelands next day her anxieties were at once running about to gather provisions for the baskets she spoke of them at night but victor had already put the matter in the hands of madame callet and all that could be done would be done by armandine he knew 'if she can't muster enough at home she'll be off to her piccadilly shop by seven am count on plenty for twice the number' nataly was reposing on the thought that they were her friends when victor mentioned his having in the afternoon despatched a note to his relatives the duvidney ladies inviting them to join him at the station to morrow for a visit of inspection to the house of his building on his new estate he startled her the duvidney ladies were to his knowledge of the order of the fragile minds which hold together by the cement of a common trepidation for the support of things established and have it not in them to be able to recognize the unsanctioned good women unworldly of the world they were perforce harder than the world from being narrower and more timorous 'but victor you were sure they would refuse' he answered 'they may have gone back to tunbridge wells by the way they have a society down there i want for fredi sure do you say my dear perfectly sure but the accumulation of invitations and refusals in the end softens them you will see we shall and must have them for fredi' she was used to the long reaches of his forecasts his burning activity on a project she found it idle to speak her thought that his ingenuity would have been needless in a position dictated by plain prudence and so much happier for them they talked of mrs burman until she had to lift a prayer to be saved from darker thoughts dreadfully prolific not to be faced part of her prayer was on behalf of mrs burman for life to be extended to her if the poor lady clung to life if it was really humane to wish it for her and heaven would know heaven had mercy on the afflicted nataly heard the snuffle of hypocrisy in her prayer she had to cease to pray chapter ix an inspection of lakelands one may not have an intention to flourish and may be pardoned for a semblance of it in exclaiming somewhat royally as creator and owner of the place 'there you see lakelands' the conveyances from the railway station drew up on a rise of road fronting an undulation where our modern english architect's fantasia in crimson brick swept from central gables to flying wings over pents crooks curves peaks cowled porches balconies recesses projections away to a red village of stables and dependent cottages harmonious in irregularity and coloured homely with the greensward about it the pines beside it the clouds above it not many palaces would be reckoned as larger the folds and swells and stream of the building along the roll of ground had an appearance of an enormous banner on the wind nataly looked her next look was at colney durance she sent the expected nods to victor's carriage she would have given the whole prospect for the covering solitariness of her chamber a multitude of clashing sensations and a throat thickening hateful to her compelled her to summon so as to force herself to feel a groundless anger directed against none against nothing perfectly crazy but her only resource for keeping down the great wave surgent at her eyes victor was like a swimmer in morning sea amid the exclamations encircling him he led through the straight passage of the galleried hall offering two fair landscapes at front door and at back down to the lake fredi's lake a good oblong of water notable in a district not abounding in the commodity he would have it a feature of the district and it had been deepened and extended up rose the springs many ran the ducts fredi's pretty little bathshed or bower had a space of marble on the three feet shallow it overhung with a shade of carved woodwork it had a diving board for an eight feet plunge a punt and small row boat of elegant build hard by green ran the banks about and a beechwood fringed with birches curtained the northward length morning sun and evening had a fair face of water to paint saw man ever the like for pleasing a poetical damsel so was miss fredi the coldest of the party hitherto and dreaming a preference of 'old places' like creckholt and craye farm 'captured to be enraptured' quite according to man's ideal of his beneficence to the sex she pressed the hand of her young french governess louise de seilles as in everything he did for his girl victor pointed boastfully to his forethought of her convenience and her tastes the pine panels of the interior the shelves for her books pegs to hang her favourite drawings and the couch bunk under a window to conceal the summerly recliner while throwing full light on her book and the hearth square for logs when she wanted fire because fredi bathed in any weather the oaken towel coffer the wood carvings of doves tits fishes the rod for the flowered silken hangings she was to choose and have shy odalisque peeps of sunny water from her couch 'fredi's naiad retreat when she wishes to escape herr strauscher or signor ruderi' said victor having his grateful girl warm in an arm 'and if they head after her into the water i back her to leave them puffing she's a dolphin that water has three springs and gets all the drainage of the upland round us i chose the place chiefly on account of it and the pines i do love pines' 'but excellent man what do you not love' said lady grace with the timely hit upon the obvious which rings 'it saves him from accumulation of tissue' said colney 'what does' was eagerly asked by the wife of the homoeopathic dr john cormyn a sentimental lady beset with fears of stoutness victor cried 'tush don't listen to colney pray' but she heard colney speak of a positive remedy more immediately effective than an abjuration of potatoes and sugar she was obliged by her malady to listen although detesting the irreverent ruthless man who could direct expanding frames in a serious tone to love love everybody everything violently and universally love and so without intermission pay out the fat created by a rapid assimilation of nutriment obeseness is the most sensitive of our ailments probably as being aware that its legitimate appeal to pathos is ever smothered in its pudding bed of the grotesque she was pained and showed it and was ashamed of herself for showing it and that very nearly fetched the tear 'our host is an instance in proof' colney said he waved hand at the house his meaning was hidden evidently he wanted victims sight of lakelands had gripped him with the fell satiric itch and it is a passion to sting and tear on rational grounds his face meanwhile which had points of the handsome signified a smile asleep as if beneath a cloth only those who knew him well were aware of the claw like alertness under the droop of eyelids admiration was the common note in the various keys the station selected for the south eastward aspect of the dark red gabled pile on its white shell terrace backed by a plantation of tall pines a mounded and full plumed company above the left wing was admired in files and in volleys marvellous effectively miraculous was the tale of the vow to have the great edifice finished within one year and the strike of workmen and the friendly colloquy with them the good reasoning the unanimous return to duty and the doubling the trebling of the number of them and the most glorious of sights o the grand old english working with a will as englishmen do when they come at last to heat and they conquer there is then nothing that they cannot conquer so the conqueror said and admirable were the conservatories running three long lines one from the drawing room to a central dome for tropical growths and the parterres were admired also the newly planted irish junipers bounding the west walk and the three tiers of stately descent from the three green terrace banks to the grassy slopes over the lake again the lake was admired the house admired admiration was evoked for great orchid houses 'over yonder' soon to be set up off we go to the kitchen garden there the admiration is genial practical we admire the extent of the beds marked out for asparagus and the french disposition of the planting at wide intervals and the french system of training peach pear and plum trees on the walls to win length and catch sun we much admire we admire the gardener we are induced temporarily to admire the french people they are sagacious in fruit gardens they have not the english constitution you think rightly but in fruit gardens they grow for fruit and not as victor quotes a friend for wood which the valiant english achieve we hear and we see examples of sagacity and we are further brought round to the old confession that we cannot cook colney durance has us there we have not studied herbs and savours and so we are shocked backward step by step until we retreat precipitately into the nooks where waxen tapers carefully tended by writers on the press light up mysterious images of our national selves for admiration something surely we do or we should not be where we are but what is it we do excepting cricket of course which others cannot do colney asks and he excludes cricket and football an acutely satiric man in an english circle that does not resort to the fist for a reply to him may almost satiate the excessive fury roused in his mind by an illogical people of a provocative prosperity mainly tongueless or of leaden tongue above the pressure of their necessities as he takes them to be they give him so many opportunities they are angry and helpless as the log hissing to the saw their instinct to make use of the downright in retort restrained as it is by a buttoned coat of civilization is amusing inviting colney durance allured them to the quag's edge and plunged them in it to writhe patriotically and although it may be said that they felt their situation less than did he the venom they sprang in his blood he was cruel he caused discomfort but these good friends about him stood for the country an illogical country and as he could not well attack his host victor radnor an irrational man he selected the abstract entity for the discharge of his honest spite the irrational friend was deeper at the source of his irritation than the illogical old motherland this house of lakelands the senselessness of his friend in building it and designing to live in it after experiences of an incapacity to stand in a serene contention with the world he challenged excited colney's wasp he was punished half way to frenzy behind his placable demeanour by having dr schlesien for chorus and here again it was the unbefitting not the person which stirred his wrath a german on english soil should remember the dues of a guest at the same time colney said things to snare the acclamation of an observant gentleman of that race who is no longer in his first enthusiasm for english beef and the complexion of the women 'ah ya it is true what you say the english grow as fast as odders but they grow to corns instead of brains they are bull quaat true' he bellowed on a laugh the last half of the quotation colney marked him his encounters with fenellan were enlivening engagements and left no malice only a regret when the fencing passed his guard that fenellan should prefer to flash for the minute he would have met a pert defender of england in the person of miss priscilla graves if she had not been occupied with observation of the bearing of lady grace halley toward mr victor radnor which displeased her on behalf of mrs victor she was besides hostile by race and class to an aristocratic assumption of licence sparing colney she with some scorn condemned mr pempton for allowing his country to be ridiculed without a word mr pempton believed that the vegetarian movement was more progressive in england than in other lands but he was at the disadvantage with the fair priscilla that eulogy of his compatriots on this account would win her coldest approval 'satire was never an argument' he said too evasively the rev septimus barmby received the meed of her smile for saying in his many fathom bass with an eye on victor 'at least we may boast of breeding men who are leaders of men' the announcement of luncheon by victor's butler arlington opportunely followed and freighted the remark with a happy recognition of that which comes to us from the hands of conquerors dr schlesien himself no antagonist to england but like colney durance a critic speculated in view of the spread of pic nic provision beneath the great glass dome as to whether it might be that these english were on another start out of the dust in vigorous commercial enterprise under leadership of one of their chance masterly minds merchant in this instance and be debated within whether genius occasionally developed in a surprising superior manner by these haphazard english may not sometimes wrest the prize from method albeit we count for the long run that method has assurance of success however late in the race to set forth luncheon was a merry meal with victor and nataly for host and hostess fenellan colney durance and lady grace halley for the talkers a gusty bosom of sleet overhung the dome rattled on it and rolling westward became a radiant mountain land partly worthy of victor's phrase 'a range of swiss alps in air' 'with periwigs louis quatorze for peaks' colney added and fenellan improved on him 'or a magnified bench of judges at the trial of your caerulean phryne' the strip of white cloud flew on a whirl from the blue to confirm it but victor and lady grace rejected any play of conceits upon nature violent and horrid interventions of the counterfeit such mad similes appeared to them when pure coin was offered they loathed the rev septimus barmby for proclaiming that he had seen 'chapters of hebrew history in the grouping of clouds' his gaze was any one of the chapters upon nesta the clerical gentleman's voice was of a depth to claim for it the profoundest which can be thought or uttered and nesta's tender youth had taken so strong an impression of sacredness from what fenellan called 'his chafer tones' that her looks were often given him in gratitude for the mere sound nataly also had her sense of safety in acquiescing to such a voice coming from such a garb consequently whenever fenellan and colney were at him drawing him this way and that for utterances cathedral in sentiment and sonorousness these ladies shed protecting beams insomuch that he was inspired to the agreeable conceptions whereof frequently rash projects are an issue touching the neighbours of lakelands they were principally enriched merchants it appeared a snippet or two of the fringe of aristocracy lay here and there among them and one racy of the soil old son of thames having the manners proper to last century's yeoman mr pempton knew something of this quaint squire of hefferstone beaves urmsing by name a ruddy man right heartily saxon a still glowing brand amid the ashes of the heptarchy hearthstone who had a song the marigolds which he would troll out for you anywhere on any occasion to have so near to the metropolis one from the centre of the venerable rotundity of the country was rare victor exclaimed 'come' in ravishment over the picturesqueness of a neighbour carrying imagination away to the founts of england and his look at nataly proposed her countenance was inapprehensive he perceived resistance and said 'i have met two or three of them in the train agreeable men gladding the banker a general fanning that man blathenoy great billbroker but the fact is close on london we're independent of neighbours we mean to be lakelands and london practically join' 'the mother city becoming the suburb' murmured colney in report of the union 'you must expect to be invaded sir' said mr sowerby and victor shrugged 'we are pretty safe' 'the lock of a door seems a potent security until some one outside is heard fingering the handle nigh midnight' fenellan threw out his airy nothing of a remark it struck on nataly's heart 'so you will not let us be lonely here' she said to her guests the rev septimus barmby was mouthpiece for congregations sound of a subterranean roar with a blast at the orifice informed her of their 'very deep happiness in the privilege' he comforted her nesta smiled on him thankfully 'don't imagine mrs victor that you can be shut off from neighbours in a house like this and they have a claim' said lady grace quitting the table fenellan and colney thought so 'like mice at a cupboard' 'beetles in a kitchen' 'no no no no' victor shook head pitiful over the good people likened to things unclean and royally upraising them in doing which he scattered to vapour the leaden incubi they had been upon his flatter moods of late 'no but it's a rapture to breathe the air here' his lifted chest and nostrils were for the encouragement of nataly to soar beside him she summoned her smile and nodded he spoke aside to lady grace 'the dear soul wants time to compose herself after a grand surprise' she replied 'i think i could soon be reconciled how much land' 'in treaty for some hundred and eighty or ninety acres in all at present three hundred and seventy including plantations lake outhouses' 'large enough land paying as it does that is not paying we shall be having to gamble in the city systematically for subsistence' 'you will not so much as jest on the subject' coming from such a man that was clear sky thunder the lady played it off in a shadowy pout and shrug while taking a stamp of his masterfulness not so volatile she said to nataly 'our place in worcestershire is about half the size if as much large enough when we're not crowded out with gout and can open to no one some day you will visit us i hope' 'you we count on here lady grace' it was an over accentuated response unusual with this well bred woman and a bit of speech that does not flow causes us to speculate the lady resumed 'i value the favour we're in a horsey doggy foxy circle down there we want enlivening if we had your set of musicians and talkers' nataly smiled in vacuous kindness at a loss for the retort of a compliment to a person she measured lady grace also was an amiable hostile reviewer each could see to have cited in the other defects common to the lower species of the race admitting a superior personal quality or two which might be pleaded in extenuation and if the apology proved too effective could be dispersed by insistence upon it under an implied appeal to benevolence when we have not a liking for the creature whom we have no plain cause to dislike we are minutely just during the admiratory stroll along the ground floor rooms colney durance found himself beside dr schlesien the latter smoking striding emphasizing but bearable as the one of the party who was not perpetually at the gape in laudation colney was heard to say 'no doubt the german is the race the least mixed in europe it might challenge aboriginals for that oddly it has invented the cyclopaedia for knowledge the sausage for nutrition how would you explain it' dr schlesien replied with an atlas shrug under fleabite to the insensately infantile interrogation he in turn was presently heard 'but my good sir you quote me your english latin i must beg of you you write it down it is orally incomprehensible to continentals' 'we are islanders' colney shrugged in languishment 'oh you do great things' dr schlesien rejoined in kindness making his voice a musical intimation of the smallness of the things 'we build great houses to employ our bricks' 'no colney to live in' said victor 'scarcely long enough to warm them' 'what do you fiddle' 'they are not hohenzollerns' 'it is true' dr schlesien called 'no but you learn discipline you build i say wid you not hohenzollerns you build but you shall look above eyes up ire necesse est good but mount you come to something have ideas' 'good but when do we reach your level' 'sir i do not say more than that we do not want instruction from foreigners' 'pupil to paedagogue indeed you have the wreath in music in jurisprudence chemistry scholarship beer arms manners' dr schlesien puffed a tempest of tobacco and strode 'he is chiselling for wit in the teutonic block' colney said falling back to fenellan fenellan observed 'you might have credited him with the finished sculpture' 'they're ahead of us in sticking at the charge of wit' 'they've a widening of their swallow since versailles' 'manners' 'well that's a tight cravat for the teutonic thrapple but he's off by himself to loosen it' victor came on the couple testily 'what are you two concocting i say do keep the peace please an excellent good fellow better up in politics than any man i know understands music means well you can see you two hate a man at all serious and he doesn't bore with his knowledge a scholar too' 'if he'll bring us the atmosphere of the groves of academe he may swing his ferule pickled in himself and welcome' said fenellan 'yes' victor nodded at a recognized antagonism in fenellan 'but colney's always lifting the germans high above us' 'it's to exercise his muscles' victor headed to the other apartments thinking that the rev septimus and young sowerby old england herself were spared by the diversion of these light skirmishing shots from their accustomed victims to the 'masculine people of our time his friends would want a drilling to be of aid to him in his campaign to come for it was one and a great one he remembered his complete perception of the plan all the elements of it the forward whirling of it just before the fall on london bridge the greatness of his enterprise laid such hold of him that the smallest of obstacles had a villanous aspect and when as anticipated colney and fenellan were sultry flies for whomsoever they could fret he was blind to the reading of absurdities which caused fredi's eyes to stream and lady grace beside him to stand awhile and laugh out her fit young sowerby appeared forgiving enough he was a perfect gentleman but fredi's appalling sense of fun must try him hard and those young fellows are often more wounded by a girl's thoughtless laughter than by a man's contempt nataly should have protected him her face had the air of a smiling general satisfaction sign of a pleasure below the mark required sign too of a sleepy partner for a battle even in the wonderful kitchen arched and pillared where the explanation came to nesta of madame callet's frequent leave of absence of late when an inferior dinner troubled her father in no degree even there his nataly listened to the transports of the guests with benign indulgence 'mama' said nesta ready to be entranced by kitchens in her bubbling animation she meant the recalling of instances of the conspirator her father had been 'you none of you guessed armandine's business' victor cried in a glee that pushed to make the utmost of this matter and count against chagrin 'she was off to paris went to test the last inventions french brains are always alert and in fact those kitchen ranges gas and coal and the apparatus for warming plates and dishes the whole of the battery is on the model of the duc d'ariane's finest in europe well' he agreed with colney 'to say france is enough' mr pempton spoke to miss graves of the task for a woman to conduct a command so extensive and as when an inoffensive wayfarer has chanced to set foot near a wasp's nest out on him came woman and her champions the worthy and the sham like a blast of powder victor ejaculated 'armandine' whoever doubted her capacity knew not armandine or not knowing armandine knew not the capacity in women with that utterance of her name he saw the orangey spot on london bridge and the sinking tower and masts and funnels and the rising of them on his return to his legs he recollected that at the very edge of the fall he had armandine strongly in his mind she was to do her part fenellan and colney on the surface she below and hospitality was to do its part and music was impressed the innocent concerts his wealth all his inventiveness were to serve and merely to attract and win the tastes of people for a social support to lakelands merely that much more if nataly's coldness to the place would but allow him to form an estimate of how much at the same time being in the grasp of his present disappointment he perceived a meanness in the result that was astonishing and afflicting he had not ever previously felt imagination starving at the vision of success victor had yet to learn that the man with a material object in aim is the man of his object and the nearer to his mark often the farther is he from a sober self he is more the arrow of his bow than bow to his arrow this we pay for scheming and success is costly we find we have pledged the better half of ourselves to clutch it not to be redeemed with the whole handful of our prize he was however learning after his leaping fashion nataly's defective sympathy made him look at things through the feelings she depressed a shadow of his missed idea on london bridge seemed to cross him from the close flapping of a wing within reach he could say only that it would if caught have been an answer to the thought disturbing him nataly drew colney durance with her eyes to step beside her on the descent to the terrace little skepsey hove in sight coming swift as the point of an outrigger over the flood chapter x skepsey in motion the bearer of his master's midday letters from london shot beyond nataly as soon as seen with an apparent snap of his body in passing he steamed to the end of the terrace and delivered the packet returning at the same rate of speed to do proper homage to the lady he so much respected he had left the railway station on foot instead of taking a fly because of a calculation that he would save three minutes which he had not lost for having to come through the raincloud 'perhaps the contrary' skepsey said it might be judged to have accelerated his course and his hat dripped and his coat shone and he soaped his hands cheerful as an ouzel cock when the sun is out again 'many cracked crowns lately in the manly art' colney inquired of him and skepsey answered with precision of statement 'crowns no sir the nose it may happen but it cannot be said to be the rule' 'you are of opinion that the practice of scientific pugilism offers us compensation for the broken bridge of a nose' 'in an increase of manly self esteem i do sir yes' skepsey was shy of this gentleman's bite and he fancied his defence had been correct perceiving a crumple of the lips of mr durance he took the attitude of a watchful dubiety 'but my goodness you are wet through' cried nataly reproaching herself for the tardy compassion and nesta ran up to them and heaped a thousand pities on her 'poor dear skip' and drove him in beneath the glass dome to the fragments of pic nic and poured champagne for him 'lest his wife should have to doctor him for a cold' and poured afresh when he had obeyed her 'for the toasting of lakelands dear skepsey' impossible to resist so he drank and blinked and was then told that before using his knife and fork he must betake himself to some fire of shavings and chips where coffee was being made for the purpose of drying his clothes but this he would not hear of he was pledged to business to convey his master's letters and he might have to catch a train by the last quarter minute unless it was behind the time tables he must hold himself ready to start entreated adjured commanded skepsey commiseratingly observed to colney durance 'the ladies do not understand sir' for turk of constantinople had never a more haremed opinion of the unfitness of women in the brave world of action the persistence of these ladies endeavouring to obstruct him in the course of his duty must have succeeded save that for one word of theirs he had two and twice the promptitude of motion he explained to them as to good children that the loss of five minutes might be the loss of a post the loss of thousands of pounds the loss of the character of a firm and he was away to the terrace nesta headed him and waved him back she and her mother rebuked him they called him unreasonable wherein they resembled the chief example of the sex to him in a wife he had at home who levelled that charge against her husband when most she needed discipline the woman laid hand on the very word legitimately his own for the justification of his process with her 'but skips if you are ill and we have to nurse you' said nesta she forgot the hospital he told her cordially and laughed at the notion of a ducking producing a cold or a cold a fever or anything consumption with him so the ladies had to keep down their anxious minds and allow him to stand in wet clothing to eat his cold pie and salad miss priscilla graves entering to them became a witness that they were seductresses for inducing him to drink wine and a sparkling wine 'it is to warm him' they pleaded and she said 'he must be warm from his walk' and they said 'but he is wet' and said she without a show of feeling 'warm water then' and skepsey writhed as if in the grasp of anatomists at being the subject of female contention or humane consideration miss graves caught signs of the possible proselyte in him she remarked encouragingly 'i am sure he does not like it he still has a natural taste' she distressed his native politeness for the glass was in his hand and he was fully aware of her high principled aversion and he profoundly bowed to principles believing his england to be pillared on them and the lady looked like one who bore the standard of a principle and if we slap and pinch and starve our appetites the idea of a principle seems entering us to support subscribing to a principle our energies are refreshed we have a faith in the country that was not with us before the act and of a real well founded faith come the glowing thoughts which we have at times thoughts of england heading the nations when the smell of an english lane under showers challenges eden and the threading of a london crowd tunes discords to the swell of a cathedral organ it may be that by the renunciation of any description of alcohol a man will stand clearer headed to serve his country he may expect to have a clearer memory for certain he will not be asking himself unable to decide whether his master named a mr journeyman or a mr jarniman as the person he declined to receive either of the two is repulsed upon his application owing to the guilty similarity of sounds but what we are to think of is our own sad state of inefficiency in failing to remember which accuses our physical condition therefore our habits thus the little man debated scarcely requiring more than to hear the right word to be a convert and make him a garland of the proselyte's fetters destructively for the cause she advocated miss priscilla gestured the putting forth of an abjuring hand with the recommendation to him so to put aside temptation that instant and she signified in a very ugly jerk of her features the vilely filthy stuff morality thought it however pleasing it might be to a palate corrupted by indulgence of the sensual appetites but the glass had been handed to him by the lady he respected who looked angelical in offering it divinely other than ugly and to her he could not be discourteous not even to pay his homage to the representative of a principle he bowed to miss graves and drank and rushed forth hearing shouts behind him his master had a packet of papers ready easy for the pocket 'by the way skepsey' he said 'if a man named jarniman should call at the office i will see him' skepsey's grey eyes came out or was it journeyman that his master would not see and jarniman that he would his habit of obedience pride of apprehension and the time to catch the train forbade inquiry besides he knew of himself of old that his puzzles were best unriddled running the quick of pace are soon in the quick of thoughts jarniman then was a man whom his master not wanting to see one day and wanting to see on another day might wish to conciliate a case of policy let jarniman go journeyman on the other hand was nobody at all a ghost of the fancy yet this journeyman was as important an individual he was a dread reality more important to skepsey in the light of patriot and only in that light was he permitted of a scrupulous conscience and modest mind to think upon himself when the immediate subject was his master's interests for this journeyman had not an excuse for existence in mr radnor's pronunciation he was born of the buzz of a troubled ear coming of a disordered brain consequent necessarily upon a disorderly stomach that might protest a degree of comparative innocence but would be shamed utterly under inspection of the eye of a lady of principle what then was the value to his country of a servant who could not accurately recollect his master's words miss graves within him asked the rapid little man whether indeed his ideas were his own after draughts of champagne the ideas excited to an urgent animation by his racing trot were a quiverful in flight over an england terrible to the foe and dancing on the green right so but would we keep up the dance we must be red iron to touch and the fighter for conquering is the one who can last and has the open brain and there you have a point against alcohol yes and miss graves if she would press it with her natural face could be pleasant and persuasive and she ought to be told she ought to marry for the good of the country women taking liquor skepsey had a vision of his wife with rheumy peepers and miauly mouth as he had once beheld the creature oh they need discipline not such would we have for the mothers of our english young decidedly the women of principle are bound to enter wedlock they should be bound by law whereas in the opposing case the binding of the unprincipled to a celibate state such a law would have saved skepsey from the necessitated commission of deeds of discipline with one of the female sex and have rescued his progeny from a likeness to the corn stalk reverting to weed he had but a son for england's defence and the frame of his boy might be set quaking by a thump on the wind of a drum the courage of william barlow skepsey would not stand against a sheep it would wind up hares to have a run at him out in the field offspring of a woman of principle but there is no rubbing out in life why dream of it only that one would not have one's country the loser dwell a moment on the reverse and first remember the lesson of the captivity of the jews and the outcry of their backsliding and repentance see a nation of the honourably begotten muscular men disdaining the luxuries they will occasionally condescend to taste like some tribe in greece boxers rowers runners climbers braced indomitable magnanimous as only the strong can be an army at word winning at a stroke the double battle of the hand and the heart men who can walk the paths through the garden of the pleasures they receive fitting mates of a build to promise or aid in ensuring depth of chest and long reach of arm for their progeny down goes the world before them and we see how much would be due for this to a corps of ladies like miss graves not allowed to remain too long on the stalk of spinsterhood her age might count twenty eight too long she should be taught that men can though truly ordinary women cannot walk these orderly paths through the garden an admission to women hinting restrictions on a ticket marked 'in moderation' meaning that they may pluck a flower or fruit along the pathway border to which they are confined speedily alas exhibits them at a mad scramble across the pleasure beds they know not moderation neither for their own sakes nor for the sakes of posterity will they hold from excess when they are not pledged to shun it the reason is that their minds cannot conceive the abstract as men do but there are grounds for supposing that the example before them of a sex exercising self control in freedom would induce women to pledge themselves to a similar abnegation until they gain some sense of touch upon the impalpable duty to the generations coming after us thanks to the voluntary example we set them the stupendous task which had hitherto baffled skepsey in the course of conversational remonstrances with his wife that of getting the idea of posterity into the understanding of its principal agent might then be mastered therefore clearly men have to begin the salutary movement it manifestly devolves upon them let them at once take to rigorous physical training women under compulsion as vessels men in their magnanimity patriotically voluntarily miss graves must have had an intimation for him he guessed it and it plunged him into a conflict with her that did not suffer him to escape without ruefully feeling the feebleness of his vocabulary and consequently he made a reluctant appeal to figures and it hung upon the bolder exhibition of lists and tables as to whether he was beaten and if beaten he was morally her captive and this being the case nothing could be more repulsive to skepsey seeing that he unable of his nature passively or partially to undertake a line of conduct beheld himself wearing a detestable 'ribbon' for sign of an oath quite needlessly sworn simply to satisfy the lady overcoming him with nimbler tongue and blocking the streets marching in bands beneath banners howling hymns statistics upon which his master and friends after exchanging opinions in argument always fell back frightened him as long as they had no opponents of their own kind they swept the field they were intelligible as the word 'principle' had become but the appearance of one body of statistics invariably brought up another and the strokes and counterstrokes were like a play of quarter staff on the sconce to knock all comprehension out of skepsey otherwise he would not unwillingly have inquired to morrow into the statistics of the controversy between the waters of the wells and of the casks prepared to walk over to the victorious however objectionable that proceeding he hoped to question his master some day except that his master would very naturally have a tendency to sum up in favour of wine good wine in moderation just as miss graves for the cup of tea not so thoughtfully stipulating that it should be good and not too copious statistics are according to their conjurors they are not independent bodies with native colours they needs must be painted by the different hands they pass through and they may be multiplied a nought or so counts for nothing with the teller skepsey saw that yet they can overcome even as fictitious battalions they can overcome he shrank from the results of a ciphering match having him for object and was ashamed of feeling to statistics as women to giants nevertheless he acknowledged that the badge was upon him if miss graves should beat her master in her array of figures to insist on his wearing it as she would she certainly would and against his internal conviction perhaps with the knowledge that the figures were an unfortified display and his oath of bondage an unmanly servility the silliest of ceremonies he was shockingly feminine to statistics mr durance despised them he called them arguing against mr radnor 'those emotional things' not comprehensibly to skepsey but mr durance a very clever gentleman could not be right in everything he made strange remarks upon his country dr yatt attributed them to the state of 'his digestion and mr fenellan had said of mr durance that as 'a barrister wanting briefs the speech in him had been bottled too long and was an overripe wine dripping sour drops through the rotten cork' mr fenellan said it laughing he meant no harm skepsey was sure he had the words he heard no more than other people hear he remembered whole sentences and many on one of his runs this active little machine quickened by motion to fire revived the audible of years back whatever suited his turn of mind at the moment rushed to the rapid wheels within him his master's business and friends his country's welfare and advancement these with records items anticipations of the manlier sports to decorate were his current themes all being chopped and tossed and mixed in salad accordance by his fervour of velocity and if you would like a further definition of genius think of it as a form of swiftness it is the lively young great grandson in the brain of the travelling force which mathematicians put to paper in a row of astounding ciphers for the motion of earth through space to the generating of heat whereof is multiplication whereof deposited matter and so your chaos your half lighted labyrinth your ceaseless pressure to evolvement and then light and so creation order the work of genius what do you say without having a great brain the measure of it possessed by skepsey was alive under strong illumination in his heart while doing penance for his presumptuousness he believed that he could lead regiments of men he was not the army's general he was the general's lieutenant now and then venturing to suggest a piece of counsel to his chief on his own particular drilled regiments his chief may rely and on his knowledge of the country of the campaign roads morasses masking hills dividing rivers he had mapped for himself mentally the battles of conquerors in his favourite historic reading and he understood the value of a plan and the danger of sticking to it and the advantage of a big army for flanking and he manoeuvred a small one cunningly to make it a bolt at the telling instant dartrey fenellan had explained to him frederick's oblique attack napoleon's employment of the artillery arm preparatory to the hurling of the cataract on the spot of weakness wellington's parallel march with marmont up to the hour of the decisive cut through the latter at salamanca and skepsey treated his enemy to the like deferentially reporting the engagement to a chief whom his modesty kept in eminence for the receiving of the principal honours as to his men of all classes and sorts they are so supple with training that they sustain a defeat like the sturdy pugilist a knock off his legs and up smiling a minute after one of the truly beautiful sights on this earth they go at the double half a day never sounding a single pair of bellows among them they have their appetites in full control to eat when they can or cheerfully fast they have healthy frames you see and as the healthy frame is not artificially heated it ensues that under any title you like they profess the principles into the bog we go we have got round to it the principles of those horrible marching and chanting people then must our england to be redoubtable to the enemy be a detestable country for habitation here was a knot skepsey's head dropped lower he went as a ram the sayings of mr durance about his dear england that 'her remainder of life is in the activity of her diseases' that 'she has so fed upon pap of compromise as to be unable any longer to conceive a muscular resolution' that 'she is animated only as the carcase to the blow fly' and so forth charged on him during his wrestle with his problem and the gentlemen had said had permitted himself to say that our england's recent history was a provincial apothecary's exhibition of the battle of bane and antidote mr durance could hardly mean it but how could one answer him when he spoke of the torpor of the people and of the succeeding governments as a change of lacqueys or the purse string's lacqueys he said that old england has taken to the arm chair for good and thinks it her whole business to pronounce opinions and listen to herself and that in the face of an armed europe this great nation is living on sufferance oh skepsey had uttered the repudiating exclamation 'feel quite up to it' he was asked by his neighbour the mover of armed hosts for the defence of the country sat in a third class carriage of the train approaching the first of the stations on the way to town he was instantly up to the level of an external world and fell into give and take with a burly broad communicative man located in london but born in the north in view of durham cathedral as he thanked his lord who was of the order of pork butcher which succulent calling had carried him down to near upon the borders of surrey and sussex some miles beyond the new big house of a mister whose name he had forgotten though he had heard it mentioned by an acquaintance interested in the gentleman's doings but his object was to have a look at a rare breed of swine worth the journey that didn't run to fat so much as to flavour had longer legs sharp snouts to plump their hams over from spain it seemed and the gentleman owning them was for selling them finding them wild past correction but the acquaintance mentioned who was down to visit t' other gentleman's big new edifice in workmen's hands had a mother who had been cook to a family and was now widow of a cook's shop ham beef and sausages prime pies to order and a good specimen herself and if ever her son saw her spirit at his bedside there wouldn't be room for much else in that chamber supposing us to keep our shapes but he was the right sort of son anxious to push his mother's shop where he saw a chance and do it cheap and those foreign pigs after a disappointment to their importer might be had pretty cheap and were accounted tasty skepsey's main thought was upon war the man had discoursed of pigs he informed the man of his having heard from a scholar that pigs had been the cause of more bloody battles than any other animal how so the pork butcher asked and said he was not much of a scholar and pigs might be provoking but he had not heard they were a cause of strife between man and man for possession of them skepsey explained oh possession why we've heard of bloody battles for the possession of women men will fight for almost anything they care to get or call their own the pork butcher said and he praised old england for avoiding war skepsey nodded how if war is forced on us then we fight suppose we are not prepared we soon get that up skepsey requested him to state the degree of resistance he might think he could bring against a pair of skilful fists in a place out of hearing of the police 'say you' said the pork butcher and sharply smiled for he was a man of size 'i would give you two minutes' rejoined skepsey eyeing him intently and kindly insomuch that it could be seen he was not in the conundrum vein 'rather short allowance eh master' said the bigger man 'feel here' he straightened out his arm and doubled it raising a proud bridge of muscle skepsey performed the national homage to muscle 'twice that would not help without the science' he remarked and let his arm be gripped in turn the pork butcher's throat sounded as it were commas and colons punctuations in his reflections while he tightened fingers along the iron lump 'stringy you're a wiry one no mistake' it was encomium with the ingrained contempt of size for a smallness that has not yet taught it the prostrating lesson he said 'weight tells' 'in a wrestle' skepsey admitted 'allow me to say you would not touch me' 'and how do you know i'm not a trifle handy with the maulers myself' 'you will pardon me for saying it would be worse for you if you were' the pork butcher was flung backward 'are you a professor may i inquire' skepsey rejected the title 'i can engage to teach young men upon a proper observance of first principles' 'they be hanged' cried the ruffled pork butcher 'our best men never got it out of books now you tell me you've got a spiflicating style of talk about you no brag you tell me course the best man wins if you mean that now if i was one of 'em and i fetches you a bit of a flick how then would you be ready to step out with a real professor' 'i should claim a fair field' was the answer made in modesty 'and you'd expect to whop me with they there principles of yours' 'i should expect to' 'bang me' was roared after a stare at the mild little figure with the fitfully dead levelled large grey eyes in front of him the pork butcher resumed 'take you for the man you say you be you're just the man for my friend jam and me he dearly loves to see a set to self the same what prettier and if you would be so obliging some day as to favour us with a display we'd head a cap conformably whether you'd the best of it according to your expectations or t' other way for there never was shame in a jolly good licking as the song says that is if you take it and make it appear jolly good and find you an opponent meet and fit never doubt ever had the worse of an encounter sir' 'often sir' 'well that's good and it didn't destroy your confidence' 'added to it i hope' at this point it became a crying necessity for skepsey to escape from an area of boastfulness into which he had fallen inadvertently and he hastened to apologize 'for his personal reference' that was intended for an illustration of our country caught unawares by a highly trained picked soldiery inferior in numbers to the patriotic levies but sharp at the edge and knowing how to strike measure the axe measure the tree and which goes down first 'invasion is it and you mean we're not to hit back' the pork butcher bellowed and presently secured a murmured approbation from an audience of three that had begun to comprehend the dialogue and strengthened him in a manner to teach skepsey the foolishness of ever urging analogies of too extended a circle to close sharply on the mark he had no longer a chance he was overborne identified with the fated invader rolled away into the chops of the channel to be swallowed up entire and not a rag left of him but john bull tucking up his shirtsleeves on the shingle beach ready for a second or a third crying to them to come on warmed by his bullish victory and friendly to the vanquished the pork butcher told skepsey he should like to see more of him and introduced himself on a card benjamin shaplow not far from the bank they parted at the terminus where three shrieks of an engine sounding like merry messages of the damned to their congeners in the anticipatory stench of the cab droppings above disconnected sane hearing perverted it no doubt or else it was the stamp of a particular name on his mind which impressed skepsey as he bored down the street and across the bridge to fancy in recollection that mr shaplow when reiterating the wish for self and friend to witness a display of his cunning with the fists had spoken the name of jarniman an unusual name yet more than one jarniman might well exist and unlikely that a friend of the pork butcher would be the person whom mr radnor first prohibited and then desired to receive it hardly mattered considering that the dutch navy did really incredible as it seems now come sailing a good way up the river thames into the very main artery of old england and what thought the tower of it skepsey looked at the tower in sympathy wondering whether the tower had seen those impudent dutch a nice people at home he had heard mr shaplow's jarniman might actually be mr radnor's he inclined to think at any rate he was now sure of the name chapter xi wherein we behold the couple justified of love having sight of their scourge fenellan in a musing exclamation that was quite spontaneous had put a picture on the departing skepsey as observed from an end of the lakelands upper terrace walk 'queer little water wagtail it is' and lady grace halley and miss graves and mrs cormyn snugly silken dry ones were so taken with the pretty likeness after hearing victor call the tripping dripping creature the happiest man in england that they nursed it in their minds for a bewick tailpiece to the chapter of a pleasant rural day it imbedded the day in an idea that it had been rural we are indebted almost for construction to those who will define us briefly we are but scattered leaves to the general comprehension of us until such a work of binding and labelling is done and should the definition be not so correct as brevity pretends to make it at one stroke we are at least rendered portable thus we pass into the conceptions of our fellows into the records down to posterity anecdotes of england's happiest man were related outlines of his personal history requested his nomination in chief among the traditionally very merry islanders was hardly borne out by the tale of his enchainment with a drunken yokefellow unless upon the durance version of the felicity of his countrymen still the water wagtail carried it skepsey trotted into memories heroes conducted up fame's temple steps by ceremonious historians who are studious when the platform is reached of the art of setting them beneath the flambeau of a final image before thrusting them inside to be rivetted on their pedestals have an excellent chance of doing the same let but the provident narrators direct that image to paint the thing a moth like humanity desires in the thing it shrinks from miss priscilla graves now fastened her meditations upon skepsey and it was important to him tobacco withdrew the haunting shadow of the rev septimus barmby from nesta she strolled beside louise de seilles to breathe sweet sweet in the dear friend's ear and tell her she loved her the presence of the german had without rousing animosity damped the young frenchwoman even to a revulsion when her feelings had been touched by hearing praise of her france and wounded by the subjects of the praise she bore the national scar which is barely skin clothing of a gash that will not heal since her country was overthrown and dismembered colney durance could excuse the unreasonableness in her for it had a dignity and she controlled it and quietly suffered trusting to the steady tireless concentrated aim of her france in the gallic mind of our time france appears as a prematurely buried glory that heaves the mound oppressing breath and cannot cease and calls hourly at times keenly to be remembered rescued from the pain and the mould spots of that foul sepulture mademoiselle and colney were friends partly divided by her speaking once of revanche whereupon he assumed the chair of the moralist with its right to lecture and went over to the enemy his talk savoured of a german our holding of the balance taking two sides is incomprehensible to a people quivering with the double wound to body and soul she was of breton blood cymric enough was in nesta to catch any thrill from her and join to her mood if it hung out a colour sad or gay and was noble as any mood of this dear louise would surely be nataly was not so sympathetic only the welsh and pure irish are quick at the feelings of the celtic french nataly came of a yorkshire stock she had the bravery humaneness and generous temper of our civilized north and a taste for mademoiselle's fine breeding with a distaste for the singular air of superiority in composure which it was granted to mademoiselle to wear with an unassailable reserve when the roughness of the commercial boor was obtrusive she said of her to colney as they watched the couple strolling by the lake below 'nesta brings her out of her frosts i suppose it's the presence of dr schlesien i have known it the same after an evening of wagner's music' 'richard wagner germanized ridicule of the french when they were down' said colney 'she comes of a blood that never forgives' 'never forgives is horrible to think of i fancied you liked your kelts as you call them' colney seized on a topic that shelved a less agreeable one that he saw coming 'you english won't descend to understand what does not resemble you the french are in a state of feverish patriotism you refuse to treat them for a case of fever they are lopped of a limb you tell them to be at rest' 'you know i am fond of them' 'and the kelts as they are called can't and won't forgive injuries look at ireland look at wales and the keltic scot have you heard them talk it happened in the year it's alive to them as if it were yesterday old history is as dead to the english as their first father they beg for the privilege of pulling the forelock to the bearers of the titles of the men who took their lands from them and turn them to the uses of cattle the saxon english had no doubt a heavier thrashing than any people allowed to subsist ever received you see it to this day the crick of the neck at the name of a lord is now concealed and denied but they have it and betray the effects and it's patent in their journals all over their literature where it's not seen another blood's at work the kelt won't accept the form of slavery let him be servile supple cunning treacherous and to appearance time serving he will always remember his day of manly independence and who robbed him he is the poetic animal of the races of modern men' 'you give him pagan colours' 'natural colours he does not offer the other cheek or turn his back to be kicked after a knock to the ground instead of asking him to forgive which he cannot do you must teach him to admire a mercantile community guided by political economy from the ledger to the banquet presided over by its dagon capital finds that difficult however there 's the secret of him that i respect in him his admiration of an enemy or oppressor doing great deeds wins him entirely he is an active spirit not your negative passive letter of scripture insensible and his faults short of ferocity are amusing' 'but the fits of ferocity' 'they are inconscient real fits they come of a hot nerve he is manageable sober too when his mind is charged as to the french people they are the most mixed of any european nation so they are packed with contrasts they are full of sentiment they are sharply logical free thinkers devotees affectionate ferocious frivolous tenacious the passion of the season operating like sun or moon on these qualities and they can reach to ideality out of sensualism below your level they're above it a paradox is at home with them' 'my friend you speak seriously an unusual compliment' nataly said and ungratefully continued 'you know what is occupying me i want your opinion i guess it i want to hear a mean thirst perhaps and you would pay me any number of compliments to avoid the subject but let me hear this house' colney shrugged in resignation 'victor works himself out' he replied 'we are to go through it all again' 'if you have not the force to contain him' 'how contain him' up went colney's shoulders 'you may see it all before you' he said 'straight as the seine chaussee from the hill of la roche guyon' he looked for her recollection of the scene 'ah the happy ramble that year' she cried 'and my nesta just seven we had been six months at craye every day of our life together looks happy to me looking back though i know that every day had the same troubles i don't think i'm deficient in courage i think i could meet but the false position so cruelly weakens me i am no woman's equal when i have to receive or visit it seems easier to meet the worst in life danger death anything pardon me for talking so perhaps we need not have left craye or creckholt' she hinted an interrogation 'though i am not sorry it is not good to be where one tastes poison here it may be as deadly worse dear friend i am so glad you remember la roche guyon he was popular with the dear french people' 'in spite of his accent' 'it is not so bad' 'and that you'll defend' 'consider these neighbours we come among they may have heard' 'act on the assumption' 'you forget the principal character victor promises he may have learnt a lesson at creckholt but look at this house he has built how can i any woman contain him he must have society' 'paraitre' 'he must be in the front he has talked of parliament' colney's liver took the thrust of a skewer through it he spoke as in meditative encomium 'his entry into parliament would promote himself and family to a station of eminence naked over the clock tower of the house' she moaned 'at the vilest i cannot regret my conduct bear what i may i can bear real pain what kills me is the suspicion and i feel it like a guilty wretch and i do not feel the guilt i should do the same again on reflection i do believe it saved him i do oh i do i do i cannot expect my family to see with my eyes you know them my brother and sisters think i have disgraced them they put no value on my saving him it sounds childish it is true he had fallen into a terrible black mood' 'he had an hour of gloom' 'an hour' 'but an hour with him it means a good deal' 'ah friend i take your words he sinks terribly when he sinks at all spare us a little while we have to judge of what is good in the circumstances i hear your reply but the principal for me to study is victor you have accused me of being the voice of the enamoured woman i follow him i know i try to advise i find it is wisdom to submit my people regard my behaviour as a wickedness or a madness i did save him i joined my fate with his i am his mate to help and i cannot oppose him to distract him i do my utmost for privacy he must entertain believe me i feel for them sisters and brother and now that my sisters are married my brother has a man's hardness' 'colonel dreighton did not speak harshly at our last meeting' 'he spoke of me' 'he spoke in the tone of a brother' 'victor promises i won't repeat it yes i see the house there appears to be a prospect a hope i cannot allude to it craye and creckholt may have been some lesson to him selwyn spoke of me kindly ah yes it is the way with my people to pretend that victor has been the ruin of me that they may come round to family sentiments in the same way his relatives the duvidney ladies have their picture of the woman misleading him imagine me the naughty adventuress' nataly falsified the thought insurgent at her heart in adding 'i do not say i am blameless' it was a concession to the circumambient enemy of whom even a good friend was apart and not better than a respectful emissary the dearest of her friends belonged to that hostile world only victor no other stood with her against the world her child yes the love of her child she had but the child's destiny was an alien phantom looking at her with harder eyes than she had vision of in her family she did not say she was blameless did not affect the thought she would have wished to say for small encouragement she would have said that her case could be pleaded colney's features were not inviting though the expression was not repellent she sighed deeply and to count on something helpful by mentioning it reverted to the 'prospect' which there appeared to be 'victor speaks of the certainty of his release' his release her language pricked a satirist's gallbladder colney refrained from speaking to wound and enjoyed a silence that did it 'do you see any possibility you knew her' she said coldly 'counting the number of times he has been expecting the release he is bound to believe it near at hand' 'you don't' she asked her bosom was up in a crisis of expectation for the answer and on a pause of half a minute she could have uttered the answer herself he perceived the insane eagerness through her mask and despised it pitying the woman 'and you don't' he said 'you catch at delusions to excuse the steps you consent to take or you want me to wear the blinkers the better to hoodwink your own eyes you see it as well as i if you enter that house you have to go through the same as at creckholt and he'll be the first to take fright' 'he finds you in tears he is immensely devoted he flings up all to protect his nataly' 'no you are unjust to him he would fling up all' 'but his nataly prefers to be dragged through fire as you please' she bowed to her chastisement one motive in her consultation with him came of the knowledge of his capacity to inflict it and his honesty in the act and a thirst she had to hear the truth loud tongued from him together with a feeling that he was excessive and satiric not to be read by the letter of his words and in consequence she could bear the lash from him and tell her soul that he overdid it and have an unjustly treated self to cherish but in very truth she was a woman who loved to hear the truth she was formed to love the truth her position reduced her to violate she esteemed the hearing it as medical to her she selected for counsellor him who would apply it so far she went on the straight way and the desire for a sustaining deception from the mouth of a trustworthy man set her hanging on his utterances with an anxious hope of the reverse of what was to come and what she herself apprehended such as checked her pulses and iced her feet and fingers the reason being not that she was craven or absurd or paradoxical but that living at an intenser strain upon her nature than she or any around her knew her strength snapped she broke down by chance there where colney was rendered spiteful in beholding the display of her inconsequent if not puling sex she might have sought his counsel on another subject if a paralyzing chill of her frame in the foreview of it had allowed her to speak she felt grave alarms in one direction where nesta stood in the eye of her father besides an unformed dread that the simplicity in generosity of victor's nature was doomed to show signs of dross ultimately under the necessity he imposed upon himself to run out his forecasts and scheme and defensively compel the world to serve his ends for the protection of those dear to him at night he was particularly urgent with her for the harmonious duet in praise of lakelands and plied her with questions all round and about it to bring out the dulcet accord he dwelt on his choice of costly marbles his fireplace and mantelpiece designs the great hall and suggestions for imposing and beautiful furniture concordantly enough for the large the lofty and rich of colour won her enthusiasm but overwhelmingly to any mood of resistance and strangely in a man who had of late been adopting as if his own a modern tone or the social and literary hints of it relating to the right uses of wealth and the duty as well as the delight of living simply 'fredi was pleased' 'yes she was dear' 'she is our girl my love i could live and die here live she may there's room enough' nataly saw the door of a covert communication pointed at in that remark she gathered herself for an effort to do battle 'she's quite a child victor' 'the time begins to run we have to look forward now i declare it's i who seem the provident mother for fredi' 'let our girl wait don't hurry her mind to she is happy with her father and mother she is in the happiest time of her life before those feelings distract' 'if we see good fortune for her we can't let it pass her' a pang of the resolution now to debate the case with victor which would be of necessity to do the avoided thing and roll up the forbidden curtain opening on their whole history past and prospective was met in nataly's bosom by the more bitter immediate confession that she was not his match to speak would be to succumb and shamefully after the effort and hopelessly after being overborne by him there was not the anticipation of a set contest to animate the woman's naturally valiant heart he was too strong and his vividness in urgency overcame her in advance fascinated her sensibility through recollection he fanned an inclination lighted it to make it a passion a frenzied resolve she remembered how and when she had quivering cause to remember the fateful day of her step in a letter received that morning from a married sister containing no word of endearment or proposal for a meeting an unregretted day if victor would think of the dues to others that is would take station with the world to see his reflected position instead of seeing it through their self justifying knowledge of the honourable truth of their love and pressing to claim and snatch at whatsoever the world bestows on its orderly subjects they had done evil to no one as yet nataly thought that not withstanding the outcry of the ancient and withered woman who bore victor radnor's name for whom in consequence of the rod the woman had used this tenderest of hearts could summon no emotion if she had it the thing was not to be hauled up to consciousness her feeling was that she forgave the wrinkled malignity pity and contrition dissolving in the effort to produce the placable forgiveness she was frigid because she knew rightly of herself that she in the place of power would never have struck so meanly but the mainspring of the feeling in an almost remorseless bosom drew from certain chance expressions of retrospective physical distaste on victor's part hard to keep from a short utterance between the nuptial two of whom the unshamed exuberant male has found the sweet reverse in his mate a haven of heavenliness to delight in these conjoined with a woman's unspoken pleading ideas of her own on her own behalf had armed her jealously in vindication of nature now as long as they did no palpable wrong about them nataly could argue her case in her conscience deep down and out of hearing where women under scourge of the laws they have not helped decree may and do deliver their minds she stood in that subterranean recess for nature against the institutions of man a woman little adapted for the post of revel but to this by the agency of circumstances it had come she who was designed by nature to be an ornament of those institutions opposed them and when thinking of the rights and the conduct of the decrepit legitimate virulent in a heathen vindictiveness declaring itself holy she had nature's logic nature's voice for self defence it was eloquent with her to the deafening of other voices in herself even to the convincing of herself when she was wrought by the fires within to feel elementally the other voices within her issued of the acknowledged dues to her family and to the world the civilization protecting women sentences thereanent in modern books and journals but the remembrance of moods of fiery exaltation when the nature she called by name of love raised the chorus within to stop all outer buzzing was in a perpetual struggle with a whirlpool a constant support while she and victor were one at heart the sense of her standing alone made her sway and a thought of differences with him caused frightful apprehensions of the abyss luxuriously she applied to his public life for witness that he had governed wisely as well as affectionately so long and he might therefore with the chorussing of the world of public men expect a woman blindfold to follow his lead but no we may be rebels against our time and its laws if we are really for nature we are not lawless nataly's untutored scruples which came side by side with her ability to plead for her acts restrained her from complicity in the ensnaring of a young man of social rank to espouse the daughter of a couple socially insurgent stained to common thinking should denunciation come the nature upholding her fled at a vision of a stranger entangled pitiable to reflect that he was not one of the adventurer lords of prey who hunt and run down shadowed heiresses and are congratulated on their luck in a tolerating country how was the young man to be warned how under the happiest of suppositions propitiate his family and such a family if consenting with knowledge would consent only for the love of money it was angling with as vile a bait as the rascal lord's humiliation hung on the scheme it struck to scorching in the contemplation of it and it darkened her reading of victor's character she did not ask for the specification of a 'good fortune that might pass' wishing to save him from his wonted twists of elusiveness and herself with him from the dread discussion it involved upon one point 'the day was pleasant to all except perhaps poor mademoiselle' she said 'peridon should have come' 'present or absent his chances are not brilliant i fear' 'and pempton and priscy' 'they are growing cooler' 'with their grotesque objections to one another's habits at table' 'can we ever hope to get them over it' 'when priscy drinks port and pempton munches beef colney says' 'i should say when they feel warmly enough to think little of their differences' 'fire smoothes the creases yes and fire is what they're both wanting in though priscy has concert pathos in her voice couldn't act a bit and pempton's 'cello tones now and then have gone through me simply from his fiddle bow i believe don't talk to me of feeling in a couple within reach of one another and sniffing objections good then for a successful day to day so far' he neared her wooing her and she assented with a franker smile than she had worn through the day the common burden on their hearts the simple discussion to come of the task of communicating dire actualities to their innocent nesta was laid aside chapter xii treats of the dumbness possible with members of a household having one heart two that live together in union are supposed to be intimate on every leaf particularly when they love one another and the cause they have at heart is common to them in equal measure the uses of a cordial familiarity forbid reserves upon important matters between them as we think not thinking of an imposed secretiveness beneath the false external of submissiveness which comes of an experience of repeated inefficiency to maintain a case in opposition on the part of the loquently weaker of the pair in constitutional kingdoms a powerful government needs not to be tyrannical to lean oppressively it is more serviceable to party than agreeable to country and where the alliance of men and women binds a loving couple of whom one is a torrent of persuasion their differings are likely to make the other resemble a log of the torrent it is borne along it dreams of a distant corner of the way for a determined stand it consents to its whirling in anticipation of an undated hour when it will no longer be neutral there may be moreover while each has the key of the fellow breast a mutually sensitive nerve to protest against intrusion of light or sound the cloud over the name of their girl could now strike nataly and victor dumb in their taking of counsel she divined that his hint had encouraged him to bring the crisis nearer and he that her comprehension had become tremblingly awake they shrank each of them the more from an end drawing closely into view all subjects glooming off or darkening up to it were shunned by them verbally and if they found themselves entering beneath that shadow conversation passed to an involuntary gesture more explicit with him significant of the prohibited though not acknowledging it all the stronger was it victor's purpose leaping in his fashion to the cover of action as an escape from perplexity to burn and scheme for the wedding of their girl the safe wedding of that dearest to have her protected secure with the world warm about her and he well knew why his nataly had her look of a closed vault threatening if opened to thunder upon life when he dropped his further hints he chose to call it feminine inconsistency in a woman who walked abroad with a basket of marriage ties for the market on her arm he knew that she would soon have to speak the dark words to their girl and the idea of any doing of it caught at his throat reasonably she dreaded the mother's task pardonably indeed but it is for the mother to do with a girl he deputed it lightly to the mother because he could see himself stating the facts to a son 'and my dear boy you will from this day draw your five thousand a year and we double it on the day of your marriage living at lakelands or where you will' his desire for his girl's protection by the name of one of our great families urged him to bind nataly to the fact with the argument that it was preferable for the girl to hear their story during her green early youth while she reposed her beautiful blind faith in the discretion of her parents and as an immediate step to the placing of her hand in a husband's he feared that her mother required schooling to tell the story vindicatingly and proudly in a manner to distinguish instead of degrading or temporarily seeming to accept degradation the world would weigh on her confession of the weight of the world on her child she would want inciting and strengthening if one judged of her capacity to meet the trial by her recent bearing and how was he to do it he could not imagine himself encountering the startled tremulous nascent intelligence in those pure brown darklashed eyes of nesta he pitied the poor mother fancifully directing her to say this and that to the girl his tongue ran till it was cut from his heart and left to wag dead colourless words the prospect of a similar business of exposition certainly devolving upon the father in treaty with the fortunate youth gripped at his vitals a minute so intense was his pride in appearing woundless and scarless a shining surface like pure health's in the sight of men nevertheless he skimmed the story much as a lecturer strikes his wand on the prominent places of a map that is to show us how he arrived at the principal point which we are all agreed to find chiefly interesting this with victor was the naming of nesta's bridal endowment he rushed to it 'my girl will have ten thousand a year settled on her the day of her marriage' choice of living at lakelands was offered it helped him over the unpleasant part of that interview at the same time it moved him to a curious contempt of the youth he had to conjure up an image of the young man in person to correct the sentiment and it remained as a kind of bruise only half cured mr dudley sowerby was not one of the youths whose presence would rectify such an abstract estimate of the genus pursuer he now came frequently of an evening to practise a duet for flutes with victor a mercadante honeyed and flowing too honeyed to suit a style that as fenellan characterized it to nataly went through the music somewhat like an inquisitive tourist in a foreign town conscientious to get to the end of the work of pleasure until the notes had become familiar when it rather resembled a constable's walk along the midnight streets into collision with a garlanded roysterer and the man of order and the man of passion true to the measure though they were seeming to dissent almost to wrangle in their different ways of winding out the melody on to the last movement which was plainly a question between home to the strayed reveller's quarters or off to the lockup victor was altogether the younger of the two but his vehement accompaniment was a tutorship mr sowerby improved it was admitted by nesta and mademoiselle that he gained a show of feeling he had learnt that feeling was wanted passion he had not a notion of otherwise he would not be delaying the interview dramatized by the father of the young bud of womanhood would be taking place and the entry into lakelands calculable for nataly's comfort as under the aegis of the cantor earldom gossip flies to a wider circle round the members of a great titled family is inaudible or no longer the diptherian whisper the commonalty hear of the commonalty and so we see the social uses of our aristocracy survive we do not want the shield of any family it is the situation that wants it nataly ought to be awake to the fact one blow and we have silenced our enemy nesta's wedding day has relieved her parents victor's thoughts upon the instrument for striking that blow led him to suppose mr sowerby might be meditating on the extent of the young lady's fortune he talked randomly of money in a way to shatter nataly's conception of him he talked of city affairs at table as it had been his practice to shun the doing and hit the resounding note on mines which have risen in the market like the crest of a serpent casting a certain spell upon the mercantile understanding 'fredi's diamonds from her own mine or what once was and she still reserves a share' were to be shown to mr sowerby nataly respected the young fellow for not displaying avidity at the flourish of the bait however it might be affecting him and she fancied that he did laboriously in his way earnestly study her girl to sound for harmony between them previous to a wooing she was a closer reader of social character than victor from refraining to run on the broad lines which are but faintly illustrative of the individual one in being common to all unless we have hit by chance on an example of the downright in roguery or folly or simple goodness mr sowerby'g bearing to nesta was hardly warmed by the glitter of diamonds his next visit showed him livelier in courtliness brighter fresher but that was always his way at the commencement of every visit as if his reflections on the foregone had come to a satisfactory conclusion and the labours of the new study of the maiden ensued again in due course to deaden him gentleman he was in the recognition of his quality as a man of principle and breeding nataly was condemned by thoughts of nesta's future to question whether word or act of hers should if inclination on both sides existed stand between her girl and a true gentleman she counselled herself as if the counsel were in requisition to be passive and so doing she more acutely than victor save in his chance flashes discerned the twist of her very nature caused by their false position and her panacea for ills the lost little cottage would not have averted it she would there have had the same coveting desire to name a man of breeding honour station for nesta's husband perhaps in the cottage choosing at leisure her consent to see the brilliant young creature tied to the best of dull men would have been unready without the girl to push it for the hon dudley was lamentably her pupil in liveliness he took the second part as it is painful for a woman with the old fashioned ideas upon the leading of the sexes to behold resembling in his look the deaf who constantly require to have an observation repeated resembling the most intelligent of animals which we do not name and we reprove ourselves for seeing likeness yet the likeness or apparent likeness would suggest that we have not so much to fear upon the day of the explanation to him some gain is there shameful thought nataly hastened her mind to gather many instances or indications testifying to the sterling substance in young mr sowerby such as a mother would pray for her son in law to possess she discovered herself feeling as the burdened mother not providently for her girl in the choice of a mate the perception was clear and not the less did she continue working at the embroidery of mr sowerby on the basis of his excellent moral foundations all the while hoping praying that he might not be lured on to the proposal for nesta but her subservience to the power of the persuasive will in victor which was like the rush of a conflagration compelled her to think realizingly of any scheme he allowed her darkly to read opposition to him was comparable to the stand of blocks of timber before flame colney durance had done her the mischief we take from the pessimist when we are overweighted in darkening the vision of external aid from man or circumstance to one who felt herself mastered victor could make her treacherous to her wishes in revolt against them though the heart protested his first conquest of her was in her blood to weaken a spirit of resistance for the precedent of submission is a charm upon the faint hearted through love it unwinds unwills them nataly resolved fixedly that there must be a day for speaking and she had her moral sustainment in the resolve she had also a tormenting consciousness of material support in the thought that the day was not present was possibly distant might never arrive would victor's release come sooner and that was a prospect bearing resemblance to hopes of the cure of a malady through a sharp operation these were matters going on behind the curtain as wholly vital to her and with him at times almost as dominant as the spiritual in memory when flesh has left but its shining track in dust of a soul outwritten and all their talk related to the purchase of furniture the expeditions to lakelands music public affairs the pardonable foibles of friends created to amuse their fellows operatic heroes and heroines exhibitions of pictures the sorrows of crowned heads so serviceable ever to mankind as an admonition to the ambitious a salve to the envious in fine whatsoever can entertain or affect the most social of couples domestically without a care to appearance and so far they partially dramatically deceived themselves by imposing on the world while they talked and duetted for the purchase of furniture from a flowing purse is a cheerful occupation also a city issuing out of hospital like this poor city of london inspires good citizens to healthy activity but the silence upon what they were most bent on had the sinister effect upon victor of obscuring his mental hold of the beloved woman drifting her away from him in communicating fenellan's news through the lawyer carling of mrs burman's intentions he was aware that there was an obstacle to his being huggingly genial even candidly genial with her until he could deal out further news corroborative and consecutive to show the action of things as progressive fenellan had sunk into his usual apathy and might plead the impossibility of his moving faster than the woman professing to transform herself into beneficence out of malignity one could hear him saying the words victor had not seen him since last concert evening and he deemed it as well to hear the words fenellan's mouth had to say he called at an early hour of the westward tidal flow at the insurance office looking over the stormy square of the first of seamen chapter xiii the latest of mrs burman after cursory remarks about the business of the office and his friend's contributions to periodical literature in which he was interested for as long as he had assurance that the safe income depending upon official duties was not endangered by them victor kicked his heels to and fro fenellan waited for him to lead 'have you seen that man her lawyer again' 'i have dined with mr carling capital claret' emptiness was in the reply victor curbed himself and said 'by the way you're not likely to have dealings with blathenoy the fellow has a screw to the back of a shifty eye i see it at work to fix the look for business i shall sit on the board of my bank one hears things he lives in style at wrensham by the way fredi has little mab mountney from creckholt staying with her you said of little mabsy here she comes into the room all pink and white like a daisy she's the daisy still reminds us of our girl at that age so then we come to another dead block' 'well no it's a chemist's shop if that helps us on' said fenellan settling to a new posture in his chair 'she's there of an afternoon for hours' 'you mean it's she' 'the lady i 'll tell you i have it from carling worthy man and lawyers can be brought to untruss a point over a cup of claret he's a bit of a mackenzie man as old aunts of mine used to say at home a man of feeling thinks he knows the world from having sifted and sorted a lot of our dustbins as the modern realists imagine it's an exposition of positive human nature when they've pulled down our noses to the worst parts if there's a worse where all are useful but the realism of the dogs is to have us by the nose excite it and befoul it and you're fearfully credible you don't read that olfactory literature however friend carling is a conciliatory carle three or four days of the week the lady he says drives to her chemist's and there she sits in the shop round the corner as you enter and sees all charing in the shop looking glass at the back herself a stranger spectacle poor lady if carling's picture of her is not overdone with her fashionable no bonnet striding the contribution chignon on the crown and a huge square green shade over her forehead sits hours long and cocks her ears at orders of applicants for drugs across the counter and sometimes catches wind of a prescription and consults her chemist and thinks she 'll try it herself it's a basket of medicine bottles driven to regent's park pretty well every day' 'ha regent's park' exclaimed victor and shook at recollections of the district and the number of the house dismal to him london buried the woman deep until a mention of her sent her flaring over london 'a chemist's shop she sits there' 'mrs burman we pass by the shop' 'she had always a turn for drugs not far from here did you say and every day under a green shade' 'dear fellow don't be suggesting ballads we'll go now' said fenellan 'it 's true it's like sitting on the banks of the stygian waters' he spied at an obsequious watch that told him it was time to quit the office 'you've done nothing' victor asked in a tone of no expectation 'only to hear that her latest medical man is themison' 'where did you hear' 'across the counter of boyle and luckwort the lady's chemists i called the day before yesterday after you were here at our last board meeting' 'the themison' 'the great dr themison who kills you kindlier than most and is much in request for it' 'there's one of your echoes of colney' victor cried 'one gets dead sick of that worn out old jibeing at doctors they don't kill you know very well it 's not to their interest to kill they may take the relish out of life and upon my word i believe that helps to keep the patient living' fenellan sent an eye of discreet comic penetration travelling through his friend 'the city's mending it's not the weary widow woman of the day when we capsized the diurnal with your royal old veuve' he said as they trod the pavement 'funny people the english they give you all the primeing possible for amusement and jollity and devil a sentry box for the exercise of it and if you shake a leg publicly partner or not you're marched off to penitence i complain that they have no philosophical appreciation of human nature' 'we pass the shop' victor interrupted him 'you're in view of it in a minute and what a square for recreative dancing and what a people to be turning it into a place of political agitation and what a country where from morning to night it's an endless wrangle about the first conditions of existence old colney seems right now and then they 're the offspring of pirates and they 've got the manners and tastes of their progenitors and the trick of quarrelling everlastingly over the booty i 'd have band music here for a couple of hours three days of the week at the least and down in the east and that forsaken north quarter of london and the baptist south too but just as those omnibus wheels are the miserable music of this london of ours it 's only too sadly true that the people are in the first rumble of the notion of the proper way to spend their lives now you see the shop boyle and luckwort there' victor looked he threw his coat open and pulled the waistcoat and swelled it ahemming 'that shop' said he and presently 'fenellan i'm not superstitious i think now listen i declare to you on the day of our drinking old veuve together last you remember it i walked home up this way across the square and i was about to step into that identical shop for some household prescription in my pocket having forgotten nataly's favourite city chemists fenbird and jay when i'm stating a fact i distinctly i 'm sure of the shop felt myself plucked back by the elbow pulled back the kind of pull when you have to put a foot backward to keep your equilibrium' so does memory inspired by the sensations contribute an additional item for the colouring of history he touched the elbow showed a flitting face of crazed amazement in amusement and shrugged and half laughed dismissing the incident as being perhaps if his hearer chose to have it so a gem of the rubbish tumbled into the dustcart out of a rather exceptional householder's experience fenellan smiled indulgently 'queer things happen i recollect reading in my green youth of a clergyman who mounted a pulpit of the port where he was landed after his almost solitary rescue from a burning ship at midnight in mid sea to inform his congregation that he had overnight of the catastrophe a personal warning right in his ear from a voice when at his bed or bunk side about to perform the beautiful ceremony of undressing and the rev gentleman was to lie down in his full uniform not so much as to relieve himself of his boots the voice insisted twice and he obeyed it despite the discomfort to his poor feet and he jumped up in his boots to the cry of fire and he got them providentially over the scuffling deck straight at the first rush into the boat awaiting them and had them safe on and polished the day he preached the sermon of gratitude for the special deliverance there was a warning and it might well be called as he called it from within we're cared for never doubt aide toi be ready dressed to help yourself in a calamity or you'll not stand in boots at your next sermon contrasting with the burnt that sounds like the moral' 'she could have seen me' victor threw out an irritable suggestion the idea of the recent propinquity set hatred in motion 'scarcely likely i'm told she sits looking on her lap under the beetling shade until she hears an order for tinctures or powders or a mixture that strikes her fancy it's possible to do more suicidal things than sit the afternoons in a chemist's shop and see poor creatures get their different passports to orcus' victor stepped mutely beneath the windows of the bellied glass urns of chemical wash the woman might be inside there now she might have seen his figure in the shop mirror and she there the wonder of it all seemed to be that his private history was not walking the streets the thinness of the partition concealing it hardly guaranteed a day's immunity because this woman would live in london in order to have her choice of a central chemist's shop where she could feed a ghastly imagination on the various recipes and while it would have been so much healthier for her to be living in a recess of the country he muttered 'diseases drugs' those were the corresponding two strokes of the pendulum which kept the woman going 'and deadly spite' that was the emanation of the monotonous horrible conflict for which and by which the woman lived in the neighbourhood of the shop he could not but think of her through the feelings of a man scorched by a furnace a little further on he said 'poor soul' he confessed to himself that latterly he had he knew not why been impatient with her rancorous in thought as never before he had hitherto aimed at a picturesque tolerance of her vindictiveness under suffering both at craye and creckholt and he had been really forgiving he accused her of dragging him down to humanity's lowest but if she did that it argued the possession of a power of a sort her station in the chemist's shop he passed almost daily appeared to him as a sudden and a terrific rush to the front though it was only a short drive from the house in regent's park but having shaken off that house he had pushed it back into mists obliterated it the woman certainly had a power he shot away to the power he knew of in himself his capacity for winning men in bodies the host of them when it came to an effort of his energies men and individually women individually the women were to be counted on as well warm supporters it was the admission of a doubt that he might expect to enroll them collectively eyeing the men he felt his command of them glancing at congregated women he had a chill the wives and spinsters in ghostly judicial assembly that is the phantom of the offended collective woman that is the regnant queen idea issuing from our concourse of civilized life to govern society and pronounce on the orderly the tolerable the legal and banish the rebellious these maintained an aspect of the stand against him did nataly read the case namely that the crowned collective woman is not to be subdued and what are we to say of the indefinite but forcible authority when we see it upholding mrs burman to crush a woman like nataly victor's novel exercises in reflection were bringing him by hard degrees to conceive it to be the impalpable which has prevailing weight not many of our conquerors have scored their victories on the road of that index nor has duration been granted them to behold the minute measure of value left even tangible after the dust of the conquest subsides the passing by a shop where a broken old woman might be supposed to sit beneath her green forehead shade venetian blind of a henbane visage had precipitated him into his first real grasp of the abstract verity and it opens on to new realms which are a new world to the practical mind but he made no advance he stopped in a fever of sensibility to contemplate the powerful formless vapour rolling from a source that was nothing other than yonder weak lonely woman in other words the human nature of the man was dragged to the school of its truancy by circumstances for him to learn the commonest of sums done on a slate in regard to payment of debts and the unrelaxing grip of the creditor on the defaulter debtors are always paying like those who are guilty of the easiest thing in life the violation of truth they have made themselves bondmen to pay if not in substance then in soul and the nipping of the soul goes on for as long as the concrete burden is undischarged you know the liar you must have seen him diminishing until he has become a face without features withdrawn to humanity's preliminary sketch some half dozen frayed threads of woeful outline on our original tapestry web and he who did the easiest of things he must from such time sweat in being the prodigy of inventive nimbleness up to the day when he propitiates truth by telling it again there is a repentance that does reconstitute it may help to the traceing to springs of a fable whereby men have been guided thus far out of the wood victor would have said truly that he loved truth that he paid every debt with a scrupulous exactitude money of course and prompt apologies for a short brush of his temper nay he had such a conscience for the smallest eruptions of a transient irritability that the wish to say a friendly mending word to the punctilio donkey of london bridge softened his retrospective view of the fall there more than once although this man was a presentation to mankind of the force in nature which drives to unresting speed which is the vitality of the heart seen at its beating after a plucking of it from the body he knew himself for the reverse of lawless he inclined altogether to good citizenship so social a man could not otherwise incline but when it came to the examination of accounts between mrs burman and himself spasms of physical revulsion loathings his excessive human nature put her out of court to men it was impossible for him to speak the torments of those days of the monstrous alliance the heavens were cognizant he pleaded his case in their accustomed hearing a youngster tempted by wealth attracted besought snared revolted etc and mrs burman when roused to jealousy had shown it by teazing him for a confession of his admiration of splendid points in the beautiful nataly the priceless fair woman living under their roof a contrast of very life with the corpse and shroud and she seen by him daily singing with him her breath about him her voice incessantly upon every chord of his being he pleaded successfully but the silence following the verdict was heavy the silence contained an unheard thunder it was the sound as when out of court the public is dissatisfied with a verdict are we expected to commit a social outrage in exposing our whole case to the public imagine it for a moment as done men are ours at a word or at least a word of invitation women we woo fluent smooth versions of our tortures mixed with permissible courtship win the individual woman and that unreasoning collective woman icy deadly condemns the poor racked wretch who so much as remembers them she is the enemy of nature tell us how she is the slave of existing conventions and from what cause she is the artificial production of a state that exalts her so long as she sacrifices daily and hourly to the artificial therefore she sides with mrs burman the foe of nature who with her arts and gold lures has now possession of the law the brass idol worshipped by the collective to drive nature into desolation he placed himself to the right of mrs burman for the world to behold the couple and he lent the world a sigh of disgust what he could not do as in other matters he did was to rise above the situation in a splendid survey and rapid view of the means of reversing it he was too social to be a captain of the socially insurgent imagination expired but having a courageous nataly to second him how then it was the succour needed then he would have been ready to teach the world that nature honest nature is more to be prized than convention a new era might begin the thought was tonic for an instant and illuminated him springingly it sank excused for the flaccidity by nataly's want of common adventurous daring she had not taken to lakelands she was purchasing furniture from a flowing purse with a heavy heart unfeminine one might say she preferred to live obscurely she did not one had to think but it was unjust and yet the accusation that she did not cheerfully make a strain and spurt on behalf of her child pressed to be repeated these short glimpses at reflection in victor were like the verberant twang of a musical instrument that has had a smart blow and wails away independent of the player's cunning hand he would have said that he was more his natural self when the cunning hand played on him to make him praise and uplift his beloved mightily would it have astonished him to contemplate with assured perception in his own person the nature he invoked but men invoking nature do not find in her the holy mother she in such case becomes to her daughters whom she so persecutes men call on her for their defence as a favourable witness she is a note of their rhetoric they are not bettered by her sustainment they have not as women may have her enaemic aid at a trying hour it is not an effort at epigram to say that whom she scourges most she most supports an opera placard drew his next remark to fenellan 'how wagner seems to have stricken the italians well now the germans have their emperor to head their armies and i say that the german emperor has done less for their lasting fame and influence than wagner has done he has affected the french too i trace him in gounod's romeo et juliette and we don't gain by it we have a poor remuneration for the melody gone think of the little shepherd's pipeing in mireille and there's another in sapho delicious i held out against wagner as long as i could the italians don't much more than wagnerize in exchange for the loss of melody they would be wiser in going back to pergolese campagnole the mefistofole was good of the school of the foreign master aida and otello no i confess to a weakness for the old barleysugar of bellini or a donizetti serenade aren't you seduced by cadences never mind wagner's tap of his paedagogue's baton a cadence catches me still early taste for barley sugar perhaps there's a march in verdi's attila and i lombardi i declare i'm in military step when i hear them as in the old days after leaving the opera fredi takes little mab mountney to her first opera to night enough to make us old ones envious you remember your first opera fenellan sonnambula with me i tell you it would task the highest poetry say require if you like showing all that's noblest splendidest in a young man to describe its effect on me i was dreaming of my box at the opera for a year after the huguenots to night not the best suited for little mabsy but she'll catch at the rataplan capital opera we used to think it the best before we had tannhauser and lohengrin and the meistersinger' victor hinted notes of the conspiration scene closing the third act of the huguenots that sombre chorus brought mrs burman before him he drummed the rataplan which sent her flying the return of a lively disposition for dinner and music completed his emancipation from the yoke of the baleful creature sitting half her days in the chemist's shop save that a thought of drugs brought the smell and the smell the picture she threatened to be an apparition at any moment pervading him through his nostrils he spoke to fenellan of hunger for dinner a need for it singular in one whose appetite ran to the stroke of the hour abreast with armandine's kitchen clock fenellan proposed a glass of sherry and bitters at his club over the way he had forgotten a shower of black balls attributable to the conjurations of old ate on a certain past day without word of refusal victor entered a wine merchant's office where he was unknown and stating his wish for bitters and dry sherry presently received the glass drank nodded to the administering clerk named the person whom he had obliged and refreshed and passed out remarking to fenellan 'colney on clubs he's right they're the mediaeval in modern times our baron's castles minus the baron dead against public life and social duties business excuses my city clubs but i shall take my name off my club up west' 'more like monasteries with a committee for abbot and whist for the services' fenellan said 'or tabernacles for the chosen and grangousier playing divinity behind the veil well they're social' 'sectionally social means anything but social my friend however and the monastery had a bell for the wanderer say i'm penniless or poundless up and down this walled desert of a street i feel i must feel these palaces if we're christian not jews not that the jews are uncharitable they set an example in fact' he rambled amusingly to the complacent hearing of fenellan who thought of his pursuit of wealth and grand expenditure victor talked as a man having his mind at leaps beyond the subject he was nearing to the idea he had seized and lost on london bridge the desire for some good news wherewith to inspirit nataly withdrew him from his ineffectual chase he had nought to deliver on the contrary a meditation concerning her comfort pledged him to concealment which was the no step or passive state most abhorrent to him he snatched at the name of themison with dr themison fast in his grasp there was a report of progress to be made to nataly and not at all an empty report themison then he leaned on themison the woman's doctor should have an influence approaching to authority with her land values in the developing colonies formed his theme of discourse to fenellan let banks beware fenellan saw him shudder and rub the back of his head 'feel the wind' he said victor answered him with that humane thrill of the deep tones which at times he had 'no don't be alarmed i feel the devil if one has wealth and a desperate wish he will speak all he does is to make me more charitable to those who give way to him i believe in a devil' 'horns and tail' 'bait and hook' 'i haven't wealth and i wish only for dinner' fenellan said 'you know that armandine is never two minutes late by the way you haven't wealth you have me' 'and i thank god for you' said fenellan acutely reminiscent of his having marked the spiritual adviser of mrs burman the rev groseman buttermore as a man who might be useful to his friend chapter xiv discloses a stage on the drive to paris a fortnight later an extremely disconcerting circumstance occurred armandine was ten minutes behind the hour with her dinner but the surprise and stupefaction expressed by victor after glances at his watch were not so profound as fenellan's on finding himself exchangeing the bow with a gentleman bearing the name of dr themison his friend's rapidity in pushing the combinations he conceived was known fenellan's wonder was not so much that victor had astonished him again as that he should be called upon again to wonder at his astonishment he did and he observed the doctor and victor and nataly aided by dropping remarks before the evening was over he gathered enough of the facts and had to speculate only on the designs dr themison had received a visit from the husband of mrs victor radnor concerning her state of health at an interview with the lady laughter greeted him he was confused by her denial of the imputation of a single ailment but she to recompose him let it be understood that she was anxious about her husband's condition he being certainly overworked and the husband's visit passed for a device on the part of the wife she admitted a willingness to try a change of air if it was deemed good for her husband change of air was prescribed to each for both 'why not drive to paris' the doctor said and victor was taken with the phrase he told fenellan at night that mrs burman he had heard was by the sea on the south coast which of her maladies might be in the ascendant he did not know he knew little he fancied that dr themison was unsuspicious of the existence of a relationship between him and mrs burman and fenellan opined that there had been no communication upon private affairs what then was the object in going to dr themison he treated her body merely whereas the rev groseman buttermore could be expected to impose upon her conduct fenellan appreciated his own discernment of the superior uses to which a spiritual adviser may be put and he too agreeably flattered himself for the corrective reflection to ensue that he had not done anything it disposed him to think a happy passivity more sagacious than a restless activity we should let fortune perform her part at the wheel in working out her ends should we not for ten to one nine times out of ten we are thwarting her if we stretch out a hand and with the range of enjoyments possessed by victor why this unceasing restlessness why when we are not near drowning catch at apparent straws which may be instruments having sharp edges themison as mrs burman's medical man might tell the lady tales that would irritate her bag of venom rarely though fenellan was the critic on his friend the shadow cast over his negligent hedonism by victor's boiling pressure drove him into the seat of judgement as a consequence he was rather a dull table guest in the presence of dr themison whom their host had pricked to anticipate high entertainment from him he did nothing to bridge the crevasse and warm the glacier air at table when the doctor anecdotal intentionally to draw him out related a decorous but pungent story of one fair member of a sweet new sisterhood in agitation against the fixed establishment of our chain mail marriage tie an anecdote of immediate diversion was wanted expected and fenellan sat stupidly speculating upon whether the doctor knew of a cupboard locked so that dr themison was carried on by lady grace halley's humourous enthusiasm for the subject to dilate and discuss and specify all in the irony of a judicial leaning to the side of the single minded social adventurers under an assumed accord with his audience concluding 'so there's an end of divorce' 'by the trick of multiplication' fenellan now reassured was content to say and that did not extinguish the cracker of a theme handled very carefully as a thing of fire it need scarce be remarked three young women being present nataly had eyes on her girl and was pleased at an alertness shown by mr sowerby to second her by crossing the dialogue as regarded her personal feelings she was hardened so long as the curtains were about her to keep the world from bending black brows of inquisition upon one of its culprits but her anxiety was vigilant to guard her girl from an infusion of any of the dread facts of life not coming through the mother's lips and she was a woman having the feminine mind's pudency in that direction which does not consent to the revealing of much here was the mother's dilemma her girl victor's girl as she had to think in this instance the most cloudless of the young women of earth seemed and might be figured as really at the falling of a crumb off the table of knowledge taken by the brain to shoot up to terrific heights of surveyal and there she rocked and only her youthful healthiness brought her down to grass and flowers she had once or twice received the electrical stimulus to feel and be as lightning from a seizure of facts in infinitesimal doses guesses caught off maternal evasions or the circuitous explanation of matters touching sex in here and there a newspaper harder to repress completely than sewer gas in great cities and her mother had seen with an apprehensive pang of anguish how witheringly the scared young intelligence of the innocent creature shocked her sensibility she foresaw the need to such a flameful soul as bride wife woman across the world of the very princeliest of men in gifts of strength for her sustainer and guide and the provident mother knew this peerless gentleman but he had his wife delusions and the pain of the disillusioning were to be feared for the imaginative nesta though not so much as that on some future day of a perchance miserable yokemating a subjection or an entanglement the nobler passions might be summoned to rise for freedom and strike a line to make their logically estimable sequence from a source not honourable before the public constantly it had to be thought that the girl was her father's child at present she had no passions and her bent to the happiness she could so richly give had drawn her sailing smoothly over the harbour bar of maidenhood where many of her sisters are disconcerted to the loss of simplicity if nataly with her sleepless watchfulness and forecasts partook of the french mother nesta's arcadian independence likened her somewhat in manner to the transatlantic version of the english girl her high physical animation and the burden of themes it plucked for delivery carried her flowing over impediments of virginal self consciousness to set her at her ease in the talk with men she had not gone through the various nursery exercises in dissimulation she had no appearance of praying forgiveness of men for the original sin of being woman and no tricks of lips or lids or traitor scarlet on the cheeks or assumptions of the frigid mask or indicated reserve cajoleries neither ignorantly nor advisedly did she play on these or other bewitching strings of her sex after the fashion of the stamped innocents who are the boast of englishmen and matrons and thrill societies with their winsome ingenuousness and who sometimes when unguarded meet an artful serenader that is a cloaked bandit and is provoked by their performances and knows anthropologically the nature behind the devious show a sciential rascal as little to be excluded from our modern circles as eve's own old deuce from eden's garden whereupon opportunity inviting both the fool and the cunning the pure donkey princess of insular eulogy and the sham one are in a perilous pass damsels of the swiftness of mind of nesta cannot be ignorant utterly amid a world where the hints are hourly scattering seed of the inklings when vileness is not at work up and down our thoroughfares proclaiming its existence with tableau and trumpet nataly encountered her girl's questions much as one seeks to quiet an enemy the questions had soon ceased excepting repulsive and rejected details there is little to be learnt when a little is known in populous communities density only will keep the little out only stupidity will suppose that it can be done for the livelier young english mothers forethoughtful for their girls have to take choice of how to do battle with a rough and tumble old england that lumbers bumping along craving the precious things which can be had but in semblance under the conditions allowed by laziness to subsist and so curst of its shifty inconsequence as to worship in the concrete an hypocrisy it abhors in the abstract nataly could smuggle or confiscate here and there a newspaper she could not interdict or withhold every one of them from a girl ardent to be in the race on all topics of popular interest and the newspapers are occasionally naked savages the streets are imperfectly garmented even by day and we have our stumbling social anecdotist our spot mouthed young man our eminently silly woman our slippery one our slimy one the rahab of society not to speak of mary the maid and the footman william a vigilant mother has to contend with these and the like in an increasing degree how best there is a method one that colney durance advocated the girl's intelligence and sweet blood invited a trial of it since as he argued we cannot keep the poisonous matter out mothers should prepare and strengthen young women for the encounter with it by lifting the veil baring the world giving them knowledge to arm them for the fight they have to sustain and thereby preserve them further from the spiritual collapse which follows the nursing of a false ideal of our life in youth this being colney said the prominent feminine disease of the time common to all our women that is all having leisure to shine in the sun or wave in the wind as flowers of the garden whatever there was of wisdom in his view he spoilt it for english hearing by making use of his dry compressed sentences besides he was a bachelor therefore but a theorist and his illustrations of his theory were grotesque meditation on them extracted a corrosive acid to consume in horrid derision the sex the nation the race of man the satirist too devotedly loves his lash to be a persuasive teacher nataly had excuses to cover her reasons for not listening to him one reason was as she discerned through her confusion at the thought that the day drew near for her speaking fully to nesta when between what she then said and what she said now a cruel contrast might strike the girl and in toneing revelations now to be more consonant with them then in softening and shading the edges of social misconduct it seemed painfully possible to be sowing in the girl's mind something like the reverse of moral precepts even to smoothing the way to a rebelliousness partly or wholly similar to her own but nataly's chief and her appeasing reason for pursuing the conventional system with this exceptional young creature referred to the sentiments on that subject of the kind of young man whom a mother elects from among those present and eligible as perhaps next to worthy to wed the girl by virtue of good promise in the moral department she had mr dudley sowerby under view far from the man of her choice and still the practice of decorum discretion a pardonable fastidiousness appears if women may make any forecast of the behaviour of young men or may trust the faces they see to promise a future stability in the husband assuredly a dudley sowerby would be immensely startled to find in his bride a young woman more than babily aware of the existence of one particular form of naughtiness on earth victor was of no help he had not an idea upon the right education of the young of the sex repression and mystery he considered wholesome for girls and he considered the enlightening of them to some extent a prudential measure for their defence and premature instruction is a fire water to their wild in woods understanding and histrionic innocence is no doubt the bloom on corruption also the facts of current human life in the crude of the reports or the cooked of the sermon in the newspapers are a noxious diet for our daughters whom nevertheless we cannot hope to be feeding always on milk and there is a time when their adorable pretty ignorance if credibly it exists out of noodledom is harmful but how beautiful the shining simplicity of our dear young english girls he was one of the many men to whose minds women come in pictures and are accepted much as they paint themselves like his numerous fellows too he required a conflict with them and a worsting at it to be taught that they are not the mere live stock we scheme to dispose of for their good unless love should interpose he would have exclaimed he broke from his fellows in his holy horror of a father's running counter to love nesta had only to say that she loved another for dudley sowerby to be withdrawn into the background of aspirants but love was unknown to the girl outwardly the plan of the drive to paris had the look of victor's traditional hospitality nataly smiled at her incorrigibly lagging intelligence of him on hearing that he had invited a company 'lady grace for gaiety peridon and catkin fiddles dudley sowerby and myself flutes barmby intonation in all nine of us and by the dear old normandy route for the sake of the voyage as in old times towers of dieppe in the morning light and the lovely road to the capital just three days in paris and home by any of the other routes it's the drive we want boredom in wet weather we defy we have our concert an hour at night and we're sure of sleep' it had a sweet simple air befitting him as when in bygone days they travelled with the joy of children for travelling shook nataly out of her troubles and gave her something of the child's inheritance of the wisdom of life the living ever so little ahead of ourselves about as far as the fox in view of the hunt that is the soul of us out for novelty devouring as it runs an endless feast and the body is eagerly after it recording the pleasures a daily chase remembrance of them is almost a renewal anticipation a revival she enraptured victor with glimpses of the domestic fun she had ceased to show sign of since the revelation of lakelands her only regret was on account of the exclusion of colney durance from the party because of happy memories associating him with the seine land and also that his bilious criticism of his countrymen was moderated by a trip to the continent fenellan reported colney to be 'busy in the act of distilling one of his prussic acid essays' fenellan would have jumped to go he informed victor as a probe that the business of the life insurance was at periods 'fearfully necrological inexplicably he was not invited did it mean that he was growing dull he looked inside instead of out and lost the clue his behaviour on the evening of the departure showed plainly what would have befallen mr sowerby on the expedition had not he as well as colney been excluded two carriages and a cab conveyed the excursionists as they merrily called themselves to the terminus they were victor's guests they had no trouble no expense none of the nipper reckonings which dog our pleasures the state of pure bliss fenellan's enviousness drove him at the rev mr barmby until the latter jumped to the seat beside nesta in her carriage mademoiselle de seilles and mr sowerby facing them lady grace halley in the carriage behind heard nesta's laugh which mr barmby had thought vacuous beseeming little girls that laugh at nothings she questioned fenellan 'oh' said he 'i merely mentioned that the rev gentleman carries his musical instrument at the bottom of his trunk' she smiled 'and who are in the cab' 'your fiddles are in the cab in charge of peridon and catkin those two would have writhed like head and tail of a worm at a division on the way to the station point a finger at peridon you run catkin through the body they're a fabulous couple' victor cut him short 'i deny that those two are absurd' 'and catkin's toothache is a galvanic battery upon peridon' nataly strongly denied it peridon and catkin pertained to their genial picture of the dear sweet nest in life a dale never traversed by the withering breath they dreaded fenellan then to prove that he could be as bad in his way as colney fell to work on the absent miss priscilla graves and mr pempton with a pitchfork's exaltation of the sacred attachment of the divergently meritorious couple and a melancholy reference to implacable obstacles in the principles of each the pair were offending the amatory corner in the generous good sense of nataly and victor they were not to be hotly protected though they were well enough liked for their qualities except by lady grace who revelled in the horrifying and scandalizing of miss graves such a specimen of the puritan middle english as priscilla graves was eastwind on her skin nausea to her gorge she wondered at having drifted into the neighbourhood of a person resembling in her repellent formal chill virtuousness a windy belfry tower down among those districts of suburban london or appalling provincial towns passed now and then with a shudder where the funereal square bricks up the church that arctic hen mother sits on the square and the moving dead are summoned to their round of penitential exercise by a monosyllabic tribulation bell fenellan's graphic sketch of the teetotaller woman seeing her admirer pursued by eumenides flagons abominations of emptiness to the banks of the black river of suicides where the one most wretched light is inebriation's nose and of the vegetarian violoncello's horror at his vision of the long procession of the flocks and herds into his lady's melodious ark of a mouth excited and delighted her antipathy she was amused to transports at the station on hearing mr barmby in a voice all ophicleide remark 'no i carry no instrument' the habitation of it at the bottom of his trunk was not forgotten when it sounded reclining in warmth on the deck of the vessel at night she said just under victor's ear 'where are those two' 'bid me select the couple' said he she rejoined 'silly man' and sleepily gave him her hand for good night and so paralyzed his arm that he had to cover the continued junction by saying more than he intended 'if they come to an understanding' 'plain enough on one side' 'you think it suitable' 'perfection and well planned to let them discover it' 'this is really my favourite route i love the saltwater and the night on deck' 'go on' 'how' 'number your loves it would tax your arithmetic' 'i can hate' 'not me' positively the contrary an impulsive squeeze of fingers declared it and they broke the link neither of them sensibly hurt though a leaf or two of the ingenuities which were her thoughts turned over in the phantasies of the lady and the gentleman was taught to feel that a never so slightly lengthened compression of the hand female shoots within us both straight and far and round the corners there you have nature if you want her naked in her elements for a text he loved his nataly truly even fervently after the twenty years of union he looked about at no other woman it happened only that the touch of one the chance warm touch put to motion the blind forces of our mother so remarkably surcharging him but it was without kindling the lady the much cooler person did nurse a bit of flame she had a whimsical liking for the man who enjoyed simple things when commanding the luxuries and it became a fascination by extreme contrast at the reminder of his adventurous enterprises in progress while he could so childishly enjoy women who dance with the warrior winner of battles and hear him talk his ball room trifles to amuse have similarly a smell of gunpowder to intoxicate them for him a turn on the deck brought him into new skies nataly lay in the cabin she used to be where lady grace was lying a sort of pleadable transparent harmless hallucination of the renewal of old service induced him to refresh and settle the fair semi slumberer's pillow and fix the tarpaulin over her silks and wraps and bend his head to the soft mouth murmuring thanks the women who can dare the nuit blanche and under stars and have a taste for holiday larks after their thirtieth are rare they are precious nataly nevertheless was approved for guarding her throat from the nightwind and a softer southerly breath never crossed channel the very breeze he had wished for luck was with him nesta sat by the rails of the vessel beside her louise mr sowerby in passing exchanged a description of printed agreement with her upon the beauty of the night a good neutral topic for the encounter of the sexes not that he wanted it neutral it furnished him with a vocabulary once he perceptibly washed his hands of dutiful politeness in addressing mademoiselle de seilles likewise upon the beauty of the night and the french lady thinking too conclusively from the breath on the glass at the moment as it is the gallic habit that if her dear nesta must espouse one of the uninteresting creatures called men in her native land it might as well be this as another agreed that the night was very beautiful 'he speaks grammatical french' nesta commented on his achievement 'he contrives in his walking not to wet his boots' mademoiselle rejoined mr peridon was a more welcome sample of the islanders despite an inferior pretension to accent he burned to be near these ladies and he passed them but once his enthusiasm for mademoiselle de seilles was notorious gratefully the compliment was acknowledged by her in her demure fashion with a reserve of comic intellectual contempt for the man who could not see that women or frenchwomen or eminently she among them must have their enthusiasm set springing in the breast before they can be swayed by the most violent of outer gales and say that she is uprooted he does but roll a log mr peridon's efforts to perfect himself in the french tongue touched her a night of may leaning on june is little more than a deliberate wink of the eye of light mr barmby an exile from the ladies by reason of an addiction to tobacco quitted the forepart of the vessel at the first greying now was the cloak of night worn threadbare and grey astir for the heralding of gold day visibly ready to show its warmer throbs the gentle waves were just a stronger grey than the sky perforce of an interfusion that shifted gradations they were silken in places oily grey cold to drive the sight across their playful monotonousness for refuge on any far fisher sail miss radnor was asleep eyelids benignly down lips mildly closed the girl's cheeks held colour to match a dawn yet unawakened though born they were in a nest shading amid silks of pale blue and there was a languid flutter beneath her chin to the catch of the morn breeze bacchanal threads astray from a disorderly front lock of rich brown hair were alive over an eyebrow showing like a seal upon the lightest and securest of slumbers mr barmby gazed and devoutly both the ladies were in their oblivion the younger quite saintly but the couple inseparably framed elevating to behold a reproach to the reminiscence of pipes he was near and quietly the eyelids of mademoiselle lifted on him her look was grave straight uninquiring soon accurately perusing an arrow of artemis for penetration he went by with the sound in the throat of a startled bush bird taking to wing he limped off some nail of the deck as if that young frenchwoman had turned the foot to a hoof man could not be more guiltless yet her look had perturbed him nails conspired in his vexation he execrated tobacco and ask not why where reason never was nesta woke babbling on the subject she had relinquished for sleep mademoiselle touched a feathery finger at her hair and hood during their silvery french chimes mr sowerby presented the risen morning to them with encomiums after they had been observing every variation in it he spoke happily of the pleasant passage and of the agreeable night particularly of the excellent idea of the expedition by this long route at night the prospect of which had disfigured him with his grimace of speculation apparently a sourness that did not exist nesta had a singular notion coming of a girl's mingled observation and intuition that the impressions upon this gentleman were in arrear did not strike him till late mademoiselle confirmed it when it was mentioned she remembered to have noticed the same in many small things and it was a pointed perception victor sent his girl down to nataly with a summons to hurry up and see sunlight over the waters nataly came she looked and the outer wakened the inner she let the light look in on her her old feelings danced to her eyes like a string of bubbles in ascent 'victor victor it seems only yesterday that we crossed twelve years back was it and in may and saw the shoal of porpoises and five minutes after dieppe in view dear french people i share your love for france' 'home of our holidays the drives and they may be the happiest and fifty minutes later we were off the harbour and natata landed a stranger and at night she was the heroine of the town' victor turned to a stately gentleman and passed his name to nataly 'sir rodwell balchington a neighbour of lakelands she understood that lady grace halley was acquainted with sir rodwell hence this dash of brine to her lips while she was drinking of happy memories and victor evidently was pluming himself upon his usual luck in the fortuitous encounter with an influential neighbour of lakelands he told sir rodwell the story of how they had met in the salle a manger of the hotel the impresario of a concert in the town who had in his hand the doctor's certificate of the incapacity of the chief cantatrice to appear and waved it within a step of suicide 'well to be brief my wife noble dame anglaise as the man announced her on the concert platform undertook one of the songs and sang another of her own pure contralto voice as you will say with the result that there was a perfect tumult of enthusiasm next day the waiters of the hotel presented her with a bouquet of spring flowers white and central violets it was in the paris papers under the heading une amie d'outre manche i think that was it' he asked nataly 'i forget' said she he glanced at her a cloud had risen he rallied her spoke of the old norman silver cross which the manager of the concert had sent humbly imploring her to accept the small memento of his gratitude she nodded an excellent artificial brightness and there was the coast of france under young sunlight over the waters once more her oft petitioning wish through the years that she had entered the ranks of professional singers upon whom the moral scrutiny is not so microscopic invaded her resembling a tide swell into rock caves which have been filled before and left to emptiness and will be left to emptiness again nataly had the intimation visiting us when in a decline of physical power the mind's ready vivacity to conjure illusions forsakes us and it was of a wall ahead and a force impelling her against it and no hope of deviation and this is the featureless thing destiny not without eyes if we have a conscience to throw them into it to look at us counsel to her to live in the hour came as upon others on the vessel from an active breath of the salt prompting to healthy hunger and hardly less from the splendour of the low full sunlight on the waters the skimming and dancing of the thousands of golden shells away from under the globe of fire chapter xv a patriot abroad nine days after his master's departure daniel skepsey a man of some renown of late as a subject of reports and comments in the newspapers obtained a passport for the identification if need were of his missing or misapprehended person in a foreign country of the language of which three unpronounceable words were knocking about his head to render the thought of the passport a staff of safety and on the morning that followed he was at speed through normandy to meet his master rounding homeward from paris at a town not to be spoken as it is written by reason of the custom of the good people of the country with whom we would fain live on neighbourly terms yes and they had proof of it not so very many years back when they were enduring the worst which can befall us though mr durance to whom he was indebted for the writing of the place of his destination large on a card and the wording of the french sound beside it besides the jotting down of trains and the station for the change of railways mr durance could say that the active form of our sympathy consisted in the pouring of cheeses upon them when they were prostrate and unable to resist a kind gentleman mr durance as daniel skepsey had recent cause to know but often exceedingly dark not so patriotic as desireable it was to be feared and yet strangely indeed mr durance had said cogent things on the art of boxing and on manly exercises and he hoped he was emphatic in saying he hoped we should be regenerated he must have meant that boxing on a grand scale would contribute to it he said that a blow now and then was wholesome for us all he recommended a monthly private whipping for old gentlemen who decline the use of the gloves to disperse their humours not excluding judges and magistrates he could hardly be in earnest he spoke in a clergyman's voice and said it would be payment of good assurance money beneficial to their souls he seemed to mean it he said that old gentlemen were bottled vapours and it was good for them to uncork them periodically he said they should be excused half the strokes if they danced nightly they resented motion he seemed sadly wanting in veneration but he might not positively intend what he said skepsey could overlook everything he said except the girding at england for where is a braver people notwithstanding appearances skepsey knew of dozens of gallant bruisers ready for the cry to strip to the belt worthy with a little public encouragement to rank beside their grandfathers of the ring in the brilliant times when royalty and nobility countenanced the manly art our nursery of heroes and there was not the existing unhappy division of classes he still trusted to convince mr durance by means of argument and happy instances historical and immediate that the english may justly consider themselves the elect of nations for reasons better than their accumulation of the piles of gold better than 'usurers' reasons' as mr durance called them much that mr durance had said at intervals was although remembered almost to the letter of the phrase beyond his comprehension and he put it aside with penitent blinking at his deficiency all the while he was hearing a rattle of voluble tongues around him and a shout of stations intelligible as a wash of pebbles and blocks in a torrent generally the men slouched when they were not running at dieppe he had noticed muscular fellows he admitted them to be nimbler on the legs than ours and that may count both ways he consoled a patriotic vanity by thinking instantly rebuking the thought for he had read chapters of military history he sat eyeing the front row of figures in his third class carriage musing on the kind of soldiers we might heaven designing it have to face and how to beat them until he gazed on rouen knowing by the size of it and by what mr durance had informed him of the city on the river that it must be the very city of rouen not so many years back a violated place at the mercy of a foreign foe strong pity laid hold of skepsey he fortified the heights for defence but saw at a glance that it was the city for modern artillery to command crush and enter he lost idea of these afflicted people as foes merely complaining of their attacks on england and their menaces in their journals and pamphlets and he renounced certain views of the country to be marched over on the road by this route to paris for the dictation of terms of peace at the gates of the french capital sparing them the shameful entry and this after the rout of their attempt at an invasion of the island a man opposite him was looking amicably on his lively grey eyes skepsey handed a card from his pocket the man perused it and crying 'dreux' waved out of the carriage window at a westerly distance naming rouen as not the place not at all totally other thus we are taught that a foreign general ignorant of the language must confine himself to defensive operations at home he would be a child in the hands of the commonest man he meets brilliant with thanks in signs skepsey drew from his friend a course of instruction in french names for our necessities on a line of march the roads to great britain's metropolis and the supplies of forage and provision at every stage of a march on london are marked in the military offices of these people and that with their barking journals is a piece of knowledge to justify a belligerent return for it only we pray to be let live peacefully fervently we pray it when this good man a total stranger to us conducts an ignorant foreigner from one station to another through the streets of rouen after a short stoppage at the buffet and assistance in the identification of coins then lifting his cap to us retires and why be dealing wounds and death it is a more blessed thing to keep the commandments but how is it possible to keep the commandments if you have a vexatious wife martha skepsey had given him a son to show the hereditary energy in his crying and coughing and it was owing he could plead to her habits and her tongue that he sometimes that he might avoid the doing of worse for she wanted correction and was improved by it courted the excitement of a short exhibition of skill man to man on publicans' first floors he could have told the magistrates so in part apology for the circumstances dragging him the other day so recently before his worship and he might have told it if he had not remembered captain dartrey fenellan's words about treating women chivalrously which was interpreted by skepsey as correcting them when called upon to do it but never exposing them only if allowed to account for the circumstances pushing us into the newspapers we should not present so guilty a look before the public furthermore as to how far it is the duty of a man to serve his master there is likewise question whether is he while receiving reproof and punishment for excess of zeal in the service of his master not to mention the welfare of the country morally without establishing it as a principle exonerated miss graves might be asked save that one would not voluntarily trouble a lady on such subjects but supposing says the opposing counsel now at work in skepsey's conscience supposing this act for which contraveneing the law of the land you are reproved and punished to be agreeable to you how then we answer supposing it and we take uncomplainingly the magistrate's reproof and punishment morally justified can it be expected of us to have the sense of guilt although we wear and know we wear a guilty look before the public his master and the dear ladies would hear of it perhaps they knew of it now with them would rest the settlement of the distressing inquiry the ladies would be shocked ladies cannot bear any semblance of roughness not even with the gloves and knowing as they must that our practise of the manly art is for their protection skepsey's grievous prospect of the hour to come under judgement of a sex that was ever a riddle unread clouded him on the approach to dreux he studied the country and the people eagerly he forbore to conduct great military operations mr durance had spoken of big battles round about the town of dreux also of a wonderful mausoleum there not equally interesting the little man was in deeper gloom than a day sobering on crimson dusk when the train stopped and his quick ear caught the sound of the station as pronounced by his friend at rouen he handed his card to the station master a glance and the latter signalled to a porter saying 'paradis' and the porter laid hold of skepsey's bag skepsey's grasp was firm he pulled the porter pulled skepsey heard explanatory speech accompanying a wrench he wrenched back with vigour and in his own tongue exclaimed that he held to the bag because his master's letters were in the bag all the way from england for a minute there was a downright trial of muscle and will the porter appeared furiously excited skepsey had a look of cooled steel then the frenchman requiring to shrug gave way to the englishman's eccentric obstinacy and signified that he was his guide quite so and skepsey showed alacrity and confidence in following he carried his bag but with the remembrance of the kindly serviceable man at rouen he sought to convey to the porter that the terms of their association were cordial a waving of the right hand to the heavens ratified the treaty on the french side nods and smiles and gesticulations with across channel vocables as it were dover cliffs to calais sands and back pleasantly beguiled the way down to the hotel du paradis under the mausoleum heights where skepsey fumbled at his pocket for coin current but the frenchman all shaken by a tornado of negation clapped him on the shoulder and sang him a quatrain skepsey had in politeness to stand listening and blinking plunged in the contrition of ignorance eclipsed he took it to signify something to the effect that money should not pass between friends it was the amatory farewell address of henri iv to his charmante gabrielle and with 'perce de mille lords l'honneur m'appelle au champ de mars' the frenchman in a backing of measured steps apologized for his enforced withdrawal from the stranger who had captured his heart skepsey's card was taken in the passage of the hotel a clean capped maid brave on the legs like all he had seen of these people preceded him at quick march to an upper chamber when he descended bag in hand she flung open the salon door of a table d'hote where a goodly number were dining and chattering waiters drew him along to the section occupied by his master's party a chair had been kept vacant for him his master waved a hand his dear ladies graciously smiled he struck the bag in front of a guardian foot growing happy he could fancy they had not seen the english newspapers and his next observation of the table showed him wrecked and lost miss nesta's face was the oval of a woeful o at his wild behaviour in england during their absence she smiled skepsey had nevertheless to consume his food excellent very tasty soup with the sour sauce of the thought that he must be tongue tied in his defence for the time of the dinner 'no dear skips please you are to enjoy yourself' said nesta he answered confusedly trying to assure her that he was doing so and he choked his master had fixed his arrival for twenty minutes earlier skepsey spoke through a cough of long delays at stations the rev septimus barmby officially peacemaker sounded the consequent excuse for a belated comer it was final such is the power of sound looks were cast from the french section of the table at the owner of the prodigious organ some of the younger men intent on the charms of albion's daughters expressed in a sign and a word or two alarm at what might be beneath the flooring and 'pas encore lui' and 'son avant courrier' and other flies of speech passed on a whiff under politest of cover not to give offence but prodigies claim attention our english at the close of the dinner consented to say it was good without specifying a dish because a selection of this or that would have seemed to italicize and commit them in the presence of ladies to a notice of the matter of course beneath us or the confession of a low sensual enjoyment until lady grace halley named the particular dressing of a tete de veau approvingly to victor and he stating that he had offered a suggestion for the menu of the day nataly exclaimed that she had suspected it upon which mr sowerby praised the menu mr barmby peridon and catkin named other dishes there was the right after dinner ring in victor's ears thanks to the woman of the world who had travelled round to nature and led the shackled men to deliver themselves heartily one tap and they are free that is in the moments after dinner when nature is at the gates with them only it must be a lady and a prevailing lady to give the tap they need our english and will for the ages of the process of their transformation need a queen skepsey bag in hand obeyed the motion of his master's head and followed him he was presently back to remain with the ladies during his master's perusal of letters nataly had decreed that he was not to be troubled so nesta and mademoiselle besought him for a recital of his french adventures and strange to say he had nothing to tell the journey pregnant at the start exciting in the course of it was absolutely blank at the termination french people had been very kind he could not say more but there was more there was a remarkable fulness if only he could subordinate it to narrative the little man did not know that time was wanted for imagination to make the roadway or riverway of a true story unless we press to invent his mind had been too busy on the way for him to clothe in speech his impressions of the passage of incidents at the call for them things had happened numbers of interesting minor things but they all slipped as water through the fingers and he being of the band of honest creatures who will not accept a lift from fiction drearily he sat before the ladies confessing to an emptiness he was far from feeling nesta professed excessive disappointment 'now if it had been in england skips' she said under her mother's gentle gloom of brows he made show of melancholy submission 'there skepsey you have a good excuse we are sure' nataly said and women when they are such ladies as these are sent to prove to us that they can be a blessing instead of the dreadful cry to providence for the reason of the spread of the race of man by their means he declared his readiness rejecting excuses to state his case to them but for his fear of having it interpreted as an appeal for their kind aid in obtaining his master's forgiveness mr durance had very considerately promised to intercede skepsey dropped a hint or two of his naughty proceedings drily aware that their untutored antipathy to the manly art would not permit of warmth nesta said 'do you know skips we saw a grand exhibition of fencing in paris' he sighed 'ladies can look on at fencing foils and masks captain dartrey fenellan has shown me and says the french are our masters at it' he bowed constrainedly to mademoiselle 'you box m skepsey' she said his melancholy increased 'much discouragement from government society if ladies but i do not venture they are not against games but these are not a protection to them when needed to the country the country seems asleep to its position mr durance has remarked on it though i would not always quote mr durance indeed he says that england has invested an old maid's all in the millennium and is ruined if it delays to come old maid i do not see i do not if i may presume to speak of myself in the same breath with so clever a gentleman agree with mr durance in everything but the chest measurement of recruits the stature of the men enlisted prove that we are losing the nursery of our soldiers' 'we are taking them out of the nursery skips if you 're for quoting captain dartrey' said nesta 'we'll never haul down our flag though while we have him' 'ah captain dartrey' skepsey was refreshed by the invocation of the name a summons to his master's presence cut short something he was beginning to say about captain dartrey chapter xvi accounts for skepsey's misconduct showing how it affected nataly his master opened on the bristling business 'what's this of your name in the papers your appearing before a magistrate and a fine tell the tale shortly' skepsey fell upon his attitude for dialectical defence the modest form of the two hands at rolling play and the head deferentially sidecast but knowing that he had gratified his personal tastes in the act of serving his master's interests an interfusion of sentiments plunged him into self consciousness an unwonted state with him clogging to a simple story 'first sir i would beg you to pardon the printing of your name beside mine' 'tush on with you' 'only to say necessitated by the circumstances of the case i read that there was laughter in the court at my exculpation of my conduct as i have to call it and there may have been i may have expressed myself i have a strong feeling for the welfare of the country' 'so it seems you said to the magistrate do you tell me that the cause of your gross breach of the law was a consideration for the welfare of the country run on the facts' 'the facts i must have begun badly sir' skepsey rattled the dry facts in his head to right them from his not having begun well they had become dry as things underfoot it was an error to have led off with the sentiments 'two very two very respectable persons respectable were desirous to witness a short display of my my system i would say of my science they call it' 'don't be nervous to the point you went into a field five miles out of london in broad day and stood in a ring the usual tiff raff about you' 'with the gloves and not for money sir for the trial of skill not very many people i cannot quite see the breach of the law' 'so you told the magistrate you were fined for your inability to quite see and you had to give security' 'mr durance was kindly responsible for me sir an acquaintance of the magistrate' 'this boxing of yours is a positive mania skepsey you must try to get the better of it must and my name too i'm to be proclaimed as having in my service an inveterate pugilist who breaks the law from patriotism male or female these very respectable persons the people your show was meant for' 'male sir females that is not the respectable ones' 'take the opinion of the respectable ones for your standard of behaviour in future' 'it was a mere trial of skill sir to prove to one of the spectators that i could be as good as my word i wished i may say to conciliate him partly he would not he judged by size credit me with he backed my adversary jerry scroom a sturdy boxer without the knowledge of the first principles' 'you beat him' 'i think i taught the man that i could instruct sir he was complimentary before we parted he thought i could not have lasted after the second round the police appeared' 'and you ran' 'no sir i had nothing on my conscience' 'why not have had your pugilistic display in a publican's room in town where you could have hammer nailed and ding donged to your heart's content for as long as you liked' 'that would have been preferable from the point of view of safety from intrusion i can admit speaking humbly but one of the parties i had a wish to gratify him is a lover of old english times and habits and our country scenes he wanted it to take place on green grass we drove over hampstead in three carts and a gig as a company of pleasure as it was a very beautiful morning there was a rest at a public house mr shaplow traces the misfortune to that mr jarniman i hear thinks it what he calls a traitor in the camp i saw no sign we were all merry and friendly' 'jarniman' said victor sharply 'who is the jarniman' 'mr jarniman is i am to understand from the acquaintance introducing us a mr shaplow i met in the train from lakelands one day and again at the corner of a street near drury lane a ham and beef shop kept by a mrs jarniman a very stout lady who does the chief carving in the shop and is the mother of mr jarniman he is in a confidential place highly trusted' skepsey looked up from the hands he soaped 'he is a curious mixture he has true enthusiasm for boxing he believes in ghosts he mourns for the lost days of prize fighting he thinks that spectres are on the increase he has a very large appetite depressed spirits mr shaplow informs me he is a man of substance in the service of a wealthy lady in poor health expecting a legacy and her appearance to him he has the look mr shaplow assures me he does not drink to excess he is a slow drinker' victor straightened 'bad way of health you said' 'mr jarniman spoke of his expectations as being immediate he put it that he expected her spirit to be out for him to meet it any day or night he desires it he says she has promised it on oath he says and must feel that she must do her duty to him before she goes if she is to appear to him with any countenance after but he is anxious for her in any case to show herself and says he should not have the heart to reproach her he has principles a tear for suffering he likes to be made to cry mrs jarniman his mother he is not married is much the same so far except ghosts she will not have them except after strong tea they come she says come to her bed she is foolish enough to sleep in a close curtained bed but the poor lady is so exceedingly stout that a puff of cold would carry her off she fears' victor stamped his foot 'this man jarniman serves a lady now in a serious does he say was he precise' 'mr jarniman spoke of a remarkable number of diseases very complicated he says he has no opinion of doctors he says that the lady's doctor and the chemist she sits in a chemist's shop and swallows other people's prescriptions that take her fancy he says her continuing to live is wonderful he has no reason to hurry her only for the satisfaction of a natural curiosity' 'he mentioned her name' 'no name sir' skepsey's limpid grey eyes confirmed the negative to victor who was assured that the little man stood clean of any falsity 'you are not on equal terms you and the magistrate have helped him to know who it is you serve skepsey' 'would you please to direct me sir' 'another time now go and ease your feet with a run over the town we have music in half an hour that you like i know see chiefly to amusing yourself' skepsey turned to go he murmured that he had enjoyed his trip victor checked him it was to ask whether this jarniman had specified one any one of the numerous diseases afflicting his aged mistress now jarniman had shocked skepsey with his blunt titles for a couple of the foremost maladies assailing the poor lady's decayed constitution not to be mentioned skepsey's thought in relation to ladies whose organs and functions we who pay them a proper homage by restricting them to the sphere so worthily occupied by their mothers up to the very oldest date respectfully curtain their accepted masters are chivalrous to them deploring their need at times for the doctors and drugs he stood looking most unhappy 'she was to appear sir in a few perhaps a week a month' a nod dismissed him the fun of the expedition and dudley sowerby had wound himself up to relish it was at night in the towns when the sound of instrumental and vocal music attracted crowds beneath the windows of the hotel and they heard zon zon violon fete et basse not bad fluting excellent fiddling such singing as a maestro conducting his own opera would have approved so victor said of his darlings' voices nesta's and her mother's were a perfect combination mr barmby's trompe in union sufficiently confirmed the popular impression that they were artistes they had been ceremoniously ushered to their carriages with expressions of gratitude at the departure from rouen and the boniface at gisors had entreated them to stay another night to give an entertainment victor took his pleasure in letting it be known that they were a quiet english family simply keeping up the habits they practiced in old england all were welcome to hear them while they were doing it but they did not give entertainments the pride of the pleasure of reversing the general idea of english dulness among our neighbours was perceived to have laid fast hold of dudley sowerby at dreux he was at the window from time to time counting heads below for this reason or a better he begged nesta to supplant the flute duet with the soprano and contralto of the helena section of the mefistofele called the serenade la luna immobile she consulted her mother and they sang it the crowds below swollen to a block of the street were dead still showing the instinctive good manners of the people then mademoiselle astonished them with a provencal or cevennes air huguenot though she was catholic but it suited her mezzo soprano tones and it rang massively of the martial religious to what heights of spiritual grandeur might not a huguenot france have marched dudley sowerby heedlessly under an emotion that could be stirred in him with force by the soul of religion issuing through music addressed his ejaculation to lady grace halley she did nor shrug or snub him but rejoined 'i could go to battle with that song in the ears' she liked seeing him so happily transformed and liked the effect of it on nesta when his face shone in talking he was at home with the girl's eyes as he had never been a song expressing in one of the combative and devotional went to the springs of his blood for he was of an old warrior race beneath the thick crust of imposed peaceful maxims and commercial pursuits and habitual stiff correctness as much as wine will music bring out the native bent of the civilized man endow him with language too he was as if unlocked he met nesta's eyes and ran in a voluble interchange that gave him flattering after thoughts and at the moment sensibly a new and assured or to some extent assured station beside a girl so vivid by which the young lady would be helped to perceive his unvoiced solider gifts nataly observed them thinking of victor's mastering subtlety she had hoped having clearly seen the sheep's eye in the shepherd that mr barmby would be watchful to act as a block between them and therefore she had stipulated for his presence on the journey she remembered victor's rapid look of readiness to consent he reckoned how naturally mr barmby would serve as a foil to any younger man mr barmby had tried all along to perform his part he had always been thwarted notably once at gisors where by some cunning management he and mademoiselle found themselves in the cell of the prisoner's nail wrought work while nesta had to take sowerby's hand for help at a passage here and there along the narrow outer castle walls and mr barmby upon occasions had set that dimple in nesta's cheek quivering though simeon fenellan was not at hand and there was no telling how it was done beyond the evidence that victor willed it so from the day of the announcement of lakelands she had been brought more into contact with his genius of dexterity and foresight than ever previously she had bent to the burden of it more had seen herself and everybody else outstripped herself of course she did not count in a struggle with him but since that red dawn of lakelands it was almost as if he had descended to earth from the skies she now saw his mortality in the miraculous things he did the reason of it was that through the perceptible various arts and shifts on her level an opposing spirit had plainer view of his aim to judge it she thought it a mean one the power it had to hurry her with the strength of a torrent to an end she dreaded impressed her physically so far subduing her mind in consequence as to keep the idea of absolute resistance obscure though her bosom heaved with the breath but what was her own of a mind hung hovering above him criticizing and involuntarily discomfortingly she could have prayed to be led blindly or blindly dashed on she could trust him for success and her critical mind seemed at times a treachery still she was compelled to judge when he said to her at night pressing both her hands 'this is the news of the day my love it's death at last we shall soon be thanking heaven for freedom' her fingers writhed upon his and gripped them in a torture of remorse on his behalf a shattering throb of her heart gave her sight of herself as well for so it is with the woman who loves in subjection she may be a critic of the man she is his accomplice' 'you have a letter victor' 'confirmation all round fenellan themison and now skepsey' he told her the tale of skepsey and jarniman colouring it as any interested animated conduit necessarily will neither of them smiled the effort to think soberly exhausted and rolled her back on credulity it might not be to day or next week or month but so much testimony pointed to a day within the horizon surely she bowed her head to heaven for forgiveness the murderous hope stood up stood out in forms and pictures there was one of a woman at her ease at last in the reception of guests contrasting with an ironic haunting figure of the woman of queenly air and stature under a finger of scorn for a bold faced impostor nataly's lips twitched at the remembrance of quaint whimpers of complaint to the fates for directing that a large instead of a rather diminutive woman should be the social offender fearing exposure majesty in the criminal's dock is a confounding spectacle to the bosom of the majestic creature all her glorious attributes have become the executioner's implements she must for her soul's health believe that a day of release and exoneration approaches 'barmby if my dear girl would like him best' victor said in tenderest undertones observing the shadowing variations of her face and pierced her cruelly past explanation or understanding not that she would have objected to the rev septimus as officiating clergyman she nodded down rolled the first big tear we cry to women land ho a land of palms after storms at sea and at once they inundate us with a deluge of eye water 'half a minute dear victor not longer' nataly said weeping near on laughing over his look of wanton abandonment to despair at sight of her tears 'don't mind me i am rather like fenellan's laundress the tearful woman whose professional apparatus was her soft heart and a cake of soap skepsey has made his peace with you' victor answered 'yes yes i see what he has been about we're a mixed lot all of us the best you've noticed skepsey has no laugh however absurd the thing he tells you not a smile' 'but you trust his eyes you look fathoms into them captain dartrey thinks him one of the men most in earnest of any of his country' 'so nataly of course thinks the same and he's a worthy little velocipede as fenellan calls him one wishes colney had been with us only colney pity one can't cut his talons for the space before they grow again' ay and in the presence of colney durance victor would not have been so encouraging half boyishly caressing with dudley sowerby it was the very manner to sow seed of imitativeness in the girl devoted as she was to her father nataly sighed foreseeing evil owning it a superstition feeling it a certainty we are easily prophets sure of being justified when the cleverness of schemes devoted to material ends appears most delicately perfect history the tales of households the tombstone are with us to inspire in nataly's bosom the reproof of her inefficiency for offering counsel where victor for his soul's sake needed it was beginning to thunder at whiles as a reproach of unfittingness in his mate worse than a public denunciation of the sin against society it might be decreed that she and society were to come to reconcilement a pain previously thought of never previously so realized seized her at her next sight of nesta she had not taken in her front mind the contrast of the innocent one condemned to endure the shadow from which the guilty was by a transient ceremony released nature could at a push be eloquent to defend the guilty not a word of vindicating eloquence rose up to clear the innocent nothing that she could do no devotedness not any sacrifice and no treaty of peace no possible joy to come nothing could remove the shadow from her child she dreamed of the succour in eloquence to charm the ears of chosen juries while a fact spoke over the population with a relentless rolling out of its one hard word but eloquence powerful on her behalf was dumb when referred to nesta it seemed a cruel mystery how was it permitted by the merciful disposer nataly's intellect and her reverence clashed they clash to the end of time if we persist in regarding the spirit of life as a remote externe who plays the human figures to bring about this or that issue instead of being beside us within us our breath if we will marking on us where at each step we sink to the animal mount to the divine we and ours who follow offspring of body or mind she was in her error from judgeing of the destiny of man by the fate of individuals chiefly her error was to try to be thinking at all amid the fevered tangle of her sensations a darkness fell upon the troubled woman and was thicker overhead when her warm blood had drawn her to some acceptance of the philosophy of existence in a savour of gratification at the prospect of her equal footing with the world while yet she lived she hated herself for taking pleasure in anything to be bestowed by a world so hap hazard ill balanced unjust she took it bitterly with such naturalness as not to be aware that it was irony and a poisonous irony moving her to welcome the restorative ceremony because her largeness of person had a greater than common need of the protection chapter xvii chiefly upon the theme of a young maid's imaginings that mausoleum at dreux may touch to lift us history pleads for the pride of the great discrowned family giving her illumination there the pride is reverently postured the princely mourning cloak it wears becomingly braided at the hem with fair designs of our mortal humility in the presence of the vanquisher against whom acknowledgeing a visible conquest of the dust it sustains a placid contention in coloured glass and marbles mademoiselle de seilles a fervid orleanist was thanked for having advised the curvature of the route homeward to visit 'the spot of so impressive a monument' as it was phrased by the rev septimus barmby whose exposition to nesta of the beautiful stained glass pictures of incidents in the life of the crusading st louis was toned to be likewise impressive colney durance not being at hand to bewail the pathos of his exhaustless 'whacking of the platitudes' which still retain their tender parts but cry unheard when there is no cynic near mr barmby laid on solemnly professional devoutness is deemed more righteous on such occasions than poetic fire it robes us in the cloak of the place as at a funeral generally mr barmby found and justly that it is in superior estimation among his countrymen of all classes they are shown by example how to look think speak what to do poets are disturbing they cannot be comfortably imitated they are unsafe not certainly the metal unless you have laureates entitled to speak by their pay and decorations and these are but one at a time and a quotation may remind us of a parody to convulse the sacred dome established plain prose officials do better for our english the audience moved round with heads of undertakers victor called to recollection fenellan's 'rev glendoveer' while mr barmby pursued his discourse uninterrupted by tripping wags and those who have schemes as well as those who are startled by the criticism in laughter to discover that they have cause for shunning it rejoice when wits are absent mr sowerby and nesta interchanged a comment on mr barmby's remarks the fate of princes the paths of glory st louis was a very distant roman catholic monarch and the young gentleman of evangelical education could admire him as a crusader st louis was for nesta a figure in the rich hues of royal saintship softened to homeliness by tears she doated on a royalty crowned with the saint's halo that swam down to us to lift us through holy human showers she listened to mr barmby hearing few sentences lending his eloquence all she felt he rolled forth notes of a minster organ accordant with the devotional service she was holding mutely mademoiselle upon st louis 'worthy to be named king of kings' swept her to a fount of thoughts where the thoughts are not yet shaped are yet in the breast of the mother emotions louise de seilles had prepared her to be strangely and deeply moved the girl had a heart of many strings of high pitch open to be musical to simplest wandering airs or to the gales this crypt of the recumbent sculptured figures and the coloured series of acts in the passage of the crowned saint thrilled her as with sight of flame on an altar piece of history but this king in the lines of the crucifixion leading gave her a lesson of life not a message from death with such a king there would be union of the old order and the new cessation to political turmoil radicalism socialism all the monster names of things with heads agape in these our days to gobble up the venerable obliterate the beautiful leave a stoniness of floods where field and garden were would be appeased transfigured she hoped she prayed for that glorious leader's advent on one subject conceived by her only of late and not intelligibly not communicably a subject thickly veiled one which struck at her through her sex and must she thought ever be unnamed the ardent young creature saw it as a very thing torn by the winds to show hideous gleams of a body rageing with fire behind the veil on this one subject her hopes and prayers were dumb in her bosom it signified shame she knew not the how for she had no power to contemplate it there was a torment of earth and a writhing of lurid dust clouds about it at a glimpse but if the new crusading hero were to come attacking that if some born prince nobly man would head the world to take away the withering scarlet from the face of women she felt she could kiss the print of his feet upon the ground meanwhile she had enjoyment of her plunge into the inmost forest well of mediaeval imaginativeness where youthful minds of good aspiration through their obscurities find much akin to them she had an eye for little skepsey too unaware that these french princes had hurried him off to agincourt for another encounter with them and the old result poor dear gentlemen with whom we do so wish to be friendly what amused her was his evident fatigue in undergoing the slow parade and sheer deference to his betters as to the signification of a holiday on arrested legs dudley sowerby's attention to him in elucidating the scenes with historical scraps greatly pleased her the rev septimus of course occupied her chiefly mademoiselle was always near to receive his repeated expressions of gratitude for the route she had counselled without personal objections to a well meaning orderly man whose pardonable error it was to be aiming too considerably higher than his head she did but show him the voluble muteness of a frenchwoman's closed lips not a smile at all and certainly no sign of hostility when bowing to his reiterated compliment in the sentence of french mr barmby had noticed and a strong sentiment rendered him observant unwontedly a similar alert immobility of her lips indicating foreign notions of this kind or that in england an all but imperceptible shortening or loss of corners at the mouth upon mention of marriages of his clergy particularly once at his reading of a lengthy report in a newspaper of a wedding ceremony involving his favourite bishop for bridegroom a report to make one glow like hymen rollicking the torch after draining the bumper to the flying slipper he remembered the look and how it seemed to intensify on the slumbering features at a statement that his bishop was a widower entering into nuptials in his fifty fourth year why not but we ask it of heaven and man why not mademoiselle was pleasant she was young or youngish her own clergy were celibates and no he could not argue the matter with a young or youngish person of her sex could it be a reasonable woman a woman who disapproved the holy nuptials of the pastors of the flocks but we are forbidden to imagine the conducting of an argument thereon with a lady luther but we are not in luther's time nature no nor can there possibly be allusions to nature mr barmby wondered at protestant parents taking a papistical governess for their young flower of english womanhood however she venerated st louis he cordially also there they met and he admitted that she had for a frenchwoman a handsome face and besides an agreeably artificial ingenuousness in the looks which could be so politely dubious as to appear only dubiously adverse the spell upon nesta was not blown away on english ground and when her father and mother were comparing their impressions she could not but keep guard over the deeper among her own at the chateau de gisors leftward off vernon on seine it had been one of romance and wonderment with inquisitive historic soundings of her knowledge and mademoiselle's a reverence for the prisoner's patient holy work and picturings of his watchful waiting daily nail in hand for the heaven sent sunlight on the circular dungeon wall through the slits of the meurtrieres but the mausoleum at dreux spake religiously it enfolded mr barmby his voice re edified it the fact that he had discoursed there though not a word of the discourse was remembered allied him to the spirit of a day rather increasing in sacredness as it receded and left her less the possessor of it more the worshipper mademoiselle had to say to herself 'impossible' after seeing the drift of her dear nesta's eyes in the wake of the colossal english clergyman she fed her incredulousness indignantly on the evidence confounding it nataly was aware of unusual intonations treble stressed in the bethesda and the galilee of mr barmby on concert evenings as it were the towering wood work of the cathedral organ in quake under emission of its multitudinous outroar the 'which' of the rev septimus addressed to nesta when song was demanded of him and her 'either' and his gentle hesitation upon a gaze at her for the directing choice could not be unnoticed by women did he know a certain thing and dream of urging the suit as an indulgent skipper of parental pages such haunting interrogations were the conspirators' daggers out at any instant or leaping in sheath against nataly's peace of mind but she trusted her girl's laughing side to rectify any little sentimental overbalancing she left the ground where maternal meditations are serious at an image of mr barmby knocking at nesta's heart as a lover was it worth inquiry a feminine look was trailed across the eyes of mademoiselle with mention of mr barmby's name mademoiselle rippled her shoulders 'we are at present much enamoured of bethesda' that watchfullest showing no alarm the absurdity of the suspicion smothered it nataly had moreover to receive startling new guests lady rodwell blachington mrs fanning wife of the general young mrs blathenoy wife of the great bill broker ladies of wrensham and about and it was a tasking of her energies equal to the buffeting of recurrent waves on deep sea the ladies were eager for her entry into lakelands she heard that victor had appointed lady blachington's third son to the coveted post of clerk in the indian house of inchling and radnor these are the deluge days when even aristocracy will cry blessings on the man who procures a commercial appointment for one of its younger sons offended and rebutted by the barrier of examinations for the civil service 'to have our adolphus under mr victor radnor's protection is a step' lady blachington said nataly was in an atmosphere of hints and revealings there were city dinners to which one or other of the residents about lakelands had been taken before he sat at victor's london table he was already winning his way apparently without effort to be the popular man of that neighbourhood a subterranean tide or a slipping of earth itself seemed bearing her on she had his promise indeed that he would not ask of her to enter lakelands until the day of his freedom had risen but though she could trust to his word the heart of the word went out of it when she heard herself thanked by lady blachington who could so well excuse her at such a time of occupation for not returning her call that she called in a friendly way a second time warmly to thank her for throwing open the concert room at lakelands in august to an entertainment in assistance of the funds for the purpose of erecting an east of london clubhouse where the children of the poor by day could play and their parents pass a disengaged evening doubtless a worthy charity nataly was alive to the duties of wealth had it been simply a demand for a donation she would not have shown that momentary pucker of the brows which lady blachington read as a contrast with the generous vivacity of the husband nataly read a leaf of her fate in this announcement nay she beheld herself as the outer world wexedly beholds a creature swung along to the doing of things against the better mind an outer world is thoughtless of situations which prepare us to meet the objectionable with a will benumbed if we do not as does that outer world belong to the party of the readily heroical she scourged her weakness and the intimation of the truth stood over her more than ever manifest that the deficiency affecting her character lay in her want of language a tongue to speak and contend would have helped her to carve a clearer way but then again the tongue to speak must be one which could reproach and strike at errors fence and continually summon resources to engage the electrical vitality of a man like victor it was an exultation of their life together a mark of his holiness for them both that they had never breathed a reproach upon one another she dropped away from ideas of remonstrance faintly seeing in her sigh of submission that the deficiency affecting her character would have been supplied by a greater force of character pressing either to speech or acts the confession of a fated inevitable in the mind is weakness prostrate she knew it but she could point to the manner of man she was matched with and it was not a poor excuse mr barmby she thought deserved her gratitude in some degree for stepping between mr sowerby and nesta the girl not having inclinations and the young gentleman being devoid of stratagem they were easily kept from the dangerous count of two mademoiselle would have said that the shepherd also had rarely if ever a minute quite alone with her lamb incredulously she perceived signs of a shock the secret following the signs was betrayed by nesta in return for a tender grasp of hands and a droll flutter of eyelids out it came on a nod first then a dreary mention of a date and an incident to bring it nearer to comprehension mr barmby and decide who will whether it is that love was made to elude or that curates impelled by his fires are subtle as nether had outwitted french watchfulness by stealing minutes enough on a day at lakelands to declare himself and no wonder the girl looked so forlorn he had shivered her mediaeval forest palace of illuminated glass to leave her standing like a mountain hind that sniffs the tainted gale off the crag of her first quick leap from hounds her instincts alarmed instead of rich imagination colouring and fostering she had no memory for his words so and truly she told her louise meaning that she had only a spiceless memory especially for the word love in her ears from the mouth of a man there had been a dream of it with the life awakening marvel it would be the humbleness it would bring to her soul beneath the golden clothing of her body one of those faint formless dreams which are as the bend of grasses to the breath of a still twilight she lived too spiritedly to hang on any dream and had moreover a muffled dread shadow sister to the virginal desire of this one as of a fateful power that might drag her down disorder discolour but now she had heard it the word the very word itself in her own ears addressed to her in a man's voice the first utterance had been heard and it was over the chapter of the book of bulky promise of the splendours and mysteries the shimmering woods and bushy glades and the descent of the shape celestial and the recognition the mutual cry of affinity and overhead the crimson outrolling of the flag of beneficent enterprises hand in hand all was at an end these then are the deceptions our elders tell of that masculine voice should herald a new world to the maiden the voice she had heard did but rock to ruin the world she had been living in mademoiselle prudently forbore from satirical remarks on his person or on his conduct nesta had nothing to defend she walked in a bald waste 'can i have been guilty of leading him to think' she said in a tone that writhed at a second discussion of this hapless affair 'they choose to think' mademoiselle replied 'it is he or another my dear and dearest you have entered the field where shots fly thick as they do to soldiers in battle and it is neither your fault nor any one's if you are hit' nesta gazed at her with a shy supplicating cry of 'louise' mademoiselle immediately answered the tone of entreaty 'has it happened to me i am of the age of eight and twenty passable to look at yes my dear i have gone through it to spare you the questions tormenting you i will tell you that perhaps our experience of our feelings comes nigh on a kind of resemblance the first gentleman who did me the honour to inform me of his passion was a hunchback' nesta cried 'oh' in a veritable pang of sympathy and clapped hands to her ears to shut out mr barmby's boom of the terrific word attacking louise from that deformed one her disillusionment became of the sort which hears derision a girl of quick blood and active though unregulated intellect she caught at the comic of young women's hopes and experiences in her fear of it 'my own precious poor dear louise what injustice there is in the world for one like my louise to have a hunchback to be the first' 'but my dear it did me no harm' 'but if it had been known' 'but it was known' nesta controlled a shuddering 'it is the knowledge of it in ourselves that it has ever happened you dear louise who deserve so much better and one asks oh why are we not left in peace and do look at the objects it makes of us' mademoiselle could see that the girl's desperation had got hold of her humour for a life buoy 'it is really worse to have it unknown when you are compelled to be his partner in sharing the secret and feel as if it were a dreadful doll you conceal for fear that everybody will laugh at its face' she resumed her seriousness 'i find it so hard to be vexed with him and really really like him for he is a good man but he will not let one shake him off he distresses because we can't quite meet as we did last wednesday concert evening he kept away and i am annoyed that i was glad' 'moths have to pass through showers and keep their pretty patterns from damage as best they can' said mademoiselle nesta transformed herself into a disciple of philosophy on the spot 'yes all these feelings of ours are moth dust one feels them i suppose they pass they must but tell me louise dear soul was your poor dear good little afflicted suitor was he kindly pitied' 'conformably with the regulations prescribed to young damsels who are in request to surrender the custody of their hands it is easy to commit a dangerous excess in the dispensing of that article they call pity of them' 'and he did he vowed to you he could not take no for an answer' at this ingenuous question woefully uttered mademoiselle was pricked to smile pointedly nesta had a tooth on her under lip then shaking vapours to the winds she said 'it is an honour to be asked and we cannot be expected to consent so i shall wear through it only i do wish that mr fenellan would not call him the inchcape bell' she murmured this to herself mr barmby was absent for two weeks 'can anything have offended him' victor inquired in some consternation appreciating the man's worth and the grand basso he was together with the need for him at the lakelands concert in august nataly wrote mr barmby a direct invitation she had no reply her speculations were cut short by victor who handed her a brief note addressed to him and signed by the rev septimus petitioning for a private interview the formality of the request incensed victor 'now dear love you see colney's meaning when he says there are people who have no intimacy in them here's a man who visits me regularly once a week or more has been familiar for years four at least and he wants to speak to me and must obtain the privilege by special appointment what can be the meaning of it' 'you will hear to morrow afternoon' nataly said seeing one paved way to the meaning a too likely meaning 'he hasn't been nothing about fredi surely' 'i have had no information' 'impossible barmby has good sense bottesini can't intend to come scraping on that string but we won't lose him he's one of us barmby counts for more at a charity concert than all the catalogue and particularly in the country but he's an excellent fellow eh' 'that he is' nataly agreed victor despatched a cheerful curt consent to see mr barmby privately on the late afternoon of the day to follow nesta returning home from the park at that hour of the interview ignorant of mr barmby's purpose though she was had her fires extinguished by the rolling roar of curfew along the hall passage out of the library chapter xviii suitors for the hand of nesta victoria when upon the well known quest the delightful singer orpheus took that downward way coming in sight of old cerberus centiceps he astutely feigned inattention to the hostile appearances of the multiple beast and with a wave of his plectrum over the responsive lyre he at the stroke raised voice this much you know it may be communicated to you that there was then beheld the most singular spectacle ever exhibited on the dizzy line of division between the living and the dead for those unaccustomed musical tones in the last thin whiff of our sustaining air were so smartingly persuasive as to pierce to the vitals of the faithful old dog before his offended sentiments had leisure to rouse their heads against a beggar of a mortal the terrible sugariness which poured into him worked like venom to cause an encounter and a wrestling his battery of jaws expressed it they gaped at the same time his eyeballs gave up all the dog that would have barked the breathing intruder an hundredfold back to earth was one compulsory centurion yawn tears issue of the frightful internal wedding of the dulcet and the sour a ravishing rather of the latter by the former rolled off his muzzles now if you are not for insisting that a magnificent simile shall be composed of exactly the like notes in another octave you will catch the fine flavour of analogy and be wafted in a beat of wings across the scene of the application of the rev septimus barmby to mr victor radnor that he might enter the house in the guise of suitor for the hand of nesta victoria it is the excelling merit of similes and metaphors to spring us to vault over gaps and thickets and dreary places but as with the visits of immortals we must be ready to receive them beware moreover of examining them too scrupulously they have a trick of wearing to vapour if closely scanned let it be gratefully for their aid so far the comparison is absolute that mr barmby passed he was at liberty to pursue his quest victor could not explain how he had been brought to grant it he was at pains to conceal the bewilderment mr barmby had cast on him and make nataly see the smallness of the grant both of them were unwilling to lose barmby there was not the slightest fear about fredi he said and why should not poor barmby have his chance with the others in the race and his nataly knew that he hated to speak unkindly he could cry the negative like a crack of thunder in the city but such matters as these and a man pleading merely for the right to see the girl and pleading in a tone 'i assure you my love he touched chords' 'did he allude to advantages in the alliance with him' nataly asked smoothly 'his passion nothing else candid enough and he had a tone he has a tone you know it 's not what he said some allusion to belief in a favourable opinion of him encouragement on the part of the mama she would have him travelling with us i foresaw it' 'you were astonished when it came' 'we always are' victor taunted her softly with having encouraged mr barmby she had thought in her heart not seriously on a sigh of despondency that mr barmby espousing the girl would smooth a troubled prospect and a present resentment at her weakness rendered her shrewd to detect victor's cunning to cover his own a thing imaginable of him previously in sentimental matters yet never accurately and so legibly printed on her mind it did not draw her to read him with a novel familiarity it drew her to be more sensible of foregone intimations of the man he was irresistible in attack not impregnably defensive nor did he seem in this instance humanely considerate if mademoiselle's estimate of the mind of the girl was not wrong then mr barmby's position would be both a ridiculous and a cruel one she had some silly final idea that the poor man might now serve permanently to check the more dreaded applicant a proof that her ordinary reflectiveness was blunted nataly acknowledged after rallying victor for coming to have his weakness condoned a justice in his counter accusation of a loss of her natural cheerfulness and promised amendment with a steely smile that his lips mimicked fondly and her smile softened to strengthen the dear soul's hopes he spoke as one who had received the latest information of dr themison and surgeons little conscious of the tragic depths he struck or of the burden he gave her heart to bear her look alarmed him she seemed to be hugging herself up to the tingling scalp and was in a moment marble to sight and touch she looked like the old engravings of martyrs taking the bite of the jaws of flame at the stake he held her embraced feeling her body as if it were in the awful grip of fingers from the outside of life the seizure was over before it could be called ominous when it was once over and she had smiled again and rebuked him for excessive anxiety his apprehensions no longer troubled him but subsided sensationally in wrath at the crippled woman who would not obey the dictate of her ailments instantly to perish and spare this dear one annoyance subsequently later than usual he performed his usual mental penance for it in consequence the wrath and the wish and the penitence haunted him each swelling to possession of him in turn until they united to head a plunge into retrospects which led to his reviewing the army of charges against mrs burman and of this he grew ashamed attributing it to the morbid indulgence in reflection a disease never afflicting him anterior to the stupid fall on london bridge he rubbed instinctively for the punctilio bump and could cheat his fancy to think a remainder of it there just below half an inch to the right of the spot where a phrenologist invited by nataly in old days had marked philo progenitiveness on his capacious and enviable cerebrum he knew well it was a fancy but it was a fact also that since the day of the fall never save in merest glimpses before that day he had taken to look behind him as though an eye had been knocked in the back of his head then was that day of the announcement of lakelands to nataly to be accounted a gloomy day he would not have it so she was happily occupied with her purchases of furniture fredi with her singing lessons and he with his business a grasp of many ribands reining in or letting loose always enjoyable in the act recently only had he known when at home a relaxation a positive pleasure in looking forward to the hours of the city office this was odd but so it was and looking homeward from the city he had a sense of disappointment when it was not concert evening the cormyns the yatts and priscilla graves and pempton foolish fellow and that bothering barmby and peridon and catkin were the lineing of his nest well and so they had been before lakelands rose what had induced he suddenly felt foreign to himself the shrouded figure of his lost idea on london bridge went by a peep into the folds of the shroud was granted him is it a truth that if we are great owners of money we are so swollen with a force not native to us as to be precipitated into acts the downright contrary of our tastes he inquired it of his tastes which have the bad habit of unmeasured phrasing when they are displeased and so they yield no rational answer still he gave heed to violent extraneous harpings against money epigrams of colney's abuse of it and the owners of it by socialist orators reported in some newspaper corner had him by the ears they ceased in the presence of lady grace halley who entered his office to tell him she was leaving town for whinfold her husband's family seat where the dear man lay in evil case she signified her resignation to the decrees from above saying generously 'you look troubled my friend any bad city news' 'i look troubled' victor said laughing and bethought him of what the trouble might be 'city news would not cause the look ah yes i was talking in the street to a friend of mine on horseback the other day and he kept noticing his horse's queer starts we spied half a dozen children in the gutter at the tail of the horse one of them plucking at a hair please sir may i have a hair out of your horse's tail said the mite we patted the poor horse that grew a tail for urchins to pluck at men come to the fathers about their girls it's my belief that mothers more easily say no if they learn the word as maids you'll say however there's no fear about my girl fredi's hard to snare and what brings you cityward' 'i want to know whether i shall do right in selling out of the tiddler mine' 'you have multiplied your investment by ten' 'if it had been thousands' 'clearly you sell always jump out of a mounted mine unless you're at the bottom of it' 'there are city articles against the mine this morning or i should have been on my way to whinfold at this moment the shares are lower' 'the merry boys are at work to bring your balloon to the ground that you may quit it for them to ascend tiddler has enemies like the best of mines or they may be named lovers if you like and mines that have gone up go down for a while before they rise again it's an affair of undulations rocket mines are not so healthy the stories are false for the time i had the latest from dartrey fenellan yesterday he's here next month some time in august' 'he is married is he not' 'was' victor's brevity sounded oddly to lady grace 'is he not a soldier' she said 'soldiers and parsons' victor interjected now she saw she understood the portent of mr barmby's hovering offer of the choice of songs and the recent tremulousness of the welling bethesda but she had come about her own business and after remarking that when there is a prize there must be competition or england will have to lower her flag she declared her resolve to stick to tiddler exclaiming 'it's only in mines that twenty times the stake is not a dream of the past' 'the riviera green field on the rock is always open to you' said victor she put out her hand to be taken 'not if you back me here it really is not gambling when yours is the counsel i follow and if i'm to be a widow i shall have to lean on a friend gifted like you i love adventure danger well if we two are in it just to see my captain in a storm and if the worst happens we go down together it 's the detestation of our deadly humdrum of modern life some inherited love of fighting' 'say brandy' 'does not mr durance accuse you of an addiction to the brandy novel' 'colney may call it what he pleases if i read fiction let it be fiction airier than hard fact if i see a ballet my troop of short skirts must not go stepping like pavement policemen i can't read dull analytical stuff or stylists when i want action if i'm to give my mind to a story i can supply the reflections i'm english if colney 's right in saying we always come round to the story with the streak of supernaturalism i don't ask for bloodshed that's what his brandy means' 'but mr durance is right we require a shedding i confess i expect it where there's love it's part of the balance and justifies one's excitement how otherwise do you get any real crisis i must read and live something unlike this flat life around us' 'there's the adam life and the macadam life fenellan says pass it in books but in life we can have quite enough excitement coming out of our thoughts no brandy there and no fine name for personal predilections or things done in domino' victor said with his very pleasant face pressing her hand to keep the act of long holding it in countenance and bring it to a well punctuated conclusion thinking involuntarily of the other fair woman whose hand was his and who betrayed a beaten visage despite or with that poor kind of trust in her captain but the thought was not guilty of drawing comparisons 'this is one that i could trust as captain or mate' he pressed the hand again before dropping it 'you judge entirely by the surface if you take me for a shifty person at the trial' said lady grace skepsey entered the room with one of his packets and she was reminded of trains and husbands she left victor uncomfortably rufed and how for she had none of the physical charms appealing peculiarly to the man who was taken with grandeur of shape she belonged rather to the description physically distasteful to him it is a critical comment on a civilization carelessly distilled from the jealous east when visits of fair women to city offices can have this effect if the sexes are separated for an hour the place where one is excluded or not common to see becomes inflammable to that appearing spark he does outrage to a bona dea she to the monasticism of the court of law and he and she awaken unhallowed emotions supposing however that western men were to de orientalize their gleeful notions of her and dis turk themselves by inviting the woman's voluble tongue to sisterly occupation there in the midst of the pleading court as in the domestic circle very soon would her eyes be harmless unless directed upon us with intent that is the burning core of the great question our armageddon in morality is she moral does she mean to be harmless is she not untamable old nature and when once on an equal footing with her lordly half would not the spangled beauty in a turn like the realistic transformation trick of a pantomime show herself to be that wanton old thing the empress of disorderliness you have to recollect as the conservative acutely suggests that her timidities at present urging her to support establishments pertain to her state of dependence the party views of conservatism are must be founded we should remember on an intimate acquaintance with her in the situations where she is almost unrestrictedly free and her laughter rings to confirm the sentences of classical authors and eastern sages conservatives know what they are about when they refuse to fling the last lattice of an ancient harem open to air and sun the brutal dispersers of mystery which would despoil an ankle of its flying wink victor's opinions were those of the entrenched majority objecting to the occult power of women as we have the women now while legislating to maintain them so and forbidding a step to a desperately wicked female world lest the step should be to wickeder his opinions were in the background rarely stirred but the lady had brought them forward and he fretted at his restlessness vexed that it should be due to the intrusion of the sex instead of to the charms of the individual no sting of the sort had bothered him he called to mind on board the channel boat nothing to speak of 'why does she come here why didn't she go to her husband she gets into the city scramble blindfold and catches at the nearest hand to help her out nice woman enough' yes but he was annoyed with her for springing sensations that ran altogether heartless to the object at the same time that they were disloyal to the dear woman their natural divinity and between him and that dear woman since the communication made by skepsey in the town of dreux nightly the dividing spirit of mrs burman lay cold as a corpse they both felt her there they kissed coldly pressed a hand said good night next afternoon the announcement by skepsey of the hon dudley sowerby surprised victor's eyebrows at least and caused him genially to review the visit of lady grace whether or not colney durance drew his description of a sunken nobility from the 'sick falcon' distinguishing the handsome features of mr sowerby that beaked invalid was particularly noticeable to victor during the statement of his case although the young gentleman was far from being one in colney's words to enliven the condition of domestic fowl with an hereditary turn for 'preying' eminently the reverse he was of good moral repute a worker a commendable citizen but there was the obligation upon him to speak it is expected in such cases if only as a formality of his 'love' hard to do even in view and near to the damsel's reddening cheeks it perplexed him he dropped a veil on the bashful topic his tone was the same as when he reverted to the material points his present income his position in the great bank of shotts and co his prospects the health of the heir to the cantor earldom he considered that he spoke to a member of the city merchants whose preference for the plain positive upon the question of an alliance between families by marriage lends them for once a resemblance to lords when a person is not read by character the position or profession is called on to supply raised print for the finger ends to spell hard on poor fredi was victor's thought behind the smile he bent on this bald cupid she deserved a more poetical lover his paternal sympathies for the girl besought in love revived his past feelings as a wooer nothing but a dread of the influence of mr barmby's toned eloquence upon the girl after her listening to dudley sowerby's addresses checked his contempt for the latter he could not despise the suitor he sided with against another and seemingly now a more dangerous unable quite to repress the sentiment he proceeded immediately to put it to his uses for we have no need to be scrupulously formal and precise in the exposition of circumstances to a fellow who may thank the stars if such a girl condescends to give him a hearing he had this idea through the conception of his girl's generosity and furthermore the cognizant eye of a lucretian alma mater having seat so strongly in victor demanded as a right an effusion of the promising amorous graces on the part of the acceptable applicant to the post of husband of that peerless these being absent evidently non existent it seemed sufficient for the present after the fashion of the young gentleman to capitulate the few material matters briefly they were dotted along with a fine disregard of the stateliness of the sum to be settled on nesta victoria and with a distant but burning wish all the while that the suitor had been one to touch his heart and open it inspiriting it as could have been done to disclose for good and all the things utterable victor loved clear honesty as he loved light and though he hated to be accused of not showing a clean face in the light he would have been moved and lifted to confess to a spot by the touch at his heart dudley sowerby's deficiencies however were outweighed by the palpable advantages of his birth his prospects and his good repute for conduct add thereto his gentlemanly manners victor sighed again over his poor fredi and in telling mr sowerby that the choice must be left to her he had the regrets of a man aware of his persuasive arts and how they would be used to think that he was actually making the choice observe how fatefully he who has a scheme is the engine of it he is no longer the man of his tastes or of his principles he is on a line of rails for a terminus and he may cast languishing eyes across waysides to right and left he has doomed himself to proceed with a self devouring hunger for the half desired probably manhood gone at the embrace of it this may be or not but nature has decreed to him the forfeit of pleasure she bids us count the passage of a sober day for the service of the morrow that is her system and she would have us adopt it to keep in us the keen edge for cutting which is the guarantee of enjoyment doing otherwise we lose ourselves in one or other of the furious matrix instincts we are blunt to all else young dudley fully agreed that the choice must be with miss radnor he alluded to her virtues her accomplishments he was waxing to fervidness he said he must expect competitors adding on a start that he was to say from his mother she in the case of an intention to present miss radnor at court victor waved hand for a finish looking as though his head had come out of hot water he sacrificed royalty to his necessities under a kind of sneer at its functions 'court my girl but the arduous duties are over for the season we are a democratic people retaining the seductions of monarchy as a friend says and of course a girl may like to count among the flowers of the kingdom for a day in the list of court presentations no harm only there's plenty of time very young girls have their heads turned though i don't say don't imagine my girl would by and by perhaps' dudley was ushered into mr inchling's room and introduced to the figure head of the firm of inchling pennergate and radnor a respectable city merchant indeed whom dudley could read off in a glimpse of the downright contrast to his partner he had heard casual remarks on the respectable city of london merchant from colney durance a short analytical gaze at him helped to an estimate of the powers of the man who kept him up mr inchling was a florid city feaster descendant of a line of city merchants having features for a wife to identify as drovers they tell us can single one from another of their round bellied beasts formerly the leader of the firm he was now after dreary fits of restiveness kickings false prophecies of ruin victor's obedient cart horse he sighed in set terms for the old days of the firm when like trouts in the current the firm had only to gape for shoals of good things to fatten it a tale of english prosperity in quiescence narrated interjectorily among the by ways of the city and wanting only metre to make it our national poem mr inchling did not deny that grand mangers of golden oats were still somehow constantly allotted to him his wife believed in victor and deemed the loss of the balancing pennergate a gain since that lamentable loss mr inchling under the irony of circumstances the tory of commerce had trotted and gallopped whither driven racing like mad against his will and the rival nations now in the field to force the pace a name for enterprise the close commercial connection of a man who speculated who to put it plainly lived on his wits hurried onward and onward always doubting munching grumbling at satisfaction in perplexity of the gratitude which is apprehensive of black nemesis at a turn of the road to confound so wild a whip as victor radnor he had never forgiven the youth's venture in india of an enormous purchase of cotton many years back and which he had repudiated though not his share of the hundreds of thousands realized before the refusal to ratify the bargain had come to victor mr inchling dated his first indigestion from that disquieting period he assented to the praise of victor's genius admitting benefits his heart refused to pardon and consequently his head wholly to trust the man who robbed him of his quondam comfortable feeling of security and if you will imagine the sprite of the aggregate english taxpayer personifying steam as the malignant who has despoiled him of the blessed safety assurance he once had from his god neptune against invaders you will comprehend the state of mr inchling's mind in regard to his terrific and bountiful but very disturbing partner he thanked heaven to his wife often that he had nothing to do with north american or south american mines and pastures or with south africa and gold and diamonds and a wife must sometimes listen mastering her inward comparisons dr schlesien had met and meditated on this example of the island energy mr inchling was not permitted by his wife to be much the guest of the radnor household because of the frequent meeting there with colney durance colney's humour for satire being instantly in bristle at sight of his representative of english city merchants 'over whom' as he wrote of the venerable body 'the disciplined and instructed germans not deviously march whom acute and adventurous americans with half a cock of the eye in passing compassionately outstrip' he and dr schlesien agreed upon mr inchling meantime the latter gentleman did his part at the tables of the wealthier city companies and retained his appearance of health he was beginning to think upon a calculation of the increased treasures of those companies and the country that we the taxpayer ought not to leave it altogether to providence to defend them notwithstanding the watchful care of us hitherto shown by our briny providence to save us from anxiety and expense but there are he said 'difficulties' and the very word could stop him as commonly when our difficulty lies in the exercise of thinking victor's african room containing large wall maps of auriferous regions was inspected and another where clerks were busy over miscellaneous continents dudley sowerby hoped he might win the maiden he and victor walked in company westward the shop of boyle and luckwort chemists was not passed on this occasion dudley grieved that he had to be absent from the next concert for practise owing to his engagement to his mother to go down to the family seat near tunbridge wells victor mentioned his relatives the duvidney maiden ladies residing near the wells they measured the distance between cronidge and moorsedge the two houses as for half an hour on horseback nesta told her father at home that the pair of them had been observed confidentially arm in arm and conversing so profoundly 'who do you think was the topic' victor asked she would not chase the little blue butterfly of a guess chapter xix treats of nature and circumstance and the dissension between them and of a satirist's malignity in the direction of his country there is at times in the hearts of all men of active life a vivid wild moment or two of dramatic dialogue between the veteran antagonists nature and circumstance when they whose business it should be to be joyfully one furiously split and the dame is up with her shrillest querulousness to inquire of her offspring for the distinct original motive of his conduct why did he bring her to such a pass and what is the gain if he be not an alienated issue of the great mother he will strongly incline to her view that he put himself into harness to join with a machine going the dead contrary way of her welfare and thereby wrote himself donkey for his present reading soldiers heroes even the braided even the wearers of the gay cock's feathers who get the honours and the pocket pieces know the moment of her electrical eloquence they have no answer for her save an index at the machine pushing them on yet farther under the enemy's line of fire where they pluck the golden wreath or the livid and in either case listen no more they glorify her topping wisdom while on the march to confound it she is wise in her way but it is asked by the disputant if we had followed her exclusively how far should we have travelled from our starting point we of the world and its prizes and duties must do her an injury to make her tongue musical to us and her argument worthy of attention so it seems how to keep the proper balance between those two testy old wranglers that rarely pull the right way together is as much the task for men in the grip of the world as for the wanton youthful fry under dominion of their instincts and probably when it is done man will have attained the golden age of his retirement from service why be scheming victor asked unlike the gallant soldiery his question was raised in the blush of a success from an examination of the quality of the thing won although it had not changed since it was first coveted it was demonstrably the same and an astonishing dry stick he held as a reward for perpetual agitations and perversions of his natural tastes here was a dudley sowerby the direct issue of the conception of lakelands if indeed they were not conceived together in one and the young gentleman had moral character good citizen substance and station rank prospect of a title and the grasp of him was firm yet so far was it from hearty that when hearing a professed satirist like colney durance remark on the decorous manner of dudley's transparent courtship of the girl under his look of an awakened approval of himself that he appeared to be asking everybody do you not think i bid fair for an excellent father of philistines victor had a nip of spite at the thought of dudley's dragging him bodily to be the grandfather poor fredi too necessarily the mother condemned by her hard fate to feel proud of philistine babies though women soon get reconciled to it or do they they did once what if his fredi turned out one of the modern young women who have drunk of ideas he caught himself speculating on that as on a danger the alliance with dudley really seemed to set him facing backward colney might not have been under prompting of nataly when he derided dudley but victor was at war with the picture of her in her compression of a cruel laugh while her eyelids were hard shut as if to exclude the young patriarch of philistines' ridiculous image he hearkened to the nature interrogating him why had he stepped on a path to put division between himself and his beloved the smallest of gaps and still the very smallest between nuptial lovers is a division and that may become a mortal wound to their one life why had he roused a slumbering world glimpses of the world's nurse like old fashioned mother nightcap benevolence to its kicking favourites its long suffering tolerance for the heroic breakers of its rough cast laws while the decent curtain continues dropped or lifted only ankle high together with many scenes lively suggestions of the choice of ways he liked best told of things which were better things incomprehensibly forfeited so that the plain sense of value insisted on more than one weighing of the gain in hand a dubious measure he was as little disposed to reject it as to stop his course at a goal of his aim nevertheless a gain thus poorly estimated could not command him to do a deed of humiliation on account of it the speaking to this dry young dudley was not imperative at present a word would do in the day to come nataly was busy with her purchases of furniture and the practise for the great august concert he dealt her liberal encouragements up to the verge of dr themison's latest hummed words touching mrs burman from which he jumped in alarm lest he should paralyze her again the dear soul's dreaded aspect of an earthy pallor was a spectre behind her cheeks ready to rush forth fenellan brought carling to dine with him and themison was confirmed by carting with incidents in proof caning by jarniman also with incidents one very odd one or so it seemed in the fury of the first savour of it she informed jarniman skepsey said his friend jarniman said that she had dreamed of making her appearance to him on the night of the rd august and of setting the date on the calendar over his desk when she entered his room 'sitting room not bedroom she was always quite the lady' skepsey reported his jarniman mrs burman as a ghost would respect herself she would keep to her character jarniman quite expected the dream to be verified she was a woman of her word he believed she had received a revelation of the approaching fact he was preparing for the scene victor had to keep silent and discourse of general prosperity his happy vivaciousness assisted him to feel it by day nataly heard him at night on a moan 'poor soul' and loudly once while performing an abrupt demi vault from back to side 'perhaps now' in a voice through doors she schooled herself to breathe equably not being allowed to impart the distressing dose of comfort he was charged with he swallowed it himself and these were the consequences and an uneasy sleep was traditionally a matter for grave debate in the radnor family the duvidney ladies dorothea and virginia would have cited ancestral names showing it to be the worst of intimations at night lying on his back beneath a weight of darkness one heavily craped figure distinguishable through the gloom as a blot on a black pad accused the answering darkness within him until his mind was dragged to go through the whole case by morning light and the compassionate man appealed to common sense to stamp and pass his delectable sophistries as that it was his intense humaneness which exposed him to an accusation of inhumanity his prayer for the truly best to happen which anticipated mrs burman's expiry they were simple sophistries fabricated to suit his needs readily taking and bearing the imprimatur of common sense they refreshed him as a chemical scent a crowded room all because he could not open his breast to nataly by reason of her feebleness or feel enthusiasm in the possession of young dudley a dry stick indeed beside him on the walk westward good quality wood no doubt but dry varnished for conventional uses poor dear fredi would have to crown it like the may day posy of the urchins of craye farm and creckholt dudley wished the great city merchant to appreciate him as a diligent student of commercial matters rivalries of banks foreign and municipal loans american rails and argentine new companies of wholesome appearance or sinister or starting with a dram in the stomach or born to bleat prostrate like sheep on their backs in a ditch trusts and founders breweries bursting vats upon the markets and england prone along the gutters gobbling drunk for shares and sober in the possession of certain of them but when as colney says a grateful england has conferred the lordship on her brewer he gratefully hands over the establishment to his country and both may disregard the howls of a salvation army of shareholders beaten by the germans in brewery too dr schlesien has his right to crow we were ahead of them and they came and studied us and they studied chemistry as well while we went on down our happy go lucky old road and then had to hire their young professors and then to import their beer have the germans more brains than we english victor's blood up to the dome of his cranium knocked the patriotic negative but as old colney says and bother him for constantly intruding the comfortably successful have the habit of sitting and that dulls the brain yet more than it eases the person hence are we outpaced we have now to know we are racing victor scored a mark for one of his projects a well conducted journal of the sharpest pens in the land might at a sacrifice of money grandly sunk expose to his english how and to what degree their sports and their fierce feastings and their opposition to ideas and their timidity in regard to change and their execration of criticism applied to themselves and their unanimous adoption of it for a weapon against others are signs of a prolonged indulgence in the cushioned seat victor saw it but would the people he loved he agreed with colney forgetting the satirist's venom to wit that the journalists should be close under their editor's rod to put it in sound bold english no metaphors no similes nor flowery insubstantiality but honest saxon manger stuff and put it repeatedly in contempt of the disgust of iteration hammering so a soft place on the anglican skull which is rubbed in consequence and taught at last through soreness to reflect a journal with colney durance for editor and called conformably the whipping top why not if it exactly hits the signification of the journal and that which it would have the country do to itself to keep it going and truly topping for there is no vulgarity in a title strongly signifying the intent victor wrote it at night naming colney for editor with a sum of his money to be devoted to the publication in a form of memorandum and threw it among the papers in his desk young dudley had a funny inquisitiveness about dartrey fenellan owing to fredi's reproduction or imitation of her mother's romantic sentiment for dartrey doubtless a bit of jealousy indicating that the dry fellow had his feelings victor touched off an outline of dartrey's history and character the half brother of simeon considerably younger and totally different 'dartrey's mother was lady charlotte kiltorne one of the clanconans better mother than wife perhaps and no reproach on her not a shadow only she made the general's bank notes fly black paper and if you 're for heredity the queer point is that simeon whose mother was a sober minded woman has always been the spendthrift dartrey married one of the hennen women all an odd lot all handsome i met her once colney said she came up here with a special commission from the prince of darkness there are women who stir the unholy in men whether they mean it or not you know' dudley pursed to remark that he could not say he did know and good for fredi if he did not know and had his objections to the knowledge but he was like the men who escape colds by wrapping in comforters instead of trusting to the spin of the blood 'she played poor dartrey pranks before he buried he behaved well to her and that says much for him he has a devil of a temper i 've seen the blood in his veins mount to cracking but there's the man because she was a woman he never let it break out with her and by heaven he had cause she couldn't be left she tricked him and she loved him passionately i believe you don't understand women loving the husband they drag through the mire' dudley did not he sharpened his mouth 'buried you said sir a widower' 'i've no positive information we shall hear when he comes back' victor replied hurriedly 'he got a drenching of all the damns in the british service from his generalissimo one day at a review for a trooper's negligence button or stock missing or something and off goes dartrey to his hut and breaks his sword and sends in his resignation good soldier lost and i can't complain he has been a right hand man to me over in africa but a man ought to have some control of his temper especially a soldier' dudley put emphasis into his acquiescence 'worse than that temper of dartrey's he can't forgive an injury he bears a grudge against his country you've heard colney durance abuse old england it's three parts factitious literary exercise it 's milk beside the contempt of dartrey's shrug he thinks we're a dead people if a people subsisting on our fat as colney says' 'i am not of opinion that we show it' observed dudley 'we don't' victor agreed he disrelished his companion's mincing tone of a monumental security and yearned for dartrey or simeon or colney to be at his elbow rather than this most commendable of orderly citizens who little imagined the treacherous revolt from him in the bosom of the gentleman cordially signifying full agreement but dudley was not gifted to read behind words and looks they were in the park of the dwindling press of carriages and here was this young dudley saying quite commendably 'it's a pity we seem to have no means of keeping our parks select' victor flung simeon fenellan at him in thought he remembered a fable of fenellan's about a society of the blest and the salt it was to them to discover an intruder from below and the consequent accelerated measure in their hymning 'have you seen anything offensive to you' he asked 'one sees notorious persons' dudley spoke aloof from them 'out of his cold attics' fenellan would have said victor approved with the deadened feeling common to us when first in sad earnest we consent to take life as it is he perceived too the comicality of his having to resign himself to the fatherly embrace of goodness lakelands had him fast and this young dudley was the kernel of lakelands if he had only been intellectually a little flexible in his morality but no he wore it cap a pie like a mediaeval knight his armour one had to approve and there was no getting away from him he was good enough to stay in town for the practise of the opening overture of the amateurs and the flute duet when his family were looking for him at tunbridge wells and almost every day victor was waylaid by him at a corner of the strand occasionally victor appeared at the point of interception armed with colney durance for whom he had called in the temple bent on self defence although colney was often as bitter to his taste as to dudley's latterly the bitter had become a tonic we rejoice in the presence of goodness let us hope and still an impersonation of conventional goodness perpetually about us depresses dudley drove him to colney for relief besides it pleased nataly that he should be bringing colney home it looked to her as if he were subjecting dudley to critical inspection before he decided a certain question much and foolishly dreaded by the dear soul that quieted her and another thing she liked him to be with colney for a clog on him as it were a tuning fork for the wild airs he started a little pessimism also she seemed to like probably as an appeasement after hearing and having to share high flights and she was in her queer woman's way always reassured by his endurance of colney's company she read it to mean that he could bear colney's perusal of him and satiric stings victor had seen these petty matters among the various which were made to serve his double and treble purposes now thanks to the operation of young dudley within him he felt them preferring fenellan's easy humour to colney's acid he was nevertheless braced by the latter's antidote to dudley while reserving his entire opposition in the abstract for victor radnor and colney durance were the optimist and pessimist of their society they might have headed those tribes in the country at a period when the omnibus of the world appears to its quaint occupants to be going faster men are shaken into the acceptation if not performance of one part or the other as it is dictated to them by their temperaments compose the parts and you come nigh to the meaning of the nineteenth century the mother of these gosling affirmatives and negatives divorced from harmony and awakened by the slight increase of incubating motion to vitality victor and colney had been champion duellists for the rosy and the saturnine since the former cheerfully slaved for a small stipend in the city of his affection and the latter entered on an inheritance counted in niggard hundreds that withdrew a briefless barrister disposed for scholarship from the forlornest of seats in the courts they had foretold of one another each the unfulfilled each claimed the actual as the child of his prediction victor was to have been ruined long back colney the prey of independent bachelors colney had escaped his harpy and victor could be called a millionaire and more prophesy was crowned by colney's dyspepsia by victor's ticklish domestic position their pity for one another their warm regard was genuine only they were of different temperaments and we have to distinguish that in many estimable and some gifted human creatures it is the quality of the blood which directs the current of opinion victor played off colney upon dudley for his internal satisfaction and to lull nataly and make her laugh but he could not as she hoped he was doing take colney into his confidence inasmuch as the optimist impelled by his exuberant anticipatory trustfulness is an author and does things whereas the pessimist is your chaired critic with the delivery of a censor generally an undoer of things our optimy has his instinct to tell him of the cast of pessimy's countenance at the confession of a dilemma foreseen he hands himself to pessimy as it were a sugar cane for the sour brute to suck the sugar and whack with the wood but he cannot perform his part in return he gets no compensation pessimy is invulnerable you waste your time in hurling a common 'tu quoque' at one who hugs the worst the three walking in the park with their bright view and black view and neutral view of life were a comical trio they had come upon the days of the unfanned electric furnace proper to london's early august when it is not pipeing march victor complacently bore heat as well as cold but young dudley was a drought and colney a drug to refresh it and why was he stewing in london it was for this young dudley who resembled a london of the sparrowy roadways and wearisome pavements and blocks of fortress mansions by chance a water cart spirting a stale water or a london of the farewell dinner parties where london's professed anecdotist lays the dust with his ten times told why was not nataly relieved of her dreary round of the purchases of furniture they ought all now to be in switzerland or tyrol nesta had of late been turning over leaves of an illustrated book of tyrol dear to her after a run through the innthal to the dolomites one splendid august and she and nataly had read there of hofer speckbacker haspinger and wrath had filled them at the meanness of the corsican who posed after it as victim on st helena's rock the scene in grey dawn on mantua's fortress walls blasting him in the courts of history when he strikes for his pathetic sublime victor remembered how he had been rhetorical as the mouthpiece of his darlings but he had in memory prominently now the many glorious pictures of that mountain land beckoning to him waving him to fly forth from the london oven lo the tyrolese limestone crags with livid peaks and snow lining shelves and veins of the crevices and folds of pinewood undulations closed by a shoulder of snow large on the blue and a dazzling pinnacle rising over green pasture alps the head of it shooting aloft as the blown billow high off a broken ridge and wide armed in its pure white shroud beneath tranced but all motion in immobility to the heart in the eye a splendid image of striving up to crowned victory and see the long valley sweeps of the hanging meadows and maize and lower vineyards and central tall green spires walking beside young dudley conversing observing too victor followed the trips and twists of a rill that was lured a little further down through scoops ducts and scaffolded channels to serve a wainwright he heard the mountain song of the joyful water a wren robin thrush on the dance down of a faun till it was caught and muted and the silver foot slid along the channel swift as moonbeams through a cloud with an air of 'whither you will so it be on' happy for service as in freedom then the yard of the inn below and the rillwater twirling rounded through the trout trough subdued still lively for its beloved onward dues to business dues to pleasure a wedding of the two and the wisest on earth eh like some one we know and nataly has made the comparison fresh forellen for lunch rhyming to fenellan he had said to her and that recollection struck the day to blaze for his friend was a ruined military captain living on a literary quill at the time and nataly's tender pleading 'could you not help to give him another chance dear victor' signifying her absolute trust in his ability to do that or more or anything had actually set him thinking of the insurance office which he started to prosperity and fenellan in it previously an untutored rill of the mountains if ever was one useless to be dwelling on holiday pictures lakelands had hold of him colney or somebody says that the greater our successes the greater the slaves we become but we must have an aim my friend and success must be the aim of any aim yes and says colney you are to rejoice in the disappointing miss which saved you from being damned by your bullet on the centre you're dead against nature old colney that is to carry the flag of liberty by clipping a limb victor overcame the pessimist in his own royal cranium court he entertained a pronounced dissension with bachelors pretending to independence it could not be argued publicly and the more the pity for a slight encouragement he would have done it his outlook over the waves of bachelors and by present conditions mostly constrained spinsters and another outlook midnight upon phlegethon to the thoughts of men made him deem it urgent and it helped the plea in his own excuse as colney pointed out to the son of nature that he had to admit was true he charged it upon mrs burman for twisting the most unselfish and noblest of his thoughts and he promised himself it was to cease on the instant when the circumstance which nature was remiss in not bringing about to day or to morrow had come to pass he could see his nataly's pained endurance beneath her habitual submission her effort was a poor one to conceal her dread of the day of the gathering at lakelands on the sunday previous to the day dr themison accompanied the amateurs by rail to wrensham to hear 'trial of the acoustics' of the concert hall they were a goodly company and there was fun in the railway carriage over colney's description of fashionable london's vast octopus malady monster who was letting the doctor fly to the tether of its longest filament for an hour plying suckers on him the while he had the look to general perception of a man but half escaped and as when the notes of things taken by the vision in front are being set down upon tablets in the head behind victor observed his look at nataly the look was like a door aswing revealing in concealing she was not or did not appear struck by it perhaps if observant she took it for a busy professional gentleman's holiday reckoning of the hours before the return train to his harness and his arrangements for catching it she was as she could be on a day of trial her enchanting majestic self again defying suspicions she was his true mate for breasting a world honoured in uplifting her her singing of a duet with nesta called forth dr themison's very warm applause he named the greatest of contraltos colney did better service than fenellan at the luncheon table he diverted nataly and captured dr themison's ear with the narrative of his momentous expedition of european emissaries to plead the cause of their several languages at the court of japan a satiric serial tale that hit incidentally the follies of the countries of europe and intentionally one had to think those of old england nesta set him going just when he was about to begin she made her father laugh by crying out in a rapture 'oh delphica' for she was naughtily aware of dudley sowerby's distaste for the story and disgust with the damsel delphica nesta gave dr themison the preliminary sketch of the grand object of the expedition indeed one of the eminent ones of the world matter for an epic though it is to be feared that our part in it will not encourage a cis atlantic bard to america the honours from beginning to end belong so then japan has decided to renounce its language for the adoption of the language it may choose among the foremost famous european tongues japan becomes the word for miraculous transformations of a whole people at the stroke of a wand and let our english enrol it as the most precious of the powerful verbs an envoy visits the principal seats of learning in europe he is of a gravity to match that of his unexampled and all but stupefying mission a fluent linguist yet an englishman the slight american accent contracted during a lengthened residence in the united states is no bar to the patriotism urging him to pay his visit of exposition and invitation from the japanese court to the distinguished doctor of divinity dr bouthoin the renown of dr bouthoin among the learned of japan has caused the special invitation to him a scholar endowed by an ample knowledge and persuasive eloquence to cite and instance as well as illustrate the superior advantages to japan and civilization in the filial embrace of mother english 'for to this it must come predestinated' says the astonishing applicant 'we seem to see a fitness in it' says the cogitative rev doctor 'and an island england in those waters will do wonders for commerce' adds the former 'we think of things more pregnant' concludes the latter with a dry gleam of ecclesiastical knowingness and let the editor of the review upon his recent pamphlet and let the prelate reprimanding him and let the newspapers criticizing his pure saxon have a care funds universally the most convincing of credentials are placed at dr bouthoin's disposal only it is requested that for the present the expedition be secret 'better so' says pure saxon's champion on a day patented for secresy and swearing in the whole american continent through the cables to keep the secret by declaring the patent the rev dr bouthoin accompanied by his curate the rev mancate semhians stumbling across portmanteaux crammed with lexicons and dictionaries and other tubes of the voice of hermes takes possession of berths in the ship polypheme bound as they mutually conceive for the biggest adventure ever embarked on by a far thoughted high thoughted patriotic pair speaking pure saxon or other colney with apologies to his hearers avoided the custom of our period called the realistic to create when casual opportunity offers a belief in the narrative by promoting nausea in the audience he passed under veil the rev doctor's acknowledgement of neptune's power and the temporary collapse of mr semhians proceeding at once to the comments of these high class missionaries on the really curious inquisitiveness of certain of the foreign passengers on board he introduced to them the indisputably learned the very argumentative crashing arrogant pedantic dogmatic philological german gentleman dr gannius reeking of the teutonic professor as a library volume of its leather with him is his fairhaired artless daughter delphica an interesting couple for the beguilement of a voyage she so beautifully moderates his irascible incisiveness yet there is a strange tone that they have what then of the polite the anecdotic gallic m falarique who studiously engages the young lady in colloquy when mr semhians is agitating outside them to say a word what of that outpouring explosive equally voluble uncontrolled m bobinikine a mongol russian shaped featured hued like the pot boiled round and tight young dumpling of our primitive boyhood which smokes on the dish from the pot and what of another hitherto unnoticed whose nose is of the hooked vulturine whose name transpires as pisistratus mytharete he hears dr bouthoin declaim some lines of homer and beseeches him for the designation of that language greek is it greek of the asiatic ancient days of the beginning of the poetic chants dr gannius crashes cachinnation dr bouthoin caps himself with the offended don mr semhians opens half an eye and a whole mouth there must be a mystery these two exclaim to one another in privacy delphica draws mr semhians aside blushing over his white necktie like the coast of labrador at the transient wink of its jack in the box apollo mr semhians faintly tells of a conversation he has had with the ingenuous fair one and she ardent as he for the throning of our incomparable saxon english in the mouths of the races of mankind strange she partly suspects the frenchman the russian the attentive silent greek to be all of them bound for the court of japan concurrents can it be we are absolutely to enter on a contention with rivals dr bouthoin speaks to dr gannius he is astonished he says he could not have imagined it 'have you ever imagined anything' dr gannius asks him entomologist botanist palaeontologist philologist and at sound of horn a ready regimental corporal dr gannius wears good manners as a pair of bath slippers to rally and kick his old infant of an englishman who in awe of his later renown and manifest might makes it a point of discretion to be ultra amiable for he certainly is not in training he has no alliances and he must diplomatize and the german is a strong one a relative too he is the saxon's cousin to say the least this german has the habit of pushing past politeness to carry his argumentative war into the enemy's country and he presents on all sides a solid rampart of recent great deeds done and mailed readiness for the doing of more if we think of assailing him in that way we are really like the poor beasts which have cast their shells or cases helpless flesh to his beak so we are cousinly whether more amused than amazed we know not dr gannius hears from 'our simpleton of the pastures' as he calls the rev doctor to his daughter that he and mr semhians have absolutely pushed forth upon this most mighty of enterprises naked of any backing from their government babes in the wood that they are 'a la grace de dieu' at every turn that cries for astutia they show no sign or symbol of english arms behind them to support and with the grandest of national prizes in view the pleading oration before the court of the elect erudites we will call them of an intelligent yet half barbarous people hesitating these between eloquence and rival eloquence cunning and rival cunning why in such a case the shadow nimbus of force is needed to decide the sinking of the scale but have these english never read their shakespeare that they show so barren an acquaintance with human to say nothing of semi barbaric nature but it is here that we germans prove our claim to being the sons of his mind dr gannius in contempt throws off the mask he also is a concurrent and not only is he the chosen by election of the chief universities of his land he has behind him as athene dilating achilles the clenched fist of the prince of thunder and lightning of his time german japan shall be he publicly swears before them all m falarique damascenes his sharpest smile m bobinikine double dimples his puddingest m mytharete rolls a forefinger over his beak dr bouthoin enlarges his eye on a sunny mote and such is the masterful effect of a frank diplomacy that when one party shows his hand the others find the reverse of concealment in hiding their own dr bouthoin and mr semhians are compelled to suspect themselves to be encompassed with rivals presumptively supported by their governments the worthy gentlemen had hoped to tumble into good fortune as in the blessed old english manner 'it has even been thus with us unhelped we do it' exclaims the rev doctor he is roused from dejection by hearing mr semhians shyly he has published verse tell of the fairtressed delphica's phosphorial enthusiasm for our galaxy of british poets assisted by mr semhians he begins to imagine that he has in the person of this artless devotee an ally who will through her worship of our poets by treachery to her sire a small matter sacrifice her guttural tongue by enabling him through the exercise of her arts charms intrigues also a small matter to obtain the first audience of the japanese erudites delphica with each of the rivals in turn is very pretty comedy she is aware that m falarique is her most redoubtable adversary by the time that the vast fleet of steamboats containing newspaper reporters is beheld from the decks of the polypheme puffing past sandy hook there colney left them for the next instalment of the serial nesta glanced at dudley sowerby she liked him for his pained frown at the part his countrymen were made to play but did wish that he would keep from expressing it in a countenance that suggested a worried knot and mischievously she said 'do you take to delphica' he replied with an evident sincerity 'i cannot say i do' had mr semhians been modelled on him 'one bets on the german of course with colney durance' victor said to dr themison leading him over the grounds of lakelands 'in any case the author teaches us to feel an interest in the rivals i want to know what comes of it' said the doctor 'there's a good opportunity one sees but mark me it will all end in satire upon poor old england according to colney we excel in nothing' 'i do not think there is a country that could offer the entertainment for which i am indebted to you to day' 'ah my friend and you like their voices the contralto' 'exquisite' dr themison had not spoken the name of radnor 'shall we see you at our next concert evening in town' said victor and hearing 'the privilege' mentioned his sharp bright gaze cleared to limpid 'you have seen how it stands with us here' at once he related what indeed dr themison had begun speculatively to think might be the case mrs burman radnor had dropped words touching a husband and of her desire to communicate with him in the event of her being given over to the surgeons she had said that her husband was a greatly gifted man setting her head in a compassionate swing this revelation of the husband soon after was filling and this mr radnor's comrade's manner of it was winning a not too self justifying tone not void of feeling for the elder woman with a manly eulogy of the younger who had flung away the world for him and borne him their one dear child victor took the blame wholly upon himself 'it is right that you should know' he said to the doctor's thoughtful posture and he stressed the blame and a flame shot across his eyeballs he brought home to his hearer the hurricane of a man he was in the passion indicating the subjection of such a temperament as this victor radnor's to trials of the moral restraints beyond his human power dr themison said 'would you we postpone that as long as we can but supposing the poor lady' victor broke in 'i see her wish i will' the clash of his answer rang beside dr themison's faltering query we are grateful when spared the conclusion of a sentence born to stammer if for that only the doctor pressed victor's hand warmly 'i may then convey some form of assurance that a request of the kind will be granted' he said 'she has but to call me to her' said victor stiffening his back chapter xx the great assembly at lakelands round the neighbourhood of lakelands it was known that the day of the great gathering there had been authoritatively foretold as fine by mr victor radnor and he delivered his prophecy in the teeth of the south western gale familiar to our yachting month and he really inspired belief or a kind of trust some supposing him to draw from reserves of observation some choosing to confide in the singularly winged sparkle of his eyes lady rodwell blachington did and young mrs blathenoy and mrs fanning they were enamoured of it and when women stand for hope and any worshipped man for promise nothing less than redoubled confusion of him dissolves the union even then they cling to it under an ejaculation that it might and should have been otherwise fancy partly has it otherwise in her caerulean home above the weeping so it is good at all points to prophecy with the aspect of the radiant day foretold a storm bearing battle overhead tore the night to pieces nataly's faith in the pleasant prognostic wavered beneath the crashes she had not much power of heart to desire anything save that which her bosom disavowed uproar rather appeased her calmness agitated she wished her beloved to be spared from a disappointment thinking he deserved all successes because of the rigours inflicted by her present tonelessness of blood and being her unresponsive manner with him was not due to lack of fire in the blood or a loss of tenderness the tender feeling under privations unwillingly imposed though willingly shared now suffused her reflections owing to a gratitude induced by a novel experience of him known as it may chance and as it does not always chance to both sexes in wedded intimacy here and there known to women whose mates are proved quick to compliance with delicate intuitions of their moods of nature a constant almost visible image of the dark thing she desired and was bound not to desire and was remorseful for desiring oppressed her a perpetual consequent warfare of her spirit and the nature subject to the thousand sensational hypocrisies invoked for concealment of its reviled brutish baseness held the woman suspended from her emotions she coldly felt that a caress would have melted her would have been the temporary rapture coldly she had the knowledge that the considerate withholding of it helped her spirit to escape a stain less coldly she thanked at heart her beloved for being a gentleman in their yoke it plighted them over flesh he talked to her on the pillow just a few sentences and unlike himself a word of city affairs 'that fellow blathenoy with his increasing multitude of bills at the bank must watch him there sit there regularly one rather likes his wife by the way if you see him near me to morrow praise the spanish climate don't forget he heads the subscription list of lady blachington's charity' victor chuckled at colney's humping of shoulders and mouth while the tempest seemed echoing a sulphurous pessimist 'if old colney had listened to me when india gave proof of the metal and south africa began heaving he'd have been a fairly wealthy man by now ha it would have genialized him a man may be a curmudgeon with money the rule is for him to cuddle himself and take a side instead of dashing at his countrymen all round and getting hated well colney popular can't be imagined but entertaining guests would have diluted his acid he has the six hundred or so a year he started old bachelor on add his miserable pay for essays literature of course he sours but don't let me hear of bachelors moralists there he sits at his temple chambers hatching epigrams pretends to have the office of critic honest old fellow as far as his condition permits i tell him it will be fine to morrow' 'you are generally right dear' nataly said her dropping breath was audible victor smartly commended her to slumber with heaven's blessing on her and a dose of soft nursery prattle he squeezed her hand he kissed her lips by day she heard him sigh settling himself into the breast of night for milk of sleep like one of the world's good children she could have turned to him to show him she was in harmony with the holy night and loving world but for the fear founded on a knowledge of the man he was it held her frozen to the semblance of a tombstone lady beside her lord in the aisle where horror kindles pitchy blackness with its legions at one movement verily it was the ghost of mrs burman come to the bed between them meanwhile the sun of victor radnor's popularity was already up over the extended circle likely to be drenched by a falsification of his daring augury though the scud flew swift and the beeches raved and the oaks roared and snarled and pine trees fell their lengths fine tomorrow to a certainty he had been heard to say the doubt weighed for something the balance inclined with the gentleman who had become so popular for he had done the trick so suddenly like a stroke of the wizard and was a real man not one of your spangled zodiacs selling for sixpence and hopping to a lucky hit laughed at nine times out of ten the reasoning went and it somewhat affected the mansion as well as the cottage that if he had become popular in this astonishing fashion after making one of the biggest fortunes of modern times he might he must have secret gifts 'you can't foretell weather' cried a pothouse sceptic but the workmen at lakelands declared that he had foretold it sceptics among the common folk were quaintly silenced by other tales of him being a whiff from the delirium attending any mention of his name how had he become suddenly so popular as to rouse in the mind of mr caddis the sitting member for the division of the county said to have the seat in his pocket a particular inquisitiveness to know the bearing of his politics mr radnor was rich true but these are days when wealthy men ambitious of notoriety do not always prove faithful to their class some of them are cunning to bid for the suffrages of the irresponsible recklessly enfranchised corruptible masses mr caddis if he had the seat in his pocket had it from the support of a class trusting him to support its interests he could count on the landowners on the clergy on the retired or retiring or comfortably cushioned merchants resident about wrensham on the many obsequious among electoral shopmen annually he threw open his grounds and he subscribed patronized did what was expected and he was not popular he was unpopular why but why was the sun of this rd august shining from its rise royally upon pacified enrolled and liveried armies of cloud more agreeable to earth's populations than his pinched appearance of the poor mopped red nose and melancholic rheumy eyelets on a january day undoubtedly victor radnor risked his repute of prophet yet his popularity would have survived the continuance of the storm and deluge he did this and the mystery puzzling the suspicious was nothing wonderful in addition to a transparent benevolence he spread a sort of assurance about him that he thought the better of the people for their thinking well of themselves it came first from the workmen at his house 'the right sort and no humbug likes you to be men' such a report made tropical soil for any new seed now it is a postulate to strengthen all poor commoners that not even in comparison with the highest need we be small unless we yield to think it of ourselves do but stretch a hand to the touch of earth in you and you spring upon combative manhood again from the basis where all are equal humanity's historians however tell us that the exhilaration bringing us consciousness of a stature is gas which too frequently has to be administered certes the cocks among men do not require the process they get it off the sight of the sun arising or a simple hen submissive but we have our hibernating bears among men our yoked oxen cab horses beaten dogs we have on large patches of these islands a saxon population much wanting assistance if they are not to feel themselves beaten driven caught by the neck yoked and heavyheaded blest then is he who gives them a sense of the pride of standing on legs beer ordinarily their solitary helper beneath the iron canopy of wealth is known to them as a bitter usurer it knocks them flat in their persons and their fortunes for the short spell of recreative exaltation they send up their rough glory round the name of the gentleman a stranger but their friend and never is friend to be thought of as a stranger who manages to get the holiday for wrensham and thereabout that they may hurl away for one jolly day the old hat of a doddered humbleness and trip to the strains of the internal music he has unwound says he is it a charity concert charity begins at home says he and if i welcome you gentry on behalf of the poor of london why it follows you grant me the right to make a beginning with the poor of our parts down here he puts it so no master nor mistress neither could refuse him why the workmen at his house were nigh pitching the contractors all sprawling on a strike and mr radnor takes train harangues 'em and rubs 'em smooth ten minutes by the clock they say and return train to his business in town by reason of good sense and feeling it was poor men don't ask for more a working man all the world over asks but justice and a little relaxation just a collar of fat to his lean mr caddis mp pursuing the riddle of popularity which irritated and repelled as constantly as it attracted him would have come nearer to an instructive presentment of it by listening to these plain fellows than he was in the line of equipages at a later hour of the day the remarks of the comfortably cushioned and wheeled though they be eulogistic to extravagance are vapourish when we court them for nourishment substantially they are bones to the cynical he heard enumerations of mr radnor's riches eclipsing his own past compute a merchant a holder of mines director of a mighty bank projector of running rails a princely millionaire and determined to be popular what was the aim of the man it is the curse of modern times that we never can be sure of our parliamentary seat not when we have it in our pockets the romans have left us golden words with regard to the fickleness of the populace we have our horace our juvenal we have our johnson and in this vaunted age of reason it is that we surrender ourselves into the hands of the populace panem et circenses mr caddis repeated it after his fathers his fathers and he had not headed them out of that original voracity there they were for moneyed legislators to bewail their appetites and it was an article of his legislation to keep them there pedestrian purchasers of tickets for the charity concert rather openly in an envelope of humour confessed to the bait of the radnor bread with bit of fun savoury rumours were sweeping across wrensham mr radnor had borrowed footmen of the principal houses about cartloads of provisions had been seen to come an immediate reward of a deed of benevolence is a thing sensibly heavenly and the five shilling tickets were paid for as if for a packet on the counter unacquainted with mr radnor although the reports of him struck a summons to their gastric juices resembling in its effect a clamorous cordiality they were chilled on their steps along the halfrolled new gravel roads to the house by seeing three tables of prodigious length where very evidently a feast had raged one to plump the people perhaps excessively courted by great gentlemen of late shopkeepers the villagers children these had been at it for two merry hours they had risen they were beef and pudding on legs in some quarters beer amiably manifest owing to the flourishes of a military band boys who had shaken room through their magical young corporations for fresh stowage darted out of a chasing circle to the crumbled cornucopia regretfully forsaken fifteen minutes back and buried another tart plenty still reigned it was the will of the master that it should we divert our attention resigned in stoic humour to the bill of the concert music handed us with our tickets at the park gates we have no right to expect refreshment we came for the music to be charitable signora bianca luciani of whom we have read almost to the hearing her enough to make the mistake at times the grand violinist durandarte forcibly detained on his way to america mr radnor sent him a blank cheque no so mr radnor besought him in person he is irresistible a great musician himself it is becoming quite the modern style we have now english noblemen who play the horn the fife the drum some say we may yet be merrie england again with our nobles taking the lead england's nobles as a musical band at the head of a marching and dancing population pictured happily an old conservative country that retained its members of aristocracy in the foremost places while subjecting them to downright uses their ancestors beholding them there would be satisfied on the point of honour perhaps enlivened by hearing them at fife and drum but middle class pedestrians having paid five shillings for a ticket to hear the music they love and not having full assurance of refreshment are often latterly satirical upon their superiors and over this country at least require the refreshment that the democratic sprouts in them may be reconciled with aristocracy do not listen to them further on the subject they vote safely enough when the day comes if there is no praetematurally strong pull the other way they perceive the name of the hon dudley sowerby fourth down the concert bill marked for a flute duet with mr victor radnor miss nesta victoria radnor accompanying at the piano it may mean do you want a whisper to suggest to you what it may mean the father's wealth is enormous the mother is a beautiful majestic woman in her prime and see she sings a wonderful voice and lower down a duet with her daughter violins and clarionet how funny something hungarian and in the second part schubert's ave maria oh when we hear that we dissolve she was a singer before he married her they say a lady by birth one of the first county families but it was a gift and she could not be kept from it and was going when they met and it was love the most perfect duet for him she abandoned the stage you must remember that in their young days the stage was many stages beneath the esteem entertained for it now domestic concerts are got up to gratify her a miss fredericks good old english name mr radnor calls his daughter freddy so mr taplow the architect says they are for modern music and ancient tannhauser wagner you see pergolese flute duet mercadante here we have him o durandarte air basque variations his own again senor durandarte mendelssohn encore him and he plays you a national piece a dark little creature a life guardsman could hold up on his outstretched hand for the fifteen minutes of the performance but he fills the hall and thrills the heart wafts you to heaven and does it as though he were conversing with his andalusian lady love in easy whispers about their mutual passion for spanish chocolate all the while so the musical critic of the tirra lirra says express trains every half hour from london all the big people of the city mr radnor commands them like royalty totally different from that old figure of the wealthy city merchant young vigorous elegant a man of taste highest culture speaks the languages of europe patron of the arts a perfect gentleman his mother was one of the montgomerys mr taplow says and it was general radnor a most distinguished officer dying knighted but mr victor radnor would not take less than a barony and then only with descent of title to his daughter in her own right mr taplow had said as much as victor radnor chose that he should say carriages were in flow for an hour pedestrians formed a wavy coil judgeing by numbers the entertainment was a success would the hall contain them marvels were told of the hall every ticket entered and was enfolded almost all had a seat chivalry stood it is a breeched abstraction sacrificeing voluntarily and genially to the fair for a restoring of the balance between the sexes that the division of good things be rather in the fair ones' favour as they are to think with the warning to them that the establishment of their claim for equality puts an end to the priceless privileges of petticoats women must be mad to provoke such a warning and the majority of them submissively show their good sense they send up an incense of perfumery all the bouquets of the chemist commingled most nourishing to the idea of woman in the nose of man they are a forest foliage rustle of silks and muslins magic interweaving or the mythology if you prefer it see hear smell they are juno venus hebe to you we must have poetry with them otherwise they are better in the kitchen is there but there is not there is not present one of the chivalrous breeched who could prefer the shocking emancipated gristly female which imposes propriety on our sensations and inner dreams by petrifying in the tender bud of them colonel corfe is the man to hear on such a theme he is a colonel of companies but those are his diversion as the british army has been to the warrior puellis idoneus he is professedly a lady's man a rose beetle and a fine specimen of a common kind and he has been that thing that shining delight of the lap of ladies for a spell of years necessitating a certain sparkle of the saccharine crystals preserving him to conceal the muster he has to be fascinating or he would look outworn forlorn on one side of him is lady carmine on the other lady swanage dames embedded in the blooming maturity of england's conservatory their lords an earl a baron are of the lords who go down to the city to sow a title for a repair of their poor incomes and are to be commended for frankly accepting the new dispensation while they retain the many advantages of the uncancelled ancient thus gently does a maternal old england let them down projectors of companies directors founders railway magnates actual kings and nobles though one cannot yet persuade old reverence to do homage with the ancestral spontaneity to the uncrowned uncoroneted people of our sphere holders of shares in gold mines shares in afric's blue mud of the glittering teeth we draw for english beauty to wear in the ear on the neck at the wrist bankers and wives of bankers victor passed among them chatting right and left lady carmine asked him 'is durandarte counted on' he answered 'i made sure of the luciani' she serenely understood artistes are licenced people with a bohemian instead of the titular glitter for the bewildering of moralists as paste will pass for diamonds where the mirror is held up to nature by bold supernumeraries he wished to introduce nesta his girl was on the raised orchestral flooring nataly held her fast to a music scroll mr peridon sad for the absence and cause of absence of louise de seilles summoned in the morning abruptly to bourges where her brother lay with his life endangered by an accident at artillery practise mr peridon was generally conductor victor was to lead the full force of amateurs in the brisk overture to zampa he perceived a movement of nataly nesta and peridon 'they have come' he said he jumped on the orchestra boards and hastened to greet the luciani with durandarte in the retiring room his departure raised the whisper that he would wield the baton an opinion was unuttered his name for the flute duet with the hon dudley sowerby had not provoked the reserve opinion it seemed on the whole a pretty thing in him to condescend to do the sentiment he awakened was not flustered by it but the act of leading appeared as an official thing to do our soufe of sentiment will be seen subsiding under a breath without a repressive word to send it down sir rodwell blachington would have preferred radnor's not leading or playing either colonel corfe and mr caddis declined to consider such conduct english in a man of station notwithstanding royal highnesses who are at least partly english partly we say under our breath remembering our old ideal of an english gentleman in opposition to german tastes it is true that the whole country is changeing decomposing the colonel fished for lady carmine's view and lady swanage too both of the distinguished ladies approved of mr radnor's leading for a leading off women are pleased to see their favourite in the place of prominence as long as fortune swims him unbuffeted or one should say unbattered up the mounting wave besides these ladies had none of the colonel's remainder of juvenile english sense of the manly his adolescent's intolerance of the eccentric suspicion and contempt of any supposed affectation which was not ostentatiously stalkingly practised to subdue the sex and you cannot wield a baton without looking affected and at one of the colonel's clubs in town only five years back an english musical composer who had not then made his money now by the mystery of events knighted had been he makes now fifteen thousand a year black balled 'fiddler no can't admit a fiddler to associate on equal terms with gentlemen' only five years back and at present we are having the fiddler everywhere a sprinkling of the minor ladies also would have been glad if mr radnor had kept himself somewhat more exclusive dr schlesien heard remarks upon which his weighty teutonic mind sat crushingly do these english care one bit for music for anything finer than material stuffs what that man durance calls 'their beef their beer and their pew in eternity' his wrath at their babble and petty brabble doubted that they did but they do art has a hold of them they pay for it and the thing purchased grapples it will get to their bosoms to breathe from them in time entirely overcoming the taste for feudalism which still a little objects to see their born gentleman acting as leader of musicians a people of slow movement developing tardily their country is wanting in the distincter features from being always in the transitional state like certain sea fish rolling head over you know not head from tail without the welsh irish scot in their composition there would not be much of the yeasty ferment but it should not be forgotten that welsh irish scot are now largely of their numbers and the taste for elegance and for spiritual utterance for song nay for ideas is there among them though it does not everywhere cover a rocky surface to bewitch the eyes of aliens like louise de seilles and dr schlesien for example aliens having no hostile disposition toward the people they were compelled to criticize honourably granting that this people has a great history even such has the lion with homer for the transcriber of his deeds but the gentle aliens would image our emergence from wildness as the unsocial spectacle presented by the drear menagerie lion alone or mated with hardly an animated moment save when the raw red joint is beneath his paw reminding him of the desert's pasture nevertheless where strength is there is hope it may be said more truly than of the breath of life which is perhaps but the bucket of breath muddy with the sediment of the well whereas we have in strength a hero if a malefactor whose muscles shall haul him up to the light he will prove worthy of when that divinity has shown him his uncleanness and when strength is not exercising you are sure to see satirists jump on his back dozens foreign and domestic are on the back of old england a tribute to our quality if at the same time an irritating scourge the domestic are in excess and let us own that their view of the potentate as an apathetic beast of power who will neither show the power nor woo the graces pretending all the while to be eminently above the beast and posturing in an inefficient mimicry of the civilized excites to satire colney durance had his excuses he could point to the chief creative minds of the country for generations as beginning their survey genially ending venomously because of an exasperating unreason and scum in the bubble of the scenes called social around them viola under his chin he gazed along the crowded hall which was to him a rich national pudding of the sycophants the hypocrites the burlies the idiots dregs of the depths and froth of the surface bowing to one that they may scorn another instituting a charity for their poorer fawning fellows to relieve their purses and assist them in tricking the world and their maker and so forth a tiresome tirade and as it was not on his lips but in the stomach of the painful creature let him grind that hurdy gurdy for himself his friend victor set it stirring victor had here what he aimed at how success derides ambition and for this he imperilled the happiness of the worthy woman he loved exposed her to our fen fogs and foul snakes of whom one or more might be in the assembly now all because of his insane itch to be the bobbing cork on the wave of the minute colney's rapid interjections condensed upon the habitual shrug at human folly just when victor fronting the glassy stare of colonel corfe tapped to start his orchestra through the lively first bars of the overture to zampa we soon perceive that the post mr radnor fills he thoroughly fills whatever it may be zampa takes horse from the opening we have no amateur conductor riding ahead violins 'cellos piano wind stops peridon catkin pempton yatt cormyn colney mrs cormyn dudley sowerby they are spirited on patted subdued muted raised rushed anew away held in hand in both hands not earnestness worn as a cloak but issuing we see not simply a leader of musicians a leader of men the halo of the millionaire behind assures us of a development in the character of england's merchant princes the homage we pay him flatters us a delightful overture masterfully executed ended too soon except that the programme forbids the ordinary interpretation of prolonged applause mr radnor is one of those who do everything consummately and we have a monition within that a course of spiritual enjoyment will rouse the call for bodily refreshment his genial nod and laugh and word of commendation to his troop persuade us oddly we know not how of provision to come at the door of the retiring room see he is congratulated by luciani and durandarte miss priscilla graves is now to sing a schumann down later it is a duet with the rev septimus barmby we have nothing to be ashamed of in her before an italian operatic singer ices after the first part is over chapter xxi dartrey fenellan had nataly and nesta known who was outside helping skepsey to play ball with the boys they would not have worked through their share of the performance with so graceful a composure even simeon fenellan was unaware that his half brother dartrey had landed in england dartrey went first to victor's office where he found skepsey packing the day's letters and circulars into the bag for the delivery of them at lakelands they sprang a chatter and they missed the last of the express trains which did not greatly signify skepsey said 'as it was a concert' to hear his hero talk was the music for him and he richly enjoyed the pacing along the railway platform arrived on the grounds they took opposite sides in a game of rounders at that moment tossing heads or tails for innings these boys were slovenly players and were made unhappy by skepsey's fussy instructions to them in smartness they had a stupid way of feeding the stick and they ran sprawling it concerned great britain for them to learn how to use their legs it was pitiful for the country to see how lumpish her younger children were dartrey knew his little man and laughed after warning him that his english would want many lessons before they stomached the mixture of discipline and pleasure so it appeared the pride of the boys in themselves their confidence enjoyment of the game were all gone and all were speedily out but skepsey who ran for the rounder with his coat off sharp as a porpoise and would have got it he had it in his grasp when at the jump just over the line of the goal a clever fling if ever was caught him a crack on that part of the human frame where sound is best achieved then were these young lumps transformed to limber lither merry fellows they rejoiced skepsey's heart they did everything better ran and dodged and threw in a style to win the nod from the future official inspector of games and amusements of the common people a deputy of the government proposed by skepsey to his hero with a deferential eagerness dartrey clapped him on the shoulder softly laughing 'system mr durance is right they must have system if they are to appreciate a holiday' skepsey said and he sent a wretched gaze around at the justification of some of the lurid views of mr durance in signs of the holiday wasted impoverishing the country's manhood in a small degree it may be argued but we ask can the country afford it while foreign nations are drilling their youth teaching them to be ready to move in squads or masses like the fist of a pugilist skepsey left it to his look to speak his thought he saw an enemy in tobacco the drowsiness of beer had stretched various hulks under trees ponderous cricket lumbered half alive flabby fun knocked up a yell and it was rather vexatious to see girls dancing in good time to the band music one had a male partner who hopped his loutish burlesque of the thing he could not do apparently too certainly none but the girls had a notion of orderly muscular exercise of what use are girls girls have their one mission on earth and let them be healthy by all means for the sake of it only they should not seem to prove that old england is better represented on the female side skepsey heard with a nip of spite at his bosom a small body of them singing in chorus as they walked in step arm in arm actually marched and to the rearward none of these girls heeding there were the louts at their burlesque of jigs and fisticuffs 'cherry ripe' was the song 'it's delightful to hear them' said dartrey skepsey muttered jealously of their having been trained the song which drew dartrey fenellan to the quick of an english home planted him at the same time in africa to hear it dewy on a parched forehead it fell england the shedding heaven he fetched a deep breath as of gratitude for vital refreshment he had his thoughts upon the training of our english to be something besides the machinery of capitalists and upon the country as a blessed mother instead of the most capricious of maudlin step dames he flicked his leg with the stick he carried said 'your master's the man to make a change among them old friend' and strolled along to a group surrounding two fellows who shammed a bout at single stick vacuity in the attack on either side contributed to the joint success of the defense they paused under inspection and dartrey said 'you're burning to give them a lesson skepsey' skepsey had no objection to his hero's doing so though at his personal cost the sticks were handed to them the crowd increased their rounders boys had spied them and came trooping to the scene skepsey was directed to hit in earnest his defensive attitude flashed and he was at head and right and left leg and giving point recovering thrusting madly and again at shoulder and thigh with bravos for reward of a man meaning business until a topper on his hat a cut over the right thigh and the stick in his middlerib told the spectators of a scientific adversary and loudly now the gentleman was cheered an undercurrent of warm feeling ran for the plucky little one at it hot again in spite of the strokes and when he fetched his master a handsome thud across the shoulder and the gentleman gave up and complimented him skepsey had applause he then begged his hero to put the previous couple in position through a few of the opening movements they were horribly sheepish at first meantime two boys had got hold of sticks and both had gone to work in skepsey's gallant style and soon one was howling he excused himself because of the funny bone situated in his case higher than usual up the arm and now the pair of men were giving and taking cuts to make a rhinoceros caper 'very well begin that way try what you can bear' said dartrey skepsey watched them in felicity for love of the fray pained by the disregard of science comments on the pretty play indicating a reminiscent acquaintance with it and the capacity for critical observations were started assaults wonderful tricks of a slashing life guardsman one spectator had witnessed at an exhibition in a london hall boxing too you may see displays of boxing still in places how about a prizefight with money on it eh but you don't expect men to stand up to be knocked into rumpsteaks for nothing no but it's they there bets right and that's a game gone to ruin along of outsiders but it always was and it always will be popular with englishmen great english names of young days before the wintry shadow of the law had blighted them received their withered laurels emulous boys were in the heroic posture good sparring does no hurt skepsey seized a likely lad dartrey another nature created the ring for them now then arms and head well up chest hearty shoulders down out with the right fist just below the level of the chin out with the left fist farther right out except for that bit of curve so and draw it slightly back for wary pussy at the spring firm you stand feeling the muscles of both legs left half a pace ahead right planted both stringy none of your milk pail looks show us jaw you bulldogs now then left from the shoulder straight at right of head good and alacrity called on vigour in skepsey's pupil dartrey's had the fist on his mouth before he could parry right arm up 'foul blow' dartrey cried skepsey vowed to the contrary dartrey reiterated his charge skepsey was a figure of negation gesticulating and protesting dartrey appealed tempestuously to the ring skepsey likewise in a tone of injury he addressed a remonstrance to captain dartrey 'hang your captain sir i call you a coward come on' said the resolute gentleman already in ripe form for the attack his blue eyes were like the springing sunrise over ridges of the seas and skepsey jumped to his meaning boys and men were spectators of a real scientific set to a lovely show they were half puzzled it seemed so deadly and the little one got in his blows at the gentleman who had to be hopping only the worse the gentleman caught it the friendlier his countenance became that was the wonder and that gave them the key but it was deliciously near to the real thing dartrey and skepsey shook hands 'and now you fellows you're to know that this is one of the champions and you take your lesson from him and thank him' dartrey said as he turned on his heel to strike and greet the flow from the house 'dartrey come' victor fenellan colney had him by the hand in turn pure sweetness of suddenly awakened joy sat in nataly's eyes as she swam to welcome him nesta moved a step seemed hesitating and she tripped forward 'dear captain dartrey' he did not say 'but what a change in you' 'it is blue butterfly all the same' nataly spoke to his look victor hurriedly pronounced the formal introduction between the hon dudley sowerby and captain dartrey fenellan the bronze face and the milky bowed to one another ceremoniously the latter faintly flushing 'so here you are at last' victor said 'you stay with us' 'to morrow or later if you'll have me i go down to my people to night' 'but you stay in england now' nataly's voice wavered on the question 'there's a chance of my being off to upper burmah before the week's ended' 'ah dear dear' sighed fenellan 'and out of good comes evil as grandfather deucalion exclaimed when he gallantly handed up his dripping wife from the mud of the deluge waters do you mean to be running and dewing it on for ever with only a nod for friends dart' 'lord simmy what a sound of home there is in your old nonsense' dartrey said his eyes of strong dark blue colour and the foreign swarthiness of his brows and cheeks and neck mixed the familiar and the strange in the sight of the women who knew him the bill broker's fair tressed young wife whispered of curiosity concerning him to nataly he dressed like a sailor he stood like a soldier and was he married yes he was married mrs blathenoy imagined a something in mrs radnor's tone she could account for it not by the ordinary reading of the feminine in the feminine but through a husband who professed to know secrets she was young in years and experience ten months wedded disappointedly awakened enlivened by the hour kindled by a novel figure of man fretful for a dash of imprudence this mrs radnor should be the one to second her very innocent turn for a galopade her own position allowed of any little diverting jig or reel or plunge in a bath she required it for the domestic jacob blathenoy was a dry chip proved such without a day's variation during the whole of the ten wedded months nataly gratified her spoken wish dartrey fenellan bowed to the lady and she withdrew him seeing composedly that other and greater ladies had the wish ungratified their husbands were not so rich as hers and their complexions would hardly have pleased the handsome brown faced officer so well banquet equal to a blast of trumpet was the detaining word for the multitude it circulated one knows not how eloquent as the whiffs to the sniffs and nowhere is eloquence to match it when the latter are sharpened from within to without the word was very soon over the field mr carling may have helped he had it from fenellan and he was among the principal groups claiming or making acquaintances as a lawyer should do the concert was complimentarily a topic durandarte divine did not everybody think so everybody did in default of a term for overtopping it our language is poor at hyperbole our voices are stronger gestures and heaven sent eyeballs invoke to display the ineffable where was durandarte now gone already gone off with the luciani for evening engagements he came simply to oblige his dear friend mr radnor cheque fifty guineas hardly more on both sides than an exchange of smiles ah these merchant princes what of mr radnor's amateur instrumentalists amateurs they are not to be named perfect musicians mr radnor is the perfection of a host yes yes mrs radnor miss radnor too delicious voices but what is it about mr radnor so captivating he is not quite english yet he is not at all foreign is he very adventurous in business as they say 'soundest head in the city of london' mr blathenoy remarked sir rodwell blachington gave his nod the crowd interjected half sighing we ought to be proud of such a man perhaps we are a trifle exaggerating says its heart but that we are wholly grateful to him is a distinct conclusion and he may be one of the great men of his time he has a quite individual style of dress lady rodwell blachington observed to colney durance 'mr radnor bids fair to become the idol of the english people' 'if he can prove himself to be sufficiently the dupe of the english people' said colney 'idol dupe' interjected sir rodwell and his eyebrows fixed at the perch of colney's famous 'national interrogation' over vacancy of understanding as if from the pull of a string he had his audience with him and the satirist had nothing but his inner gush of acids at sight of a planted barb colney was asked to explain he never explained he performed a series of astonishing leaps like the branchy baboon above the traveller's head in the tropical forest and led them into the trap they assisted him to prepare for them 'no humour do you say the english have no humour' a nephew of lady blachington's inquired of him with polite pugnacity and was cordially assured that 'he vindicated them' 'and altruistic another specimen of the modern coinage' a classical church dignitary in grammarian disgust remarked to a lady as they passed colney pricked up his ears it struck him that he might fish for suggestions in aid of the grand argument before the elders of the court of japan dr wardan whose recognition he could claim stated to him that the lady and he were enumerating words of a doubtfully legitimate quality now being inflicted upon the language 'the slang from below is perhaps preferable' said colney 'as little less' 'but a pirate tongue cut off from its roots must continue to practise piracy surely or else take reinforcements in slang otherwise it is inexpressive of new ideas' 'possibly the new ideas are best expressed in slang' 'if insular they will consequently be incommunicable to foreigners you would then have us be trading with tokens instead of a precious currency yet i cannot perceive the advantage of letting our ideas be clothed so racy of the obscener soil considering the pretensions of the english language to become the universal if we refuse additions from above they force themselves on us from below' dr wardan liked the frame of the observations disliked the substance 'one is to understand that the english language has these pretensions' he said he minced in his manner after the well known mortar board and tassel type the mouthing of a petrifaction clearly useless to the pleadings of the patriotic dr bouthoin and his curate he gave no grip to colney who groaned at cheap donnish sarcasm and let him go after dealing him a hard pellet or two in a cracker covering there was victor all over the field netting his ephemerae and he who feeds on them to pay a price for their congratulations and flatteries he is one of them himself nesta came tripping from the rev septimus barmby 'dear mr durance where is captain dartrey' mrs blathenoy had just conducted her husband through a crowd for an introduction of him to captain dartrey that was perceptible dudley sowerby followed nesta closely he struck across the path of the rev septimus again he had the hollow of her ear at his disposal 'mr radnor was excellent he does everything consummately really we are all sensible of it i am he must lead us in a symphony these light champagne overtures of french composers as mr fenellan calls them do not bring out his whole ability zampa le pre aux clercs masaniello and the like' 'your duet together went well' 'thanks to you to you you kept us together' 'papa was the runaway or strain the leash if there was one' 'he is impetuous he is so fervent but miss radnor i could not be the runaway with you with you at the piano indeed i shall we stroll down i love the lake' 'you will hear the bell for your cold dinner very soon' 'i am not hungry i would so much rather talk hear you but you are hungry you have been singing twice three times opera singers they say eat hot suppers they drink stout and i never heard your voice more effective yours is a voice that something of the feeling one has in hearing cathedral voices carry one up i remember in dresden once a fraulein kuhnstreich a prodigy very young considering her accomplishments but it was not the same' nesta wondered at dartrey fenellan for staying so long with mr and mrs blathenoy 'ah mr sowerby if i am to have flattery i cannot take it as a milliner's dumb figure wears the beautiful dress i must point out my view of some of my merits' 'oh do i beg miss you have a christian name and i too and once not mr sowerby yes it was dudley 'quite accidentally and a world of pardons entreated' 'and dudley begged dudley might be dudley always' he was deepening to the barmby intonation apparently cupid's but a shade more airily pagan not so fearfully clerical her father had withdrawn dartrey fenellan from mr and mrs blathenoy dr schlesien was bowing with dartrey 'and if durandarte would only but you are one with miss graves to depreciate my durandarte in favour of the more classical jachimo whom we all admire but you shall be just' said she and she pouted she had seen her father plant dartrey fenellan in the midst of a group of city gentlemen simeon touched among them to pluck at his brother he had not a chance he retired and swam into the salmon net of seductive mrs blathenoy's broad bright smile 'it's a matter of mines and they're hovering in the attitude of the query like corkscrews over a bottle profoundly indifferent to blood relationships' he said to her 'pray stay and be consoled by me' said the fair young woman 'you are to point me out all the distinguished people is it true that your brother has left the army' 'dartrey no longer wears the red here comes colonel corfe who does england has her army still' 'his wife persuaded him' 'you see he is wearing the black' 'for her how very very sad tell me what a funnily dressed woman meeting that gentleman' 'hush a friend of the warrior splendid weather colonel corfe' 'superb toilettes' the colonel eyed mrs blathenoy dilatingly advanced bowed and opened the siege she decided a calculation upon his age made a wall of it smilingly agreed with his encomium of the concert and toned her voice to fenellan's comprehension 'did it occur recently' 'months in africa i haven't the date' 'such numbers of people one would wish to know who are those ladies holding a court where mr radnor is' 'lady carmine lady swanage if it is your wish' interposed the colonel she dealt him a forgiving smile 'and that pleasant looking old gentleman' colonel corfe drew up fenellan said 'are we veterans at forty or so' 'well it 's the romance perhaps' she raised her shoulders the colonel's intelligence ran a dog's nose for a lady's interjections 'the romance at forty fifty gone miss julinks the great heiress and a beauty has chosen him over the heads of all the young men of his time cranmer lotsdale most romantic history' 'she's in love with that i suppose' 'now you direct my attention to him' said fenellan 'the writing of the romantic history has made the texture look a trifle thready you have a terrible eye' it was thrown to where the person stood who had first within a few minutes helped her to form critical estimates of men more consciously to read them 'your brother stays in england' 'the fear is that he's off again' 'annoying for you if i had a brother i would not let him go' 'how would you detain him' 'locks and bolts clock wrong hands and arms kneeling the fourth act of the huguenots' 'he went by way of the window i think but that was a lover' 'oh well' she flushed she did not hear the 'neglected and astonished colonel speak and she sought diversion in saying to fenellan 'so many people of distinction are assembled here to day tell me who is that pompous gentleman who holds his arms up doubled as he walks' 'like flappers of a penguin and advances in jerks he is head of the great firm of quatley brothers sir abraham finances or farms one of the south american republics we call him pride of port he consumes it and he presents it' 'and who is that little man who stops everybody' 'people of distinction indeed that little man is your upper lip underrateing him when a lady's lip is erratically disdainful it suggests a misuse of a copious treasury deserving to be mulcted punished how who can say that little man now that little man with a lift of his little finger could convulse the bacon market' mrs blathenoy shook hearing colonel corfe exclaim 'bacon market' she let fly a peal then she turned to a fresh satellite a round and a ruddy 'at her service ever' mr beaves urmsing and repeated fenellan's words he in unfeigned wonderment at such unsuspected powers cried 'dear me' and stared at the little man making the pretty lady's face a twinkling dew he had missed the concert was it first rate ecstasy answered in the female voice 'hem'd fool i am to keep appointments' he muttered she reproved him 'fie mr urmsing it's the making of them not the keeping' 'ah my dear ma'am if i'd had blathenoy's luck when he made a certain appointment and he was not so much older than me the old ones get the prizes' mr beaves urmsing prompted colonel corfe to laugh in triumph the colonel's eyebrows were up in fixity over sleepy lids he brightened to propose the conducting of the pretty woman to the banquet 'we shall see them going in' said she 'mr radnor has a french cook who does wonders but i heard him asking for mr beaves urmsing i'm sure he expected the marigolds at his concert' 'anything to oblige the company' said the rustic ready chorister clearing his throat the lady's feet were bent in the direction of a grassy knoll where sunflowers tulips dahlias peonies of the sex eclipsed at a distance its roses and lilies fenellan saw dartrey still a centre of the merchantmen strolling thither 'and do you know your brother is good enough to dine with us next week thursday down here' she murmured 'i could venture to command if you are not induced' 'whichever word applies to a faithful subject' 'i do so wish your brother had not left the army' 'you have one son of mars' her eyes took the colonel up to cast him down he was not the antidote she said to him 'luciani's voice wears better than her figure' the colonel replied 'i remember' and corrected himself 'at eton in jackets she was not so particularly slim never knew how to dress you beat italians there she moved one as a youngster' 'eton boys are so susceptible' 'why hulloa don't i remember her coming out and do you mean to tell me' mr beaves urmsing brutally addressed the colonel 'that you were at eton when why what age do you give the poor woman then' he bellowed 'eh' as it were a bull crowing the colonel retreated to one of his defensive corners 'i am not aware that i meant to tell you anything' mr beaves urmsing turned square breasted on fenellan 'fellow's a born donkey' 'and the mother lived' said fenellan mr beaves urmsing puffed with wrath at the fellow five minutes later in the midst of the group surrounding and felicitating victor he had sight of fenellan conversing with fair ones and it struck a light in him he went three steps backward with shouts 'dam funny fellow eh who is he i must have that man at my table worth fifty colonel jackasses and i 've got a son in the guards and as much laugh in him he 's got as a bladder but we'll make a party eh radnor with that friend o' yours dam funny fellow and precious little of it going on now among the young lot they're for seeing ghosts and gaping their jaws all for the quavers instead of the capers' he sounded and thrummed his roguish fling off for the capers a second glimpse of fenellan agitated the anecdote as he called it seizing victor's arm to have him out of earshot of the ladies delivery not without its throes was accomplished but imperfectly owing to sympathetic convulsions under which mr beaves urmsing's countenance was crinkled of many colours as we see the spring rhubarb leaf unable to repeat the brevity of fenellan's rejoinder he expatiated on it to convey it swearing that it was the kind of thing done in the old days when men were witty dogs 'pat and pat back as in the pantomime' 'repartee' said victor 'he has it you shall know him you're the man for him' 'he for me that he is hope the mother's doing well my card eh grave as an owl look there goes the donkey lady to right and left all ears for him ha ha i must have another turn with your friend mother lived did she dam funny fellow all of the olden time and a dinner bachelor dinner six of us at my place next week say wednesday half past six for a long evening flowing bowl eh shall it be' nesta came looking to find her captain dartrey mr beaves urmsing grew courtly of the olden time he spied colonel corfe anew and 'donkey' rose to split the roar at his mouth and full of his anecdote he pursued some congenial acquaintances crying to his host 'wednesday mind eh by george your friend's gizzarded me for the day' plumped with the rich red stream of life this last of the squires of old england thumped along among the guests a very tuning fork to keep them at their pitch of enthusiasm he encountered mr caddis and it was an encounter mr caddis represented his political opinions but here was this cur of a caddis whineing his niminy note from his piminy nob when he was asked for his hearty echo of the praises of this jolly good fellow come to waken the neighbourhood to be a blessing a blazing hearth a fall of manna and thank the lord for him you desertdog 'he 's a merchant prince and he's a prince of a man if you're for titles eh you assent to my encomiums you'll be calling me mr speaker next hang me caddis if those parliamentary benches of yours aren't freezing you from your seat up and have got to your jaw my belief' mr caddis was left reflecting that we have in the dispensations of providence when we have a seat to submit to castigations from butcherly men unaccountably commissioned to solidify the seat he could have preached a discourse upon success to quiet the discontentment of the unseated and our world of seats oddly gained quaintly occupied maliciously beset insensately envied needs the discourse but it was not delivered else would it have been here written down without mercy as a medical prescript one of the grand specifics he met victor and between his dread of him and the counsels of a position subject to stripes he was a genial thaw victor beamed for mr caddis had previously stood eminent as an iceberg of the lakelands' party mr inchling and mr caddis were introduced the former in commerce the latter in politics their sustaining boast was the being our stable englishmen and at once with cousinly minds they fell to chatting upon the nothings agreeably and seriously colney durance forsook a set of ladies for fatter prey and listened to them what he said victor did not hear the effect was always to be seen with inchling under colney fenellan did better service really good service nataly played the heroine she was at heart why think of her as having to act a character twice had carling that afternoon indirectly and directly stated mrs burman to be near the end we crape a natural a defensible satisfaction to hear of not wishing it poor woman but pardonably before man and all the angels wishing praying for the beloved one to enter into her earthly peace by the agency of the other's exit into her heavenly fenellan and colney came together and said a word apiece of their friend 'in his element the dear old boy has the look of a goldfish king of his globe' 'the dear old boy has to me the look of a pot on the fire with a loose lid' i may have the summons from themison to morrow victor thought the success of the day was a wine that rocked the soberest of thoughts for strange to confess ever since the fall on london bridge his heart influenced in some degree by nataly's depression perhaps had been shadowed by doubts of his infallible instinct for success here at a stroke and before entering the house he had the whole neighbourhood about him he could feel that he and nataly stood in the minds of the worthy people variously with the brightness if not with the warmth distinguishable in the bosom of beaves urmsing the idea of whom gave lakelands an immediate hearth glow armandine was thirteen minutes by his watch behind the time she had named small blame to her he excused her to lady carmine lady swanage lady blachington mrs fanning sir abraham quatley mr danny of bacon fame and the rest of the group surrounding nataly on the mound leftward of the white terraces descending to the lake where she stood beating her foot fretfully at the word brought by nesta that dartrey fenellan had departed it was her sunshine departed but she went through her task of conversing amiably colney for a wonder consented to be useful in assisting fenellan to relate stories of french cooks which were like the royal hanoverian oyster of an age for offering acceptable flavour to english hearers nesta drew her mother's attention to priscilla graves and skepsey the latter bending head and assenting nataly spoke of the charm of priscilla's voice that day in her duet with the rev septimus mr pempton looked he saw that priscilla was proselytizing she was perfection to him but for one blotting thing with grief on his eyelids he said to nataly or to himself 'meat' 'dear friend don't ride your hobby over us' she replied 'but it's with that object they mount it' said victor the greater ladies of the assembly were quite ready to accuse the sections down to the individuals of the social english reserving our elect of an itch to be tyrants colney was apologizing for them with his lash 'it's merely the sensible effect of a want of polish of the surface when they rub together' and he heard carling exclaim to victor 'how comes the fellow here' skepsey had rushed across an open space to intercept a leisurely progressive man whose hat was of the shape victor knew and the man wore the known black gaiters in appearance he had the likeness of a fallen parson carling and victor crossed looks that were questions carrying their answers nataly's eyes followed victor's 'who is the man' she said and she got no reply beyond a perky sparkle in his gaze others were noticing the man who was trying to pass by skepsey now on his right side now on his left 'there'll be no stopping him' carling said and he slipped to the rear' at this juncture armandine's mellow bell proclaimed her readiness victor rubbed the back of his head nataly asked him 'dear is it that man' he nodded scantly 'expected expected i think we have our summons from armandine one moment poor soul poor soul lady carmine sir abraham quatley will you lead lady blachington i secure you one moment' he directed nataly to pair a few of the guests he hurried down the slope of sward nataly applied to colney durance 'do you know the man is it that man' colney rejoined 'the man's name is jarniman' armandine's bell swung melodiously the guests had grouped thickening for the stream to procession mrs blathenoy claimed fenellan she requested him to tell her whether he had known mrs victor radnor many years she mused 'you like her' 'one likes one's dearest of friends among women does one not' the lady nodded to his response 'and your brother' 'dartrey is devoted to her' 'i am sure' said she 'your brother is a chivalrous gentleman i like her too' she came to her sentiment through the sentiment of the chivalrous gentleman sinking from it she remarked that mr radnor was handsome still fenellan commended the subject to her as one to discourse of when she met dartrey a smell of a trap hatch half open afflicted and sharpened him it was blathenoy's breath husbands of young wives do these villanies for the sake of showing their knowledge fenellan forbore to praise mrs victor he laid his colours on dartrey the lady gave ear till she reddened he meant no harm meant nothing but good and he was lighting the most destructive of our lower fires visibly that man jarniman was disposed of with ease as in the street theatres of crowing punch distance enlisted pantomime to do the effective part of the speeches jarniman's hat was off he stood bent he delivered his message he was handed over to skepsey's care for the receiving of meat and drink victor returned he had lady blachington's hand on his arm he was all hers and in the heart of his company of guests at the same time eyes that had read him closely for years were unable to spell a definite signification on his face below the overflowing happiness of the hospitable man among contented guests he had in fact something within to enliven him and that was the more than suspicion amounting to an odour of certainty that armandine intended one of her grand surprises for her master and for the hundred and fifty or so to be seated at her tables in the unwarmed house of lakelands chapter xxii concerns the intrusion of jarniman armandine did her wonders there is not in the wide range of the muses a more responsive instrument than man to his marvellous cook and if his notes were but as flowing as his pedals are zealous we should be carried on the tale of the enthusiasm she awakened away from the rutted highroad where history now thinks of tightening her girdle for an accelerated pace the wonders were done one hundred and seventy guests plenteously fed at tables across the great concert hall down a length of the conservatory glass on soups fish meats and the kitchen garden under play of creative sauces all in the persuasive steam of savouriness every dish one may say advancing curtseying swimming to be your partner instead of passively submitting to the eye of appetite consenting to the teeth as that rather melancholy procession of the cold resembling established spinsters thrice corseted in decorum will appear to do whether armandine had the thought or that she simply acted in conformity with a frenchwoman's direct good sense we do require to smell a sort of animation in the meats we consume we are still perhaps traceably related to the adamite old youngster just on his legs who betrayed at every turn his darwinian beginnings and relished a palpitating unwillingness in the thing refreshing him only we young oldsters cherish the milder taste for willingness with a throb of the vanquished in it and a seeming of that we get from the warm roast the banquet to be fervently remembered should smoke should send out a breath to meet us victor's crowded saloon carriage was one voice of eulogy to raise armandine high as the finale rockets bursting over wrensham station at the start londonward how had she managed we foolishly question the arts of magicians mr pempton was an apparent dissentient as the man must be who is half a century ahead of his fellows in humaneness and saddened by the display of slaughtered herds and their devourers he had picked out his vegetable and farinaceous morsels wherever he could get them uncontaminated enough for sustenance and the utmost he could show was that he did not complain when mounted and ridden by the satirist in wrath at him for systematically feasting the pride of the martyr on the maceration of his animal part he put on his martyr's pride which assumed a perfect contentment in the critical depreciation of opposing systems he was drawn to state as he had often done that he considered our animal part shamefully and dangerously over nourished and that much of the immorality of the world was due to the present excessive indulgence in meats 'not in drink' miss graves inquired 'no' he said boldly 'not equally meats are more insidious i say nothing of taking life of fattening for that express purpose diseases of animals bad blood made cruelty superinduced it will be seen to be it will be looked back on as a form of a second stage of cannibalism let that pass i say that for excess in drinking the penalty is paid instantly or at least on the morrow' 'paid by the drunkard's wife you should say' 'whereas intemperance in eating corrupts constitutionally more spiritually vitiates we think on the whole gluttony is the least generous of the vices' colney lured mr pempton through a quagmire of the vices to declare that it brutalized and stammeringly to adopt the suggestion that our breeding of english ladies those lights of the civilized world can hardly go with a feeding upon flesh of beasts priscilla regretted that champagne should have to be pleaded in excuse of impertinences to her sex they were both combative nibbed for epigram edged to inflict wounds and they were set to shudder openly at one another's practises they might have exposed to colney which of the two maniacal sections of his english had the vaster conceit of superiority in purity they were baring themselves as it were with a garment flung off at each retort he reproached them for undermineing their countrymen whose falstaff panics demanded blood of animals to restore them and their periods of bragging that they should brandify their wits to imagine themselves vikings nataly interposed she was vexed with him he let his eyelids drop but the occasion for showing the prickliness of the bristly social english could not be resisted dr peter yatt was tricked to confess that small annoyances were in his experience powerful on the human frame and dr john cormyn was very neatly brought round to assure him he was mistaken if he supposed the homoeopathic doctor who smoked was exercising a destructive influence on the efficacy of the infinitesimal doses he prescribed dr yatt chuckled a laugh at globules dr cormyn at patients treated as horses while mr catkin was brought to praise the smoke of tobacco as our sanctuary from the sex and mr peridon quietly denied that the taking of it into his nostrils from the puffs of his friend caused him sad silences nesta flew to protect the admirer of her beloved louise her subsiding young excitement of the day set her boating on that moony melancholy in mr peridon no one could understand the grounds for colney's more than usual waspishness he trotted out the fulgent and tonal church of the rev septimus the skeleton of worship so truly showing the spirit in that of dudley sowerby's family maliciously admiring both and he had a spar with fenellan ending in a snarl and a shout victor said to him 'yes here as much as you like old colney but i tell you you've staggered that poor woman lady blachington to day and her husband too and i don't know how many besides what the pleasure of it can be i can't guess' 'nor i' said fenellan 'but i'll own i feel envious like the girl among a family of boys i knew who were all of them starved in their infancy by a miserly father that gave them barely a bit of graves to eat and not a drop of pempton to drink and on the afternoon of his funeral i found them in the drawing room four lank fellows heels up walking on their hands from long practice and the girl informed me that her brothers were able so to send the little blood they had in their bodies to their brains and always felt quite cheerful for it happy and empowered to deal with the problems of the universe as they couldn't on their legs but she poor thing was forbidden to do the same and i'm like her i care for decorum too much to get the brain to act on colney's behaviour but i see it enraptures him and may be comprehensible to the topsy turvy' victor rubbed hands it was he who filled colney's bag of satiric spite in addition to the downright lunacy of the courting of country society by means of the cajolements witnessed this day a suspicion that victor was wearing a false face over the signification of jarniman's visit and meant to deceive the trustful and too devoted loving woman he seemed bound to wreck irritated the best of his nature he had a resolve to pass an hour with the couple and speak and insist on hearing plain words before the night had ended but fenellan took it out of him victor's show of a perfect contentment emulating pempton's incited colney to some of his cunning rapier thrusts with his dancing adversary and the heat which is planted in us for the composition of those cool epigrams will not allow plain words to follow or handing him over to the police of the philistines you may put it that a habit of assorting spices will render an earnest simplicity distasteful he was invited by nataly to come home with them her wish for his presence besides personal was moved by an intuition that his counsel might specially benefit them he shrugged he said he had work at his chambers 'work' victor ejaculated he never could reach to a right comprehension of labour in regard to the very unremunerative occupation of literature colney he did not want and he let him go as nataly noticed without a sign of the reluctance he showed when the others including fenellan excused themselves 'so we're alone' he said when the door of the hall had closed on them he kept nesta talking of the success of the day until she observing her mother's look simulated the setting in of a frenzied yawn she was kissed and she tripped to her bed 'now we are alone' nataly said 'well dear and the day was you must own ' he sought to trifle with her heavy voice but she recalled him 'victor' and the naked anguish in her cry of his name was like a foreign world threatening the one he filled 'ah yes that man that jarniman you saw him i remember you recollected him stouter than he was in her service ever since well a little drop of bitter perhaps no harm tonic' 'victor is she very ill' 'my love don't feel at your side she is ill ill not the extreme case not yet old and ill i told skepsey to give the man refreshment he had to do his errand' 'what why did he come' 'curious he made acquaintance with skepsey and appears to have outwitted poor skepsey as far as i see it but if that woman thinks of intimidating me now ' his eyes brightened he had sprung from evasions 'living in flagrant sin she says you and i she will not have it warns me heard this day at noon of company at lakelands jarniman off at once are to live in obscurity you and i if together dictates from her death bed i suppose her death bed' 'dearest' nataly pressed hand on her left breast 'may we not think that she may be right' 'an outrageous tyranny of a decrepit woman naming herself wife when she is only a limpet of vitality with drugs for blood hanging on to blast the healthy and vigorous i remember old colney's once in old days calling that kind of marriage a sarcophagus it was to me there i lay see myself lying wasting think what you can good of her by all means from her bed despatches that jarniman to me from her bedside with the word that she cannot in her conscience allow what imposition was it i practised flagrant sin it would have been an infinitely viler she is the cause of suffering enough i bear no more from her i've come to the limit she has heard of lakelands she has taken one of her hatreds to the place she might have written might have sent me a gentleman privately no it must be done in dramatic style for effect her confidential lawyer doctor butler perhaps to frighten me the boy she knew and poor soul i don't mean to abuse her but such conduct as this is downright brutal i laugh at it i snap my fingers i can afford to despise it only i do say it deserves to be called abominable' 'victor has she used a threat' 'am i brought to listen to any of her threats funny thing i 'm certain that woman never can think of me except as the boy she knew i saw her first when she was first a widow she would keep talking to me of the seductions of the metropolis kept informing me i was a young man shaking her head i 've told you she well i know we are mixtures women as well as men i can i hope grant the same i believe i can allowances to women as to men we are poor creatures all of using one sense though i won't give colney his footing there's a better way of reading us i hold fast to nature no violation of nature my good colney we can live the lives of noble creatures and i say that happiness was meant for us just as when you sit down to your dinner you must do it cheerfully and you make good blood otherwise all's wrong there's the right answer to colney but when a woman like that and marries a boy well twenty one not quite that and an innocent a positive innocent it may seem incredible after a term of school life it was a fact i can hardly understand it myself when i look back marries him and then sets to work to persecute him because he has blood in his veins because he worships beauty because he seeks a real marriage a real mate and i say it let the world take its own view the world is wrong because he preferred a virtuous life to the kind of life she would she must why necessarily have driven him to with a mummy's grain of nature in his body and i am made of flesh i admit it' 'victor dearest her threat concerns only your living at lakelands' 'pray don't speak excitedly my love' he replied to the woman whose tones had been subdued to scarce more than waver 'you see how i meet it water off a duck's back or indian solar beams on the skin of a hindoo i despise it hardly worth contempt but come our day was a good one fenellan worked well old colney was colney durance of course he did no real mischief' 'and you will not determine to enter lakelands not yet dear' said nataly 'my own girl leave it all to me' 'but victor i must must know' 'see the case you have lots of courage we can't withdraw her intention is mischief i believe the woman keeps herself alive for it we've given her another lease though it can only be for a very short time themison is precise carling too if we hold back i have great faith in themison the woman's breath on us is confirmed we go down then complete the furnishing quite leisurely accept listen accept one or two invitations impossible to refuse but they are accepted and we defy her a crazy old creature imagines herself the wife of the ex premier widow of prince le boo engaged to the chinese ambassador et caetera leave the tussle with that woman to me no we don't repeat the error of crayc farm and creckholt and here we have stout friends not to speak of beaver urmsing a picture of old christmas england you took to him must have taken to beaver urmsing the marigolds and sir rodwell and lady blachington are altogether above the mark of sir humphrey and lady pottil and those half and half mountneys there's a warm centre of home in lakelands but i know my nataly she is thinking of our girl here is the plan we stand our ground my dear soul won't forsake me only there's the thought of fredi in the event improbable enough i lift fredi out of the atmosphere awhile she goes to my cousins the duvidney ladies' nataly was hit by a shot 'can you imagine it victor' 'regard it as done' 'they will surely decline' 'their feeling for general radnor is a worship' 'all the more' 'the son inherits it he goes to them personally have you ever known me personally fail fredi stays at moorsedge for a month or two dorothea and virginia duvidney will give her a taste of a new society good for the girl all these little shiftings can be turned to good meantime i say we stand our ground but you are not to be worried for though we have gone too far to recede we need not and we will not make the entry into lakelands until you know that is auspiciously to suit you in every way thus i provide to meet contingencies what one may really fancy is that the woman did but threaten there's her point of view to be considered silly crazy but one sees it we are not sure that she struck a blow at craye or creckholt i wonder she never wrote she was frightened when she came to manage her property of signing her name to anything absurd that sending of jarniman however it's her move we make a corresponding disposition of our chessmen' 'and i am to lose my nesta for a month' nataly said after catching here and there at the fitful gleams of truce or comfort dropped from his words and simultaneously the reproach of her mind to her nature for again and so constantly yielding to the domination of his initiative unable to find the words even the ideas to withstand him brought big tears angry at herself both for the internal feebleness and the exhibition of it she blinked and begged excuse there might be nothing that should call her to resist him she could not do much worse than she had done to day the reflection that to day she had been actually sustained by the expectation of a death to come diminished her estimate of to morrow's burden on her endurance in making her seem a less criminal woman who would have no such expectation which was virtually a stab at a fellow creature's future her head was acute to work in the direction of the casuistries and the sensational webs and films facing victor it was a block but the thought came how could she meet those people about lakelands without support of the recent guilty whispers she said coldly her heart shaking her 'you think there has been a recovery' 'invalids are up and down they are well no i should think she dreads the' he kept 'surgeon' out of hearing 'or else she means this for the final stroke though i'm lying here i can still make him feel that or poor woman she has her notions of right and wrong' 'could we not now travel for a few weeks victor' 'certainly dear we will after we have kept our engagements to dine i accepted with the blathenoys the blachingtons beaver urmsing' nataly's vision of the peaceful lost little dairy cottage swelled to brilliance like the large tear at the fall darkening under her present effort to comprehend the necessity it was for him to mix and be foremost with the world unable to grasp it perfectly in mind her compassionate love embraced it she blamed herself for being the obstruction to him 'very well' she said on a sigh 'then we shall not have to let our girl go from us' 'just a few weeks in the middle of dinner i scribbled a telegram to the duvidneys for skepsey to take' 'speaking of nesta' 'of my coming to morrow they won't stop me i dine with them sleep at the wells hotel for a night we are to be separated for a night' she laid her hand in his and gave him a passing view of her face 'for two dear i am that man's visit rather shaken i shall have a better chance of sleeping if i know i am not disturbing you' she was firm and they kissed and parted each had an unphrased speculation upon the power of mrs burman to put division between them chapter xxiii treats of the ladies' lapdog tasso for an instance of momentous effects produced by very minor causes the maiden ladies dorothea and virginia duvidney were thin sweet old fashioned grey gentlewomen demurely conscious of their excellence and awake to the temptation in the consciousness who imposed a certain reflex primness on the lips of the world when addressing them or when alluding to them for their appearance was picturesque of the ancestral time and their ideas and scrupulousness of delivery suggested the belated in ripeness orchard apples under a snow storm or any image that will ceremoniously convey the mind's profound appreciation together with the tooth's panic dread of tartness they were by no means tart only as you know the tooth is apprehensively nervous an uninviting sign will set it on edge even the pen which would sketch them has a spell on it and must don its coat of office walk the liveried footman behind them their wealth their deeds of charity their modesty their built grey locks their high repute a 'chippendale elegance' in a quaintly formal correctness that they had as colney durance called it gave them some queenliness and allowed them to claim the ear as an oracle and banish rebellious argument intuitive knowledge assisted by the rev stuart rem and the rev abram posterley enabled them to pronounce upon men and things not without effect their country owned it the foreigner beheld it nor were they corrupted by the servility of the surrounding ear they were good women striving to be humbly good they might for all the little errors they nightly unrolled to then perceptions have stood before the world for a study in the white of our humanity and this may be but a washed wall it is true revolutionary sceptics are measuring the depths of it but the hue refreshes the world admires and we know it an object of aim to the bettermost of the wealthy if happily complacent circumstances have lifted us to the clean paved platform out of grip of puddled clay and bespattering wheeltracks we get our chance of coming to it possessing for example nine thousand pounds per annum in consols and not expending the whole of it upon our luxuries we are without further privation near to kindling the world's enthusiasm for whiteness yet there too we find that character has its problems to solve there are shades in salt we must be charitable but we should be just we give to the poor of the land but we are eminently the friends of our servants duty to mankind diverts us not from the love we bear to our dog and with a pathetic sorrow for silt we discard it from sight and hearing we hate dirt having said so much having shown it by sealing the mouth of mr stuart rem and iceing the veins of mr abram posterley in relation to a dreadful public case and a melancholy private we have a pleased sense of entry into the world's ideal at the same time we protest our unworthiness acknowledgeing that they were not purely spotless these ladies genuinely took the tiny fly spot for a spur to purification and they viewed it as a patch to raise in relief their goodness they gazed on it saw themselves in it and veiled it warned of the cunning of an oft defeated tempter to do good and sleep well was their sowing and their reaping uneasy consciences could not have slept the sleeping served for proof of an accurate reckoning and an expungeing of the day's debits they differed in opinion now and then as we see companion waves of the river blown by a gust roll a shadow between them and almost equally transient were their differences with a world that they condemned when they could not feel they as an embodiment of their principles were leading it the english world at times betrayed a restiveness in the walled pathway of virtue for alas it closely neighbours the french only a channel often dangerously smooth to divide but it is not perverted for long and the english funds are always constant and a tower would they be suffered to be so if libertinism were in the ascendant colney durance was acquainted with the duvidney ladies hearing of the journey to them and the purport of it he said with the mask upon glee 'then victor has met his match' nataly had sent for him to dine with her in victor's absence she was far from grieved as to the result by his assurance to her that victor had not a chance colney thought so 'just like him to be off gaily to try and overcome or come over the greatest power in england' they were england herself the squat old woman she has become by reason of her overlapping numbers of the comfortable fund holder annuitants a vast body of passives and negatives living by precept according to rules of precedent and supposing themselves to be righteously guided because of their continuing undisturbed them he branded as hypocritical materialists and the country for pride in her sweetmeat plethora of them mixed with an ancient hebrew fear of offence to an inscrutable lord eccentrically appeasable through the dreary iteration of the litany of sinfulness he was near a truth and he had the heat of it on him satirists in their fervours might be near it to grasp it if they could be moved to moral distinctness mental intention with a preference of strong plain speech over the crack of their whips colney could not or would not praise our modern adventurous experimental heroic tramping active as opposed to yonder pursy passives and negatives he had occasions for flicking the fellow sharply and to speak of the lord as our friend present with us palpable to reason perceptible to natural piety solely through the reason which justifies punishment that would have stopped his mouth upon the theme of god forsaken creatures our satirist is an executioner by profession a moralist in excuse or at the tail of it though he thinks the position reversed when he moralizes angrily to have his angry use of the scourge condoned nevertheless he fills a serviceable place and certainly he is not happy in his business colney suffered as heavily as he struck if he had been no more than a mime in the motley of satire he would have sucked compensation from the acid of his phrases for the failure to prick and goad and work amendment he dramatized to nataly some of the scene going on at the wells victor's petition his fugue in urgency of it the brief reply of miss dorothea and her muted echo miss virginia he was rather their apologist for refusing but as when after himself listening to their 'views' he had deferentially withdrawn from the ladies of moorsedge and had then beheld their strangely hatted lieutenants and the regiments of the toneless respectable on the pantiles and the mounts the curse upon the satirist impelled him to generalize the quiet good ladies were multiplied they were 'the thousands of their sisters petticoated or long coated or buck skinned comfortable annuitants under clerical shepherding close upon outnumbering the labourers they paralyze at home and stultify abroad' colney thumped away the country's annuitants had for type 'the figure with the helmet of the owl goddess and the trident of the earth shaker seated on a wheel at the back of penny pieces in whom you see neither the beauty of nakedness nor the charm of drapery not the helmet's dignity or the trident's power but she has patently that which stops the wheel and poseing for representative of an imperial nation she helps to pass a penny' so he passed his epigram heedless of the understanding or attention of his hearer who temporarily misjudged him for a man impelled by the vanity of literary point and finish when indeed it was hot satiric spite justified of its aim which crushed a class to extract a drop of scathing acid in the interests of the country mankind as well nataly wanted a picture painted colours and details that she might get a vision of the scene at moorsedge she did her best to feel an omen and sound it in his question 'whether the yearly increasing army of the orderly annuitants and their parasites does not demonstrate the proud old country as a sheath for pith rather than of the vital run of sap' perhaps it was patriotic to inquire and doubtless she was the weakest of women she could follow no thought her heart was beating blindly beside victor hopeing for the refusal painful to her through his disappointment 'you think me foolish' she made answer to one of colney's shrugs 'and it has come to that pitch with me that i cannot be sensible of a merit except in being one with him obeying is the word and i have never yet known him fail that terrible lakelands wears a different look to me when i think of what he can do though i would give half my days to escape it' she harped on the chord of feverish extravagance the more hateful to colney because of his perceiving that she simulated a blind devotedness to stupefy her natural pride and he was divided between stamping on her for an imbecile and dashing at victor for a maniac but her situation rendered her pitiable 'you will learn tomorrow what victor has done' he said and thought how the simple words carried the bitterness that was uttered within a few minutes of midnight when the ladies of moorsedge themselves after an exhausting resistance to their dearest relative were at the hall door of the house with victor saying the good night to which he responded hurriedly cordially dumbly a baffled man they clasped hands miss dorothea said 'you victor always' miss virginia said 'you will be sure of welcome' he walked out upon the moonless night and for lack of any rounded object in the smothering darkness to look at he could nowhere take moorings to gather himself together and define the man who had undergone so portentous a defeat he was glad of quarters at an hotel a solitary bed absence from his nataly for their parts the ladies were not less shattered they had no triumph in their victory the weight of it bore them down they closed locked shot the bolts and fastened the chain of the door they had to be reminded by the shaking of their darling dog tasso's curly silky coat that he had not taken his evening's trot to notify malefactors of his watchfulness and official wrath at sound of footfall or a fancied one without consultation they unbolted the door and tasso went forth to 'compose his vesper hymn' as mr posterley once remarked amusingly though not pretending to the muse's crown so far the little dog had qualities to entrance the spinster sex his mistresses talked of him of his readiness to go forth of the audible first line of his hymn or sonnet of his instinct telling him that something was wrong in the establishment for most of the servants at moorsedge were prostrated by a fashionable epidemic a slight attack the doctor said but montague the butler had withdrawn for the nursing of his wife perrin the footman was confined to his chamber manton the favourite maid had appeared in the morning with a face that caused her banishment to bed and the cook mrs bannister then sighingly agreed to send up cold meat for the ladies' dinner hence their melancholy inhospitality to their cousin victor who had in spite of his errors the right to claim his place at their table was 'of the blood' they said he was recognized as the living prince of it his every gesture every word recalled the general the trying scene with him had withered them they did not speak of it each had to the other the look of a vessel that has come out of a gale would they sleep they scarcely dared ask it of themselves they had done rightly silence upon that reflection seemed best it was the silence of an inward agitation still they knew the power of good consciences to summon sleep tasso was usually timed for five minutes they were astonished to discover by the clock that they had given him ten he was very quiet if so and for whatever he did he had his reason they said he was a dog endowed with reason endowed and how they wished that mr stuart rem would admit it with their love of the little dog believed and mr posterley acquiesced a soul do but think it of dear animals and any form of cruelty to them becomes an impossibility mr stuart rem but he would not be convinced ungenerously indeed he named mr posterley a courtier the ladies could have retorted that mr posterley had not a brother who was the celebrated surgeon sir nicholas rem usually tasso came running in when the hall door was opened to him not a sound of him could be heard the ladies blew his familiar whistle he trotted back to a third appeal and was unfortunately for them not caressed he received reproaches from two forefingers directed straight at his reason he saw it and felt it the hug of him was deferred to the tender good night to him in his basket at the foot of the ladies' beds on entering their spacious bed chamber they were so fatigued that sleep appeared to their minds the compensating logical deduction miss dorothea suppressed a yawn and inflicted it upon miss virginia who returned it with an apology and immediately had her sister's hand on her shoulder for an attempted control of one of the irresistibles a spectacle imparting bitter shudders and shots to the sympathetic jawbones of an observer hand at mouth for not in privacy would they have been guilty of exposing a grimace they signified under an interim smile their maidenly submission to the ridiculous force of nature after which miss virginia retired to the dressing room absorbed in woeful recollection of the resolute no they had been compelled to reiterate in response to the most eloquent and saving for a single instance admirable man their cousin the representative of 'the blood' supplicating them a recreant thankfulness coiled within her bosom at the thought that dorothea true to her office of speaker had tasked herself with the cruel utterance and repetition of the word victor's wonderful eyes his voice yet more than his urgent pleas and also in the midst of his fiery flood of speech his gentleness his patience pathos and a man's tone through it all were present to her disrobed she knocked at the door 'i have called to you twice' dorothea said and she looked a motive for the call 'what is it' said virginia with faltering sweetness with a terrible divination the movement of a sigh was made 'are you aware of anything dear' virginia was taken with the contrary movement of a sniff but the fear informing it prevented it from being venturesome doubt of the pure atmosphere of their bed chamber appeared to her as too heretic even for the positive essay in affirming that she was not aware of anything her sight fell on tasso his eyeballs were those of a little dog that has been awfully questioned 'it is more than a suspicion' said dorothea and plainly now while open to the seductions of any pleasing infidel testimony her nose in repugnance convicted him absolutely virginia's nose was lowered a few inches it inhaled and stopped midway 'you must be mistaken dear he never ' 'but are you insensible to the' dorothea's eyelids fainted virginia dismissed the forlornest of efforts at incredulity a whiff of tasso had smitten her 'ah' she exclaimed and fell away 'is it tasso how was it you noticed nothing before undressing dear' 'thinking of what we have gone through to night i forgot him at last the very strange the like of it i have not ever and upon that thick coat and dear it is late we are in the morning hours' 'but my dear oh dear what is to be done with him' that was the crucial point for discussion they had no servant to give them aid manton they could not dream of disturbing and tasso's character was in the estimate he hated washing it balefully depraved his temper and not only creature of habit that he was would he decline to lie down anywhere save in their bedroom he would lament plead insist unremittingly if excluded terrifying every poor invalid of the house then again were they at this late hour to dress themselves and take him downstairs and light a fire in the kitchen and boil sufficient water to give him a bath and scrubbing cold water would be death to him besides he would ring out his alarum for the house to hear pour out all his poetry poor dear as mr posterley called it at a touch of cold water the catastrophe was one to weep over the dilemma a trial of the strongest intelligences in addition to reviews of their solitary alternative the having of a befouled degraded little dog in their chamber through the night they were subjected to a conflict of emotions when eyeing him and there came to them the painful perhaps irreverent perhaps uncharitable thought that the sinner who has rolled in the abominable must cleanse him and do things to polish him and perfume before again embraced even by the mind if indeed we can ever have our old sentiment for him again mr stuart rem might decide it for them nay before even the heart embraces him he must completely purify himself that is to say the ordinary human sinner save when a relative contemplating tasso the hearts of the ladies gushed out in pity of an innocent little dog knowing not evil dependent on his friends for help to be purified necessarily kept at a distance the very look of him prescribed extreme separation as far as practicable but they had proof of a love almost greater than it was previous to the offence in the tender precautions they took to elude repulsion he was rolling on the rug communicating contagion flasks of treble distilled lavender water and their favourite traditional in the family eau d'arquebusade were on the toilet table they sprinkled his basket liberally sprinkled the rug and the little dog perfume pastilles were in one of the sitting rooms below and virginia would have gone down softly to fetch a box but dorothea restrained her in pity for the servants with the remark 'it would give us a nightmare of a roman catholic cathedral' a bit of the window was lifted by dorothea cautiously that prowling outsiders might not be attracted tasso was wooed to his basket he seemed inquisitive the antidote of his naughtiness excited him his tail circled after his muzzle several times then he lay a silken scarf steeped in eau d'arquebusade was flung across him their customary devout observances concluded lights were extinguished and the ladies kissed and entered their beds their beds were not homely to them dorothea thought that virginia was long in settling herself virginia did not like the sound of dorothea's double sigh both listened anxiously for the doings of tasso he rested he was uneasy he was rounding his basket once more unaware of the exaggeration of his iniquitous conduct poor innocent he shook that dreadful coat of his he had displaced the prophylactic cover of the scarf he drove them in a despair to speculate on the contention between the perfume and the stench in junction with such a doubt of the victory of which of the two as drags us to fear our worst it steals into our nostrils possesses them as the history of mankind has informed us we were led up to our civilization by the nose but philosophy warns us on that eminence to beware of trusting exclusively to our conductor lest the mind of us at least be plunged back into barbarism the ladies hated both the cause and the consequence they had a revulsion from the object of the above contention but call it not a contention there is nobility in that this was a compromise a degrading union with very sickening results whether they came of an excess of the sprinkling could not well be guessed the drenching at least was righteously intended beneath their shut eyelids they felt more and more the oppression of a darkness not laden with slumber they saw it insolidity themselves as restless billows driven dashing to the despondent sigh sleep was denied them tasso slept he had sinned unknowingly and that is not a spiritual sin the chastisement confers the pardon but why was this ineffable blessing denied to them was it that they might have a survey of all the day's deeds and examine them under the cruel black beams of insomnia virginia said 'you are wakeful' 'thoughtful' was the answer a century of the midnight rolled on dorothea said 'he behaved very beautifully' 'i looked at the general's portrait while he besought us' virginia replied 'one sees him in victor at victor's age try to sleep' 'i do i pray that you may' silence courted slumber their interchange of speech from the posture of bodies on their backs had been low and deliberate in the tone of the vaults dead silence recalled the strangeness of it the night was breathless their open window a peril bestowing no boon they were mutually haunted by sound of the gloomy query at the nostrils of each when drawing the vital breath but for that they thought they might have slept bed spake to bed 'the words of mr stuart rem last sunday' 'he said be just could one but see direction' 'in obscurity feeling is a guide' 'the heart' 'it may sometimes be followed' 'when it concerns the family' 'he would have the living who are seeking peace be just' 'not to assume the seat of justice' again they lay as tombstone effigies that have committed the passage of affairs to another procession of the ages there was a gentle sniff in hopeless confirmation of the experience of its predecessors a sister to it ensued 'could victor have spoken so without assurance in his conscience that his entreaty was righteously addressed to us that we' 'and no others' 'i think of his language he loves the child' 'in heart as in mind he is eminently gifted acknowledgeing error' 'he was very young' the huge funereal minutes conducted their sonorous hearse the hour it struck in the bed room three no more than three of the clock it was the voice telling of half the precious restorative night hours wasted now as we close our eyelids when we would go to sleep so must we in expectation of the peace of mind granting us the sweet oblivion preliminarily do something which invokes that we may obtain it 'dear' dorothea said 'i know indeed' said virginia 'we may have been' 'not designingly' 'indeed not but harsh it may be named if the one innocent is to be the sufferer' 'the child can in no sense be adjudged guilty' 'it is victor's child' 'he adores the child' wheels were in mute motion within them and presently the remark was tossed up 'in his coming to us it is possible to see paternal solicitude' thence came fruit of reflection 'to be instrumental as guides to a tender young life' reflection heated with visions 'once our dream' they had the happier feeling of composure though tasso possessed the room not tasso but a sublimated offensiveness issue of the antagonistically combined dispersed to be the more penetrating insomuch that it seemed to them they could not ever again make use of eau d'arquebusade without the vitiating reminder so true were the words of mr stuart rem 'half measures to purification are the most delusive of our artifices' fatigue and its reflections helped to be peacefuller their souls were mounting to a serenity above the nauseating degradation to which the poor little dog had dragged them 'victor gave his promise' 'at least concession would not imply contact with the guilty' both sighed as they took up the burden of the vaporous tasso to drop him with the greater satisfaction in the expelling of their breath 'it might be said dear that concession to his entreaty does not in any way countenance the sin' 'i can see dear how it might be read as a reproof' their exchange of sentences followed meditative pauses dorothea leading 'to one so sensitive as victor' 'a month or two of our society for the child' 'it is not the length of time' 'the limitation assures against maternal claims' 'she would not dare' 'he used the words her serious respect for us i should not wish to listen to him often' 'we listen to a higher' 'it may really be that the child is like him' 'not resembling mr stuart rem's clementina' 'a week of that child gave us our totally sleepless night' 'one thinks more hopefully of a child of victor's' 'he would preponderate' 'he would' they sighed but it was now with the relief of a lightened oppression 'if dear in truth the father's look is in the child he has the greater reason to desire for her a taste of our atmosphere' 'do not pursue it sleep' 'one prayer' 'your mention of our atmosphere dear destroys my power to frame one do you for two but i would cleanse my heart' 'there is none purer' 'hush' virginia spoke a more fervent word of praise of her sister and had not the hushing response to it she heard the soft regular breathing her own was in downy fellowship with it a moment later at the hour of nine in genial daylight sitting over the crumbs of his hotel breakfast victor received a little note that bore the handwriting of dorothea duvidney 'dear victor we are prepared to receive the child for a month in haste before your train our love d and v' his face flashed out of cloud a more precious document had never been handed to him it chased back to midnight the doubt hovering over his belief in himself phrased to say that he was no longer the victor radnor known to the world and it extinguished a corpse like recollection of a baleful dream in the night here shone radiant witness of his being the very man save for the spot of his recent confusion in distinguishing his identity or in feeling that he stood whole and solid because of two mature maiden ladies yes because of two maiden ladies my good fellow and friend colney you know the ladies and what the getting round them for one's purposes really means the sprite of colney durance had struck him smartly overnight victor's internal crow was over colney now and when you have the optimist and pessimist acutely opposed in a mixing group they direct lively conversations at one another across the gulf of distance even of time for a principle is involved besides the knowledge of the other's triumph or dismay the couple are scales of a balance and not before last night had victor ever consented to think of colney ascending while he dropped low to graze the pebbles he left his hotel for the station singing the great aria of the fourth act of the favorita neglected since that mighty german with his rienzi and tannhauser and tristan and isolda had mastered him to the displacement of his boyhood's beloved sugary inis and antes and zettis had clearly mastered not beguiled him had wafted him up to a new realm invigorating if severer but now his youth would have its voice he travelled up to town with sir abraham quatley and talked and took and gave hints upon city and commercial affairs while the honeyed italian of the conventional gloriously animal stress and flutter had a revel in his veins now and then mutedly ebullient at the mouth honeyed golden rich in visions having surely much more of nature's encouragement to her children chapter xxiv nesta's engagement a word in his ear from fenellan touching that man blathenoy set the wheels of victor's brain at work upon his defences for a minute on the walk westward who knew who did not know he had a torpid consciousness that he cringed to the world with an entreaty to the great monster to hold off in ignorance and the next instant he had caught its miserable spies by the lurcher neck and was towering he dwelt on his contempt of them to curtain the power they could stir 'the little woman you say took to dartrey' fenellan with the usual apologetic moderation of a second statement thought 'there was the look of it' 'well we must watch over her dartrey but dartrey's an honest fellow with women but men are men very few men spare a woman when the mad fit is on her a little woman pretty little woman wife to jacob blathenoy she mustn't at her age have any close choosing under her hand and dartrey's just the figure to strike a spark in a tinder box head' 'with a husband who'd reduce minerva's to tinder after a month of him' 'he spent his honeymoon at his place at wrensham told me so' blathenoy had therefore then heard of the building of lakelands by the victor radnor of the city and had then we guess in the usual honeymoon boasting of a windbag with his bride wheezed the foul gossip to hide his emptiness and do duty for amusement of the pretty little caged bird probably so but victor knew that blathenoy needed him and feared him probably the wife had been enjoined to keep silence for the blachingtons fannings and others were it could be sworn blank and unscratched folio sheets on the subject as yet unless mrs burman had dropped venom 'one pities the little woman eh fenellan' 'dartrey won't be back for a week or so and they're off to switzerland after the dinner they give i heard from him this morning one of the clanconans is ill 'lucky but wherever blathenoy takes her he must be the same arid bore as old colney says' 'a domestic simoom' said fenellan booming it and victor had a shudder 'awful thing marriage to some women we chain them to that domestic round most of them haven't the means of independence or a chance of winning it and all that's open to them if they've made a bad cast for a mate and good lord how are they to know before it's too late they haven't a choice except to play tricks or jump to the deuce or sit and drape in blight as colney has it though his notion of the optional marriages broken or renewed every seven years if he means it you never know with him it sounds like another squirt of savage irony it's donkey nonsense eh' 'the very hee haw of nonsense' fenellan acquiesced 'come come read your scriptures donkeys have shown wisdom' victor said rather leaning to the theme of a fretfulness of women in the legal yoke 'they're donkeys till we know them for prophets who can tell colney may be hailed for one fifty years hence' fenellan was not invited to enter the house although the loneliness of his lodgeings was known and also that he played whist at his club victor had grounds for turning to him at the door and squeezing his hand warmly by way of dismissal in ascribing them to a weariness at fenellan's perpetual acquiescence he put the cover on them and he stamped it with a repudiation of the charge that colney's views upon the great marriage question were the 'very hee haw of nonsense' they were not the hee haw in fact viewing the host of marriages they were for discussion there was no bray about them he could not feel them to be absurd while mrs burman's tenure of existence barred the ceremony anything for a phrase he murmured of fenellan's talk calling him dear old boy to soften the slight nataly had not seen fenellan or heard from dartrey so she continued to be uninformed of her hero's release and that was in the order of happy accidents she had hardly to look her interrogation for the news it radiated but he stated such matter of course briefly 'the good ladies are ready to receive our girl' her chagrin resolved to a kind of solace of her draggled pride in the idea that he who tamed everybody to submission might well have command of her the note signed d and v was shown there stood the words and last night she had been partly of the opinion of colney durance she sank down among the unreasoning abject not this time with her perfect love of him but with a resistance and a dubiety under compression for she had not quite comprehended why nesta should go this readiness of the duvidney ladies to receive the girl stopped her mental inquiries she begged for a week's delay 'before the parting' as her dear old silly mother's pathos whimpered it of the separation for a month and he smiled and hummed pleasantly at any small petition thinking her in error to expect dartrey's return to town before the close of a week and then wondering at women mildly denouncing in his heart the mothers who ran risk of disturbing their daughters' bosoms with regard to particular heroes married or not dartrey attracted women he was one of the men who do it without effort victor's provident mind blamed the mother for the indiscreetness of her wish to have him among them but dudley had been making way bravely of late he improved he began to bloom like a spring flower of the garden protected from frosts under glass and fredi was the sheltering and nourishing bestower of the lessons one could see his questions and other little points revealed that he had a certain lover's dread of dartrey fenellan a sort of jealousy victor understood the feeling to love a girl who has her ideal of a man elsewhere in another though she may know she never can wed the man and has not the hope of it is torment to the lover quailing as we do in this terrible season of the priceless deliciousness stripped against all the winds that blow skinless at times one gets up a sympathy for the poor shy dependent shivering lover nevertheless here was young dudley waking visibly becoming bolder as in the flute duets he gained fire from concert the distance between cronidge and moorsedge was two miles and a quarter instead of the delay of a whole week victor granted four days which embraced a musical evening at mrs john cormyn's on the last of the days when nesta was engaged to sing with her mother a duet of her own composition the first public fruit of her lessons in counterpoint from rigid herr strauscher who had said what he had said in letting it pass eulogy coming from him so victor heard and he doated am the surprise to come for him in a boyish anticipation the girl's little french ballads under tutelage of louise de seilles promised though they were imitative if strauscher let this pass victor saw grand opera somewhere to follow england's claim to be a creative musical nation vindicated and the genius of the fair sex as well he heard the duet at mrs cormyn's and he imagined a hearing of his fredi's opera and her godmother's delight in it the once famed sanfredini's consent to be the diva at a rehearsal and then her compelling her hidalgo duque to consent further an event not inconceivable for here was downright genius the flowering aloe of the many years in formation and colney admitted the song to have a streak of genius though he would pettishly and stupidly say that our modern newspaper press is able now to force genius for us twenty or so to the month excluding sundays our short pauses for the incubation of it real rare genius was in that song nothing forced and exquisite melody one of those melodies which fling gold chains about us and lead us off lead us back into eden victor hummed at bars of it on the drive homeward his darlings had to sing it again in the half lighted drawing room the bubble happiness of the three was vexed only by tidings heard from colney during the evening of a renewed instance of skepsey's misconduct priscilla graves had hurried away to him at the close of mr john cormyn's concert in consequence in grief and in sympathy skepsey was to appear before the magistrate next morning for having administered physical chastisement to his wife during one of her fits of drunkenness colney had seen him his version of the story was given however in the objectionable humorous manner none could gather from it of what might be pleaded for skepsey his 'lesson to his wife in the art of pugilism before granting her captain's rank among the defensive amazons of old england' was the customary patent absurdity but it was odd that skepsey always preferred his appeal for help to colney durance nesta proposed following priscilla that night she had hinted her wish on the way home she was urgent beseeching when her father lifted praises of her she had to start with her father by the train at seven in the morning and she could not hear of poor skepsey for a number of hours she begged a day's delay which would enable her she said to join them in dining at the blachingtons' and seeing dear lakelands again 'i was invited you know' she spoke in childish style and under her eyes she beheld her father and mother exchange looks he had a fear that nataly might support the girl's petition nataly read him to mean possible dangers among the people at wrensham she had seemed hesitating after meeting victor's look her refusal was firm she tried to make it one of distress for the use of the hard word to her own dear girl nesta spied beneath but what was it there was a reason for her going she had a right to stay and see and talk with captain dartrey and she was to be deported so now she set herself to remember little incidents at creckholt particularly a conversation in a very young girl's hearing upon sir humphrey and lady pottil's behaviour to the speakers her parents she had then and she now had an extraordinary feeling as from a wind striking upon soft summer weather off regions of ice that she was in her parents' way how the feeling was irrational it could give her no reply or only the multitudinous which are the question violently repeated she slept on it she and her father breakfasted by the london birds' first twitter they talked of skepsey she spoke of her going as exile 'no' said he 'you're sure to meet friends' her cheeks glowed it came wholly through the suddenness of the recollection that the family seat of one among the friends was near the wells he was allowed to fancy as it suited him to fancy that a vivid secret pleasure laid the colour on those ingenuous fair cheeks 'a solitary flute for me for a month i shall miss my sober comrade got the habit of duetting and he's gentle bears with me' tears lined her eyelids 'who would not be dearest dada but there is nothing to bear except the honour' 'you like him you and i always have the same tastes fredi' now there was a reddening of the sun at the mount all the sky aflame how could he know that it was not the heart in the face she reddened because she had perused his wishes had detected a scheme striking off from them and knew a man to be the object of it and because she had at the same time the sense of a flattery in her quick divination and she was responsively emotional her blood virginal often it was a tropical lightning it looked like the heart doing rich painter's work on maiden features victor was naturally as deceived as he wished to be from his being naturally so his remarks on dudley had an air of embracing him as one of the family 'his manner to me just hits me' 'i like to see him with you' she said her father let his tongue run 'one of the few young men i feel perfectly at home with i do like dealing with a gentleman i can confide in a gentleman honour heart whatever i hold dearest' there he stopped not too soon the girl was mute fully agreeing slightly hardening she had a painful sense of separation from her dear louise and it was now to be from her mother as well she felt the pain when kissing her mother in bed but this was moderated by the prospect of a holiday away out of reach of mr barmby's pursuing voice whom her mother favoured and her mother was concealing something from her so she could not make the confidante of her mother nataly had no forewarnings her simple regrets filled her bosom all night she had been taking her chastisement and in the morning it seemed good to her that she should be denuded for her girl to learn the felicity of having relatives for some reason over which nataly mused in the succeeding hours the girl had not spoken of any visit her mother was to pay to the duvidney ladies or they to her latterly she had not alluded to her mother's family it might mean that the beloved and dreaded was laying finger on a dark thing in the dark reading syllables by touch keeping silence over the communications to a mind not yet actively speculative as it is a way with young women 'with young women educated for the market to be timorous consequently secretive rather snaky' colney durance had said her nesta was not one of the 'framed and glazed' description cited by him for an example of the triumph of the product 'exactly harmonious with the ninny male's ideal of female innocence' no but what if the mother had opened her heart to her girl it had been of late her wish or a dream shaping hourly to a design now positively to go through that furnace her knowledge of victor's objection restrained an impulse that had not won spring enough to act against his counsel or vivify an intelligence grown dull in slavery under him with regard to the one seeming right course the adoption of it would have wounded him therefore her she had thought of him first she had also thought of herself and she blamed herself now she went so far as to think that victor was guilty of the schemer's error of counting human creatures arithmetically in the sum without the estimate of distinctive qualities and value here and there his return to a shivering sensitiveness on the subject of his girl's enlightenment 'just yet' for which nataly pitied and loved him sharing it with humiliation for doing so became finally her excuse we must have some excuse if we would keep to life skepsey's case appeared in the evening papers he confessed 'frankly' he said to the magistrate that 'acting under temporary exasperation he had lost for a moment a man's proper self command' he was as frank in stating that he 'occupied the prisoner's place before his worship a second time and was a second time indebted to the gentleman mr colney durance who so kindly stood by him' there was hilarity in the court at his quaint sententious envelopment of the idiom of the streets which he delivered with solemnity 'he could only plead not in absolute justification an appeal to human sentiments the feelings of a man of the humbler orders returning home in the evening and his thoughts upon things not without their importance to find repeatedly the guardian of his household beastly drunk and destructive' colney made the case quite intelligible to the magistrate who gravely robed a strain of the idiomatic in the officially awful to keep in tune with his delinquent no serious harm had been done to the woman skepsey was admonished and released his wife expressed her willingness to forgive him now he had got his lesson and she hoped he would understand that there was no need for a woman to learn pugilism skepsey would have explained but the case was over he was hustled out however a keen young reporter present smelt fun for copy he followed the couple and in a particular evening journal laughable matter was printed concerning skepsey's view of the pugilism to be imparted to women for their physical protection in extremity and the distinction of it from the blow conveying the moral lesson to them his wife having objected to the former because it annoyed her and he pestered her and she was never she said ready to stand up to him for practice as he called it except when she had taken more than he thought wholesome for her he had no sense there was a squabble between them because he chose to scour away to his master's office instead of conducting her home with the honours nesta read the young reporter's version with shrieks she led the ladies of moorsedge to discover amusement in it at first as her letter to her mother described them they were like a pair of pieces of costly china with the settled smile and cold she saw but the outside of them and she continued reporting the variations which steadily determined the warmth on the night of the third day they kissed her tenderly they were human figures no one could be aware of the trial undergone by the good ladies in receiving her victor's child but as their phrase would have run had they dared to give it utterance to one another a child of sin how foreign to them in that character how strange when she was looked on as an inhabitant of their house they hardly dared to estimate until the timorous estimation from gradually swelling suddenly sank nature invaded them they could discard the alienating sense of the taint and not only did they no longer fear the moment when mr stuart rem or mr posterley might call for evening tea but they consulted upon inviting the married one of those gentlemen to 'divert dear nesta' every night she slept well in all she did she proved she was 'of the blood' she had victor's animated eyes she might have they dreaded to think his eloquence they put it down to his eloquence entirely that their resistance to his petition had been overcome for similarly with the treatment of the private acts of royal personages by lacquey history there is in the minds of the ultra civilized an insistance that any event having a consequence in matters personal to them be at all hazards recorded with the utmost nicety in decency by such means they preserve the ceremonial self respect which is a necessity of their existence and so they maintain the regal elevation over the awe struck subjects of their interiors who might otherwise revolt pull down scatter dishonour expose for a shallow fiction the holiest the most vital to them a democratic evil spirit is abroad generated among congregations often perilously communicating its wanton laughter to the desperate wickedness they know not solely through the monition of mr stuart rem to lurk within it has to be excluded on certain points they must not think the night of tasso was darkly clouded in the minds of the pure ladies a rift would have seized their half slumbering sense of smell to revive the night perhaps disorder the stately march of their intelligences victor's eloquence victor's influence victor's child he carried them as a floodstream insomuch that their reception of this young creature of the blot on her birth was regarded by them in the unmentioned abstract and the child's presence upon earth seen with the indulgence without the naughty curiosity of the loyal moral english for the numerous offspring of the peccadillos of their monarchs these things pass muster from being 'britannically cocooned in the purple' says our irreverent satirist and the maiden ladies' passion of devotion to 'the blood' helped to blind them but still more so did the imperious urgency to curtain closely the night of tasso throwing all its consequences upon victor's masterful tongue whence it ensued and here is the danger for illogical individuals as well as vast communities who continue to batten upon fiction when the convenience of it has taken the place of pleasure that they had need to exalt his eloquence for a cloak to their conduct and doing it they fell into a habit of yielding to him they disintegrated under him rules principles morality were shaken to some confusion and still proceeding thus they now and then glanced back more wonderingly than convicted sinners upon their days of early innocence at the night when successfully they withstood him they who had doubted of the rightness of letting victor's girl come into collision with two clerical gentlemen one of whom was married permitted him now to bring the hon dudley sowerby to their house and make appointments to meet mr dudley sowerby under a roof that sheltered a young lady evidently the allurement to the scion of aristocracy of whose family mr stuart rem had spoken in the very kindling hushed tones proper to the union of a sacerdotal and an english citizen's veneration how would it end and if some day this excellent mr dudley sowerby reproached them he could not have a sweeter bride one more truly a lady in education and manners but the birth the child's name their trouble was emitted in a vapour of interjections very perplexing was it for the good ladies of strict principles to reflect as dimly they did that the concrete presence of dear nesta silenced and overcame objections to her being upon earth she seemed as it were a draught of redoubtable nature inebriating morality but would others be similarly affected victor might get his release to do justice to the mother it would not cover the child prize as they might the quality of the radnor blood drawn from the most ancient of original britain's princes there was also the cantor blood for consideration and it was old noble proud would it be satisfied in matching itself with great wealth a radiant health and the good looks of a young flower for the sake of the dear girl the ladies hoped that it would and they enlarged the outline of their wedding present while in their minds the noble english family which could be satisfied so was lowered partaking of the taint they had personally ceased to recognize of one thing they were sure and it enlisted them the gentleman loved the girl her love of him had it been prominent to view would have stirred a feminine sigh not more except a feminine lecture to follow she was quite uninflamed fresh and cool as a spring his ardour had no disguise they measured him by the favourite fiction's heroes of their youth and found him to gaze talk comport himself according to the prescription correct grammar finished sentences all that is expected of a gentleman enamoured and ever with the watchful intentness for his lady's faintest first dawn of an inclining to a wish mr dudley sowerby's eye upon nesta was really an apprentice there is in love's young season a magnanimity in the male kind their superior strength and knowledge are made subservient to the distaff of the weaker and shallower they crown her queen her look is their mandate so was it when sir charles and sir rupert and the estimable villiers davenant touched maidenly hearts to throb so is it now with the hon dudley sowerby very haltingly the ladies were guilty of a suggestion to victor 'oh fredi' said he 'admires her no doubt and so do i so we all do she's one of the nice girls but as to cupid's darts she belongs to the cucumber family and he shoots without fireing we shall do the mischief if we put an interdict don't you remember the green days when obstacles were the friction to light that match' their pretty nod of assent displayed the virgin pride of the remembrance they dreamed of having once been exceedingly wilful it refreshed their nipped natures and dwelling on it they forgot to press their suggestion incidentally he named the sum his fredi would convey to her husband with as was calculable the further amount his only child would inherit a curious effect was produced on them though they were not imaginatively mercenary as the creatures tainted with wealth commonly are they talked of the sum over and over in the solitude of their chamber 'dukes have married for less' such an heiress they said might buy up a principality victor had supplied them with something of an apology to the gentleman proposing to nesta in their house the chronicle of it is that dudley sowerby did this on the fifteenth day of september and that it was not known to the damsel's parents before the twenty third as they were away on an excursion in south tyrol away flown with just a word of the hurried departure to their envious exiled girl though they did not tell her of new constructions at the london house partly causing them to fly subject to their consent she wrote she had given hers the letter was telegramic on the essential point she wrote of mr barmby's having visited mr posterley at the wells and she put it just as flatly her principal concern to judge by her writing was to know what mr durance had done during her absence with the group of emissary advocates of the various tongues of europe on board the steam liner conducting them the first stage of their journey to the court of japan mr simeon fenellan had written his opinion that all these delegates of the different european nationalities were nothing other than dupes of a new york syndicate of american humorists not without an eye on the mainchance and he was sure they would be set to debate publicly before an audience of high priced tickets in the principal north american cities previous to the embarcation for japan at san francisco mr fenellan eulogized the immense astuteness of dr gannius in taking his daughter delphica with him dr gannius had singled forth poor dr bouthoin for the object of his attacks but nesta was chiefly anxious to hear of delphica's proceedings she was immensely interested in delphica and envied her and the girl's funny speculations over the play of delphica's divers arts upon the greek and upon the russian and upon the english curate mr semhians and upon m falarique set gallically pluming and crowing out of an alsace lorraine growl were clever only in such a letter they were amazing nataly received it at campiglio when about to start for an excursion down the sarca valley to arco her letter of reply was delayed one to victor from dudley sowerby awaited them on their return 'confirms fredi' he said showing it and praising it as commendable properly fervid she made pretence to read she saw the words her short beat of wings was over she had joined herself with victor's leap for a change thirsting for the scenery of the white peaks in heaven to enjoy through his enjoyment if her own capacity was dead and she had found it revive up to some recovery of her old songful readiness for invocations of pleasure escape and beauty beckoned ahead behind were the chains these two letters of the one fact plucked her back the chained body bore the fluttering spirit or it was the spirit in bonds that dragged the body both were abashed before the image of her girl out of the riddle of her strange nesta one thing was clear she did not love the man and nataly tasted gladness in that from the cup of poisonous regrets at the thought her girl's heart would not be broken but if he so strongly loved her as to hold to this engagement it might then be worse she dropped a plumb line into the young man sounding him by what she knew of him and judged she had to revert to nesta's charm for the assurance of his anchored attachment her holiday took the burden of her trouble and amid the beauty of a disenchanted scene she resumed the london incubus 'you told him of her being at the wells in the neighbourhood victor' 'didn't you know my dear the family seat is cronidge two miles out from the wells and particularly pretty country' 'i had forgotten if i ever heard you will not let him be in ignorance' 'my dear love you are pale about it this is a matter between men i write thanking for the honour and so forth and i appoint an interview and i show him my tablets he must be told necessarily incidents of this kind come in their turn if dudley does not account himself the luckiest young fellow in the kingdom he's not worthy of his good fortune i wish they were both here now honeymooning among these peaks seeing the crescent over one as we did last night' 'have you an idea in reading nesta's letter' 'seems indifferent mere trick to hide the blushes and i too i'm interested in delphica delphica and falarique will be fine stage business of course dr bouthoin and his curate we know what old england has to expect from colney' 'at any rate mr durance hurts no one you will in your letter appoint the day of the interview' 'hurts himself yes dearest appoint for ten days homeward eleventh day from to day and you to fredi a bit of description as you can my nataly happy to be a dolomite to be painted by nataly's pen' the sign is evil when we have a vexatious ringing in the ear of some small piece of familiar domestic chatter and subject it to scrutiny hang on it worry and magnify it what will not creatures under sway of the sensational life catch at to emphasize and strengthen distaste until distaste shall have a semblance of reason in the period of the mind's awakening to revolt nataly shrank from the name of dolomite detested the name though the scenes regained their beauty or something of it beneath her showery vision every time victor spoke of dolomites on the journey homeward she had at heart an accusation of her cowardice her duplicity frailty treachery to the highest of her worship and sole support of her endurance in the world not much blaming him but the degrading view of herself sank them both on a shifty soil down goes the idol for him she could plead still for herself she could not the smell of the channel brine inspirited her sufficiently to cast off the fit and make it seem in the main a bodily depression owing to causes of which she was beginning to have an apprehensive knowledge and they were not so fearful to her as the gloom they displaced chapter xxv nataly in action a ticket of herald newspapers told the world of victor's returning to his london pretty mrs blathenoy was nataly's first afternoon visitor and was graciously received no sign of inquiry for the cause of the lady's alacrity to greet her being shown colney durance came in bringing the rumour of an australian cantatrice to kindle europe mr peridon a seeker of tidings from the city of bourges miss priscilla graves reporting of skepsey in a holiday sunday tone that his alcoholic partner might at any moment release him mr septimus barmby with a hanged heavy look suggestive of a wharfside crane swinging the ponderous thing he had to say 'i have seen miss radnor' 'she was well' the mother asked and the grand basso pitched forth an affirmative 'dear sweet girl she is' mrs blathenoy exclaimed to colney he bowed 'very sweet and can let fly on you like a haggis for a scratch' she laughed glad of an escape from the conversational formalities imposed on her by this mrs victor radnor's mighty manner 'but what girl worth anything we all can do that i hope for a scratch' mr barmby's profession dissented mr catkin appeared ten minutes after his peridon he had met victor near the exchange and had left him humming the non fu sogno of ernani 'ah when victor takes to verdi it's a flat city and wants a burst of drum and brass' colney said and he hummed a few bars of the march in attila and shrugged he and victor had once admired that blatancy mr pempton appeared according to anticipation he sat himself beside priscilla entered mrs john cormyn voluminous mrs peter yatt effervescent nataly's own people were about her and she felt at home mrs blathenoy pushed a small thorn into it by speaking of captain fenellan and aside as if sharing him with her nataly heard that dartrey had been the guest of these blathenoys even dartrey was but a man rather lower under her voice the vain little creature asked 'you knew her' 'her' the cool counter interrogation was disregarded 'so sad in the desert a cup of pure water worth more than barrow loads of gold poor woman' 'who' 'his wife' 'wife' 'they were married' nataly could have cried snake her play at brevity had certainly been foiled she nodded gravely a load of dusky wonders and speculations pressed at her bosom she disdained to question the mouth which had bitten her mrs blathenoy resolving that despite the jealousy she excited she would have her friend in captain fenellan whom she liked liked she was sure quite as innocently as any other woman of his acquaintance did departed and she hugged her innocence defiantly with the mournful pride which will sometimes act as a solvent a remark or two passed among the company upon her pretty face nataly murmured to colney 'is there anything of dartrey's wife' 'dead' he answered 'when' 'months back i had it from simeon you didn't hear' she shook her head her ears buzzed if he had it from simeon fenellan victor must have known it her duties of hostess were conducted with the official smile as soon as she stood alone she dropped on a chair like one who has taken a shot in the heart and that hideous tumult of wild cries at her ears blankly ceased dartrey victor nesta were shifting figures of the might have been for whom a wretched erring woman washed clean of her guilt by death in a far land had gone to her end vainly gone and now another was here a figure of wood in man's shape conjured up by one of the three to divide the two others likely to be fatal to her or to them to her she hoped if the choice was to be and beneath the leaden hope her heart set to a rapid beating a fainter a chill at the core she snatched for breath she shut her eyes and with open lips lay waiting prepared to thank the kindness about to hurry her hence out of the seas of pain without pain then came sighs the sad old servant in her bosom was resuming his labours but she had been near it very near it a gush of pity for victor overwhelmed her hardness of mind unreflectingly she tried her feet to support her and tottered to the door touched along to the stairs and descended them thinking strangely upon such a sudden weakness of body when she would no longer have thought herself the weak woman her aim was to reach the library she sat on the stairs midway pondering over the length of her journey and now her head was clearer for she was travelling to get railway guides and might have had them from the hands of a footman and imagined that she had considered it prudent to hide her investigation of those books proofs of an understanding fallen backward to the state of infant and having to begin our drear ascent again a slam of the kitchen stair door restored her she betrayed no infirmity of footing as she walked past arlington in the hall and she was alive to the voice of skepsey presently on the door steps arlington brought her a note victor had written 'my love i dine with blathenoy in the city at the walworth business skepsey for clothes eight of us formal a thousand embraces late' skepsey was ushered in his wife had expired at noon he said and he postured decorously the grief he could not feel knowing that a lady would expect it of him his wife had fallen down stone steps she died in hospital he wished to say she was no loss to the country but he was advised within of the prudence of abstaining from comment and trusting to his posture and he squeezed a drop of conventional sensibility out of it and felt improved nataly sent a line to victor 'dearest i go to bed early am tired dine well come to me in the morning' she reproached herself for coldness to poor skepsey when he had gone the prospect of her being alone until the morning had been so absorbing a relief she found a relief also in work at the book of the trains a walk to the telegraph station strengthened her especially after despatching a telegram to mr dudley sowerby at cronidge and one to nesta at moorsedge did she become stoutly nerved the former was requested to meet her at penhurst station at noon nesta was to be at the station for the wells at three o'clock from the time of the flying of these telegrams up to the tap of victor's knuckle on her bed room door next morning she was not more reflectively conscious than a packet travelling to its destination by pneumatic tube nor was she acutely impressionable to the features and the voice she loved 'you know of skepsey' she said 'ah poor skepsey' victor frowned and heaved 'one of us ought to stand beside him at the funeral' 'colney or fenellan' 'i will ask mr durance' 'do my darling' 'victor you did not tell me of dartrey's wife' 'there again they all get released yes dartrey dartrey has his luck too' she closed her eyes with the desire to be asleep 'you should have told me dear' 'well my love well poor dartrey i fancy i hadn't a confirmation of the news i remember a horrible fit of envy on hearing the hint not much more than a hint serious illness was it or expected event hardly worth while to trouble my dear soul till certain anything about wives forces me to think of myself my better self' 'i had to hear of it first from mrs blathenoy' 'you've heard of duels in dark rooms that was the case between blathenoy and me last night for an hour' she feigned somnolent fatigue over her feverish weariness of heart he kissed her on the forehead her spell bound intention to speak of dudley sowerby to him was broken by the sounding of the hall door thirty minutes later she had lain in a trance life surged to her with the thought that she could decide and take her step many were the years back since she had taken a step less independently then than now unregretted if fatal her brain was heated for the larger view of things and the swifter summing of them it could put the man at a remove from her and say that she had lived with him and suffered intensely it gathered him to her breast rejoicing in their union the sharper the scourge the keener the exultation but she had one reproach to deafen and beat down this did not come on her from the world she and the world were too much foot to foot on the antagonist's line for her to listen humbly it came of her quick summary survey of him which was unnoticed by the woman's present fiery mind as being new or strange in any way simply it was a fact she now read and it directed her to reproach herself for an abasement beneath his leadership a blind subserviency and surrender of her faculties to his greater powers such as no soul of a breathing body should yield to man not to the highest not to the titan not to the most godlike of men under cloak they demand it they demand their bane and victor she had seen into him the reproach on her was that she in her worship had been slave not helper scarcely was she irreproachable in the character of slave if it had been utter slave she phrased the words for a further reproach she remembered having at times murmured dissented and it would have been a desperate proud thought to comfort a slave that never once had she known even a secret opposition to the will of her lord but she had she recalled instances up they rose up rose everything her mind ranged over subsiding immediately when the service was done she had not conceived her beloved to be infallible surest of guides in all earthly matters her intellect had sometimes protested what then had moved her to swamp it her heart answered and that heart also was arraigned and the heart's fleshly habitation acting on it besides so flagellant of herself was she covertly however and as the chaste among women can consent to let our animal face them not grossly still perceptibly to her penetrative hard eye on herself she saw the senses of the woman under a charm she saw and swam whirling with a pang of revolt from her personal being and this mortal kind her rational intelligence righted her speedily she could say in truth by proof she loved the man nature's love heart's love soul's love she had given him her life it was a happy cross current recollection that the very beginning and spring of this wild cast of her life issued from something he said and did merest of airy gestures to signify the blessing of life how good and fair it is a drooping mood in her had been struck he had a look like the winged lyric up in blue heavens he raised the head of the young flower from its contemplation of grave mould that was when he had much to bear mrs burman present and when the stranger in their household had begun to pity him and have a dread of her feelings the lucent splendour of his eyes was memorable a light above the rolling oceans of time she had given him her life little aid she might have closely counselled wound in and out with his ideas sensible of capacity she confessed to the having been morally subdued physically as well swept onward and she was arrested now by an accident like a waif of the river floods by the dip of a branch time that it should be but was not mr durance inveighing against the favoured system for the education of women right when he declared them to be unfitted to speak an opinion on any matter external to the household or in a crisis of the household she had not agreed with him he presented stinging sentences which irritated more than they enlightened now it seemed to her that the model women of men make pleasant slaves not true mates they lack the worldly training to know themselves or take a grasp of circumstances there is an exotic fostering of the senses for women not the strengthening breath of vital common air if good fortune is with them all may go well the stake of their fates is upon the perpetual smooth flow of good fortune she had never joined to the cry of the women few among them were having it in the breast as loudly hard on herself too she perceived how the social rebel had reduced her mind to propitiate a simulacrum reflected from out of an enthroned society within it by an advocacy of the existing laws and rules and habits eminently servile is the tolerated lawbreaker none so conservative not until we are driven back upon an unviolated nature do we call to the intellect to think radically and then we begin to think of our fellows or when we have set ourselves in motion direct for the doing of the right thing have quitted the carriage at the station and secured the ticket and entered the train counting the passage of time for a simple rapid hour before we have eased heart in doing justice to ourself and to another then likewise the mind is lighted for radiation that doing of the right thing after a term of paralysis cowardice any evil name is one of the mighty reliefs equal to happiness of longer duration nataly had it but her mind was actually radiating and the comfort to her heart evoked the image of dartrey fenellan she saw a possible reason for her bluntness to the coming scene with dudley at once she said no and closed the curtain knowing what was behind counting it nought she repeated almost honestly her positive negative how we are mixed of the many elements she thought as an observer and self justifyingly thought on and with truth that duty urged her upon this journey and proudly thought that she had not a shock of the painful great organ in her breast at the prospect at the end or any apprehension of its failure to carry her through yet the need of peace or some solace needed to prepare her for her interview turned her imagination burningly on dartrey she would not allow herself to meditate over hopes and schemes nesta free dartrey free she vowed to her soul sacredly and she was one of those in whom the divinity lives that they may do so not to speak a word for the influencing of dudley save the one fact consequently for a personal indulgence she mused she caressed maternally the object of her musing of necessity she excluded nesta but in tenderness she gave dartrey a fair one to love him the scene was waved away that one so loving him partly worthy of him ready to traverse the world now beside him who could it be other than she who knew and prized his worth foolish it is one of the hatefuller scourges upon women whenever a little shaken themselves they muse upon some man's image that they cannot put in motion the least bit of drama without letting feminine self play a part generally to develop into a principal part the apology makes it a melancholy part dartrey's temper of the caged lion dominated by his tamer served as keynote for any amount of saddest colouring he controlled the brute but he held the contempt of danger the love of strife the passion for adventure he had crossed the desert of human anguish he of all men required a devoted mate merited her of all men living he was the hardest to match with a woman with a woman deserving him the train had quitted london now for the country now for free breathing she who two days back had come from alps delighted in the look on flat green fields it was under the hallucination of her saying in flight adieu to them and to england and that somewhere hidden to be found in asia africa america was the man whose ideal of life was higher than enjoyment his caged brute of a temper offered opportunities for delicious petting the sweetest a woman can bestow it lifts her out of timidity into an adoration still palpitatingly fearful ah but familiarity knowledge confirmed assurance of his character lift her to another stage above the pleasures may she not prove to him how really matched with him she is to disdain the pleasures cheerfully accept the burdens meet death if need be readily face it as the quietly grey to morrow at least show herself to her hero for a woman the incredible being to most men who treads the terrors as well as the pleasures of humanity beneath her feet and may therefore have some pride in her stature ay but only to feel the pride of standing not so shamefully below his level beside him woods were flying past the carriage windows her solitary companion was of the class of the admiring gentlemen presently he spoke she answered he spoke again her mouth smiled and her accompanying look of abstract benevolence arrested the tentative allurement to conversation new ideas were set revolving in her dartrey and victor grew to a likeness they became hazily one man and the mingled phantom complimented her on her preserving a good share of the beauty of her youth the face perhaps the figure rather too well suits the years she replied to reassure her this dartrey victor drew her close and kissed her and she was confused and passed into the breast of mrs burman expecting an operation at the hands of the surgeons the train had stopped 'penhurst' she said 'penhurst is the next station' said the gentleman here was a theme for him the stately mansion the noble grounds and sidney he discoursed of them the handsome lady appeared interested she was interested also by his description of a neighbouring village likely one hundred years hence to be a place of pilgrimage for americans and for australians age he said improves true beauty and his eyelids indicated a levelling to perform the soft intentness mechanically a ball rose in her throat the remark was illuminated by a saying of colney's with regard to his countrymen at the play of courtship no laughter came the gentleman talked on all fancies and internal communications left her slowness of motion brought her to the plain piece of work she had to do on a colourless earth that seemed foggy but one could see one's way resolution is a form of light our native light in this dubious world dudley sowerby opened her carriage door they greeted 'you have seen nesta' she said 'not for two days you have not heard the miss duvidneys have gone to brighton' 'they are rather in advance of the season' she thanked him for meeting her he was grateful for the summons informing the mother of his betrothed that he had ridden over from cronidge he speculated on the place to select for her luncheon and he spoke of his horse being led up and down outside the station nataly inquired for the hour of the next train to london he called to one of the porters obtained and imparted the time evidently now as shown by an unevenness of his lifted brows expecting news of some little weight 'your husband is quite well' he said in affection for the name of husband 'mr radnor is well i have to speak to you i have more than time' 'you will lunch at the inn' 'i shall not eat we will walk' they crossed the road and passed under trees 'my mother was to have called on the miss duvidneys they left hurriedly i think it was unanticipated by nesta i venture you pardon the liberty she allows me to entertain hopes mr radnor i am hardly too bold in thinking i trust in appealing to you at least i can promise 'mr sowerby you have done my daughter the honour to ask her hand in marriage' he said 'i have' and had much to say besides but deferred a blow was visible the father had been more encouraging to him than the mother 'you have not known of any circumstance that might cause hesitation in asking' 'miss radnor' 'my daughter you have to think of your family' 'indeed mrs radnor i was coming to london tomorrow with the consent of my family' 'you address me as mrs radnor i have not the legal right to the name' 'not legal' said he with a catch at the word he spun round in her sight though his demeanour was manfully rigid 'have i understood madam' 'you would not request me to repeat it is that your horse the man is leading' 'my horse it must be my horse' 'mount and ride back leave me i shall not eat reflect by yourself you are in a position of one who is not allowed to decide by his feelings mr radnor you know where to find' 'but surely some food i cannot have misapprehended' 'i cannot eat i think you have understood me clearly' 'you wish me to go' 'i beg' 'it pains me dear madam' 'it relieves me if you will here is your horse' she gave her hand he touched it and bent he looked at her a surge of impossible questions rolled to his mouth and rolled back with the thought of an incredible thing that her manner more than her words held him from doubting 'i obey you' he said 'you are kind' he mounted horse raised hat paced on and again bowing to one of the wayside trees cantered the man was gone but not from nataly's vision that face of wet chalk under one of the shades of fire chapter xxvi in which we see a conventional gentleman endeavouring to examine a spectre of himself dudley rode back to cronidge with his thunderstroke it filled him as in those halls of political clamour where explanatory speech is not accepted because of a drowning tide of hot blood on both sides he sought to win attention by submitting a resolution to the effect that he would the next morning enter into the presence of mr victor radnor bearing his family's feelings for a discussion upon them but the brutish tumult in addition to surcharging encased him he could not rightly conceive the nature of feelings men were driving shoals he had lost hearing and touch of individual men had become a house of angrily opposing parties he was hurt he knew and therefore he supposed himself injured though there were contrary outcries and he admitted that he stood free he had not been inextricably deceived the girl was caught away to the thinnest of wisps in a dust whirl reverting to the father and mother his idea of a positive injury that was not without its congratulations sank him down among his disordered deeper sentiments which were a diver's wreck where an armoured livid subtermarine a monstrous puff ball of man wandered seriously light in heaviness trembling his hundredweights to keep him from dancing like a bladder block of elastic lumber thinking occasionally amid the mournful spectacle of the atmospheric pipe of communication with the world above whereby he was deafened yet sustained one tug at it and he was up on the surface disengaged from the hideous harness joyfully no more that burly phantom cleaving green slime free and the roaring stopped the world looked flat foreign a place of crusty promise his wreck animated by the dim strange fish below appeared fairer it winked lurefully when abandoned the internal state of a gentleman who detested intangible metaphor as heartily as the vulgarest of our gobblegobbets hate it metaphor only can describe and for the reason that he had in him just something more than is within the compass of the language of the meat markets he had and had it not the less because he fain would not have had sufficient stuff to furnish forth a soul's epic encounter between nature and circumstance and metaphor simile analysis all the fraternity of old lamps for lighting our abysmal darkness have to be rubbed that we may get a glimpse of the fray free and rejoicing without the wish to be free at the same time humbly and sadly acquiescing in the stronger claim of his family to pronounce the decision such was the second stage of dudley's perturbation after the blow a letter of nesta's writing was in his pocket he knew her address he could not reply to her until he had seen her father and that interview remained necessarily prospective until he had come to his exact resolve not omitting his critical approval of the sentences giving it shape stamp dignity a noble's crest as it were nesta wrote briefly the apostrophe was 'dear mr sowerby' she had engaged to send her address her father had just gone the miss duvidneys had left the hotel yesterday for the furnished house facing the sea according to arrangements she had a livery stable hack and had that morning trotted out to the downs with a riding master and company one of whom was 'an agreeable lady' he noticed approvingly her avoidance of an allusion to the 'delphica' of mr durance's incomprehensible serial story or whatever it was which as he had shown her annoyed him for its being neither fact nor fun and she had insisted on the fun and he had painfully tried to see it or anything of a meaning and it seemed to him now that he had been humiliated by the obedience to her lead she had offended by her harping upon delphica however here it was unmentioned he held the letter out to seize it in the large entire her handwriting was good as good as the writing of the most agreeable lady on earth dudley did not blame her for letting the lady be deceived in her if she knew her position she might be ignorant of it and to strangers to chance acquaintances even to friends the position of the loathsome name was not materially important marriage altered the view he sided with his family he sided edgeing away against his family but a vision of the earldom coming to him stirred reverential objections composed of all which his unstained family could protest in religion to repudiate an alliance with a stained house and the guilty of a condonation of immorality who would have imagined mr radnor a private sinner flaunting for one of the righteous and she the mother a lady quite a lady having really a sense of duty sense of honour that she must be a lady dudley was convinced he beheld through a porous crape woven of formal respectfulness with threads of personal disgust the scene striking him drearly like a distant great mansion's conflagration across moorland at midnight of a lady's breach of bonds and plunge of all for love how had it been concealed in dudley's upper sphere everything was exposed scandal walked naked and unashamed figurante of the polite world but still this lady was of the mint and coin a true lady handsome now she must have been beautiful and a comprehensible pride for so would dudley have borne it keeps the forsaken man silent up to death grandly silent but the loss of such a woman is enough to kill a man not in time though legitimacy evidently by the mother's confession cannot protect where it is wanted dudley was optically affected by a round spot of the world swinging its shadow over nesta he pitied and strove to be sensible of her the effort succeeded so well that he was presently striving to be insensible the former state was the mounting of a wall the latter was a sinking through a chasm there would be family consultations abhorrent his father's agonized amazement at the problem presented to a family of scrupulous principles and pecuniary requirements his mother's blunt mention of the abominable name mediaevally vindicated in champions of certain princely families indeed but morally condemned always under condemnation of the church a blot and handed down posterity and it might be a titled posterity crying out a man in the situation of dudley could not think solely of himself the nobles of the land are bound in honour to their posterity there you have one of the prominent permanent distinctions between them and the commonalty his mother would again propose her chosen bride for him edith averst with the dowry of a present one thousand pounds per annum and prospect of six or so excluding sir john's estate carping in leicestershire a fair estate likely to fall to edith consumption seized her brothers as they ripened a fair girl too only dudley did not love her he wanted to love he was learning the trick from this other one who had become obscured and diminished tainted to the thought of her yet not extinct sight of her was to be dreaded unguiltily tainted in herself she was innocent that constituted the unhappy invitation to him to swallow one half of his feelings which had his world's blessing on it for the beneficial enlargement and enthronement of the baser unblest half which he hugged and distrusted can innocence issue of the guilty he asked it hopeing it might be possible he had been educated in his family to believe that the laws governing human institutions are divine until history has altered them they are altered to present a fresh bulwark against the infidel his conservative mind retiring in good order occupied the next rearward post of resistance secretly behind it the man was proud of having a heart to beat for the cause of the besiegeing enemy in the present instance when this was blabbed to him and he had owned it he attributed his weakness to excess of nature the liking for a fair face oh but more spirit was in the sweet eyes she led him she did lead him in spiritual things led him out of common circles of thought into refreshing new spheres he had reminiscences of his having relished the juices of the not quite obviously comic through her indications and really in spite of her inferior flimsy girl's education she could boast her acquirements she was quick startlingly modest too in commerce with a slower mind that carried more though she laughed and was a needle for humour she taught him at times to put away his contempt of the romantic she had actually shown him that his expressed contempt of it disguised a dread as it did and he was conscious of the foolishness of it now while pursuing her image while his intelligence and senses gave her the form and glory of young morning wariness counselled him to think it might be merely the play of her youth and also the disposition of a man in harness of business exaggeratingly to prize an imagined finding of the complementary feminine of himself venerating purity as he did the question whether the very sweetest of pure young women having such an origin must not at some time or other show trace of the origin surged up if he could only have been sure of her moral exemption from taint a generous ardour in reserve behind his anxious dubieties would have precipitated dudley to quench disapprobation and brave the world under a buckler of those monetary advantages which he had but stoutly to plead with the house of cantor for the speedy overcoming of a reluctance to receive the nameless girl and prodigious heiress his family's instruction of him and his inherited tastes rendered the aspect of a nature stripped of the clothing of the laws offensive down to devilish we grant her certain steps upon certain conditions accompanied by ceremonies and when she violates them she becomes visibly again the revolutionary wicked old beast bent on levelling our sacredest edifices an alliance with any of her votaries appeared to dudley as an act of treason to his house his class and his tenets and nevertheless he was haunted by a cry of criminal happiness for and at the commission of the act he would not decide to be 'precipitate' and the days ran their course until lady grace halley arrived at cronidge a widow lady cantor spoke to her of dudley's unfathomable gloom lady grace took him aside she said without preface 'you've heard have you' 'you were aware of it' said he and his tone was irritable with a rebuke 'coming through town for the first time yesterday i had it of all men from a sir abraham quatley to whom i was recommended to go about my husband's shares in a south american railway and we talked and it came out he knows he says it is not generally known and he likes respects mr victor radnor we are to keep the secret hum he had heard of your pretensions and our relationship etc esteemed it you know the city dialect his duty to mention etc that was after i had spied on his forehead the something i wormed out of his mouth what are you going to do' 'what can i do' 'are you fond of the girl' an attachment was indicated as belonging to the case she was not a woman to whom the breathing of pastoral passion would be suitable yet he saw that she despised him for a lover and still she professed to understand his dilemma perplexity at the injustice of fate and persons universally put a wrinkled mask on his features and the expression of his feelings they were torn and the world was torn and what he wanted was delay time for him to define his feelings and behold a recomposed picture of the world he had already taken six days he pleaded the shock to his family 'you won't have such a chance again' she said shrugs had set in they agreed as to the behaviour of the girl's mother it reflected on the father he thought 'difficult thing to proclaim before an engagement' her shoulders were restless 'when a man's feelings get entangled' 'oh a man's feelings i'm your british jury for a woman's' 'he has married her' she declared to not knowing particulars she could fib smoothly the next day she was on the line to london armed with the proposal of an appointment for the hon dudley to meet 'the girl's father' chapter xxvii contains what is a small thing or a great as the soul of the chief actor may decide skepsey ushered lady grace into his master's private room and entertained her during his master's absence he had buried his wife he said she feared seeing his posture of the soaping of hands at one shoulder that he was about to bewail it and he did wish to talk of it to show his modest companionship with her in loss and how a consolation for our sorrows may be obtained but he won her approval by taking the acceptable course between the dues to the subject and those to his hearer as a model cab should drive considerate equally of horse and fare a day of holiday at hampstead after the lowering of the poor woman's bones into earth had been followed by a descent upon london and at night he had found himself in the immediate neighbourhood of a public house noted for sparring exhibitions and instructions on the first floor and he was melancholy unable quite to disperse 'the ravens' flocking to us on such days though if we ask why we have to go out of the world there is a corresponding inquiry of what good was our coming into it and unless we are doing good work for our country the answer is not satisfactory except that we are as well gone thinking which he was accosted by a young woman perfectly respectable in every way who inquired if he had seen a young man enter the door she described him and reviled the temptations of those houses and ultimately as she insisted upon going in to look for the young man and use her persuasions to withdraw him from 'that snare of satan' he had accompanied her and he had gone upstairs and brought the young man down but friends or the acquaintances they call friends were with him and they were 'in drink' and abused the young woman and she had her hand on the young man's arm quoting scripture sad to relate of men bearing the name of englishmen and it was hardly much better if they pleaded intoxication they were not content to tear the young man from her grasp they hustled her pushed her out dragged her in the street 'it became me to step to her defence she was meek' said skepsey 'she had a great opinion of the efficacy of quotations from scripture she did not recriminate i was able to release her and the young man she protected on condition of my going upstairs to give a display of my proficiency i had assured them that the poor fellows who stood against me were not a proper match and of course they jeered but they had the evidence on the pavement so i went up with them i was heavily oppressed i wanted relief i put on the gloves he was a bigger man they laughed at the little one i told them it depended upon a knowledge of first principles and the power to apply them i will not boast my lady my junior by ten years the man went down he went down a second time and the men seemed surprised i told them it was nothing but first principles put into action i mention the incident for the extreme relief it afforded me at the close of a dark day' 'so you cured your grief' said lady grace and skepsey made way for his master victor's festival lights were kindled beholding her cressets on the window sill lamps inside 'am i so welcome' there was a pull of emotion at her smile 'what with your little factotum and you we are flattered to perdition when we come here he has been proposing by suggestion like a court physician the putting on of his boxing gloves for the consolation of the widowed meant most kindly and it's a thousand pities women haven't their padded gloves' 'oh but our boxing gloves can do mischief enough you have something to say i see' 'how do you see' 'tusk tush' the silly ring of her voice and the pathless tattle changed she talked to suit her laden look 'you hit it i come from dudley he knows the facts i wish to serve you in every way' victor's head had lifted 'who was it' 'no enemy' 'her mother she did rightly 'certainly she did' said victor and he thought that instantaneously of the thing done 'oh then she spoke to him she has kept it from me for now nearly a week six days i've seen her spying for something she expected like a face behind a door three inches ajar she has not been half alive she refused explanations she was expecting to hear from him of him the decision whatever it's to be' 'i can't aid you there' said lady grace 'he's one of the unreadables he names tuesday next week' 'by all means' 'she' 'fredi poor fredi ah my poor girl yes no she knows nothing here is the truth of it she the legitimate lives they say she lives well then she lives against all rules physical or medical lives by sheer force of will it's a miracle of the power of a human creature to i have it from doctors friends attendants they can't guess what she holds on to keep her breath all the happiness in life if only it could benefit her but it 's the cause of death to us do you see dear friend you are a friend proved friend' he took her hand and held and pressed it in great need of a sanguine response to emphasis and having this warm feminine hand his ideas ran off with it 'the friend i need you have courage my nataly poor dear she can endure in her quiet way a woman of courage would take her place beside me and compel the world to do her homage help a bright ready smile does it she would never be beaten of course we could have lived under a bushel stifled next to death but i am for light air battle if you like i want a comrade not a not that i complain i respect pity love i do love her honour only we want something else courage to face the enemy quite right that she should speak to dudley sowerby he has to know must know all who deal closely with us must know but see a moment i am waiting to see the impediment dispersed which puts her at an inequality with the world and then i speak to all whom it concerns not before for her sake how is it now dudley will ask you understand and when i am forced to confess that the mother the mother of the girl he seeks in marriage is not yet in that state herself probably at that very instant the obstacle has crumbled to dust i say probably i have information doctors friends attendants they all declare it cannot last outside a week but you are here true i could swear a touch of a hand tells me a woman's hand well yes i read by the touch of a woman's hand betrays more than her looks or her lips' he sank his voice 'i don't talk of condoling if you are in grief you know i share it' he kissed her hand and laid it on her lap eyed it and met her eyes took a header into her eyes and lost himself a nip of his conscience moved his tongue to say 'as for guilt if it were known a couple of ascetics absolutely' but this was assumed to be unintelligible and it was merely the apology to his conscience in communion with the sprite of a petticoated fair one who was being subjected to tender little liberties necessarily addressed in enigmas he righted immediately under a perception of the thoroughbred's contempt for the barriers of wattled sheep and caught the word 'guilt' to hide the philistine citizen's lapse by relating historically in abridgement the honest beauty of the passionate loves of the two whom the world proscribed for honestly loving there was no guilt he harped on the word to erase the recollection of his first use of it 'fiddle' said lady grace 'the thing happened you have now to carry it through you require a woman's aid in a social matter rely on me for what i can do you will see dudley on tuesday i will write be plain with him not forgetting the gilding i need not remark your nesta has no aversion' 'admires respects likes is quite is willing' 'good enough beginning' she rose for the atmosphere was heated rather heavy 'and if one proves to be of aid you'll own that a woman has her place in the battle' the fair black clad widow's quick and singular interwreathing of the evanescent pretty pouts and frowns dimpled like the brush of the wind on a sunny pool in a shady place and her forehead was close below his chin her lips not far her apparel was attractively mourning widows in mourning when they do not lean over extremely to the stygian shore with the complexions of the drugs which expedited the defunct to the ferry provoke the manly arm within reach of them to pluck their pathetic blooming persons clean away from it what of the widow who visibly likes the living compassion sympathy impulse and gratitude impulse again living warmth and a spring of the blood to wrestle with the king of terrors for the other poor harper's half night capped eurydice and a thirst sudden as it is overpowering and the solicitude a reflective solicitude to put the seal on a thing and call it a fact to the astonishment of history and a kick of our naughty youth in its coffin all the insurgencies of nature with her colonel of the regiment absent and her veering trick to drive two vessels at the cross of a track into collision combine for doing that which is very much more and which affects us at times so much less than did the pressure of a soft wedded hand by our own elsewhere pledged one on the contrary we triumph we have the rich flavour of the fruit for our pains we commission the historian to write in hieroglyphs a round big fact the lady passed through the trial submitting stiffening her shoulders and at the close shutting her eyes she stood cool in her blush and eyed him like one gravely awakened having been embraced and kissed she had to consider her taste for the man and acknowledge a neatness of impetuosity in the deed and he was neither apologizing culprit nor glorying bandit when it was done but something of the lyric god tempering his fervours to a pleased sereneness not offering a renewal of them he glowed transparently he said 'you are the woman to take a front place in the battle' with this woman beside him it was a conquered world comparisons in the jotting souvenirs of a woman of her class and set favoured him for she disliked enterprising libertines and despised stumbling youths and the genial simple glow of his look assured her that the vanished fiery moment would not be built on by a dating master she owned herself or did she some understanding of how the other woman had been won to the leap with him was drawing in about her she would have liked to beg for the story and she could as little do that as bring her tongue to reproach if we come to the den she said to her thought of reproach our semi civilization makes it a den where a scent in his nostrils will spring the half tamed animal away to wildness and she had come unanticipatingly without design except perhaps to get a superior being to direct and restrain a gambler's hand perhaps for the fee of a temporary pressure 'i may be able to help a little i hope' she fetched a breath to say while her eyelids mildly sermonized and immediately she talked of her inheritance of property in stocks and shares victor commented passingly on the soundness of them and talked of projects he entertained parliament 'but i have only to mention it at home and my poor girl will set in for shrinking' he doated on the diverse aspect of the gallant woman of the world 'you succeed in everything you do' said she and she cordially believed it and that belief set the neighbour memory palpitating success folded her waist was warm upon her lips she worshipped the figure of success 'i can't consent to fail it's true when my mind is on a thing' victor rejoined he looked his mind on lady grace the shiver of a maid went over her these transparent visages where the thought which is half design is perceived as a lightning strike lightning into the physically feebler her hand begged with the open palm her head shook thrice and though she did not step back he bowed to the negation and then she gave him a grateful shadow of a smile relieved with a startled view of how greatly relieved by that sympathetic deference in the wake of the capturing intrepidity 'i am to name tuesday for dudley' she suggested 'at any hour he pleases to appoint' 'a visit signifies' 'whatever it signifies' 'i'm thinking of the bit of annoyance' 'to me anything appointed finds me ready the next minute' her smile was flatteringly bright 'by the way keep your city people close about you entertain as much as possible dine them' she said 'at home' 'better sir rodwell blachington sir abraham quatley and their wives there's no drawing back now and i will meet them' she received a compliment she was on the foot to go but she had forgotten the tiddler mine the tiddler mine was leisurely mounting victor stated the figures he saluted her hand and lady grace passed out with her heart on the top of them and a buzz about it of the unexpected having occurred she had her experiences to match new patterns in events though not very many compared with gambling the game of love was an idle entertainment compared with other players this man was gifted victor went in to mr inchling's room and kept inchling from speaking that he might admire him for he knew not what or knew not well what the good fellow was devoted to his wife victor in old days had called the wife mrs grundy she gossiped she was censorious she knew could not but know the facts yet never by a shade was she disrespectful he had a curious recollection of how his knowledge of inchling and his wife being always in concert entirely whatever they might think in private devoted to him in action had influenced if it had not originally sprung his resolve to cast off the pestilential cloak of obscurity shortening his days and emerge before a world he could illumine to give him back splendid reflections inchling and his wife it was because the two were one and if one and subservient to him knowing all the story why it foreshadowed a conquered world they were the one pulse of the married grundy beating in his hand so it had been he rattled his views upon indian business to hold inchling silent and let his mind dwell almost lovingly on the good faithful spouse who had no phosphorescent writing of a recent throbbing event on the four walls of his room nataly was not so generously encountered in idea he felt and regretted this he greeted her with a doubled affectionateness her pitiable deficiency of courage excusing a man for this and that small matter in the thick of the conflict made demands on him for gentle treatment 'you have not seen any one' she asked 'city people and you my love' 'mr barmby called he has gone down to tunbridge wells for a week to some friend there' she added in pain of thought 'i have seen dartrey he has brought lord clanconan to town for a consultation and expects he will have to take him to brighton' 'brighton what a life for a man like dartrey at brighton' her breast heaved 'if i cannot see my nesta there he will bring her up to me for a day 'but my dear i will bring her up to you if it is your wish to see her' 'it is becoming imperative that i should' 'no hurry no hurry wait till the end of next week and i must see dartrey on business at once' she gave the address in a neighbouring square he had minutes to spare before dinner and flew she was not inquisitive colney durance had told dartrey that victor was killing her she had little animation her smiles were ready but faint after her interview with dudley there had been a swoon at home and her maid sworn to secrecy willingly spared a tender hearted husband so good a master chapter xxviii mrs marsett little acts of kindness were not beyond the range of colney durance and he ran down to brighton to give the exiled nesta some taste of her friendly london circle the duvidney ladies knew that the dreaded gentleman had a regard for the girl their own which was becoming warmer than they liked to think was impressed by his manner of conversing with her 'child though she was' he paid her the compliment of a sober as well as a satirical review of the day's political matter and recent publications and the ladies were introduced in a wonderment to the damsel delphica they listened placidly to a discourse upon her performances japanese to their understandings at new york behold another adventurous representative and advocate of the european tongues has joined the party signor jeridomani a philologer of course a politician in addition macchiavelli redivivus it seems to fair delphica the speech he delivers at the syndicate delmonico dinner is justly applauded by the new york press as a masterpiece of astuteness he appears to be the only one of the party who has an eye for the dark she fancies she may know a more widely awake in the abstract but now thanks to jubilant journals and homeric laughter over the continent the secret is out in so far as the concurrents are all unmasked and exposed for the edification of the american public dr bouthoin's eyebrows are up mr semhians disfigures his name by greatly gaping shall they return to their great britain indignant patriotism with the sauce of a luxurious expedition at no cost to the private purse restrains them moreover there is no sign of any one of the others intending to quit the expedition and mr semhians has done a marvel or two in the cricket field old england looks up where she can what is painfully extraordinary to our couple they find in the frigid attitude of the americans toward their 'common tongue' together with the rumour of a design to despatch an american rival emissary to japan nesta listened inquired commented laughed the ladies could not have a doubt that she was interested and understood she would have sketches of scenes between delphica and m falarique with whom the young germania was cleverly ingenuous indeed a seminary celimene and between delphica and m mytharete with whom she was archaeological ravishingly amoebaean of homer dr gannius holds a trump card in his artless daughter conjecturally for the establishment of the language of the gutturals in the far east he has now a suspicion that the inventive m falarique melted down to sobriety by misfortune may some day startle their camp by the cast of more than a crow into it and he is bent on establishing alliances frightens the supple signor jeridomani to lingual fixity eulogizes football with dr bouthoin and retracts or modifies his dictum upon the english that 'masculine brawn they have in their bodies but muscle they have not in their feminine minds' to exalt them for a signally clean if a dense people 'amousia not alousia is their enemy' how when we have the noblest crop of poets 'you have never heartily embraced those aliens among you until you learnt from us that you might brag of them' have they not endowed us with the richest of languages 'the words of which are used by you as old slippers for puns' mr semhians has been superciliously and ineffectively punning in foreign presences he and his chief are inwardly shocked by a new perception what if now that we have the populace for paymaster subservience to the literary tastes of the populace should reduce the nation to its lowest mental level and render us not only unable to compete with the foreigner but unintelligible to him although so proudly paid at home is it not thus that nations are seen of the highest to be devouring themselves 'for' says dr gannius as if divining them 'this excessive and applauded productiveness both of your juvenile and your senile in your modern literature is it ever a crop is it even the restorative perishable stuff of the markets is it not rather your street pavement's patter of raindrops incessantly in motion and as fruitful' mr semhians appeals to delphica 'genius you have' says she stiffening his neck band 'genius in superabundance' he throttles to the complexion of the peony 'perhaps criticism is wanting' dr gannius adds 'perhaps it is the drill sergeant everywhere wanting for an unrivalled splendid rabble' colney left the whole body of concurrents on the raised flooring of a famous new york hall clearly entrapped and incited to debate before an enormous audience as to the merits of their respective languages 'i hear' says dr bouthoin to mr semhians whose gape is daily extending 'that the tickets cost ten dollars' there was not enough of delphicafor nests colney asked 'have you seen any of our band' 'no' she said with good cheer and became thoughtful conscious of a funny reason for the wish to hear of the fictitious creature disliked by dudley a funny and a naughty reason was it not so very naughty but it was funny for it was a spirit of opposition to dudley without an inferior feeling at all such as girls should have colney brought his viola for a duet they had a pleasant musical evening as in old days at creckholt and nesta going upstairs with the ladies to bed made them share her father's amused view of the lamb of the flock this bitter gentleman became when he had the melodious instrument tucked under his chin he was a guest for the night dressing in the early hour nests saw him from her window on the parade and soon joined him to hear him at his bitterest in the flush of the brine 'these lengths of blank faced terraces fronting sea' were the satirist's present black beast 'so these moneyed english shoulder to the front place and that is the appearance they offer to their commercial god' he gazed along the miles of 'english countenance' drearily laughing changeful ocean seemed to laugh at the spectacle some orphic joke inspired his exclamation 'capital' 'come where the shops are' said nesta 'and how many thousand parsons have you here' 'ten i think' she answered in his vein and warmed him leading him contemplatively to scrutinize her admirers the rev septimus mr sowerby 'news of our friend of the whimpering flute' 'here no i have to understand you' colney cast a weariful look backward on the 'regiments of anglo chinese' represented to him by the moneyed terraces and said 'the face of a stopped watch the only meaning it has is past date' he had no liking for dudley sowerby but it might have been an allusion to the general view of the houses but again 'the meaning of it past date' stuck in her memory a certain face close on handsome had a fatal susceptibility to caricature she spoke of her 'exile' wanted skepsey to come down to her moaned over the loss of her louise the puzzle of the reason for the long separation from her parents was evident in her mind and unmentioned they turned on to the pier nesta reminded him of certain verses he had written to celebrate her visit to the place when she was a child 'and then along the pier we sped and there we saw a whale he seemed to have a normous head and not a bit of tail' 'manifestly a foreigner to our shores where the exactly inverse condition rules' colney said 'and then we scampered on the beach to chase the foaming wave and when we ran beyond its reach we all became more brave' colney remarked 'i was a poet for once' a neat legged parisianly booted lady having the sea winds very enterprising with her dark wavy locks and jacket and skirts gave a cry of pleasure and a silvery 'you dear' at sight of nesta then at sight of one of us moderated her tone to a propriety equalling the most conventional 'we ride to day' 'i shall be one' said nesta 'it would not be the commonest pleasure to me if you were absent' 'till eleven then' 'after my morning letter to ned' she sprinkled silvery sound on that name or on the adieu blushed blinked frowned sweetened her lip lines bit at the underone and passed in a discomposure 'the lady' colney asked 'she is i meet her in the troop conducted by the riding master mrs marsett' 'and who is ned' 'it is her husband to whom she writes every morning he is a captain in the army or was he is in norway fishing' 'then the probability is that the english officer continues his military studies' 'do you not think her handsome mr durance' 'ned may boast of his possession when he has trimmed it and toned it a little 'she is different if you are alone with her' 'it is not unusual' said colney at eleven o'clock he was in london and nesta rode beside mrs marsett amid the troop a south easterly wind blew the waters to shifty goldleaf prints of brilliance under the sun 'i took a liberty this morning i called you dear this morning' the lady said 'it's what i feel only i have no right to blurt out everything i feel and i was ashamed i am sure i must have appeared ridiculous i got quite nervous' 'you would not be ridiculous to me' 'i remember i spoke of ned 'you have spoken of him before' 'oh i know to you alone i should like to pluck out my heart and pitch it on the waves to see whether it would sink or swim that's a funny idea isn't it i tell you everything that comes up what shall i do when i lose you you always make me feel you've a lot of poetry ready made in you' 'we will write and you will have your husband then' 'when i had finished my letter to ned i dropped my head on it and behaved like a fool for several minutes i can't bear the thought of losing you' 'but you don't lose me' said nesta 'there is no ground for your supposing that you will and your wish not to lose me binds me to you more closely' 'if you knew' mrs marsett caught at her slippery tongue and she carolled 'if we all knew everything we should be wiser and what a naked lot of people we should be' they were crossing the passage of a cavalcade of gentlemen at the end of the east cliff one among them large and dominant with a playful voice of brass cried out 'and how do you do mrs judith marsett ha beautiful morning' mrs marsett's figure tightened she rode stonily erect looked level ahead her woman's red mouth was shut fast on a fighting underlip 'he did not salute you' nesta remarked to justify her for not having responded the lady breathed a low thunder 'coward' 'he cannot have intended to insult you' said nesta 'that man knows i will not notice him he is a beast he will learn that i carry a horsewhip' 'are you not taking a little incident too much to heart' the sigh of the heavily laden came from mrs marsett 'am i pale i dare say i shall go on my knees tonight hating myself that i was born one of the frail sex we are or we should ride at the coward and strike him to the ground pray pray do not look distressed now you know my christian name that dog of a man barks it out on the roads it doesn't matter' 'he has offended you before' 'you are near me they can't hurt me can't touch me when i think that i 'm talking with you how i envy those who call you by your christian name' 'nesta' said smiling nesta the smile was forced that she might show kindness for the lady was jarring on her mrs marsett opened her lips 'oh my god i shall be crying let's gallop no wait i'll tell you i wish i could i will tell you of that man that man is major worrell one of the majors who manage to get to their grade a retired warrior he married a handsome woman above him in rank with money a good woman she was a good woman or she would have had her vengeance and there was never a word against her she must have loved that ned calls him full blooded ox he spent her money and he deceived her you innocent oh you dear i'd give the world to have your eyes i've heard tell of crystal clear but eyes like yours have to tell me how deep and clear such a world for them to be in i did pray and used your name last night on my knees that you i said nesta might never have to go through other women's miseries ah me i have to tell you he deceived her you don't quite understand' 'i do understand' said nesta 'god help you i am excited to day that man is poison to me his wife forgave him three times on three occasions that unhappy woman forgave him he is great at his oaths and a big breaker of them she walked out one november afternoon and met him riding along with a notorious creature you know there are bad women they passed her laughing and look there nesta see that groyne that very one' mrs marsett pointed her whip hard out 'the poor lady went down from the height here she walked into that rough water look steadying herself along it and she plunged she never came out alive a week after her burial major worrell i 've told you enough' 'we 'll gallop now' said nesta mrs marsett's talk her presence hardly less affected the girl with those intimations of tumult shown upon smooth waters when the great elements are conspiring she felt that there was a cause why she had to pity did pity her it might be that captain marsett wedded one who was of inferior station' and his wife had to bear blows from cruel people the supposition seemed probable the girl accepted it for beyond it as the gathering of the gale masked by hills lay a brewing silence what she did not reflect her quick physical sensibility curled to some breath of heated atmosphere brought about her by this new acquaintance not pleasant if she had thought of pleasure intensely suggestive of our life at the consuming tragic core round which the furnace pants but she was unreflecting feeling only a beyond and hidden besides she was an exile spelling at dark things in the dark getting to have the sight which peruses darkness she touched the door of a mystery that denied her its key but showed the lock and her life was beginning to know of hours that fretted her to recklessness her friend louise was absent she had so few friends owing to that unsolved reason she wanted one of any kind if only gentle and this lady seemed to need her and she flattered nesta was in the mood for swallowing and digesting and making sweet blood of flattery at one time she liked mrs marsett best absent in musing on her wishing her well having said the adieu for it was wearisome to hear praises of 'innocence' and women can do so little to cure that 'wickedness of men' among the lady's conversational themes and 'love' too it may be a 'plague' and it may be 'heaven' it is better left unspoken of but there were times when mrs marsett's looks and tones touched compassion to press her hand an act that had a pledgeing signification in the girl's bosom and when by the simple avoidance of ejaculatory fervours mrs marsett's quieted good looks had a shadow of a tender charm more pathetic than her outcries were these had not always the sanction of polite usage and her english was guilty of sudden lapses to the thameswater english of commerce and drainage instead of the upper wells but there are many uneducated ladies in the land many too whose tastes in romantic literature betray now and then by peeps a similarity to nesta's maid mary's mrs marsett liked love blood and adventure she had moreover a favourite noble poet and she begged nesta's pardon for naming him and she would not name him and told her she must not read him until she was a married woman because he did mischief to girls thereupon she fell into one of her silences emerging with a cry of hate of herself for having ever read him she did not blame the bard and ah poor bard he fought his battle he shall not be named for the brand on the name he has lit a sulphur match for the lover of nature through many a generation and to be forgiven by sad frail souls who could accuse him of pipeing devil's agent to them at the perilous instant poor girls too is chastisement enough this it is to be the author of unholy sweets a posterity sitting in judgement will grant that they were part of his honest battle with the hypocrite english philistine without being dupe of the plea or at all the thirsty swallower of his sugary brandy mrs marsett expressed aloud her gladness of escape in never having met a man like him followed by her regret that 'ned' was so utterly unlike except 'perhaps' and she hummed she was off on the fraternity in wickedness nesta's ears were fatigued 'my mother writes of you' she said to vary the subject mrs marsett looked she sighed downright 'i have had my dream of a friend it was that gentleman with you on the pier your mother objects' 'she has inquired nothing more' 'i am not twenty three not as old as i should be for a guide to you i know i would never do you harm that i know i would walk into that water first and take mrs worrell's plunge the last bath a thorough cleanser for a woman only she was a good woman and didn't want it as we as lots of us do to wash off all recollection of having met a man your mother would not like me to call you nesta i have never begged you to call me judith damnable name' mrs marsett revelled in the heat of the curse on it as a relief to torture of the breast until a sense of the girl's alarmed hearing sent the word reverberating along her nerves and shocked her with such an exposure of our shaggy wild one on a lady's lips she murmured 'forgive me' and had the passion to repeat the epithet in shrieks and scratch up male speech for a hatefuller but the twitch of nesta's brows made her say 'do pardon me i did something in scripture judith could again since that brute worrell crossed me riding with you i loathe my name i want to do things i have offended you' 'we have been taught differently i do not use those words nothing else' 'they frighten you' 'they make me shut that is all' 'supposing you were some day to discover ta tata all the things there are in the world' mrs marsett let fly an artificial chirrup 'you must have some ideas of me' 'i think you have had unhappy experiences' 'nesta just now and then the first time we rode out together coming back from the downs i remember i spoke without thinking i was enraged of a case in the newspapers and you had seen it and you were not afraid to talk of it i remember i thought well for a girl she's bold i thought you knew more than a girl ought to know until you did you set my heart going you spoke of the poor women like an angel of compassion you said we were all mixed up with their fate i forget the words but no one ever heard in church anything that touched me so i worshipped you you said you thought of them often and longed to find out what you could do to help and i thought if they could hear you and only come near you as i was ah my heaven unhappy experiences yes but when men get women on the slope to their perdition they have no mercy none they deceive and they lie they are false in acts and words they do as much as murder they're never hanged for it they make the laws and then they become fathers of families and point the finger at the wretched creatures they have a dozen names against women for one at themselves' 'it maddens me at times to think' said nesta burning with the sting of vile names oh there are bad women as well as bad men but men have the power and the lead and they take advantage of it and then they turn round and execrate us for not having what they have robbed us of' 'i blame women if i may dare at my age' said nesta and her bosom heaved 'women should feel for their sex they should not allow the names they should go among their unhappier sisters at the worst they are sisters i am sure that fallen cannot mean christ shows it does not he changes the tone of scripture the women who are made outcasts must be hopeless and go to utter ruin we should if we pretend to be better step between them and that there cannot be any goodness unless it is a practiced goodness otherwise it is nothing more than paint on canvas you speak to me of my innocence what is it worth if it is only a picture and does no work to help to rescue i fear i think most of the dreadful names that redden and sicken us the old testament i have a french friend a mademoiselle louise de seines you should hear her she is intensely french and a roman catholic everything which we are not but so human so wise and so full of the pride of her sex i love her it is love she will never marry until she meets a man who has the respect for women for all women we both think we cannot separate ourselves from our sisters she seems to me to wither men when she speaks of their injustice their snares to mislead and their cruelty when they have succeeded she is right it is the brute there is no other word' 'and french and good' mrs marsett ejaculated 'my ned reads french novels and he says their women but your mademoiselle is a real one if she says all that i could kneel to her french or not does she talk much about men and women' 'not often we lose our tempers she wants women to have professions at present they have not much choice to avoid being penniless poverty and the sight of luxury it seems as if we produced the situation to create an envious thirst and cause the misery things are improving for them but we groan at the slowness of it' mrs marsett now declared a belief that women were nearly quite as bad as men 'i don't think i could take up with a profession unless to be a singer ah do you sing' nesta smiled 'yes i sing' 'how i should like to hear you my ned's a thorough englishman gentleman you know he cares only for sport shooting fishing hunting and football cricket rowing and matches he's immensely proud of england in those things and such muscle he has though he begins to fancy his heart's rather weak it's digestion i tell him but he takes me to the opera sometimes italian opera he can't stand german down at his place in leicestershire he tells me when there 's company he has i'm sure you sing beautifully when i hear beautiful singing even from a woman they tell tales of upon my word it's true i feel my sins all melting out of me and i'm new made i can't bear ned to speak would you one day one afternoon before the end of next week it would do me such real good you can't guess how much if i could persuade you i know i'm asking something out of rules for just half an hour i judge by your voice in talking oh it would do me good good good to hear you sing there is a tuned piano a cottage i don't think it sounds badly you would not see any great harm in calling on me once' 'no' said nesta and it was her nature that projected the word her awakened wits were travelling to her from a distance and she had an intimation of their tidings and she could not have said what they were or why for a moment she hesitated to promise she would come her vision of the reality of things was without written titles to put the stamp of the world on it she felt this lady to be one encompassed and in the hug of the elementary forces which are the terrors to inexperienced pure young women but she looked at her and dared trust those lips those eyes she saw through whatever might be the vessel the spirit of the woman as the upper nobility of our brood are enabled to do in a crisis mixed of moral aversion and sisterly sympathy when nature cries to them and the scales of convention the mud spots of accident even naughtiness even wickedness all misfortune's issue if we but see the one look upward fall away reason is not excluded from these blind throbs of a blood that strikes to right the doings of the fates nesta did not err in her divination of the good and the bad incarnate beside her though both good and bad were behind a curtain the latter sparing her delicate senses appealing to chivalry to the simply feminine claim on her reason acting in her heart as a tongue of the flames of the forge where we all are wrought told her surely that the good predominated she had the heart which is at our primal fires when nature speaks she gave the promise to call on mrs marsett and sing to her 'an afternoon oh what afternoon' she was asked and she said 'this afternoon if you like' so it was agreed mrs marsett acted violently the thrill of delight she felt in the prospect the ladies dorothea and virginia consulted and pronounced the name of marsett to be a reputable county name 'there was a leicestershire baronet of the name of marsett' they arranged to send their button blazing boy at nesta's heels mrs marsett resided in a side street not very distant from the featureless but washed and orderly terrace of the glassy stare at sea chapter xxix shows one of the shadows of the world crossing a virgin's mind nasta and her maid were brought back safely through the dusk by their constellation of a boy to whom the provident ladies had entrusted her they could not but note how short her syllables were her face was only partly seen they had returned refreshed from their drive on the populous and orderly parade so fair a pattern of their england after discoursing of 'the dear child' approving her manners instancing proofs of her intelligence nay her possession of 'character' they did so notwithstanding that these admissions were worse than their growing love for the girl to confound established ideas and now in thoughtfulness on her behalf dorothea said 'we have considered nesta that you may be lonely and if it is your wish we will leave our card on your new acquaintance' nesta took her hand and kissed it she declined saying 'no' without voice they had two surprises at the dinner hour one was the card of dartrey fenellan naming an early time next day for his visit and the other was the appearance of the rev stuart rem a welcome guest he had come to meet his bishop he had come also with serious information for the ladies regarding the rev abram posterley no sooner was this out of his mouth than both ladies exclaimed 'again' so serious was it that there had been a consultation at the wells mr posterley's friend the rev septimus barmby and his own friend the rev groseman buttermore had journeyed from london to sit upon the case and 'one hoped' mr stuart rem said 'poor posterley would be restored to the senses he periodically abandoned' he laid a hand on tasso's curls and withdrew it at a menace of teeth tasso would submit to rough caresses from mr posterley he would not allow mr stuart rem to touch him why was that perhaps for the reason of mr posterley's being so emotional as perpetually to fall a victim to some bright glance and require the rescue of his friends the slave of woman had a magnet for animals dorothea and virginia were drawn to compassionate sentiments in spite of the provokeing recurrence of mr posterley's malady he had not an income to support a wife always was this unfortunate gentleman entangling himself in a passion for maid or widow of the wells and it was desperate a fever mr stuart rem charitably remarked on his taking it so severely because of his very scrupulous good conduct they pardoned a little wound to their delicacy and asked 'on this occasion' mr stuart rem named a linendraper's establishment near the pantiles where a fair young woman served 'and her reputation' that was an article less presentable through plate glass it seemed mr stuart rem drew a prolonged breath into his nose 'it is most melancholy' they said in unison 'nothing positive' said he 'but the suspicion of a shadow mr stuart rem you will not permit it' he stated that his friend buttermore might have influence dorothea said 'when i think of mr posterley's addiction to ceremonial observances and to matrimony i cannot but think of a sentence that fell from mr durance one day with reference to that division of our church he called it you frown and i would only quote mr durance to you in support of your purer form as we hold it to be with the candles the vestments confession alas he called it rome and a wife' mr stuart rem nodded an enforced assent he testily dismissed mention of mr durance and resumed on mr posterley the good ladies now with some of their curiosity appeased considerately signified to him that a young maiden was present the young maiden had in heart stuff to render such small gossip a hum of summer midges she did not imagine the dialogue concerned her in any way she noticed mr stuart rem's attentive scrutiny of her from time to time she had no sensitiveness hardly a mind for things about her to morrow she was to see captain dartrey she dwelt on that prospect for an escape from the meshes of a painful hour the most woeful of the hours she had yet known passed with judith marsett which dragged her soul through a weltering of the deeps tossed her over and over still did it with her ideas it shocked her nevertheless to perceive how much of the world's flayed life and harsh anatomy she had apprehended and so coldly previous to mrs marsett's lift of the veil in her story of herself a skipping revelation terrible enough to the girl whose comparison of the previously suspected things with the things now revealed imposed the thought of her having been both a precocious and a callous young woman a kind of 'delphica without the erudition' her mind phrased it airily over her chagrin and the silence of dudley proved him to have discovered his error in choosing such a person he was wise and she thanked him she had an envy of the ignorant innocents adored by the young man she cordially thanked for quitting her she admired the white coat of armour they wore whether bestowed on them by their constitution or by prudence for while combating mankind now on judith marsett's behalf personally she ran like a hare from the mere breath of an association with the very minor sort of similar charges ardently she desired the esteem of mankind she was at moments abject but had she actually been aware of the facts now known those wits of the virgin young quickened to shrewdness by their budding senses and however vividly require enlightenment of the audible and visible before their sterner feelings can be heated to break them away from a blushful dread and force the mind to know as much as the wilfully or naturally blunted the intelligently honest have to learn by touch only their understandings cannot meanwhile be so wholly obtuse as our society's matron acting to please the tastes of the civilized man a creature that is not clean washed of the turk in him barbarously exacts the signor aforesaid is puzzled to read the woman who is after all in his language but when it comes to reading the maiden she appears as a phosphorescent hieroglyph to some speculative egyptologer and he insists upon distinct lines and characters no variations if he is to have sense of surety many a young girl is misread by the amount she seems to know of our construction history and dealings when it is not more than her sincere ripeness of nature that has gathered the facts of life profuse about her and prompts her through one or other of the instincts often vanity to show them to be not entirely strange to her or haply her filly nature is having a fling at the social harness of hypocrisy if you it is usually through the length of ears of your novelist that the privilege is yours have overheard queer communications passing between girls and you must act the traitor eavesdropper or achilles masquerader to overhear so clearly these be assured are not specially the signs of their corruptness even the exceptionally cynical are chiefly to be accused of bad manners your moralist is a myopic preacher when he stamps infamy on them or on our later generation for the kick they have at grandmother decorum because you do not or cannot conceal from them the grinning skeleton behind it nesta once had dreams of her being loved and she was to love in return for a love that excused her for loving double treble as not her lover could love she thought with grateful pride in the treasure she was to pour out at his feet as only one or two and they were women in the world had ever loved her notion of the passion was parasitic man the tree woman the bine but the bine was flame to enwind and to soar serpent to defend immortal flowers to crown the choice her parents had made for her in dudley behind the mystery she had scent of nipped her dream and prepared her to meet as it were the fireside of a november day instead of springing up and into the dawn's blue of full summer with swallows on wing her station in exile at the wells of the weariful rich under the weight of the sullen secret unenlivened by dudley's courtship subdued her to the world's decrees phrased thus 'i am not to be a heroine' the one golden edge to the view was that she would greatly please her father her dream of a love was put away like a botanist's pressed weed but after hearing judith marsett's wild sobs it had no place in her cherishing for above all the unhappy woman protested love to have been the cause of her misery she moaned of 'her ned' of his goodness his deceitfulness her trustfulness his pride and the vileness of his friends her longsuffering and her break down of patience it was done for the proof of her unworthiness of nesta's friendship that she might be renounced and embraced she told the pathetic half of her story to suit the gentle ear whose critical keenness was lost in compassion how deep the compassion mixed with the girl's native respect for the evil fortuned may be judged by her inaccessibility to a vulgar tang that she was aware of in the deluge of the torrent where innocence and ned and love and a proud family and that beast worrell rolled together in leaping and shifting involutions a darkness of thunder was on the girl although she was not one to shrink beneath it like the small bird of the woods she had to say within herself many times 'i shall see captain dartrey to morrow' for a recovery and a nerving and with her thought of him her tooth was at her underlip she struggled abashed in hesitation over men's views of her sex and how to bring a frank mind to meet him to be sure of his not at heart despising until his character swam defined and bright across her scope 'he is good to women' fragments of conversation principally her father's had pictured captain dartrey to her most manfully tolerant toward a frivolous wife he came early in the morning instantly after breakfast not two minutes had passed before she was at home with him his words his looks revived her spirit of romance gave her the very landscapes and new ones yes he was her hero but his manner made him also an adored big brother stamped splendid by the perils of life he sat square as if alert to rise with an elbow on a knee and the readiest turn of head to speakers the promptest of answers eyes that were a brighter accent to the mouth so vividly did look accompany tone he rallied her chatted and laughed pleased the ladies by laughing at colney durance and inspired her with happiness when he spoke of england that 'one has to be in exile awhile to see the place she takes' 'oh captain dartrey i do like to hear you say so' she cried his voice was reassuring also in other directions it rang of true man he volunteered however a sad admission that england had certainly lost something of the great nation's proper conception of force the meaning of it virtue of it and need for it 'she bleats for a lesson and will get her lesson' but if we have captain dartrey we shall come through so said the sparkle of nesta's eyes 'she is very like her father' he said to the ladies 'we think so' they remarked 'there's the mother too' said he and nesta saw that the ladies shadowed they retired then she begged him to 'tell her of her own dear mother' the news gave comfort except for the suspicion that the dear mother was being worn by her entertaining so largely 'papa is to blame' said nesta 'a momentary strain your father has an idea of parliament one of the london boroughs' 'and i captain dartrey when do i go back to them' 'your mother comes down to consult with you and now do we ride together' 'you are free' 'my uncle lord clan lets me out' 'to day' 'why yes' 'this morning' 'in an hour's time' 'i will be ready' nesta sent a line of excuse to mrs marsett throwing in a fervent adjective for balm that fair person rode out with the troop under conduct of the hallowing squire of the stables and passed by nesta on horseback beside dartrey fenellan at the steps of a huge hotel issuing from which pretty mrs blathenoy was about to mount mrs marsett looked ahead and coloured but she could not restrain one look at nesta that embraced her cavalier nesta waved hand to her and nodded mrs marsett withdrew her eyes her doing so silent though it was resembled the drag back to sea of the shingle wave below her such a screaming of tattle she heard in the questions discernible through the attitude of the cavalier and of the lady who paused to stare before the leap up in the saddle 'who is she what is she how did you know her where does she come from wears her hat on her brows huge gauntlets out of style shady shady shady' and as always during her nervous tumults the name of worrell made diapason of that execrable uproar her hat on her brows had an air of dash defying a world it could win as ned well knew but she scanned her gauntlets disapprovingly this town we are glad to think has a bright repute for glove shops and mrs marsett could applaud herself for sparing ned's money she had mended her gloves if they were in the fashion but how does the money come hark at that lady and that gentleman questioning miss radnor of everything everything in the world about her not a word do they get from miss radnor and it makes them the more inquisitive idle rich people comfortably fenced round are so inquisitive and mrs marsett loving nesta for the notice of her maddened by the sting of tongues it was causing heard the wash of the beach without consciousness of analogies but with a body ready to jump out of skin out of life in desperation at the sound she was all impulse a shifty piece of unmercenary stratagem occasionally directing it arrived at her lodgings she wrote to nesta 'i entreat you not to notice me if you pass me on the road again let me drop never mind how low i go i was born to be wretched a line from you just a line now and then only to show me i am not forgotten i have had a beautiful dream i am not bad in reality i love goodness i know i cling to the thought of you as my rescue i declare please let me hear if it's not more than good day and your initials on a post card' the letter brought nesta in person to her chapter xxx the burden upon nesta could there be confidences on the subject of mrs marsett with captain dartrey nesta timidly questioned her heart she knocked at an iron door shut upon a thing alive the very asking froze her almost to stopping her throbs of pity for the woman with captain dartrey if with any one but with no one not with her mother even toward her mother she felt guilty of knowing her mother had a horror of that curtain nesta had seen it and had taken her impressions she too shrank from it the more when impelled to draw near it louise de seilles would have been another self louise was away when to return the dear friend could not state speaking in her ear would have been possible the theme precluded writing it was ponderous combustible new knowledge of life for a girl to hold unaided in the presence of the simple silvery ladies dorothea and virginia she had qualms as if she were breaking out in spots before them the ladies fancied that mr stuart rem had hinted to them oddly of the girl and that he might have meant she appeared a little too cognizant of poor mr abram posterley's malady as girls in these terrible days only too frequently too brazenly are they discoursed to her of the degeneracy of the manners nay the morals of young englishwomen once patterns they sketched the young english gentlewoman of their time indeed a beauty with round red cheeks and rounded open eyes and a demure shut mouth a puppet's divine ignorance inoffensive in the highest degree rightly worshipped they were earnest and nesta struck at herself she wished to be as they had been reserving her painful independence they were good they were the ideal women of our country which demands if it be but the semblance of the sureness of stationary excellence such as we have in sevres and dresden polished bright and smooth as ever by the morning's flick of a duster perhaps in danger of accidents accidents must be kept away but enviable admirable we think when we are not thinking of seed sown or help given to the generations to follow nesta both envied and admired she revered them yet her sharp intelligence larger in the extended boundary of thought coming of strange crimson lighted new knowledge discerned in a dimness what blest conditions had fixed them on their beautiful barren eminence without challengeing it she had a rebellious rush of sympathy for our evil fortuned of the world the creatures in the battle the wounded trodden mud stained and it alarmed her lest she should be at heart one out of the fold she had the sympathy nevertheless and renewing and increasing with the pulsations of a compassion that she took for her reflective survey the next time she saw dartrey fenellan she was assured of him as being the man who might be spoken to and by a woman though not by a girl not spoken to by her the throb of the impulse precipitating speech subsided to a dumb yearning he noticed her look he was unaware of the human sun in the girl's eyes taking an image of him for permanent habitation in her breast that face of his so clearly lined quick firm with the blue smile on it like the gleam of a sword coming out of sheath did not mean hardness she could have vowed o that some woman other than the unhappy woman herself would speak the words denied to a girl he was the man who would hearken and help essential immediate help was to be given besides the noble benevolence of mind novel ideas of manliness and the world's need for it were printed on her understanding for what could women do in aid of a good cause she fawned she deemed herself very despicably her hero's inferior the thought of him enclosed her in a prison the gaoler is a demi god hued bright or black as it may be and by the present arrangement between the sexes she whom the world allowed not to have an intimation from eye or ear or from nature's blood ripeness in commune with them of certain matters which it suffers to be notorious necessarily directed her appeal almost in worship to the man who was the one man endowed to relieve and who locked her mouth for shame thus was she too being put into her woman's harness of the bit and the blinkers and taught to know herself for the weak thing the gentle parasite which the fiction of our civilization expects her caressingly and contemptuously to become in the active while it is exacted of hero comedy of clowns that in the passive she be a rockfortress impregnable not to speak of magically encircled she must also have her feelings she must not be an unnatural creature and she must have a sufficient intelligence for her stupidity does not flatter the possessing man it is not an organic growth that he desires in his mate but a happy composition you see the world which comes of the pair this burning nesta victor's daughter tempered by nataly's milder blood was a girl in whom the hard shocks of the knowledge of life perforce of the hardness upon pure metal left a strengthening for generous imagination she did not sit to brood on her injured senses or set them through speculation touching heat they were taken up and consumed by the fire of her mind nor had she leisure for the abhorrences in a heart all flowing to give aid and uplift and restore self was as urgent in her as in most of the young but the gift of humour which had previously diverted it was now the quick feeling for her sisterhood through the one piteous example she knew and broadening it through her insurgent abasement on their behalf which was her scourged pride of sex she but faintly thought of blaming the men whom her soul besought for justice for common kindness to women there was the danger that her aroused young ignorance would charge the whole of the misery about and abroad upon the stronger of those two and another danger that the vision of the facts below the surface would discolour and disorder her views of existence but she loved she sprang to the lighted world and she had figures of male friends to which to cling and they helped in animating glorious historical figures on the world's library shelves or under yet palpitating earth promise of a steady balance of her nature too was shown in the absence of any irritable urgency to be doing when her bosom bled to help beyond the resolve that she would not abandon the woman who had made confession to her she formed no conscious resolutions far ahead down her journey of the years to come she did see muffled things she might hope and would strive to do they were chrysalis shapes above all she flew her blind quickened heart on the wings of an imaginative force and those of the young who can do that are in their blood incorruptible by dark knowledge irradiated under darkness in the mind let but the throb be kept for others that is the one secret for redemption if not for preservation victor descended on his marine london to embrace his girl full of regrets at fredi's absence from the great whirl 'overhead' as places of multitudinous assembly where he shone always appeared to him but it was not to last long she would soon be on the surface again at the first clasp of her he chirped some bars of her song he challenged her to duet before the good ladies and she kindled she was caught up by his gaiety wondering at herself faintly aware of her not being spontaneous and she made her father laugh just in the old way and looked at herself in his laughter with the thought that she could not have become so changed by which the girl was helped to jump to her humour victor turned his full front to dorothea and virginia one sunny beam of delight and although it was mr stuart rem who was naughty nesta's victim and although it seemed a trespass on her part to speak in such a manner of a clerical gentleman they were seized they were the opposite partners of a laughing quadrille lasting till they were tired out victor had asked his girl if she sang on a sunday the ladies remembered that she had put the question for permission to mr stuart rem who was opposed to secular singing 'and what did he say' said victor nesta shook her head 'it was not what he said papa it was his look his duty compelled him though he loves music he had the look of a patriarch putting his handmaiden away into the desert' dorothea and virginia in spite of protests within laughed to streams they recollected the look she had given the portrait of mr stuart rem in the act of repudiating secular song 'victor conjured up a day when this darling fredi a child stood before a famous picture in the brera at milan when he and her mother noticed the child's very studious graveness and they had talked of it he remarking that she disapproved of the patriarch and nataly that she was taken with hagar's face he seemed surprised at her not having heard from dudley 'how is that' said he 'most probably because he has not written papa' he paused after the cool reply she had no mournful gaze at all but in the depths of the clear eyes he knew so well there was a coil of something animate whatever it might be and twice she drew a heavy breath he mentioned it in london nataly telegraphed at night for her girl to meet her next day at dartrey's hotel their meeting was incomprehensibly joyless to the hearts of each though it was desired and had long been desired and mother was mother daughter daughter without diminution of love between them they held hands they kissed and clasped they showered their tender phrases with full warm truth and looked into eyes and surely saw one another but the heart of each was in a battle of its own taking wounds or crying for supports whether to speak to her girl at once despite the now vehement contrary counsel of victor was nataly's deliberation under the thought of the young creature's perplexity in not seeing her at the house of the duvidney ladies while nesta conjured in a flash the past impressions of her mother's shrinking distaste from any such hectic themes as this which burdened and absorbed her and she was almost joining to it through sympathy with any thought or feeling of one in whom she had such pride she had the shudder of revulsion further nataly put on rather cravenly an air of distress or she half designingly permitted her trouble to be seen by way of affecting her girl's recollection when the confession was to come that nesta might then understand her to have been restrained from speaking not evasive of her duty the look was interpreted by nesta as belonging to the social annoyances dating in her calendar from creckholt apprehensively dreaded at lakelands she hinted asking and her mother nodded not untruthfully but she put on a briskness after the nod and a doubt was driven into nesta's bosom her dear skepsey was coming down to her for a holiday she was glad to hear of dudley there was no word nataly shunned his name with a superstitious dread lest any mention of him should renew pretensions that she hoped and now supposed were quite withdrawn so she had told poor mr barmby only yesterday at his humble request to know he had seen dudley on the pantiles walking with a young lady he said and 'he feared' he said using a pardonable commonplace of deceit her compassion accounted for the 'fear' which was the wish and caused her not to think it particularly strange that he should imagine dudley to have quitted the field now that a disengaged dartrey fenellan was at hand poor mr barmby could have no chance dartrey came to her room by appointment she wanted to see him alone and he informed her that mrs blathenoy was in the hotel and would certainly receive and amuse nesta for any length of time 'i will take her up' said nataly and rose and she sat immediately and fluttered a hand at her breast she laughed 'perhaps i'm tired' dartrey took nesta he returned saying 'there's a lift in the hotel do the stairs affect you at all' she fenced his sharp look 'laziness i fancy age is coming on how is it mrs blathenoy is here' 'well how' 'foolish curiosity' 'i think i have made her of service i did not bring the lady here' 'of service to whom' 'why to victor' 'has victor commissioned you' 'you can bear to hear it her husband knows the story he has a grudge commercial reasons i fancy it is that victor stood against his paper at the table of the bank blathenoy vowed blow for blow but i think the little woman holds him in she says she does' 'victor prompted you' 'it occurred as it occurred' 'she does it for love of us oh i can't trifle dartrey' 'tell me' 'first you haven't let me know what you think of my nesta' 'she's a dear good girl' 'not so interesting to you as a flighty little woman' 'she has a speck of some sort on her mind' nataly spied at dudley's behaviour and said 'that will wear away is mr blathenoy much here' 'as often as he can come i believe' 'that is' 'i have seen him twice' 'his wife remains' 'fixed here for the season' 'my friend' 'no harm no harm' 'but to her' 'you have my word of honour' 'yes and she is doing you a service at your request you occasionally reward her with thanks and she sees you are a man of honour do you not know women' dartrey blew his pooh pooh on feminine suspicions 'there's very little left of the don amoroso in me women don't worship stone figures' 'they do like the sea birds and what do you say to me dartrey i can confess it i am one of them i love you when last you left england i kissed your hand it was because of your manly heart in that stone figure i kept from crying you used to scorn us english for the whimpering fits you said we enjoy and must have in books if we can't get them up for ourselves i could have prayed to have you as brother or son i love my victor the better for his love of you oh poor soul how he is perverted since that building of lakelands he cannot take soundings of the things he does formerly he confided in me in all things now not one i am the chief person to deceive if only he had waited we are in a network of intrigues and schemes every artifice in london tempting one to hate simple worthy people who naturally have their views and see me an impostor and tolerate me fascinated by him or bribed it has to be said there are ways of bribeing i trust he may not have in the end to pay too heavily for succeeding he seems a man pushed by destiny not irresponsible but less responsible than most he is desperately tempted by his never failing whatever he does it is true and it sets me thinking of those who have never had an ailment up to a certain age when the killing blow comes latterly i have seen into him i never did before had i been stronger i might have saved or averted but you will say the stronger woman would not have occupied my place i must have been blind too i did not see that his nature shrinks from the thing it calls up he dreads the exposure he courts or has to combat with all his powers it has been a revelation to me of him life as well nothing stops him now it is parliament a vacant london borough he counts on a death ah terrible i have it like a snake's bite night and day' nataly concluded 'there it has done me some good to speak i feel so base' she breathed heavily dartrey took her hand and bent his lips to it 'happy the woman who has not more to speak how long will nesta stay here' 'you will watch over her dartrey she stays her father wishes up to ah we can hardly be in such extreme peril he has her doctor her lawyer and her butler a favourite servant to check and influence her she you know who it is does not i am now convinced mean persecution she was never a mean minded woman oh i could wish she were they say she is going then i am to be made an honest woman of victor wants nesta now that she is away to stay until you understand he feels she is safe from any possible kind of harm with those good ladies and i feel she is the safer for having you near otherwise how i should pray to have you with us daily i have to pass through well something like the ordeal of the red hot ploughshares and without the innocence dear friend but it's best that my girl should not have to be doing the same though she would have the innocence but she writhes under any shadow of a blot and for her to learn the things that are in the world through her mother's history and led to know it by the falling away of friends or say acquaintances however ignorant at present she learns from a mere nothing i dread in a moment she is a blaze of light there have been occurrences only victor could have overcome them i had to think it better for my girl that she was absent we are in such a whirl up there so i work round again to how long and the picture of myself counting the breaths of a dying woman the other day i was told i was envied' 'battle battle battle for all of us in every position' said dartrey sharply to clip a softness 'except when one's attending on an invalid uncle then it's peace rather like extinction and i can't be crying for the end either i bite my moustache and tap foot on the floor out of his hearing make believe i'm patient now i 'll fetch nesta' mrs blathenoy came down with an arm on nesta's shoulder she held a telegram and said to nataly 'what can this mean it's from my husband he puts jacob my husband's christian name so like my husband where there's no concealment there he says down to night else pack ready start to morrow can it signify affairs are bad with my husband in the city' it had that signification to nataly's understanding at the same time the pretty little woman's absurd lisping repetition of 'my husband' did not seem without design to inflict the wound it caused in reality it was not malicious it came of the bewitchment of a silly tongue by her knowledge of the secret to be controlled and after contrasting her fortunes with nataly's on her way downstairs she had comforted herself by saying that at least she had a husband she was not aware that she dealt a hurt until she had found a small consolation in the indulgence for captain dartrey fenellan admired this commanding figure of a woman who could not legally say that which the woman he admired less if at all legally could say 'i must leave you to interpret' nataly remarked mrs blathenoy resented her unbefitting queenly style for this reason she abstained from an intended leading up to mention of the 'singular looking lady' seen riding with miss radnor more than once and as to whom miss radnor for one gives her the name had not just now when questioned spoken very clearly so the mother's alarms were not raised and really it was a pity mrs blathenoy said to dartrey subsequently finding him colder than before mrs radnor's visit it was a pity because a young woman in miss radnor's position should not by any possibility be seen in association with a person of commonly doubtful appearance she was denied the petulant satisfaction of rousing the championship bitter to her dartrey would not deliver an opinion on miss radnor's conduct he declined moreover to assist in elucidating the telegram by 'looking here' and poring over the lines beside a bloomy cheek he was petulantly whipped on the arm with her glove and pouted at and it was then and then only or chiefly through nataly's recent allusion that the man of honour had his quakings in view of the quagmire where he was planted on an exceedingly narrow causeway not of the firmest for she was a pretty little woman one of the prize gifts of the present education of women to the men who are for having them quiescent domestic patterns and her artificial ingenuousness or candid frivolities came to her by nature to kindle the nature of the gentleman on the other bank of the stream and witch him to the plunge so greatly mutually regretted after taken an old duet to the moon dartrey escaped to the club where he had a friend the friend was colonel sudley one of the modern studious officers not in good esteem with the authorities he had not forgiven dartrey for the intemperateness which cut off a brilliant soldier from the service he was reduced to acknowledge however that there was a sparkling defence for him to reply with in the shape of a fortune gained and where we have a society forcing us to live up to an expensive level very trying to a soldier's income a fortune gained will offer excuses for misconduct short of disloyal or illegal they talked of the state of the army we are moving true and at the last review the 'march past' was performed before a mounted generalissimo profoundly asleep head on breast our english military 'moving' may now be likened to somnolency on horseback 'oh come no rancour' said the colonel 'you know he's a kind old boy at heart nowhere a more affectionate man alive' 'so the sycophants are sure of posts' 'come i say he's devoted to the service' 'invalid him and he shall have a good epitaph' 'he's not so responsible as the taxpayer' 'there you touch home mother goose can't imagine the need for defence until a hand's at her feathers' 'what about her shrieks now and then' 'indigestion of a surfeit' they were in a laughing wrangle when two acquaintances of the colonel's came near one of them recognized dartrey he changed a prickly subject to one that is generally as acceptable to the servants of mars his companion said 'who is the girl out with judith marsett' he flavoured eulogies of the girl's good looks in easy garrison english she was praised for sitting her horse well one had met her on the parade in the afternoon walking with mrs marsett colonel sudley had seen them on horseback he remarked to dartrey 'and by the way you're a clean stretch ahead of us i've seen you go by these windows with the young lady on one side and a rather pretty woman on the other too' 'nothing is unseen in this town' dartrey rejoined strolling to his quarters along the breezy parade at night he proposed to himself that he would breathe an immediate caution to nesta how had she come to know this mrs marsett but he was more seriously thinking of what colney durance called 'the mustard plaster' the satirist's phrase for warm relations with a married fair one and dartrey clear of any design to have it at his breast was beginning to take intimations of pricks and burns they are an almost positive cure of inflammatory internal conditions they were really hard on him who had none to be cured the hour was nigh midnight as he entered his hotel the porter ran off to the desk in his box and brought him a note saying that a lady had left it at half past nine left it then the lady could not be the alarming lady he was relieved the words of the letter were cabalistic these beneath underlined address 'i beg you to call on me if i do not see you this evening it is urgent you will excuse me when i explain not late to morrow i am sure you will not fail to come i could write what would be certain to bring you i dare not trust any names to paper' the signature was judith marsett chapter xxxi shows how the squires in a conqueror's service have at times to do knightly conquest of themselves by the very earliest of the trains shot away to light and briny air from london's november gloom which knows the morning through increase of gasjets little skepsey was hurried over suburban chimneys in his friendly third class carriage where we have reminders of ancient pastoral times peculiar to our country as it may chance but where a man may speak to his neighbour right off without being deemed offensive that is homely a social fellow knitting closely to his fellows when he meets them enjoys it even at the cost of uncushioned seats he can if imps are in him merryandrew as much as he pleases detested punctilio does not reign there he can proselytize for the soul's welfare decry or uphold the national drink advertize a commercial firm deriving prosperity from the favour of the multitude exhort to patriotism all is accepted politeness is the rule according to skepsey's experience of the southern part of the third class kingdom and it is as well to mark the divisions for the better knowledge of our countrymen the north requires volumes to itself the hard grained old pirate stock northward has built the land and is to the front when we are at our epic work meanwhile it gets us a blowzy character by shouldering roughly among the children of civilization skepsey journeying one late afternoon up a kentish line had in both senses of the word encountered a long limbed navvy an intoxicated he was compelled by his manly modesty to desire to think whose loathly talk forced upon the hearing of a decent old woman opposite him passed baboonish behaviour so much so that skepsey civilly intervened subsequently inviting him to leave the carriage and receive a lesson at the station they were nearing upon his promising faithfully that it should be a true and telling lesson the navvy requested this pygmy spark to flick his cheek merely to show he meant war in due sincerity and he as faithfully all honour promising not to let it bring about a breakage of the laws of the company skepsey promptly did the deed so they went forth skepsey alluded to the incident for an example of the lamentable deficiency in science betrayed by most of our strong men when put to it and the bitter thought that he could count well nigh to a certainty on the total absence of science in the long armed navvy whose fist on his nose might have been as the magnet of a pin was chief among his reminiscences after the bout destroying pleasure for the lover of old england's might one blow would have sent skepsey travelling he was not seriously struck once they parted shaking hands the navvy confessing himself to have 'drunk a drop' and that perhaps accounted for his having been 'topped by a dot on him' he declined to make oath never to repeat his offence but said sending his vanquisher to the deuce with an amicable push at his shoulder 'damned if i ever forget five foot five stretched six foot flat' skepsey counted his feet some small amount higher but our hearty rovers' sons have their ballad moods when giving or taking a thrashing one of the third class passengers a lad of twenty became skepsey's pupil and turned out clever with the gloves and was persuaded to enter the militia and grew soon to be a corporal thus there was profit of the affair though the navvy sank out of sight let us hope and pray he will not insult the hearing of females again if only females knew how necessary it is for their sakes to be able to give a lesson now and then ladies are positively opposed and judges too who dress so like them the manhood of our country is kept down in consequence mr durance was right when he said something about the state of war being wanted to weld our races together and yet we are always praying for the state of peace which causes cracks and gaps among us was that what he meant by illogical it seemed to skepsey oddly considering his inferior estimate of the value of the fair sex that a young woman with whom he had recently made acquaintance and who was in brighton now upon missionary work a member of the 'army' an officer of advancing rank matilda pridden by name was nearer to the secret of the right course of conduct for individual citizens and the entire country than any gentleman he knew yes nearer to it than his master was thinking of mr victor radnor skepsey fetched a sigh he had knocked at his master's door at the office one day and imagining the call to enter had done so and had seen a thing he could not expunge lady grace halley was there from matters he gathered skepsey guessed her to be working for his master among the great folks as he did with jarniman and mr fenellan with mr carling but is it usual he asked himself his natural veneration framing the rebuke to his master thus to repay the services of a lady so warmly we have all of us an ermined owl within us to sit in judgement of our superiors as well as our equals and the little man notwithstanding a servant's bounden submissiveness was forced to hear the judicial pronouncement upon his master's behaviour his master had at the same time been saying most weighty kind words more and more of late one thing that if he gave all he had to his fellows and did all he could he should still be in their debt and he was a very wealthy gentleman what are we to think the ways of our superiors are wonderful we do them homage still we feel we painfully feel we are beginning to worship elsewhere it is the pain of a detachment of the very roots of our sea weed heart from a rock mr victor radnor was an honour to his country skepsey did not place the name of matilda pridden beside it or in any way compare two such entirely different persons at the same time and most earnestly while dreading to hear he desired to have matilda pridden's opinion of the case distressing him he never could hear it because he could never be allowed to expound the case to her skepsey sighed again he as much as uttered oh if we had a few thousands like her but what if we do have them they won't marry there they are all that the country requires in wives and mothers and like miss priscilla graves they won't marry he looked through sad thoughts across the benches of the compartments to the farther end of the carriage where sat the rev septimus barmby looking at him through a meditation as obscure if not so mournful few are the third class passengers outward at that early hour in the winter season and skepsey's gymnastics to get beside the rev septimus were unimpeded though a tight packed carriage of us poor journaliers would not have obstructed them with as much as a sneer mr barmby and skepsey greeted the latter said he had a holiday to pay a visit to miss nesta the former said he hoped he should see miss nesta skepsey then rapidly brought the conversation to a point where matilda pridden was comprised he discoursed of the 'army' and her position in the army giving instances of her bravery the devotion shown by her to the cause of morality in all its forms mr barmby had his fortunes on his hands at the moment he could not lend an attentive ear and he disliked this army the title it had taken and the mixing of women and men in its ranks not to speak of a presumption in its proceedings and the public marching and singing moreover he enjoyed his one or two permissible glasses he doubted that the chiefs of the army had common benevolence for the inoffensive pipe but the cause of morality was precious to him morality and a fit of softness and the union of the happiest contrast of voices had set him for a short while before the dawn of nesta's day hankering after priscilla graves skepsey's narrative of matilda pridden's work down at the east of london was effective it had the ring to thrill a responsive chord in mr barmby who mused on london's east and martyrly service there his present expectations were of a very different sort but a beautiful bride bringing us wealth is no misleading beam if we direct the riches rightly septimus a solitary minister in those grisly haunts of the misery breeding vice must needs accomplish less than a septimus the husband of one of england's chief heiresses only not the most brilliant owing to circumstances known to the rev groseman buttermore strangely and opportunely revealed for her exceeding benefit it may be hoped she is no longer the ignorant girl to reject the protecting hand of one whose cloth is the best of cloaking a glance at dudley sowerby's defection assures our worldly wisdom too that now is the time to sue several times while mr barmby made thus his pudding of the desires of the flesh and the spirit skepsey's tales of matilda pridden's heroism caught his attention he liked her deeds he disliked the position in which the young woman placed herself to perform them and he said so women are to be women he said skepsey agreed 'if we could get men to do the work sir' mr barmby was launching forth plenty of men his mouth was blocked by the reflection that we count the men on our fingers often are we as it were an episcopal thumb surveying scarce that number of followers he diverged to censure of the marchings and the street singing the impediment to traffic the annoyance to a finely musical ear he disapproved altogether of matilda pridden's military display pronouncing her to be 'doubtless a worthy young person' 'her age is twenty seven' said skepsey spying at the number of his own 'you have known her long' mr barmby asked 'not long sir she has gone through trouble she believes very strongly in the will if i will this if i will that and it is the right will not wickedness it is done as good as done and force is quite superfluous in her sermons she exhorts to prayer before action' 'preaches' 'she moves a large assembly sir' 'it would seem that england is becoming americanized' exclaimed the conservative in mr barmby almost he groaned and his gaze was fish like in vacancy on hearing the little man speak of the present intrepid forwardness of the sex to be publicly doing it is for men the most indigestible fact of our century one that by contrast throws an overearthly holiness on our decorous dutiful mothers who contentedly worked below the surface while men unremittingly attended to their interests above skepsey drew forth a paper covered shilling book a translation from the french under a yelling title of savage hate of old england and cannibal glee at her doom mr barmby dropped his eyelashes on it without comment nor did he reply to skepsey's forlorn remark 'we let them think they could do it' behold the downs breakfast is behind them miss radnor likewise if the poor child has a name we propose to supply the deficiency she does not declare war upon tobacco she has a cultured and a beautiful voice we abstain from enlargeing on the charms of her person she has resources which representatives of a rival creed would plot to secure 'skepsey you have your quarters at the house of miss radnor's relatives' said mr barmby as they emerged from tunnelled chalk 'mention that i think of calling in the course of the day' a biscuit had been their breakfast without a name they parted at the station roused by the smell of salt to bestow a more legitimate title on the day's restorative beginning down the hill along by the shops and skepsey in sight of miss nesta's terrace considered it still an early hour for a visitor so to have the sea about him he paid pier money and hurried against the briny wings of a south wester green waves curls of foam flecks of silver under low flying grey dark cloud curtains shaken to a rift where at one shot the sun had a line of nereids nodding laughing sparkling to him skepsey enjoyed it at the back of thoughts military and naval visible sea this girdle of britain inspired him to exultations in reverence he wished mr durance could behold it now and have such a breastful he was wishing he knew a song of britain and sea rather fancying mr durance to be in some way a bar to patriotic poetical recollection when he saw his captain dartrey mounting steps out of an iron anatomy of the pier and looking like a razor off a strap 'why sir' cried skepsey 'just a plunge and a dozen strokes' dartrey said 'and you'll come to my hotel and give me ten minutes of the recreation and if you don't come willingly i shall insult your country' 'ah i wish mr durance were here' skepsey rejoined 'it would upset his bumboat of epigrams he rises at ten o'clock to a queasy breakfast by candlelight and proceeds to composition his picture of the country is a portrait of himself by the artist' 'but sir captain dartrey you don't think as mr durance does of england' 'there are lots to flatter her skepsey a drilling can't do her harm you're down to see miss nesta ladies don't receive quite so early and have you breakfasted come on with me quick' dartrey led him on saying 'you have an eye at my stick it was a legacy to me by word of mouth from a seaman of a ship i sailed in who thought i had done him a service and he died after all he fell overboard drunk he perished of the villain stuff one of his messmates handed me the stick in cape town sworn to deliver it a good knot to grasp and it 's flexible and strong stick or rattan whichever you please it gives point or caresses the shoulder there's no break in it whack as you may they call it a demerara supple jack i'll leave it to you' skepsey declared his intention to be the first to depart he tried the temper of the stick bent it a bit and admired the prompt straightening 'it would give a good blow sir' 'does its business without braining' perhaps for the reason that it was not a handsome instrument for display on fashionable promenades dartrey chose it among his collection by preference as ugly dogs of a known fidelity are chosen for companions the demerara supple jack surpasses bull dogs in its fashion of assisting the master for when once at it the clownish looking thing reflects upon him creditably by developing a refined courtliness of style while in no way showing a diminution of jolly ardour for the fray it will deal you the stroke of a bludgeon with the playfulness of a cane it bears resemblance to those accomplished natural actors who conversationally present a dramatic situation in two or three spontaneous flourishes and are themselves again men of the world the next minute skepsey handed it back he spoke of a new french rifle he mentioned in the form of query for no answer the translation of the barking little volume he had shown to mr barmby he slapped at his breast pocket where it was not a ship was on the sea line and he seemed to deplore that vacancy 'but it tells both ways' dartrey said 'we don't want to be hectoring in the channel all we want is to be sure of our power so as not to go hunting and fawning for alliances up along that terrace miss nesta lives brighton would be a choice place for a landing' skepsey temporized to get his national defences by pleading the country's love of peace 'then you give up your portion of the gains of war an awful disgorgement' said dartrey 'if you are really for peace you toss all your spare bones to the war dogs otherwise quakerly preaching is taken for hypocrisy' 'i 'm afraid we are illogical sir' said skepsey adopting one of the charges of mr durance to elude the abominable word 'in you run my friend' dartrey sped him up the steps of the hotel a little note lay on his breakfast table his invalid uncle's valet gave the morning's report of the night the note was from mrs blathenoy she begged captain dartrey in double underlinings of her brief words to mount the stairs he debated and he went she was excited and showed a bosom compressed to explode she had been weeping 'my husband is off he bids me follow him what would you have me do' 'go' 'you don't care what may happen to your friends the radnors' 'not at the cost of your separation from your husband' 'you have seen him' 'be serious' 'oh you cold creature you know you see i can't conceal and you tell me to go go gracious heavens i've no claim on you i haven't been able to do much i would have never mind believe me or not and now i'm to go on the spot i suppose you've seen the man i 'm to go to too i would bear it if it were not away from out of sight of i'm a fool of a woman i know there's frankness for you and i could declare you're saying impudence in your heart or what you have for one have you one' 'my dear soul it 's a flint so just think of your duty' dartrey played the horrid part of executioner with some skill her bosom sprang to descend into abysses 'and never a greater fool than when i sent for you to see such a face as i'm showing' she cried with lips that twitched and fingers that plucked at her belt 'but you might feel my hatred of being tied to dragged about over the continent by that perhaps you think a woman is not sensible of vulgarity in her husband i 'm bothering you i don't say i have the slightest claim you never made love to me never never so much as pressed my hand or looked others have as much as i let them and before i saw you i had not an idea of another man but that man so you advise me to go' 'there's no other course' 'no other course i don't see one what have i been dreaming of usually a woman feeling' she struck at her breast 'has had a soft word in her ear go i don't blame you captain dartrey at least you 're not the man to punish a woman for stripping herself as i 've done i call myself a fool i'm a lunatic trust me with your hand' 'there you are' she grasped the hand and shut her eyes to make a long age of the holding on to him 'oh you dear dear fellow don't think me unwomanly i must tell you now i am naked and can't disguise i see you are ice feel and if you were different i might be you won't be hurt by hearing you've made yourself dear to me without meaning to i know it began that day at lakelands i fell in love with you the very first minute i set eyes on you there's a confession for a woman to make and a married woman i'm married and i no more feel allegiance as they call it than if there never had been a ceremony and no jacob blathenoy was in existence and why i should go to him but you shan't be troubled i did not begin to live as a woman before i met you i can speak all this to you because we women can't be deceived in that you are one of the men who can be counted on for a friend' 'i hope so' dartrey said and his mouth hardened as nature's electricity shot sparks into him from the touch and rocked him 'no not yet i will soon let it drop' said she and she was just then thrillingly pretty she caressed the hand placing it at her throat and moving her chin on it as women fondle birds 'i am positively to go then' 'positively you are to go and it's my command' 'not in love with any one at all' 'not with a soul' 'not with a woman' 'with no woman' 'nor maid' 'no and no to everything and an end to the catechism' 'it is really a flint that beats here' she said and with a shyness in adventurousness she struck the point of her forefinger on the rib 'fancy me in love with a flint and running to be dutiful to a jacob blathenoy at my flint's command i'm half in love with doing what i hate because this cold thing here bids me do it i believe i married for money and now it looks as if i were to have my bargain with poverty to bless it' 'there i may help' said dartrey relieved at sight of a loophole to spring to some initiative out of the paralysis cast on him by a pretty little woman's rending of her veil a man of honour alone with a woman who has tossed concealment to the winds is a riddled target indeed he is tempted to the peril of cajoleing that he may escape from the torment and the ridicule he is tempted to sigh for the gallant spirit of his naughty adolescence 'come to me will you apply to me if there's ever any need i happen to have money and forgive me for naming it' she groaned 'don't i'm sure and i thought it from the first you're one of the good men and the woman who meets you is lucky and wretched and so she ought to be only to you should i do believe that i won't speak of what excuses i've got you've seen' 'don't think of them there'll be danger in it 'shall you think of me in danger' 'silly silly don't you see you have to do with a flint i've gone through fire and if i were in love with you i should start you off to your husband this blessed day' 'and you're not the slightest wee wee bit in love with me' 'perfectly true but i like you and if we're to be hand in hand in the time to come you must walk firm at present' 'i'm to go to day' 'you are' 'without again' the riddled target kicked dartrey contrasted jacob blathenoy with the fair wife and commiseratingly exonerated her he lashed at himself for continuing to be in this absurdest of postures and not absolutely secure for all that his head shook 'friends you'll find best' 'well' she sighed 'i feel i'm doomed to go famished through life there's never to be such a thing as love for me i can't tell you no woman could though you'll say i've told enough i shall burn with shame when i think of it i could go on my knees to have your arms round me once i could kill myself for saying it i should feel that i had one moment of real life i know i ought to admire you they say a woman hates if she's refused i can't i wish i were able to i could have helped the radnors better by staying here and threatening never to go to him unless he swore not to do them injury he's revengeful just as you like you say go and i go there i may kiss your hand' 'give me yours' dartrey kissed the hand she kissed the mark of his lips he got himself away by promising to see her to the train for paris outside her door he was met by the reflection coming as a thing external that he might veraciously and successfully have pleaded a passionate hunger for breakfast nay that he would have done so if he had been downright in earnest for she had the prettiness to cast a spell a certain curve at the lips a fluttering droop of the eyelids a corner of the eye that led long distances away to forests and nests this little woman had the rosy peeping june bud's plumpness what of the man who refused to kiss her once cold antecedent immersion had to be thanked and stringent vacuity perhaps a spotting ogre image of her possessor some sense of right doing also we hope dartrey angrily attributed his good conduct to the lowest motives he went so far as to accuse himself of having forborne to speak of breakfast from a sort of fascinated respect for the pitch of a situation that he despised and detested then again when beginning to eat his good conduct drew on him a chorus of the jeers of all the martial comrades he had known but he owned he would have had less excuse than they had he taken advantage of a woman's inability at a weak moment to protect herself or rather if he had not behaved in a manner to protect her from herself he thought of his buried wife and the noble in the base of that poor soul needing constantly a present helper for the nobler to conquer be true man with a woman she must be viler than the devil has yet made one if she does not follow a strong right lead but be patient of course and the word patience here means more than most men contain certainly a man like jacob blathenoy was a mouthful for any woman and he had bought his wife he deserved no pity not probably not that view however is unwholesome and opens on slides pity of his wife too gets to be fervidly active with her portrait fetches her breath about us as for condemnation of the poor little woman her case was not unexampled though the sudden flare of it startled rather mrs victor could read men and women closely yes and victor when he schemed but dartrey declined to be throwing blame right or left more than by his breakfast and in a preferable direction he was refreshed by skepsey's narrative of the deeds of matilda pridden 'the right sort of girl for you to know skepsey' he said 'the best in life is a good woman' skepsey exhibited his book of the gallic howl 'they have their fits now and then and they're soon over and forgotten' dartrey said 'the worst of it is that we remember' after the morning's visit to his uncle he peered at half a dozen sticks in the corner of the room grasped their handles and selected the demerara supple jack for no particular reason the curved knot was easy to the grasp it was in his mind that this person signing herself judith marsett might have something to say which intimately concerned nesta he fell to brooding on it until he wondered why he had not been made a trifle anxious by the reading of the note overnight skepsey was left at nesta's house dartrey found himself expected by the servant waiting on mrs marsett chapter xxxii shows how temper may kindle temper and an indignant woman get her weapon judith marsett stood in her room to receive nesta's hero she was flushed and had thinned her lips for utterance of a desperate thing after the first severe formalities her aim was to preserve an impressive decorum she was at the same time burning to speak out furious wrath in words of savage rawness if they should come as a manner of slapping the world's cheek for the state to which it reduces its women whom one of the superior creatures can insult and laugh men complaining of the 'peace which is near their extinction' have but to shuffle with the sex they will experience as remarkable a change as if they had passed off land on to sea dartrey had some flitting notion of the untamed original elements women can bring about us in his short observant bow to mrs marsett following so closely upon the scene with mrs blathenoy but this handsome woman's look of the dull red line of a sombre fire that needed only stir of a breath to shoot the blaze did not at all alarm him he felt refreshingly strung by it she was discerned at a glance to be an aristocratic member of regions where the senses perpetually simmer when they are not boiling the talk at the club recurred to him how could nesta have come to know the woman his questioning of the chapter of marvellous accidents touched nesta simply as a young girl to be protected without abhorrently involving the woman he had his ideas of the spirit of woman stating her case to the one judge for lack of an earthly just one a story different from that which is proclaimed pestilential by the body of censors under conservatory glass where flesh is delicately nurtured highly prized spirit not so much so and where the pretty tricking of the flesh is taken for a spiritual ascendancy in spite of her turbulent breast's burden to deliver mrs marsett's feminine acuteness was alive upon dartrey confirming here and there nesta's praises of him she liked his build and easy carriage of a muscular frame her ned was a heavy man more than dartrey's figure as she would have said though the estimate came second she liked his manner with her not a doubt was there that he read her position she could impose upon some not upon masculine eyes like these they did not scrutinize nor ruffle a smooth surface with a snap at petty impressions and they were not cynically intimate or dominating or tentatively amorous clear good fellowship was in them and it was a blessedness whatever might be her feeling later when she came to thank him at heart to be in the presence of a man whose appearance breathed of offering her common ground whereon to meet and speak together unburdened by the hunting world and by the stoneing world such common ground seems a kind of celestial to the better order of those excluded from it dartrey relieved her midway in a rigid practice of the formalities 'i think i may guess that you have something to tell me relating to miss radnor' 'it is' mrs marsett gathered up for an immediate plunge and deferred it 'i met her we went out with the riding master she took to me i like her i could say' the woman's voice dropped dead low in a tremble 'i love her she is young i could kneel to her do you know a major worrell' 'worrell no' 'he is a calls himself a friend of my of captain marsett's he met us out one day' 'he permitted himself to speak to miss radnor' she rejoiced in dartrey's look 'not then first let me tell you i can hardly tell you but miss radnor tells me you are not like other men you have made your conclusions already are you asking what right i had to be knowing her it is her goodness accident began it i did not deceive her as soon as ever i could i i have captain marsett's promise to me at present he's situated he but i opened my heart to her as much as a woman can it came did i do very wrong' 'i'm not here to decide continue pray' mrs marsett aimed at formal speech and was driving upon her natural in anger 'i swear i did it for the best she is an innocent girl young lady only she has a head she soon reads things i saw the kind of cloud in her i spoke i felt bound to she said she would not forsake me i was bound to and it was enough to break my heart to think of her despising me no she forgave pitied she was kind those are the angels who cause us to think of changeing i don't care for sermons but when i meet charity i won't bore you' 'you don't' 'my captain marsett can't bear he calls it psalmody he thinks things ought always to be as they are with women and men and women preachers he does detest she is not one to preach you are waiting to hear what i have to tell that man major worrell has tried to rob me of everything i ever had to set a value on love i 'd say he laughs at a woman like me loving' dartrey nodded to signify a known sort of fellow 'she came here' mrs marsett's tears had risen 'i ought not to have let her come i invited her for once i am lonely none of my sex none i could respect i meant it for only once she promised to sing to me and oh how she sings you have heard her my whole heart came out i declare i believe girls exist who can hear our way of life and i'm not so bad except compared with that angel who heard me and was and is i could take oath no worse for it some girls can she is one i am all for bringing them up in complete innocence if i was a great lady my daughters should never know anything of the world until they were married but miss radnor is a young lady who cannot be hurt she is above us oh what a treasure for a man and my god for any man born of woman to insult a saint as she is he is a beast' 'major worrell met her here' 'blame me as much as you like i do myself half my rage with him is at myself for putting her in the way of such a beast to annoy each time she came i said it was to be the last i let her see what a mercy from heaven she was to me she would come it has not been many times she wishes me either to captain marsett has promised and nothing seems hard to me when my own god's angel is by she is i'm not such a bad woman but i never before i knew her knew the meaning of the word virtue there is the young lady that man worried with his insulting remarks though he must have known she was a lady because he found her in my rooms' 'you were present when as you say he insulted her' 'i was here it commenced and he would see her downstairs' 'you heard' 'of course i never left her' 'give me a notion' 'to get her to make an appointment to let him conduct her home' 'she was alone' 'her maid was below' 'and this happened' 'yesterday after dark my ned captain marsett encourages him to be familiar i should be the lowest of women if i feared the threats of such a reptile of a man i could tell you more i can't always refuse his visits though if ned knew the cur he is captain marsett is easy going' 'i should like to know where he lives' she went straight to the mantelpiece and faced about with a card handing it quite aware that it was a charge of powder desperate things to be done excused the desperate said and especially they seemed a cover to the bald and often spotty language leaping out of her against her better taste when her temper was up 'somewhere not very distant' said dartrey perusing 'is he in the town to day do you know' 'i am not sure he may be her name' 'have no fear ladies' names are safe' 'i am anxious that she may not be insulted again' 'did she show herself conscious of it' 'she stopped speaking she looked at the door she may come again or never through that man' 'you receive him at his pleasure' 'captain marsett wishes me to he is on his way home he calls major worrell my pet spite all i want is not to hear of the man i swear he came yesterday on the chance of seeing for he forced his way up past my servant he must have seen miss radnor's maid below' 'you don't mean that he insulted her hearing' 'oh captain fenellan you know the style' 'well i thank you' dartrey said 'the young lady is the daughter of my dearest friends she's one of the precious you're quite right keep the tears back' 'i will' she heaved open mouthed to get physical control of the tide 'when you say that of her how can i help it it's i fear because i fear and i've no right to expect ever but if i'm never again to look on that dear face tell her i shall i shall pray for her in my grave tell her she has done all a woman can an angel can to save my soul i speak truth my very soul i could never go to the utter bad after knowing her i don't you know the world i'm a poor helpless woman don't swear to give up my ned if he does break the word he promised once i can't see how i could i haven't her courage i haven't what it is you know her it's in her eyes and her voice if i had her beside me then i could starve or go to execution i could i am certain here i am going to do what you men hate let me sit' 'here's a chair' said dartrey 'i've no time to spare good day for the present you will permit me to call' 'oh come' she cried out of her sobs for excuse they were genuine or she would better have been able to second her efforts to catch a distinct vision of his retreating figure she beheld him when he was in the street turn for the district where major worrell had his lodgeings that set her mind moving and her tears fell no longer major worrell was not at home dartrey was informed that he might be at his club at the club he heard of the major as having gone to london and being expected down in the afternoon colonel sudley named the train an early train the major was engaged to dine at the club dartrey had information supplied to him concerning major worrell and captain marsett also mrs marsett she had a history worthy citizens read the description of history with interest when the halo of royalty is round it they may if their reading extends perceive that it has been the main turbid stream in old mammon's train since he threw his bait for flesh they might ask too whether it is likely to cease to flow while he remains potent the lady's history was brief and bore recital in a club came off quite honourably there regarding major worrell the tale of him showed him to have a pass among men he managed cleverly to get his pleasures out of a small income and a 'fund of anecdote' his reputation indicated an anecdotist of the table prevailing in the primitive societies where the art of conversing does not come by nature and is exercised in monosyllabic undertones or grunts until the narrator's well masticated popular anecdote loosens a digestive laughter and some talk ensues he was marsett's friend and he boasted of not letting ned marsett make a fool of himself dartrey was not long in shaping the man's character worrell belonged to the male birds of upper air who mangle what female prey they are forbidden to devour and he had miss radnor's name he had spoken her name at the club overnight he had roused a sensation because of a man being present percy southweare who was related to a man as good as engaged to marry her the major never fell into a quarrel with sons of nobles if he could help it or there might have been a pretty one so colonel sudley said dartrey spoke musing 'i don't know how he may class me i have an account to square with him' 'it won't do in these days my good friend come and cool yourself and we'll lunch here i shan't leave you' 'by all means we'll lunch and walk up to the station and you will point him out to me' dartrey stated major worrell's offence the colonel was not astonished but evidently he thought less of worrell's behaviour to miss radnor in mrs marsett's presence than of the mention of her name at the club and that he seemed to think had a shade of excuse against the charge of monstrous he blamed the young lady who could go twice to visit a mrs marsett partly exposed a suspicion of her dartrey let him talk they strolled along the parade and were near the pier suddenly saying 'there beside our friend in clerical garb here she comes judge if that is the girl for the foulest of curs to worry no matter where she's found' dartrey directed the colonel's attention to nesta and mr barmby turning off the pier and advancing he saluted she bowed there was no contraction of her eyelids and her face was white the mortal life appeared to be deadened in her cold wide look as when the storm wind banks a leaden remoteness leaving blown space of sky the colonel said 'no that's not the girl a gentleman would offend' 'what man' cried dartrey 'if we had a society for the trial of your gentleman but he has only to call himself gentleman to get grant of licence and your society protects him it won't punish and it won't let you but you saw her ask yourself what man could offend that girl' 'still my friend she ought to keep clear of the marsetts' 'when i meet him i shall treat him as one out of the law' 'you lead on to an ultimate argument with the hangman' we 'll dare it to waken the old country old england will count none but worrells in time as for discreet if you like the young lady might have been more discreet she's a girl with a big heart if we were all everlastingly discreet' dartrey may have meant that the consequence of a prolonged conformity would be the generation of stenches to shock to purgeing tempests the tolerant heavens over such smooth stagnancy he had his ideas about movement about the good of women and the health of his england the feeling of the hopelessness of pleading nesta's conduct for the perfect justification of it to son or daughter of our impressing conventional world even to a friend that friend a true man a really chivalrous man drove him back in a silence upon his natural brotherhood with souls that dare do it was a wonder to think of his finding this kinship in a woman in a girl and the world holding that virgin spirit to be unclean or shadowed because its rays were shed on foul places he clasped the girl her smitten clear face the face of the second sigh after torture bent him in devotion to her image the clasping and the worshipping were independent of personal ardours quaintly mixed with semi paternal recollections of the little 'blue butterfly' of the days at craye farm and creckholt and he had heard of dudley sowerby's pretensions to her hand nesta's youthfulness cast double age on him from the child's past he pictured the child pictured the girl with her look of solitariness of sight as in the desolate wide world where her noble compassion for a woman had unexpectedly painfully almost by transubstantiation rack screwed her to woman's mind and above sorrowful holy were those eyes they held sway over dartrey and lost it some steps on his demon temper urgeing him to strike at major worrell as the cause of her dismayed expression he was not the happier for dropping to his nature but we proceed more easily all of us when the strain which lifts us a foot or two off our native level is relaxed chapter xxxiii a pair of wooers that ashen look of the rise out of death from one of our mortal wounds was caused by deeper convulsions in nesta's bosom than dartrey could imagine she had gone for the walk with mr barmby reading the omen of his tones in the request dorothea and virginia would have her go the clerical gentleman a friend of the rev abram posterley and one who deplored poor mr posterley's infatuation and one besides who belonged to nesta's musical choir in london seemed a safe companion for the child the grand organ of mr barmby's voice too assured them of a devout seriousness in him that arrested any scrupulous little questions they could not conceive his uttering the nonsensical empty stuff compliments to their beauty and what not which girls hear sometimes from inconsiderate gentlemen to the having of their heads turned moreover nesta had rashly promised her father's faithful servant skepsey to walk out with him in the afternoon and the ladies hoped she would find the morning's walk to have been enough good little man though skepsey was they were sure but there is the incongruous for young women of station on a promenade mr barmby headed to the pier after pacing up and down between the briny gulls and a polka band he made his way forethoughtfully to the glass sheltered seats fronting east where as his enthusiasm for the solemnity of the occasion excited him to say 'we have a view of the terraces and the cliffs' and where not more than two enwrapped invalid figures were ensconsed then it was that nesta recalled her anticipation of his possible design forgotten by her during their talk of her dear people priscilla graves and mr pempton and the yatts and simeon fenellan peridon and catkin and skepsey likewise and the very latest news of her mother she wished she could have run before him to spare him he would not notice a sign girls must wait and hear it was an oratorio she watched the long wave roll on to the sinking into its fellow and onward again for the swell and the weariful lapse and up at last bursting to the sheet of white the far heard roar and the near commingled giving mr barmby a semblance to the powers of ocean at the first direct note the burden of which necessitated a pause she petitioned him to be her friend to think of himself as her friend but a vessel laden with merchandize that has crossed wild seas for this particular port is hardly to be debarred from discharging its goods on the quay by simple intimations of their not being wanted we are precipitated both by the aim and the tedium of the lengthened voyage to insist that they be seen we believe perforce in their temptingness and should allurement fail we fall back to the belief in our eloquence an eloquence to expose the qualities they possess is the testification in the promise of their excellence she is to be induced by feeling to see it we are asking a young lady for the precious gift of her hand we respect her and because of our continued respect despite an obstruction we have come to think we have a claim upon her gratitude could she but be led to understand how different we are from some other man from one hitherto favoured among them unworthy of this prize however personally exalted and meritorious the wave of wide extension rolled and sank and rose heaving lifeless variations of the sickly streaks on its dull green back dudley sowerby's defection was hinted at and accounted for by the worldly test of worldly considerations what were they nesta glanced an indistinct comparison was modestly presented of one unmoved by worldly considerations but what were they she was wakened by a lamp and her darkness was all inflammable to it 'oh mr barmby you have done me the honour to speak before you know my answer' she said 'you were then subject to an influence a false i may say wicked sentiment upholding celibacy' 'my poor louise she never thought of influencing me she has her views i mine our friendship does not depend on a treaty of reciprocity we are one at heart each free to judge and act as it should be in friendship i heard from her this morning her brother will be able to resume his military duties next month then she will return to me' 'we propose' rejoined mr barmby beholding the involuntary mercurial rogue dimple he had started from a twitch at the corner of her lips the good gentleman pursued 'can we dare write our designs for the month to come ah i will say nesta give me the hope i beg to have see the seriousness you are at liberty that other has withdrawn his pretensions we will not blame him he is in expectation of exalted rank where there is any shadow' mr barmby paused on his outroll of the word but immediately not intending to weigh down his gentle hearer with the significance in it resumed at a yet more sonorous depth 'he is under the obligation to his family an old a venerable family in the full blaze of public opinion his conduct can be palliated by us too there is a right and wrong in minor things independent of the higher rectitude we pardon we can partly support the worldly view' 'there is a shadow' said nesta and her voice was lurefully encouraging he was on the footing where men are precipitated by what is within them to blunder 'on you no on you personally not at all no it could not be deemed so not by those knowing esteeming not by him who loves you and would with his name would with his whole strength envelop shield certainly certainly not' 'it is on my parents' she said 'but to me nothing nothing quite nought to confound the innocent with the guilty and excuses may exist we know but how little we know' 'it is on both my parents' she said with a simplicity that induced him to reply 'before the world but not i repeat' the band instruments behind the sheltering glass flourished on their termination of a waltz she had not heeded their playing now she said 'the music is over we must not be late at lunch' and she stood up and moved he sprang to his legs and obediently stepped out 'i shall have your answer to day this evening nesta' 'mr barmby it will be the same you will be kind to me in not asking me again' he spoke further she was dumb had he done ill or well for himself and for her when he named the shadow on her parents he dwelt more on her than on himself he would not have wounded her to win the blest affirmative could she have been entirely ignorant and after dudley sowerby's defection for such it was the rev stuart rem had declared the union between the almost designated head of the cantor family and a young person of no name of worse than no birth impossible 'absolutely and totally impossible' he had said in his impressive fashion speaking from his knowledge of the family and an acquaintance with dudley she must necessarily have learnt why dudley sowerby withdrew no parents of an attractive daughter should allow her to remain unaware of her actual position in the world it is criminal a reduplication of the criminality yet she had not spoken as one astonished she was mysterious women are so young women most of all it is undecided still whether they do of themselves conceive principles or should submit to an imposition of the same upon them in terrorem mysterious truly but most attractive as lady bountiful of a district she would have in her maturity the majestic stature to suit a dispensation of earthly good things and strangely here she was at this moment rivalling to excelling all others of her sex he verified it in the crowd of female faces passing when they if they but knew the facts would visit her very appearance beside them on a common footing as an intrusion and a scandal to us who know such matters are indeed wonderful moved by reflective compassion mr barmby resumed the wooer's note some few steps after he had responded to the salutation of dartrey fenellan and colonel sudley she did not speak she turned her forehead to him and the absence of the world from her eyes chilled his tongue he declined the pleasure of the lunch with the duvidney ladies he desired to be alone to question himself fasting to sound the deed he had done for he had struck on a suspicion of selfishness in it and though love must needs be an egoism love is no warrant for the doing of a hurt to the creature beloved thoughts upon skepsey and the tale of his matilda pridden's labours in poor neighbourhoods to which he had been inattentive during the journey down to the sea invaded him they were persistent he was a worthy man having within him the spiritual impulse curiously ready to take the place where a material disappointment left vacancy the vulgar sort embrace the devil at that stage before the day had sunk mr barmby's lowest wish was to be a light as the instrument of his church in her ministrations amid the haunts of sin and slime to such plain souls as daniel skepsey and matilda pridden and he could still be that if nesta in the chapters of the future changed her mind she might for her good she would he reserved the hope his light was one to burn beneath an extinguisher at the luncheon table of the duvidney ladies it was a pain to dorothea and virginia to witness how poor the appetite their nesta brought in from the briny blowy walk they prophesied against her chances of a good sleep at night if she did not eat heartily virginia timidly remarked on her paleness both of them put their simple arts in motion to let her know that she was dear to them so dear as to make them dread the hour of parting they named their dread of it they had consulted in private and owned to one another that they did really love the child and dared not look forward to what they would do without her the dear child's paleness and want of appetite they remembered they were observing a weak innocent girl suggested to them mutually the idea of a young female heart sickening for the old unhappy maiden reason but if only she might return with them to the wells the rev stuart rem would assure her to convince her of her not being quite quite forsaken he or some one having sanction from victor might ultimately the ladies waiting anxiously in the next room to fold her on the warmth of their bosoms when she had heard impart to her the knowledge of circumstances which would under their further tuition concerning the particular sentiments of great families and the strict duties of the scions of the race help to account for and excuse the hon dudley sowerby's behaviour they went up to the drawing room talking of skepsey and his tale of miss pridden for nesta's amusement any talk of her skepsey usually quickened her lips to reminiscent smiles and speech now she held on to gazeing and sadly it seemed as if some object were not present for a vague encouragement dorothea said 'one week and we are back home at moorsedge' not so far from cronidge was implied for the administering of some foolish temporary comfort and it was as when a fish on land springs its hollow sides in alien air for the sustaining element the girl panted she clasped dorothea's hand and looked at virginia 'my mother i must see her' she said they were slightly stupefied by the unwonted mention of her mother they made no reply they never had done so when there was allusion to her mother their silence now struck a gong at the girl's bosom dorothea had it in mind to say that if she thirsted for any special comfort the friends about her would offer consolation for confidence before she could speak perrin the footman entered bearing the card of the hon dudley sowerby mr dudley sowerby begged for an immediate interview with miss radnor the ladies were somewhat agitated but no longer perplexed as to their duties they had quitted moorsedge to avoid the visit of his family if he followed it signified that which they could not withstand the 'tivoli falls' as they named the fateful tremendous human passion from the reminiscences of an impressive day on their travels in youth when the leaping torrent had struck upon a tale of love they were reading they hurriedly entreated nesta to command her nerves peremptorily requested her to stay where she was showed her spontaneously by way of histrionic adjuration the face to be worn by young ladies at greetings on these occasions kissed her and left her virginia whispering 'he is true' dudley entered the drawing room charged with his happy burden of a love that had passed through the furnace she stood near a window well in the light she hardly gave him welcome his address to her was hurried rather uncertain coherent enough between the drop and the catch of articulate syllables he found himself holding his hat he placed it on the table and it rolled foolishly but soon he was by her side having two free hands to claim her one 'you are thinking you have not heard from me i have been much occupied' he said 'my brother is ill very ill i have your pardon' 'indeed you have if it has to be asked' 'i have it' 'have i to grant it' 'i own to remissness 'i did not blame you' 'nesta' her coldness was unshaken he repeated the call of her name 'i should have written i ought to have written i could not have expressed you do forgive so many things' 'you come from cronidge to day' 'from my family to you' she seemed resentful his omissions as a correspondent were explicable in a sentence it had to be deferred reviewing for a moment the enormous internal conflict undergone by him during the period of the silence between them he wondered at the vastness of the love which had conquered objections to him so poignant there was at least no seeing of the public blot on her birth when looking on her face nor when thinking of the beauty of her character in absence or in presence was there any he had mastered distaste to such a degree that he forgot the assistance he had received from the heiress for enabling him to appreciate the fair young girl money is the imperious requirement of superior station and more money and more in these our modern days of the merchant's wealth and the miner's and the gigantic american and australian millionaires high rank is of necessity vowed in peril of utter eclipse to the possession of money still it is when assured a consideration far to the rear with a gentleman in whose bosom love and the buzzing world have fought their battle out he could believe it thoroughly fought out by the prolonged endurance of a contest lasting many days and nights in the midst of which at one time the task of writing to tell her of his withdrawal from the engagement was the cause of his omission to write as to her character he dwelt on the charm of her recovered features to repress an indicative dread of some intrepid force behind it that might be unfeminine however gentle the external lineaments her features her present aristocratic deficiency of colour greatly pleased him her character would submit to moulding of all young ladies in the world she should be the one to shrink from a mental independence and hold to the guidance of the man ennobling her did she her eyes were reading him she had her father's limpid eyes and when they concentrated rays they shot 'have you seen my parents mr sowerby' he answered smilingly for reassuringly 'i have seen them' 'my mother' 'from your mother first but am i not to be dudley' 'she spoke to you she told you' 'and yesterday your father a second time' some remainder of suspicion in the dealing with members of this family urged dudley to say 'i understood from them you were not that you were quite' 'i have heard i have guessed it was recently this morning as it happened i wish to go to my mother to day i shall go to her to morrow' 'i might offer to conduct you now' 'you are kind i have skepsey' she relieved the situation of its cold toned strain in adding 'he is a host' 'but i may come now have i not the right you do not deny it me' 'you are very generous' 'i claim the right then always and subsequently soon after my mother hopes to welcome you at cronidge she will be glad to hear of your naming of a day my father bids me he and all our family' 'they are very generous' 'i may send them word this evening of a day you name' 'no mr sowerby 'dudley' 'i cannot say it i have to see my parents' 'between us surely' 'my whole heart thanks you for your goodness to me i am unable to say more' he had again observed and he slightly crisped under the speculative look she directed on him a simple unstrained look that had an air of reading right in and was worse to bear with than when the spark leaped upon some thought from her eyes though he had no imagination of anything he concealed or exposed and he would have set it down to her temporary incredulousness of his perfect generosity or power to overcome the world's opinion of certain circumstances that had been a struggle the peculiar look was not renewed she spoke warmly of her gratitude she stated that she must of necessity see her parents at once she submitted to his entreaty to conduct her to them on the morrow it was in the manner of one who yielded step by step from inability to contend her attitude continuing unchanged he became sensible of a monotony in the speech with which he assailed it and he rose to leave not dissatisfied she at his urgent request named her train for london in the early morning he said it was not too early he would have desired to be warmed yet he liked her the better for the moral sentiment controlling the physical he had appointments with relatives or connections in the town and on that pretext he departed hoping for the speedy dawn of the morrow as soon as he had turned his back on the house no not he the man to have pity of women underfoot that was the thought unrevolved unphrased all but unconscious in nesta and while her heart was exalting him for his generosity under her present sense of the chilling shadow she felt the comfort there was in being grateful to him for the golden beams which his generosity cast about her but she had an intelligence sharp to pierce virgin though she was and with the mark in sight however distant she struck it unerring as an artemis for blood of beasts those shrewd young wits on the lookout to find a champion athirst for help upon a desolate road were hard as any judicial to pronounce the sentence upon dudley in that respect she raised him high she placed herself low she had a glimpse of the struggle he had gone through love of her had helped him she believed and she was melted and not the less did the girl's implacable intuition read with the keenness of eye of a man of the world the blunt division in him where warm humanity stopped short at the wall of social concrete forming a part of this rightly esteemed young citizen she too was divided she was at his feet and she rebuked herself for daring to judge or rather it was for having a reserve in her mind upon a man proving so generous with her she was pulled this way and that by sensibilities both inspiring to blind gratitude and quickening her penetrative view the certainty of an unerring perception remained dorothea and virginia were seated in the room below waiting for their carriage when the hall door spoke of the hon dudley's departure soon after nesta entered to them she swam up to dorothea's lap and dropped her head on it kneeling the ladies feared she might be weeping dorothea patted her thick brown twisted locks of hair unhappiness following such an interview struck them as an ill sign virginia bent to the girl's ear and murmured 'all well' she replied 'he has been very generous' her speaking of the words renewed an oppression that had darkened her on the descent of stairs for sensibilities sharp as nesta's are not to be had without their penalties and she who had gone nigh to summing in a flash the nature of dudley sank suddenly under that affliction often besetting the young adventurous mind crushing to young women the fascination exercised upon them by a positive adverse masculine attitude and opinion young men know well what it is and if young women have by chance overcome their timidity to the taking of any step out of the trim pathway they shrink with a sense of forlornest isolation it becomes a subjugation inciting to revolt but a heavy weight to cast off soon it assumed its material form for the contention between her and dudley in the figure of mrs marsett the nesta who had been instructed to know herself to be under a shadow heard she almost justified dudley's reproaches to her for having made the acquaintance of the unhappy woman for having visited her for having been though but for a minute at the mercy of a coarse gentleman's pursuit the recollection was a smart buffet her lighted mind punished her thus through her conjuring of dudley's words should news of her relations with mrs marsett reach him and she would have to tell him would he not say 'i have borne with the things concerning your family all the greater reason why i must insist' he would assuredly say he insisted her humour caught at the word as being the very word one could foresee and clearly see him uttering in a fit of vehemence on her immediate abandonment of 'that woman' and with nesta's present enlightenment by dusky beams upon her parentage she listened abjectly to dudley or the opinion of the majority would he not say or think that her clinging to mrs marsett put them under a kind of common stamp or gave the world its option to class them together these were among the ideas chasing in a head destined to be a battle field for the enrichment of a harvest field of them while the girl's face was hidden on dorothea's lap and her breast heaved and heaved she distressed them when she rose by saying she must instantly see her mother they saw the pain their hesitation inflicted and dorothea said 'yes dear any day you like' 'to morrow i must go to her to morrow' a suggestion of her mother's coming down was faintly spoken by one lady echoed in a quaver by the other nesta shook her head to quiet the kind souls she entreated them to give their promise that they would invite her again imagining the hon dudley to have cast her off both ladies embraced her not entirely yielding up their hearts to her by reason of the pernicious new ideas now in the world to sap our foundations of morality which warned them of their duty to uphold mentally his quite justifiable behaviour even when compassionating the sufferings of the guiltless creature loved by them chapter xxxiv contains deeds unrelated and expositions of feelings all through the afternoon and evening skepsey showed indifference to meals by continuing absent and he was the one with whom nesta would have felt at home more at home than with her parents he and the cool world he moved in were a transparency of peace to her mind even to his giving of some portion of it when she had the dear little man present to her in a vivid image of a fish in a glass globe wandering round and round now and then shooting across just as her skepsey did he carried his head semihorizontally at his arrowy pace plain to read though he was he appeared under that image created of him animated by motives inducing to speculation she thought of him till she could have reproached him for not returning and helping her to get away from the fever of other thoughts this anguish twisting about her parents and the dreadful trammels of gratitude to a man afflictingly generous the frown of congregated people the latter was the least of evils she had her charges to bring against them for injustice uncited unstirred charges they were effective as a muffled force to sustain her and the young who are of healthy lively blood and clean conscience have either emotion or imagination to fold them defensively from an enemy world whose power to drive them forth into the wilderness they acknowledge but in the wilderness their souls are not beaten down by breath of mortals they burn straight flame there up to the parent spirit she could not fancy herself flying thither where to be shorn and naked and shivering is no hardship for the solitude clothes and the sole true life in us resolves to that steady flame she was restrained by dudley's generosity which held her fast to have the forgiveness for her uncommitted sin dashed in her face he surprised her the unexpected quality in him seemed suddenly to have snared her fast and she did not obtain release after seeing behind it seeing it by the light of what she demanded personal shallow a lover's generosity so her keen intellect saw it and her young blood for the youthful are thus divided thrilled in thinking it must be love the name of the sacred passion lifted it out of the petty cabin of the individual into a quiring cathedral universal and subdued her it subdued her with an unwelcome touch of tenderness when she thought of it as involving tenderness for her mother some chivalrous respect for her mother could he love the daughter without some little which a more intimate knowledge of her dear mother would enlarge the girl's heart flew to her mother clung to her vindicated her dumbly it would not inquire and it refused to hear hungering the while she sent forth her flights of stories in elucidation of the hidden and they were like white bird after bird winging to covert beneath a thundercloud until her breast ached for the voice of the thunder harsh facts sure as she was of her never losing her filial hold of the beloved she and her mother grew together they were one accepting the shadow they were the closer one beneath it she had neither vision nor active thought of her father in whom her pride was at the hour of ten the ladies retired for the enjoyment of their sweet reward manton their maid came down to sit with nesta on the watch for skepsey perrin the footman returning as late as twenty minutes to eleven from his tobacco promenade along the terrace reported to manton 'a row in town' and he repeated to nesta the policeman's opinion and his own of the 'army' fellows and the way to treat them both were for rigour 'the name of army attracts poor skepsey so i am sure he would join it if they would admit him' nesta said 'he has an immense respect for a young woman who belongs to his army and one doesn't know what may have come' said manton two or three minutes after eleven a feeble ring at the bell gained admission for some person whispering was heard in the passage manton played eavesdropper and suddenly bursting on skepsey arrested him when about to dash upstairs his young mistress's voice was a sufficient command he yielded he pitched a smart sigh and stepped into her presence for his countenance to be seen or the show of a countenance that it presented 'skepsey wanted to rush to bed without saying good night to me' said she leaving unnoticed except for woefulness of tone his hurried shuffle of remarks on 'his appearance' and 'little accidents' ending with an inclination of his disgraceful person to the doorway and a petition 'if i might miss nesta' the implied pathetic reference to a surgically treated nose under a cross of strips of plaster could not obtain dismissal for him and he had one eye of sinister hue showing beside its lighted grey fellow as if a sullen punished dragonwhelp had couched near some quick wood pigeon the two eyes blinked rapidly he was a picture of guilt in the nude imploring to be sent into concealment the cruelty of detaining him was evident 'yes if you must' nesta said 'but dear skepsey will it be the magistrate again to morrow' he feared it would be he fancied it would needs be he concluded by stating that he was bound to appear before the magistrate in the morning and he begged assistance to keep it from the knowledge of the miss duvidneys who had been so kind to him 'has there been bailing of you again skepsey' 'a good gentleman a resident' he replied 'a military gentleman indeed a colonel of the cavalry but it may so be retired and anxious about our vast possessions though he thinks a translation of a french attack on england unimportant he says the germans despise us most' 'then this gentleman thinks you have a good case' 'he is a friend of captain dartrey's' hearing that name nesta said 'now skepsey you must tell me everything you are not to mind your looks i believe i do always believe you mean well' 'miss nesta it depends upon the magistrate's not being prejudiced against the street processionists 'but you may expect justice from the magistrate if your case is good' 'i would not say no miss nesta but we find the opinion of the public has its effect with magistrates their sentences they are severe on boxing they have latterly treated the army with more consideration owing to the change in the public view i myself have changed' 'have you joined it' 'i cannot say i am a member of it' 'you walked in the ranks to day and you were maltreated your friend was there' 'i walked with matilda pridden that is parallel along the pavement' 'i hope she came out of it unhurt' 'it is thanks to captain dartrey miss nesta' this time nesta looked her question manton interposed 'you are to speak mr skepsey' and she stopped a flood of narrative that was knocking in his mind to feel its head and to leap an uninterrupted half minute more would have shaped the story for the proper flow he began after attending to the throb of his bruises in a manner to correct them rather than solace and the beginning was the end 'captain dartrey rescued us before matilda pridden suffered harm to mention the chin slight teeth unshaken a beautiful set she is angry with captain dartrey for having recourse to violence in her defence it is against her principles then you die she says and our principles are to gain more by death she says we are alive in them but worse if we abandon them for the sake of living i am a little confused she is very abstruse because that is the corruptible life she says i have found it quite impossible to argue with her she has always a complete answer wonderful in case of invasion we are to lift our voices to the lord and the lord's will shall be manifested if we are robbed we ask how came we by the goods it is unreasonable it strikes at rights of property but i have to go on thinking when in danger she sings without excitement when the blow struck her she stopped singing only an instant she says no one fears who has real faith she will not let me call her brave she cannot admire captain dartrey her principles are opposed she said to him sir you did what seemed to you right she thinks every blow struck sends us back to the state of the beasts her principles' 'how was it captain dartrey happened to be present skepsey' 'she is very firm you cannot move her captain dartrey was on his way to the station to meet a gentleman from london miss nesta he carried a stick a remarkable stick he had shown to me in the morning and he has given it me now he says he has done his last with it he seems to have some of matilda pridden's ideas about fighting when it's over he was glad to be rid of the stick he said' 'but who attacked you what were the people' 'captain dartrey says england may hold up her head while she breeds young women like matilda pridden right or wrong he says it is the substance' hereupon manton sick of miss pridden shook the little man with a snappish word to bring him to attention she got him together sufficiently for him to give a lame version of the story flat until he came to his heroine's behaviour when he brightened a moment and he sank back absorbed in her principles and theories of life it was understood by nesta that the processionists going at a smart pace found their way blocked and were assaulted in one of the sidestreets and that skepsey rushed to the defence of matilda pridden and that while they were engaged captain dartrey was passing at the end of the street and recognized one he knew in the thick of it and getting the worst of it owing to numbers 'i will show you the stick he did it with miss nests' said skepsey regardless of narrative and darted out of the room to bring in the demerara supple jack holding which he became inspired to relate something of captain dartrey's deeds they gave no pleasure to his young lady as he sadly perceived thus it is with the fair sex ever so fond of heroes she shut her eyes from the sight of the demerara supple jack descending right and left upon the skulls of a couple of bully lads 'that will do you were rescued and now go to bed skepsey and be up at seven to breakfast with me' nesta said for his battle damaged face would be more endurable to behold after an interval she hoped and she might in the morning dissociate its evil look from the deeds of captain dartrey the thought of her hero taking active part in a streetfray was repulsive to her it swamped his brilliancy and this distressed her by withdrawing the support which the thought of him had been to her since mid day she lay for sleepless hours while nursing a deeper pain under oppression of repugnance to battle dealing bloodshedding men it was long before she grew mindful of the absurdity of the moan recurring whenever reflection wearied translated into speech it would have run 'in a street of the town with a stick' the vulgar picture pursued her to humiliation it robbed her or dimmed her possession of the one bright thing she had remaining to her so she deemed it during the heavy sighs of night partly conscious that in some strange way it was as much as tossing her to the man who never could have condescended to the pugnacious using of a stick in a street he on the contrary was a cover to the shamefaced her heart was weak that night she hovered above it but not so detached as to scorn it for fawning to one any one who would offer her and her mother a cover from scorn and now she exalted dudley's generosity now clung to a low idea of a haven in her father's wealth and she was unaware that the second mood was deduced from the first she did know herself cowardly she had too a critic in her clear head to spurn at the creature who could think of purchasing the world's respect dudley's generosity sprang up to silence the voice she could praise him on a review of it for delicacy moreover and the delicacy laid her under a more positive obligation her sense of it was not without a toneless quaint faint savour of the romantic that her humour little humorously caught at to paint her a picture of former heroes of fiction who win their trying lady by their perfection of good conduct on a background of high birth and who are not seen to be wooden before the volume closes her fatigue of sleeplessness plunged her into the period of poke bonnets and peaky hats to admire him giving her the kind of sweetness we may imagine ourselves to get in the state of tired horse munching hay if she had gone to her bed with a noble or simply estimable plain image of one of her friends in her heart to sustain it she would not have been thus abject skepsey's discoloured eye and captain dartrey's behaviour behind it threw her upon dudley's generosity as being the shield for an outcast girls who see at a time of need their ideal extinguished in its appearing tarnished are very much at the disposal of the pressing suitor nesta rose in the black winter morn summoning the best she could think of to glorify dudley that she might not feel so doomed according to an agreement overnight she went to the bedroom of dorothea and virginia to assure them of her having slept well and say the good bye to them and their tasso the little dog was the growl of a silken ball in a basket his mistresses excused him because of his being unused to the appearance of any person save manton in their bedroom dorothea kissing her said 'adieu dear child and there is home with us always remember and after breakfast however it may be you will for our greater feeling of security have she has our orders manton your own maid we consider too young for a guardian to accompany you we will not have it on our consciences that by any possibility harm came to you while you were under our charge the good innocent girl we received from the hands of your father we return to him we are sure of that' nesta said 'mr sowerby promised he would come' 'however it may be' dorothea repeated her curtaining phrase virginia put in a word of apology for tasso's temper he enjoyed ordinarily a slumber of half an hour's longer duration he was dorothea feelingly added regularity itself virginia murmured 'except once' and both were appalled by the recollection of that night it had nevertheless caused them to reperuse the rev stuart rem's published beautiful sermon on dirt the words of which were an antidote to the night of tasso in the nostrils of mnemosyne so that dorothea could reply to her sister slightly by way of a reproval quoting mr stuart rem at his loftiest 'let us not bring into the sacred precincts dirt from the roads but have a care to spread it where it is a fructification' virginia produced the sequent sentence likewise weighty nesta stood between the thin division of their beds her right hand given to one her left to the other they had the semblance of a haven out of storms she reflected after shutting the door of their room that the residing with them had been a means of casting her it was an effort to remember how upon the world where the tree of knowledge grows she had eaten and she might be the worse for it but she was raised to a height that would not let her look with envy upon peace and comfort luxurious quiet people were as ripening glass house fruits her bitter gathering of the knowledge of life had sharpened her intellect and the intellect even in the young is and not less usefully hard metal rather than fallow soil but for the fountain of human warmth at her breast she might have been snared by the conceit of intellect to despise the simple and conventional or shed the pity which is charity's contempt she had only to think of the kindness of the dear good ladies her heart jumped to them at once and when she fancied hearing those innocent souls of women embracing her and reproaching her for the knowledge of life she now bore her words down deep in her bosom were it has helped me to bear the shock of other knowledge how would she have borne it before she knew of the infinitely evil saving for the tender compassion weeping over her mother she had not much acute personal grief for this world condemning her birth was the world tolerant of that infinitely evil her intellect fortified her to be combative by day after the night of imagination which splendid power is not so serviceable as the logical mind in painful seasons for night revealed the world snorting dragon's breath at a girl guilty of knowing its vilest more than she liked to recall it had driven her scorched half withered to the shelter of dudley the daylight spreading thin at the windows restored her from that weakness 'we will quit england' she said thinking of her mother and herself and then of her father's surely following them she sighed thankfully half way through the breakfast with skepsey at sight of the hour by the clock she was hurriedly sentient of the puzzle of her feelings when she guessed at a chance that dudley would be delayed she supposed herself as possibly feeling not so well able to keep every thought of her head brooding on her mother in dudley's company skepsey's face was just sufferable by light of day if one pitied reflecting on his honest intentions it ceased to discolour another he dropped a few particulars of his hero in action but the heroine eclipsed he was heavier than ever with his matilda pridden at the hour for departure perrin had a conveyance at the door nesta sent off skepsey with a complimentary message to captain dartrey her maid mary begged her to finish her breakfast manton suggested the waiting a further two or three minutes 'we must not be late' nesta said and when the minute hand of the clock marked ample time for the drive to the station she took her seat and started keeping her face resolutely set seaward having at her ears the ring of a cry that was to come from manton but manton was dumb she spied no one on the pavement who signalled to stop them and no one was at the station to greet them they stepped into a carriage where they were alone dudley with his dreaded generosity melted out of nesta's thoughts like the vanishing steam wreath on the dip between the line and the downs she passed into music as she always did under motion of carriages and trains whether in happiness or sadness and the day being one that had a sky the scenic of music swung her up to soar none of her heavy burdens enchained though she knew the weight of them with those of other painful souls the pipeing at her breast gave wings to large and small of the visible and along the downs went stateliest of flowing dances a copse lengthened to forest a pool of cattle water caught grey for flights through enchantment cottage children wherever seen in groups she wreathed above with angels to watch them her mind all the while was busy upon earth embracing her mother eyeing her father imagination and our earthly met midway and still she flew until she was brought to the ground by a shot she struggled to rise uplifting judith marsett a woman not so very much older than her own teens in the count of years and ages older and the world pulling at her heels to keep her low that unhappiest had no one but a sisterly girl to help her and how she clung to the slender help who else was there the good and the bad in the woman struck separate blows upon the girl's resonant nature she perceived the good and took it into her reflections the bad she divined it approached like some threat of inflammation natures resonant as that which animated this girl are quick at the wells of understanding and she had her intimations of the world's wisdom in withholding contagious presences from the very mangy of the young who may not have an aim or ideal or strong human compassion for a preservative she was assured of her possessing it she asked herself in her mother's voice and answered mutely she had the certainty for she rebuked the slavish feverishness of the passion as betrayed by mrs marsett and the woman's tone as of strung wires ringing on a rage of the wind then followed her cry for the man who could speak to captain marsett of his duty in honour an image of one accompanying the faster beats of her heart beguiled her to think away from the cause he the one man known to her would act the brother's part on behalf of the hapless creature nesta just imagined her having supplicated him and at once imagination came to dust she had to thank him she knelt to him for the first time of her life she found herself seized with her sex's shudder in the blood chapter xxxv in which again we make use of the old lamps for lighting an abysmal darkness and if nesta had looked out of her carriage window soon after the train began to glide her eagle of imagination would have reeled from the heights with very different feelings earlier perhaps a captive at sight of the tardy gentleman rushing along the platform and bending ear to the footman perrin and staring for one lost the snaky tail of the train imparted to dudley an apprehension of the ominous in his having missed her it wound away and left regrets which raised a chorus of harsh congratulations from the opposite party of his internal parliament neither party could express an opinion without rousing the other to an uproar he had met his cousin southweare overnight he had heard that there was talk of miss radnor her name was in the mouth of major worrell it was coupled with the name of mrs marsett a military captain in the succession to be sir edward marsett bestowed on her the shadow of his name it could be certified that miss radnor visited the woman at her house what are we to think of miss radnor save that daughters of depraved parents a torture undeserved is the centaur's shirt for driving us to lay about in all directions he who had swallowed so much a thunderbolt a still undigested discharge from the perplexing heavens jumped frantic under the pressure upon him of more and worse a girl getting herself talked of at a club and she of all young ladies should have been the last to draw round her that buzz of tongues on such a subject the parents pursuing their career of cynical ostentation in london threw an evil eye of heredity on their offspring in the egg making anything credible pointing at tendencies an alliance with her was impossible so said disgust anger came like a stronger beast and extinguished the safety there was in the thing it consumed by growing so excessive as to require tempering with drops of compassion which prepared the way for a formal act of cold forgiveness and the moment that was conceived he had a passion to commit the horrible magnanimity and did it on a grand scale and dissolved his heart in the grandeur and slaved himself again far from expungeing the doubt of her forgiveness gave it a stamp and an edge his renewed enslavement set him perusing his tyrant keenly as nauseated captives do and he saw that forgiveness was beside the case for this nesta victoria radnor would not crave it or accept it he had mentally played the woman to her superior vivaciousness too long for him to see her taking a culprit's attitude what she did she intended to do the mother would not have encouraged her the father idolized her and the father was a frank hedonist whose blood speculation on horseback gallops to barren extremes eyes like hers if there had not been the miserable dupes of girls conduct is the sole guide to female character that likewise may be the hypocrite's mask popular artists intent to gratify the national taste for effects called realistic have figured in scenes of battle the raying fragments of a man from impact of a cannon ball on his person truly thus it may be when flesh contends but an image of the stricken and scattered mind of the man should though deficient in the attraction have a greater significance forasmuch as it does not exhibit him entirely liquefied and showered into space it leaves him his legs for the taking of further steps dudley standing on the platform of nesta's train one half minute too late according to his desire before he put himself in motion was as wildly torn as the vapour shredded streaming to fingers and threads off the upright columnar shot of the shriek from the boiler he wished every mad antagonism to his wishes that he might see her be blind to her embrace discard heal his wound and tear it wider he thanked her for the grossness of an offence precluding excuses he was aware of a glimmer of advocacy in the very grossness he conjured up her features and they said her innocence was the sinner they scoffed at him for the dupe he was willing to be she had enigma's mouth with the eyes of morning more than most girls she was the girl sphinx to him because of her having ideas or what he deemed ideas she struck a toneing warmth through his intelligence not dissimilar to the livelier circulation of the blood in the frame breathing mountain air she really helped him incited him to go along with this windy wild modern time more cheerfully if not quite hopefully for she had been the book of romance he despised when it appeared as a printed volume and which might have educated the young man to read some among our riddles in the book of humanity the white he was ready to take for silver the black were all black the spotted had received corruption's label her youthful french governess mademoiselle de seilles was also peculiarly enigmatic at the mouth conversant one might expect with the disintegrating literature of her country in public the two talked of st louis one of them in secret visits a mrs marsett the southweare women the hennen women and lady evelina reddish were artless candid creatures in their early days not transgressing in a glance lady grace halley had her fit of the devotional previous to marriage no girl known to dudley by report or acquaintance had committed so scandalous an indiscretion as miss radnor's it pertained to the insolently vile and on that ground it started the voluble defence for certain suspected things will dash suspicion to the rebound when they are very dark as soon as the charge against her was moderated the defence expired he heard the world delivering its judgement upon her and he sorrowfully acquiesced she passed from him when she was cut off she sang him in the distance a remembered saying of hers with the full melody of her voice one day treating of modern pessimism he had draped a cadaverous view of our mortal being in a quotation of the wisdom of the philosopher emperor 'to set one's love upon the swallow is a futility' and she weighing it nodded and replied 'may not the pleasure for us remain if we set our love upon the beauty of the swallow's flight' there was for a girl a bit of idea real idea in that meaning of course the picture we are to have of the bird's wings in motion it has often been admired oh not much of an idea in itself feminine and vague but it was pertinent opportune in this way she stimulated and the girl who could think it and call on a mrs marsett was of the class of mixtures properly to be handed over to chemical experts for analysis she had her aspirations on behalf of her sex she and mademoiselle de seilles discussed them women were to do this do that necessarily a means of instructing a girl to learn what they did do if the lower part of her face had been as reassuring to him as the upper he might have put a reluctant faith in the pure mindedness of these aspirations without reverting to her origin and also to recent rumours of her father and lady grace halley as it was he inquired of the cognizant whether an intellectual precocity devoted by preference to questions affecting the state of women did not rather more than suggest the existence of urgent senses likewise she a girl under twenty had an interest in public matters and she called on a mrs marsett to plead her simplicity was to be absolutely ignorant of her he neighboured sagacity when he pointed that interrogation relating to nesta's precociousness of the intelligence for as they say in dactylomancy the 'psychical' of women are not disposed in their sensitive early days to dwell upon the fortunes of their sex a thought or two turns them facing away with the repugnant shiver they worship at a niche in the wall they cannot avoid imputing some share of foulness to them that are for scouring the chamber and the civilized male keeping his own chamber locked quite shares their pale taper's view the full blooded to the finger tips on the other hand are likely to be drawn to the subject by noble inducement as often as by base nature at flood being the cause in either instance this young nature of the good and the bad is the blood which runs to power of heart as well as to thirsts of the flesh then have men to sound themselves to discover how much of nature their abstract honourable conception or representative eidolon of young women will bear without going to pieces and it will not be much unless they shall have taken instruction from the poet's pen for a view possibly of nature at work to cast the slough when they see her writhing as in her ugliest old throes if they have learnt of nature's priest to respect her they will less distrust those rare daughters of hers who are moved by her warmth to lift her out of slime it is by her own live warmth that it has to be done cold worship at a niche in the wall will not do it well there is an index for the enlargement of your charity but facts were dudley's teachers physically morally mentally he read the world through facts that is to say through the facts he encountered and he was in consequence foredoomed to a succession of bumps all the heavier from his being unlike the horned kind not unimpressible by the hazy things outside his experience even at his darkest over nesta it was his indigestion of the misconduct of her parents which denied to a certain still small advocate within him the right to raise a voice that good fellow struck the attitude for pleading and had to be silent for he was instinct at best a stammering speaker in the court of the wigged facts instinct of this nesta radnor's character would have said a brave word but for her deeds bearing witness to her inheritance of a lawlessly adventurous temperament what to do he was no nearer to an answer when the wintry dusk had fallen on the promenading crowds to do nothing is the wisdom of those who have seen fools perish facts had not taught him that the doing nothing for a length of days after the first shock he sustained was the reason of how it came that nesta knitted closer her acquaintance with the 'agreeable lady' she mentioned in her letter to cronidge those excellent counsellors of a mercantile community gave him no warnings that the 'masterly inactive' part so greatly esteemed by him for the conduct of public affairs might be perilous in dealings with a vivid girl nor a hint that when facts continue undigested it is because the sensations are as violent as hysterical females to block them from the understanding his robin goodfellow instinct tried to be serviceable at a crux of his meditations where edith averst's consumptive brothers waved faded hands at her chances of inheriting largely superb for the chances but what of her offspring and the other was a girl such as the lusty dame dowager of fighting ancestors would have signalled to the heir of the house's honours for the perpetuation of his race no doubt and the venerable dame beautiful in her old lace frame or say foliage of the ages backward temp ed iii inflated him with a thought of her and his readings in modern books on heredity pure blood physical regeneration pronounced approval of nesta radnor and thereupon instinct opened mouth to speak and a lockjaw seized it under that scowl of his presiding mistrust of nature he clung to his mistrust the more because of a warning he had from the silenced natural voice somewhat as we may behold how the conservatism of a class in a world of all the evidences showing that there is no stay to things comes of the intuitive discernment of its finality his mistrust was his own and nesta was not not yet though a step would make her his own instinct prompting to the step was a worthless adviser it spurred him nevertheless he called at the club for his cousin southweare with whom he was not in sympathy and had information that southweare said 'made the girl out all right' girls in these days do things which the sainted stay at homes preceding them would not have dreamed of doing something had occurred relating to major worrell he withdrew miss radnor's name acknowledged himself mistaken or amended his report of her in some way not quite intelligible dudley was accosted by simeon fenellan subsequently by dartrey there was gossip over the latter gentleman's having been up before the magistrate talk of a queer kind of stick and dartrey said laughing to simeon 'rather lucky i bled the rascal' whatever the meaning she nursed one of her adorations for this man who had yesterday apparently joined in a street fray so she partook of the stain of the turbid defacing all these disorderly people at his hotel at breakfast the next morning a newspaper furnished an account of captain dartrey fenellan's participation in the strife after mention of him as nephew of the earl of clanconan 'now a visitor to our town' and his deeds were accordant with his birth such writing was enough to send dudley an eager listener to colney durance what a people mr dartrey fenellan's card compelled dudley presently to receive him dartrey not debarred by considerations that an allusion to miss radnor could be conveyed only in the most delicately obscure manner spared him no more than the plain english of his relations with her requested to come to the club at a certain hour of the afternoon that he might hear major worrell's personal contradiction of scandal involving the young lady's name together with his apology etc dudley declined and he was obliged to do it curtly words were wanting they are hard to find for wounded sentiments rendered complex by an infusion of policy his present mood with the something new to digest held the going to major worrell a wrong step he behaved as if the speaking to dartrey fenellan pledged him hardly less and besides he had a physical abhorrence under dictate of moral reprobation of the broad shouldered sinewy man whose look of wiry alertness pictured the previous day's gory gutters dartrey set sharp eyes on him for an instant bowed and went chapter xxxvi nesta and her father the day of nesta's return was one of a number of late when victor was robbed of his walk westward by lady grace halley who seduced his politeness with her various forms of blandishment to take a seat in her carriage and she was a practical speaker upon her quarter of the world when she had him there perhaps she was right in saying though she had no right to say that he and she together might have the world under their feet it was one of those irritating suggestions which expedite us up to a bald ceiling only to make us feel the gas bladder's tight extension upon emptiness it moved him to examine the poor value of his aim by tying him to the contemptible means one estimate involved the other whichever came first somewhere he had an idea that would lift and cleanse all degradations but it did seem as if he were not enjoying things pleasant enough in the passage of them were barren if not prickly in the retrospect he sprang out at the head of the park for a tramp round it in the gloom of the girdle of lights to recover his deadened relish of the thin phantasmal strife to win an intangible prize his dulled physical system asked as with the sensations of a man at the start from sleep in the hurrying grip of steam what on earth he wanted to get and what was the substance of his gains what if other than a precipitous intimacy a deep crumbling over deeper with a little woman amusing him in remarks of a whimsical nudity hardly more nay not more he said and at the end of twenty paces he saw much more the campaign gathered a circling suggestive brilliancy like the lamps about the winter park the society lured with glitter hooked by greed composed a ravishing picture the little woman was esteemed as a serviceable lieutenant and her hand was a small soft one agreeable to fondle and avaunt but so it is in war we must pay for our allies what if it had been that he and she together with their united powers he dashed the silly vision aside as vainer than one of the bubble empires blown by boys and it broke showing no heart in it his heart was nataly's let colney hint his worst nataly bore the strain always did bear any strain coming in the round of her duties and if she would but walk or if she danced at parties she would scatter the fits of despondency besetting the phlegmatic like this day's breeze the morning fog or as he did with two minutes of the stretch of legs full of the grandeur of that black pit of the benighted london with its ocean voice of the heart at beat along the lighted outer ring victor entered at his old door of the two houses he had knocked into one a surprise for fredi and heard that his girl had arrived in the morning 'and could no more endure her absence from her mammy o' the songful satirical line spouted in him to be flung at his girl as he ran upstairs to the boudoir off the drawing room he peeped in it was dark sensible of presences he gradually discerned a thick blot along the couch to the right of the door and he drew near two were lying folded together mother and daughter he bent over them his hand was taken and pressed by fredi's she spoke she said tenderly 'father' neither of the two made a movement he heard the shivering rise of a sob that fell the dry sob going to the waste breath was nataly's his girl did not speak again he left them he had no thought until he stood in his dressing room when he said 'good' for those two must have been lying folded together during the greater part of the day and it meant that the mother's heart had opened the girl knew her tone 'father' sweet was heavy too with the darkness it came out of so she knew good he clasped them both in his heart tempering his pity of those dear ones with the thought that they were of the sex which finds enjoyment in a day of the mutual tear and envying them he strained at a richness appearing in the sobs of their close union all of his girl's loving soul flew to her mother and naturally she would not be harsh on her father she would say he loved and true he did love he does love loves no woman but the dear mother he flicked a short wring of the hand having taken pressure from an alien woman's before fredi pressed it and absolved himself in the act thinking how little does a woman know how true we can be to her when we smell at a flower here and there there they are stationary women the flowers we the bee and we are faithful in our seeming volatility faithful to the hive and if women are to be stationary the reasoning is not so bad funny however if they here and there imitatively spread a wing and treat men in that way it is a breach of the convention we pay them our homage that they may serve as flowers not to be volatile tempters nataly never had been one of the sort lady grace was no necessity existed for compelling the world to bow to lady grace while on behalf of his nataly he had to victor closed the curtain over a gulf revealed by an invocation of nature and showing the tremendous force he partook of so largely in her motive elements of the devourer horrid to behold when we need a gracious presentation of the circumstances she is a splendid power for as long as we confine her between the banks but she has a passion to discover cracks and if we give her headway she will find one and drive at it and be through uproarious in her primitive licentiousness unless we labour body and soul like dutchmen at the dam here she was and not desired almost detested nature detested it had come about through the battle for nataly chiefly through mrs burman's tenacious hold of the filmy thread she took for life and was enabled to use as a means for the perversion besides bar to the happiness of creatures really living we may well marvel at the fates and tell them they are not moral agents victor's reflections came across colney durance who tripped and stopped them dressed with his customary celerity he waited for nesta to show her the lighted grand double drawing room a further proof of how fortune favoured him she was to be told how he one day expressed a wish for greater space and was informed on the next that the neighbour house was being vacated and the day following he was in treaty for the purchase of it returning from tyrol he found his place habitable nesta came her short look at him was fond her voice not faltering she laid her hand under his arm and walked round the spacious room praising the general design admiring the porcelain the ferns friezes hangings and the grand piano the ebony inlaid music stands the firegrates and plaques the ottomans the tone of neutral colour that as in sound muted splendour he told her it was a reception night with music and added 'i miss my seen anybody lately' 'mr sowerby' said she 'he was to have escorted me back he may have overslept himself' she spoke it plainly when speaking of the dear good ladies she set a gentle humour at play and comforted him as she intended with a souvenir of her lively spirit wanting only in the manner of gaiety he allowed that she could not be quite gay more deeply touched the next minute he felt in her voice in her look in her phrasing of speech an older much older daughter than the fredi whom he had conducted to moorsedge 'kiss me' he said she turned to him full front and kissed his right cheek and left and his forehead saying 'my love my papa my own dear dada' all the words of her girlhood in her new sedateness and smiling like the moral crepuscular of a sunlighted day down a not totally inanimate sunday londen street he strained her to his breast 'mama soon be here' 'soon' that was well and possibly at the present moment applying with her cunning hand the cosmetics and powders he could excuse for a concealment of the traces of grief satisfied in being a superficial observer he did not spy to see more than the world would when nataly entered the dining room at the quiet family dinner she performed her part for his comfort though not prattling and he missed his fredi's delicious warble of the prattle running rill like over our daily humdrum simeon fenellan would have helped then suddenly came enlivenment a recollection of news in the morning's paper 'no harm before fredi my dear she's a young woman now and no harm so to speak at least not against the sanfredini she has donned her name again and a villa on como leaving her 'duque' paragraph from a milanese musical journal no particulars now mark me we shall have her at lakelands in the summer if only we could have her now' 'it would be a pleasure' said nataly her heart had a blow in the thought that a lady of this kind would create the pleasure by not bringing criticism 'the godmother' he glistened upon nesta she gave him low half notes of the little blue butterfly's imitation of the superb contralto and her hand and head at turn to hint the theatrical operatic attitude 'delicious' he cried his eyelids were bedewed at the vision of the three of them planted in the past and here again out of the dark wood where something had required to be said and had been said and all was happily over owing to the goodness and sweetness of the two dear innocents whom heaven bless jealousy of their naturally closer heart at heart had not a whisper for him part of their goodness and sweetness was felt to be in the not excluding him nesta engaged to sing one of the 'old duets with her mother she saw her mother's breast lift in a mechanical effort to try imaginary notes as if doubtful of her capacity more at home in the dumb deep sigh they fell to her mother's heroism made her a sacred woman to the thoughts of the girl overcoming wonderment at the extreme submissiveness she put a screw on her mind to perceive the rational object there might be for causing her mother to go through tortures in receiving and visiting and she was arrested by the louder question whether she could think such a man as her father irrational people with resounding names waves of a steady stream were announced by arlington just as in the days that seemed remote before she went to moorsedge only they were more numerous and some of the titles had ascended a stage there were great lords there were many great ladies and lady grace halley shuffling amid them like a silken shimmer in voluminous robes they crowded about their host where he stood 'he is their law' colney said speaking unintelligibly in the absence of the simeon fenellan regretted so loudly by mr beaves urmsing they had an air of worshipping and he of swimming there were also city magnates and lakelands' neighbours the gentleman representing pride of port sir abraham quatley and colonel corfe sir rodwell and lady blachington mrs fanning mr caddis few young men and maids were seen dr john cormyn came without his wife not mentioning her mrs peter yatt touched the notes for voices at the piano priscilla graves was a vacancy and likewise the rev septimus barmby peridon and catkin and mr pempton took their usual places there was no fluting a famous canadian lady was the principal singer a galician violinist zig zagging extreme extensions and contractions of his corporeal frame in execution and described by colney as 'paganini on wall' failed to supplant durandarte in nesta's memory she was asked by lady grace for the latest of dudley sir abraham quatley named him with handsome emphasis great dames caressed her openly approved shadowed the future place among them victor alluded at night to mrs john cormyn's absence he said 'a homoeopathic doctor's wife' nothing more and by that little he prepared nesta for her mother's explanation the great london people ignorant or not were caught by the strong tide he created and carried on it but there was a bruiting of the secret among their set and the one to fall away from her nataly marvellingly named mrs john cormyn whose marriage was of her making she did not disapprove priscilla's behaviour priscilla had come to her and protesting affection had openly stated that she required time and retirement to recover her proper feelings nataly smiled a melancholy criticism of an inconsequent or capricious woman in relating to nesta certain observations priscilla had dropped upon poor faithful mr pempton because of his concealment from her of his knowledge of things for this faithful gentleman had been one of the few not ignorant the rumour was traceable to the city 'mother we walk on planks' nesta said nataly answered 'you will grow used to it' her mother's habitual serenity in martyrdom was deceiving nesta had a transient suspicion that she had grown from use to like the whirl of company for oblivion in the excitement and as her remembrance of her own station among the crowding people was a hot flush the difference of their feelings chilled her nataly said 'it is to morrow night again we do not rest' she smiled and at once the girl read woman's armour on the dear face and asked herself could i be so brave the question following was a speechless wave that surged at her father she tried to fathom the scheme he entertained the attempt obscured her conception of the man he was she could not grasp him being too young for knowing that young heads cannot obtain a critical hold upon one whom they see grandly succeeding it is the sun's brilliance to their eyes mother and daughter slept together that night and their embrace was their world nesta delighted her father the next day by walking beside him into the city as far as the end of the embankment where the carriage was in waiting with her maid to bring her back and at his mere ejaculation of a wish the hardy girl drove down in the afternoon for the walk home with him lady grace halley was at the office 'i'm an incorrigible stock exchange gambler' she said 'only' victor bade her beware 'mines are undulating in movement and their heights are a preparation for their going down' she said she 'liked a swing' nesta looked at them in turn the day after and the day after lady grace was present she made play with dudley's name this coming into the city daily of a girl for the sake of walking back in winter weather with her father struck her as ambiguous either a jealous foolish mother's device or that of a weak man beating about for protection but the woman of the positive world soon read to the contrary helped a little by the man no doubt she read rather too much to the contrary and took the pedestrian girl for perfect simplicity in her tastes when nesta had so far grown watchful as to feel relieved by the lady's departure her mother without sympathy for the lady was too great of soul for jealousy victor had his nataly before him at a hint from lady grace and he went somewhat further than the exact degree when affirming that nataly could not scheme and was incapable of suspecting nataly could perceive things with a certain accuracy she would not stoop to a meanness 'plot nataly' said he and shrugged in fact the void of plot drama shuffle of excitement reflected upon nataly he might have seen as tragic as ever dripped on stage had he looked but the walk westward with his girl together with pride in a daughter who clove her way through all weathers won his heart to exultation he told her 'fredi does her dada so much good' not telling her in what or opening any passage to the mystery of the man he was she was trying to be a student of life with her eyes down upon hard earth despite of her winged young head she would have compassed him better had he dilated in sublime fashion but he baffled her perusal of a man of power by the simpleness of his enjoyment of small things coming in his way the lighted shops the crowd emergence from the crowd or the meeting near midwinter of a soft warm wind along the embankment and dark thames magnificently coroneted over his grimy flow there is no grasping of one who quickens us his flattery of his girl too restored her broken feeling of personal value it permeated her nourishingly from the natural breath of him that it was at times he touched deep in humaneness and he set her heart leaping on the flash of a thought to lay it bare with the secret it held for his help that was a dream she could more easily have uttered the words to captain dartrey after her remembered abashing holy tremour of the vision of doing it and casting herself on noblest man's compassionateness and her imagined thousand emotions a rolling music within her a wreath of cloudglory in her sky which had as with virgins it may be plighted her body to him for sheer urgency of soul drawn her by a single unwitting to brain conscious in blood shy curl outward of the sheathing leaf to the flowering of woman to him even to the shore of that strange sea where the maid stands choosing this one man for her destiny as in a trance so are these young ones unfolded shade by shade and a shade is all the difference with them they can teach the poet to marvel at the immensity of vitality in 'the shadow of a shade' her father shut the glimpse of a possible speaking to him of mrs marsett with a renewal of his eulogistic allusions to dudley sowerby the 'perfect gentleman good citizen' prospective heir to an earldom besides she bowed to dudley's merits she read off the honorific pedimental letters of a handsome statue for a sign to herself that she passed it she was unjust as victor could feel though he did not know how coldly unjust for among the exorbitant requisitions upon their fellow creatures made by the young is the demand that they be definite no mercy is in them for the transitional and dudley and it was under her influence and painfully not ignobly was in process of development interesting to philosophers if not to maidens victor accused her of paying too much heed to colney durance's epigrams upon their friends he quite joined with his english world in its opinion that epigrams are poor squibs when they do not come out of great guns epigrams fired at a venerable nation are surely the poorest of popgun paper pellets the english kick at the insolence when they are not in the mood for pelleting themselves or when the armed foreigner is overshadowing and braceing colney's pretentious and laboured satiric prose epic of 'the rival tongues' particularly offended him as being a clever aim at no hitting and sustained him inasmuch as it was an acid friend's collapse how could colney expect his english to tolerate such a spiteful diatribe the suicide of dr bouthoin at san francisco was the finishing stroke to the chances of success of the serial although we are promised splendid evolutions on the part of mr semhians who after brilliant achievements with bat and ball abandons those weapons of old england's modern renown for a determined wrestle with our english pronunciation of words and rescue of the spelling of them from the printer his headache over the present treatment of the verb 'to bid' was a quaint beginning for one who had soon to plead before japanese and who acknowledged now 'in contrition of spirit' that in formerly opposing the scheme for an academy he helped to the handing of our noble language to the rapid reporter of news for an apathetic public further he discovered in astonishment the subordination of all literary americans to the decrees of their literary authorities marking a transatlantic point of departure and contrasting ominously with the unruly islanders 'grunting the higgledy piggledy of their various ways in all the porker's gut gamut at the rush to the trough' after a week's privation of bat and ball he is lighted or not a gas jet of satire upon his countrymen as for the 'pathetic sublimity of the funeral of dr bouthoin' victor inveighed against an impious irony in the over dose of the pathos and the same might be suspected in britannia's elegy upon him a strain of hot eulogy throughout mr semhians all but treasonably calls it papboat and brandy 'our english literary diet of the day' stimulating and not nourishing britannia's mournful anticipation that 'the shroud enwinding this my son is mine' should the modern generation depart from the track of him who proved himself the giant in mainly supporting her glory was no doubt a high pitch of the note of conservatism but considering that dr bouthoin 'committed suicide under a depression of mind produced by a surfeit of unaccustomed dishes upon a physical system inspired by the traditions of exercise and no longer relieved by the practice' to translate from dr gannius we are again at war with the writer's reverential tone and we know not what to think except that mr durance was a saturday meat market's butcher in the satiric art nesta found it pleasanter to see him than to hear of his work which to her present feeling was inhuman as little as our native public had she then any sympathy for the working in the idea she wanted throbs visible aims the christian incarnate she would have preferred the tale of slaughter periodically invading all english classes as a flush from the undrained lower vikings all to frigid sterile satire and truly it is not a fruit bearing rod colney had to stand on the defence of it against the damsel's charges he thought the use of the rod while expressing profound regret at a difference of opinion between him and those noble heathens beneficial for boys but in relation to their seniors and particularly for old gentlemen he thought that the sharpest rod to cut the skin was the sole saving of them insensibility to satire he likened to the hard mouthed horse which is doomed to the worser thing in consequence and consequently upon the lack of it and of training to appreciate it he described his country's male venerables as being distinguishable from annuitant spinsters only in presenting themselves forked 'he is unsuccessful and embittered victor said to nesta 'colney will find in the end that he has lost his game and soured himself by never making concessions here's this absurd serial it fails of course and then he has to say it's because he won't tickle his english won't enter into a frowzy complicity with their tastes' 'but i think of skepsey honest creatures respect mr durance and he is always ready to help them' said nesta 'if he can patronize' 'does he patronize me dada' 'you are one of his exceptions marry a title and live in state and then hear him i am successful and the result of it is that he won't acknowledge wisdom in anything i say or do he will hardly acknowledge the success it is a dirty road to success he says so that if successful i must have rolled myself in mire i compelled him to admit he was wrong about your being received at moorsedge a bit of a triumph' nesta's walks with her father were no loss of her to nataly the girl came back to her bearing so fresh and so full a heart and her father was ever prouder of her he presented new features of her in his quotations of her sayings thoughtful sayings 'i declare she helps one to think' he said 'it 's not precocity it 's healthy inquiry she brings me nearer ideas of my own not yet examined than any one else does i say what a wife for a man' 'she takes my place beside you dear now i am not quite strong' said nataly 'you have not seen' 'dudley sowerby he's at cronidge i believe his elder brother's in a bad way bad business this looking to a death' nataly eyes revealed a similar gulf let it be cast on society then a society opposing nature forces us to these murderous looks upon impediments but what of a society in the dance with nature victor did not approve of that he began under the influence of nesta's companionship to see the goddess nature there is in a chastened nature and this view shook the curtain covering his lost idea he felt sure he should grasp it soon and enter into its daylight a muffled voice within him said that he was kept waiting to do so by the inexplicable tardiness of a certain one to rise ascending to her spiritual roost she was now harmless to strike themison carling jarniman even the rev groseman buttermore had been won to the cause of humanity her ascent considering her inability to do further harm below was most mysteriously delayed owing to it in a manner almost as mysterious he was kept crossing a bridge having a slippery bit on it thanks to his gallant fredi he had found his feet again but there was a bruise where to his honour he felt tenderest and fredi away he might be down again for no love of a slippery bit proved slippery one might guess by a predecessor or two ta ta ta to and mum still in justice to the little woman she had been serviceable she would be still more so if a member of parliament now on his back here we are with the murder eye again nesta's never speaking of lakelands clouded him a little as an intimation of her bent of mind 'and does my girl come to her dada to day' he said on the fifth morning since her return prepared with a villanous resignation to hear that this day she abstained though he had the wish for her coming 'why don't you know' said she 'we all meet to have tea in mr durance's chambers and i walk back with you and there we are joined by mama and we are to have a feast of literary celebrities' 'colney's selection of them and simeon fenellan i hope perhaps dartrey perhaps eh' she reddened so dudley sowerby's unspoken name could bring the blush to her cheeks dudley had his excuses in his brother's condition his father's health too was but this was dudley calculating where there are coronets calculations of this sort must needs occur just as where there are complications odd one fancies it that we walking along the pavement of civilized life should be perpetually summoning orcus to our aid for the sake of getting a clear course 'and supposing a fog my dearie' he said 'the daughter in search of her father carries a lamp to light her to him through densest fogs as well as over deserts' etc she declaimed a long sentence to set the ripple running in his features and when he left the room for a last word with armandine she flung arms round her mother's neck murmuring 'mother mother' a cry equal to 'i am sure i do right' and understood so by nataly approving it she too on the line of her instinct without an object in sight chapter xxxvii the mother the daughter taking nesta's hand on her entry into his chambers with her father colney durance bowed over it and kissed it the unusual performance had a meaning she felt she was praised it might be because she made herself her father's companion 'i can't persuade him to put on a great coat' she said 'you would defeat his aim at the particular waistcoat of his ambition' said colney goaded to speak not anxious to be heard he kept her beside him leading her about for introductions to multiform celebrities of both sexes among them the gentleman editing the magazine which gave out serially the rival tongues and there was talk of a dragon throated public's queer appetite in letters the pained editor deferentially smiled at her cheerful mention of delphica 'in book form perhaps' he remarked with plaintive' resignation adding 'you read it' and a lady exclaimed 'we all read it' but we are the elect who see signification and catch flavour and we are reminded of an insatiable monster how sometimes capricious is his gorge 'he may happen to be in the humour for a shaking' colney's poor consolation it was to say of the prospects of his published book for the funny monster has been known to like a shaking 'he takes it kinder tickled' said fenellan joining the group and grasping nesta's hand with a warmth that thrilled her and set her guessing 'a taste of his favourite cayenne lollypop colney it fetches the tear he loves to shed or it gives him digestive heat in the bag of his literary receptacle fearfully relaxed and enormous and no wonder his is to lie him down on notion of the attitude for reading his back and he has in a jiffy the funnel of the libraries inserted into his mouth and he feels the publishers pouring their gallons through it unlimitedly never crying out which he can't only swelling which he's obliged to do with a non nutritious inflation and that's his intellectual enjoyment bearing a likeness to the horrible old torture of the baillir d'eau and he's doomed to perish in the worst book form of dropsy you my dear colney have offended his police or excise who stand by the funnel in touch with his palate to make sure that nothing above proof is poured in and there's your misfortune he's not half a bad fellow you find when you haven't got to serve him' 'superior to his official parasites one supposes' colney murmured the celebrities were unaffectedly interested in a literary failure having certain merits they discussed it to compliment the crownless author and the fervider they the more was he endowed to read the meanness prompting the generosity publication of a book is the philosopher's lantern upon one's fellows colney was caught away from his private manufactory of acids by hearing simeon fenellan relate to victor some of the recent occurrences at brighton simeon's tone was unsatisfying colney would have the word he was like steel on the grindstone for such a theme of our national grotesque sublime 'that demerara supple jack victor don't listen to simeon he's a man of lean narrative fit to chronicle political party wrangles and such like crop of carcase prose this is epical in drink we have old england's organic epic greeks and trojans parliamentary olympus ennobled brewers nasal fanatics all the machinery to hand keep a straight eye on the primary motives of man you'll own the english produce the material for proud verse they're alive there dartrey's demerara makes a pretty episode of the battle i haven't seen it if it's possible to look on it but i hear it is flexible of a vulgar appearance in repose jove's lightning at one time the thong of aeacus at another observe dartrey marching off to the station for the purpose of laying his miraculous weapon across the shoulders of a son of mars who had offended but we have his name my dear victor his name simeon worrell a major worrell his offence being probably that he obtained military instruction in the service and left it at his convenience for our poor patch and tatter british army to take in his place another young student who'll grow up to do similarly and dartrey we assume is off to stop that system you behold sir dartrey twirling the weapon in preparatory fashion because he is determined we shall have an army of trained officers instead of infant amateurs heading heroic louts not a thought of beer in dartrey always unpatriotic you 'll say plato entreats his absent mistress to fix eyes on a star eyes on beer for the uniting of you english i tell you no poetic fiction seeing him on his way thus terribly armed and knowing his intent venus to shield a former favourite servant of mars conjured the most diverting of interventions in the shape of a young woman in a poke bonnet and skepsey her squire marching with a dozen or so informing bedevilled mankind of the hideousness of our hymnification when it is not under secluding sanction of the edifice and challengeing criticism and that was hard by and real english in the form of bludgeons wielded by a battalion of the national idol bungay beervat's boys and they fell upon the hymners here you fill in with pastoral similes they struck the maid adored by skepsey and that was the blow which slew them our little man drove into the press with a pair of fists able to do their work a valiant skiff upon a sea of enemies he was having it on the nob and suddenly the demerara lightened it flailed to thresh enough to say brains would have come the bungays made a show of fight no lack of blood in them to stock a raw shilling's worth or gush before achilles rageing you perceive the picture you can almost sing the ballad we want only a few names of the fallen it was the carving of a maitre chef according to skepsey right left and point with supreme precision they fell accurately sliced from the joint having done with them dartrey tossed the demerara to skepsey and washed his hands of battle and he let his major go unscathed phlebotomy sufficient for the day' nesta's ears hummed with the name of major worrell 'skepsey did come back to london with a rather damaged frontispiece' victor said 'he can't have joined those people' 'they may suit one of your militant peacemakers' interposed fenellan 'the most placable creatures alive and the surest for getting up a shindy' 'suit him they're the scandal of our streets' victor was pricked with a jealousy of them for beguiling him of his trusty servant 'look at your country see where it shows its vitality' said colney 'you don't see elsewhere any vein in movement movement' he harped on the word victor constantly employed to express the thing he wanted to see 'think of that when the procession sets your teeth on edge they're honest foes of vice and they move in england pulpit preaching has no effect for gross maladies gross remedies you may judge of what you are by the quality of the cure puritanism i won't attempt to paint it would barely be decent but compare it with the spectacle of english frivolity and you'll admit it to be the best show you make it may still be the saving of you on the level of the orderly ox i 've not observed that it aims at higher and talking of the pulpit barmby is off to the east has accepted a shoreditch curacy skepsey tells me' 'so there's the reason for our not seeing him' victor turned to nesta 'papa you won't be angry with skepsey if he has joined those people' said nesta 'i'm sure he thinks of serving his country mr durance' colney smiled on her 'and you too' 'if women knew how' 'they're hitting on more ways at present than the men in england' 'but mr durance it speaks well for england when they're allowed the chance here' 'good' fenellan exclaimed 'and that upsets his placement of the modern national genders germany masculine france feminine old england what remains' victor ruffled and reddened on his shout of 'neuter' their circle widened nesta knew she was on promotion by her being led about and introduced to ladies they were encouraging with her one of them a mrs marina floyer had recently raised a standard of feminine insurrection she said 'i hear your praises from mr durance he rarely praises you have shown capacity to meditate on the condition of women he says' nesta drew a shorter breath with a hope at heart she speculated in the dark as to whether her aim to serve and help was not so friendless and did mr durance approve but surely she stood in a glorious england if there were men and women to welcome a girl to their councils oh that is the broad free england where gentlemen and gentlewomen accept of the meanest aid to cleanse the land of its iniquities and do not suffer shame to smite a young face for touching upon horrors with a pure design she cried in her bosom i feel she had no other expression for that which is as near as great natures may come to the conceiving of the celestial spirit from an emissary angel and she trembled the fire ran through her it seemed to her that she would be called to help or that certainly they were nearing to an effacement of the woefullest of evils and if not helping it would still be a blessedness for her to kneel thanking heaven society was being attacked and defended she could but studiously listen her father was listening the assailant was a lady and she had a hearing although she treated society as a discrowned monarch on trial for an offence against a more precious viz the individual cramped by brutish laws the individual with the ideas of our time righteously claiming expansion out of the clutches of a narrow old world disciplinarian that giant hypocrite she flung the gauntlet at externally venerable institutions and she had a hearing where horrification execration the foul furies of conservatism would in a shortly antecedent day have been hissing and snakily lashing hounding her to expulsion mrs marina floyer gravely seconded her colney did the same victor turned sharp on him 'yes' colney said 'we unfold the standard of extremes in this country to get a single step taken that's how we move we threaten death to get footway now mark society's errors will be admitted' a gentleman spoke he began by admitting society's errors nevertheless it so distinctly exists for the common good that we may say of society in relation to the individual it is the body to the soul we may wash trim purify but we must not maim it the assertion of our individuality in opposition to the government of society this existing society is a toss of the cap for the erasure of our civilization et caetera platitudes can be of intense interest if they approach our case but if you please we ask permission to wash trim purify and we do not get it but you have it because we take it at our peril and you who are too cowardly to grant or withhold call up the revolutionary from the pits by your slackness etc there was a pretty hot debate both assailant and defendant to victor's thinking spoke well and each the right thing and he could have made use of both but he could answer neither he beat about for the cause of this deficiency and discovered it in his position mentally he was on the side of society yet he was annoyed to find the attack was so easily answerable when the defence unfolded but it was absurd to expect it would not be and in fact a position secretly rebellious is equal to water on the brain for stultifying us before the controversy was over a note in nataly's handwriting called him home she wrote 'make my excuses c d will give nesta and some lady dinner a visitor here come alone and without delay quite well robust impatient to consult with you nothing else' nesta was happy to stay and victor set forth the visitor plainly dudley nataly's trusting the girl to the chance of some lady being present was unlike her dudley might be tugging at the cord and the recent conversation upon society rendered one of its gilt pillars particularly estimable a person in the debate had declared this modern protest on behalf of individualism to represent society's criminal trial and it is likely to be a long one and good for the world that we see such a trial well said or not undoubtedly society is an old criminal not much more advanced than the state of spiritual worship where bloody sacrifice was offered to a hungry lord but it has a case for pleading we may liken it as we have it now to the bumping lumberer's raft suitable along torrent waters until we come to smoother are we not on waters of a certain smoothness at the reflecting level enough to justify demands for a vessel of finer design if society is to subsist it must have the human with the logical argument against the cry of the free flags instead of presenting a block's obtuseness that you need not hesitate to believe will be rolled downward and disintegrated sooner than later a society based on the logical concrete of humane considerateness a society prohibiting to mrs burman her wielding of a life long rod the personal element again to confuse inquiry and skepsey and barmby both of them bent on doing work without inquiry of any sort they were enviable they were good fellows victor clung to the theme because it hinted of next door to his lost idea he rubbed the back of his head fancying a throb there are civilized creatures incapable of abstract thought when their social position is dubious for if so we never can be quit of those we forsake apparently mrs burman's unfathomed power lay in her compelling him to summon the devilish in himself and play upon the impish in society that he might overcome her victor's house door stopped this current nataly took his embrace 'nothing wrong' he said and saw the something it was a favourable moment to tell her what she might not at another time regard as a small affair 'news in the city to day of that south london borough being vacated quatley urges me a death again i saw pempton too will you credit me when i tell you he carries his infatuation so far that he has been investing in japanese and chinese loans because they are less meat eaters than others and vegetarians are more stable and outlast us all dudley the visitor' 'mr sowerby has been here' she said in a shaking low voice victor held her hand and felt a squeeze more nervous than affectionate 'to consult with me' she added 'my maid will go at ten to bring nesta mr durance i can count on to see her safe home ah' she wailed victor nodded saying 'i guess and my love you will receive mrs john cormyn to morrow morning i can't endure gaps gaps in our circle must never be do i guess i spoke to colney about bringing her home' nataly sighed 'ah make what provision we will evil mr sowerby has had a great deal to bear' 'a worldling may think so' her breast heaved and the wave burst but her restraining of tears froze her speech 'victor our nesta mr sowerby is unable to explain and how the miss duvidneys at that brighton' the voice he heard was not his darling's deep rich note it had dropped to toneless hoarseness 'she has been permitted to make acquaintance she has been seen riding with she has called upon oh it is one of those abandoned women in her house our girl our nesta she was insulted by a man in the woman's house she is talked of over brighton the mother the daughter and grant me this that never was girl more carefully never till she was taken from me oh do not forget you will defend me you will say that her mother did with all her soul strive it is not a rumour mr sowerby has had it confirmed' a sob caught her voice victor's hands caressed to console 'dudley does not propose to' 'nesta must promise but how it happened how an acquaintance with contact with oh cruel' each time she ceased speaking the wrinkles of a shiver went over her and the tone was of tears coming but she locked them in 'an accident' said victor 'some misunderstanding there can't be harm of course she promises hasn't to promise how could a girl distinguish he does not cast blame on her' 'dear if you would go down to dartrey to morrow he knows it is over the clubs there he will tell you before a word to nesta innocent yes mr sowerby has not to be assured of that ignorant of the character of the dreadful woman ah if i could ever in anything think her ignorant she frightens me mr sowerby is indulgent he does me justice my duty to her i must defend myself has been my first thought i said in my prayers she at least we have to see the more than common reasons why she of all girls should he did not hint it he was delicate her name must not be public' 'yes yes dudley is without parallel as a gentleman' said victor 'it does not suit me to hear the word indulgent my dear if you were down there you would discover that the talk was the talk of two or three men seeing our girl ride by and she did ride with a troop why we've watched them along the parade often clear as day how it happened i'll go down early to morrow' he fancied nataly was appeased and even out of this annoyance there was the gain of her being won to favour dudley's hitherto but tolerated suit nataly also had the fancy that the calm following on her anguish was a moderation of it she was kept strung to confide in her girl by the recent indebtedness to her for words heavenly in the strengthening comfort they gave but no sooner was she alone than her torturing perplexities and her abasement of the hours previous to victor's coming returned for a girl of nesta's head could not be deceived she had come home with a woman's intelligence of the world hard knowledge of it a knowledge drawn from foul wells the unhappy mother imagined she dreaded to probe to the depth of it she had in her wounded breast the world's idea that corruption must come of the contact with impurity nataly renewed her cry of despair 'the mother the daughter' her sole revelation of the heart's hollows in her stammered speaking to victor she thanked heaven for the loneliness of her bed where she could repeat 'the mother the daughter' hearing the world's words the daughter excused by reason of her having such a mother the mother unpitied for the bruiting of her brazen daughter's name but both alike consigned to the corners of the world's dust heaps she cried out that her pride was broken her pride her last support of life had gone to pieces the tears she restrained in victor's presence were called on to come now and she had none it might be that she had not strength for weeping she was very weak rising from bed to lock her door against nesta's entry to the room on her return at night she could hardly stand a chill and a clouding overcame her the quitted bed seemed the haven of a drifted wreck to reach victor tried the handle of a locked door in the dark of the early winter morning 'the mother the daughter' had swung a pendulum for some time during the night in him too he would rather have been subjected to the spectacle of tears than have heard that toneless voice as it were the dry torrent bed rolling blocks instead of melodious if afflicting waters he told nesta not to disturb her mother and murmured of a headache 'though upon my word the best cure for mama would be a look into fredi's eyes' he said embracing his girl quite believing in her just a little afraid of her chapter xxxviii nataly nesta and dartrey fenellan pleasant things that come to us too late for our savour of the sweetness in them toll ominously of life on the last walk to its end yesterday before dudley sowerby's visit nataly would have been stirred where the tears we shed for happiness or repress at a flattery dwell when seeing her friend mrs john cormyn enter her boudoir and hearing her speak repentantly most tenderly mrs john said 'you will believe i have suffered dear i am half my weight i do think' and she did not set the smile of responsive humour moving although these two ladies had a key of laughter between them nataly took her kiss held her hand and at the parting kissed her she would rather have seen her friend than not so far she differed from a corpse but she was near the likeness to the dead in the insensibility to any change of light shining on one who best loved darkness and silence she cried to herself wilfully that her pride was broken as women do when they spurn at the wounding of a dignity they cannot protect and die to see bleeding for in it they live the cry came of her pride unbroken sore bruised and after a certain space for recovery combative she said any expiation i could offer where i did injury i would not refuse i would humble myself and bless heaven for being able to pay my debt what i can of it all i contend against is injustice and she sank into sensational protests of her anxious care of her daughter too proud to phrase them her one great affliction the scourging affliction of her utter loneliness an outcast from her family daily and she knew not how more shut away from the man she loved now shut away from her girl seemed under the hand of the angel of god the abandonment of her by friends was merely the light to show it midday's post brought her a letter from priscilla graves entreating to be allowed to call on her next day we are not so easily cast off nataly said bitterly in relation to the lady whose offending had not been so great she wrote 'come if sure that you sincerely wish to' having fasted she ate at lunch in her dressing room with some taste of the food haunted by an accusation of gluttony because of her eating at all and a vile confession that she was enabled to eat owing to the receipt of priscilla's empty letter for her soul's desire was to be doing a deed of expiation and the macerated flesh seemed her assurance to herself of the courage to make amends i must have some strength she said wearifully in apology for the morsel consumed nesta's being in the house with her became an excessive irritation doubts of the girl's possible honesty to speak a reptile truth under question amazement at her boldness to speak it hatred of the mouth that could and loathing of the words the theme and abomination of herself for conjuring fictitious images to rouse real emotions all ran counterthreads that produced a mad pattern in the mind affrighting to reason and then for its preservation reason took a superrational leap and ascribed the terrible injustice of this last cruel stroke to the divine scourge recognized divine by the selection of the mortal spot for chastisement she clasped her breast and said it is mortal and that calmed her she said smiling i never felt my sin until this blow came therefore the blow was proved divine ought it not to be welcomed and she appearing no better than one of those the leprous of the sex and brought to acknowledgement of the likeness by her daughter nataly drank the poison distilled from her exclamations and was ice she had denied herself to nesta's redoubled petition nesta knocking at the door a third time and calling tore the mother two ways to have her girl on her breast or snap their union in a word with an edge she heard the voice of dartrey fenellan he was admitted 'no dear' she said to nesta and nesta's 'my own mother' consentingly said in tender resignation as she retired sprang a stinging tear to the mother's eyelids dartrey looked at the door closing on the girl 'is it a very low woman' nataly asked him in a church whisper with a face abashed 'it is not' said he quick to meet any abruptness 'she must be cunning' 'in the ordinary way we say it of puss before the hounds' 'to deceive a girl like nesta' 'she has done no harm' 'dartrey you speak to a mother you have seen the woman she is ah' 'she is womanly womanly' 'quite one of those' 'my dear soul you can't shake them off in that way she is one of us if we have the class we can't escape from it they are not to bear all the burden because they exist we are the bigger debtors i tell you she is womanly' 'it sounds like horrid cynicism' 'friends of mine would abuse it for the reverse' 'do not make me hate your chivalry this woman is a rod on my back provided only she has not dropped venom into nesta's mind' 'don't fear' 'can you tell me you think she has done no harm to my girl' 'to nesta herself not any not to a girl like your girl' 'to my girl's name speak at once but i know she has she induced nesta to go to her house my girl was insulted in this woman's house' dartrey's forehead ridged with his old fury and a gust of present contempt 'i can tell you this that the fellow who would think harm of it knowing the facts 's not worthy of touching the tips of the fingers of your girl' 'she is talked of' 'a good looking girl out riding with a handsome woman on a parade of idlers' 'the woman is notorious' nataly said it shivering he shook his head 'not true' 'she has an air of a lady' 'she sits a horse well' 'would she to any extent deceive me impose on me here' 'no' 'ah' nataly moaned 'but what' said dartrey 'there was no pretence her style is not worse than that of some we have seen there was no effort to deceive the woman's plain for you and me to read she has few of the arts one or two tricks if you like and these were not needed for use there are women who have them and have not been driven or let slip into the wilderness' 'yes i know those ideas of yours' nataly had once admired him for his knightliness toward the weakest women and the women underfoot 'you have spoken to this woman she boasted of acquaintance with nesta' 'she thanked god for having met her' 'is it one of the hysterical creatures' mrs marsett appeared fronting dartrey he laughed to himself 'a clever question there is a leaning to excitement of manner at times it 's not hysteria allow for her position' nataly took the unintended blow and bowed to it and still more harshly said 'what rank of life does the woman come from' 'the class educated for a skittish career by your popular stage and your book stalls i am not precise' 'leave mr durance is she in any degree commonly well bred behaviour talk her english' 'i trench on mr durance in replying her english is passable you may hear' 'everywhere of course and this woman of slipshod english and excited manners imposed upon nesta' 'it would not be my opinion' 'did not impose on her' 'not many would impose on nesta radnor for long' 'think what that says dartrey' 'you have had a detestable version of the story' 'because an excited creature thanks god to you for having met her' 'she may she's a better woman for having met her don't suppose we're for supernatural conversions the woman makes no show of that but she has found a good soul among her sex her better self in youth as one guesses and she is grateful feels farther from exile in consequence she has found a lady to take her by the hand not a common case she can never go to the utterly bad after knowing nesta i forget if she says it i say it you have heard the story from one of your conventional gentlemen' 'a true gentleman i have reason to thank him he has not your ideas on these matters dartrey he is very sensitive on nesta's behalf' 'with reference to marriage i'll own i prefer another kind of gentleman i 've had my experience of that kind of gentleman many of the kind have added their spot to the outcasts abominated for uncleanness in holy unction many i won't say all but men who consent to hear black words pitched at them and help to set good women facing away from them are pious dolts or rascal dogs of hypocrites they if you'll let me quote colney durance to you to day and how is it he is not in favour they are tempting the lord to turn the pillars of society into pillars of salt down comes the house and priests can rest in sight of it they ought to be dead against the sanctimony that believes it excommunicates when it curses the relationship is not dissolved so cheaply though our society affects to think it is barmby's off to the east end of this london victor informs me good fellow and there he'll be groaning over our vicious nature nature is not more responsible for vice than she is for inhumanity both bad but the latter's the worse of the two' nataly interposed 'i see the contrast and see whom it's to strike' dartrey sent a thought after his meaning 'hardly that let it stand he 's only one with the world but he shares the criminal infamy for crushing hope out of its frailest victims they're that no sentiment what a world too look behind it brutal because brutish the world may go hang we expect more of your gentleman to hear of nesta down there and doubt that she was about good work and come complaining he had the privilege of speaking to her remonstrating if he wished there are men who think men the plucking of sinners out of the mire a dirty business they depute it to certain officials and your women it's the taste of the world to have them educated so that they can as little take the humane as the enlightened view except by the way sometimes in secret they have a sisterly breast in secret they do occasionally think as they feel in public the brass mask of the idol they call propriety commands or supplies their feelings and thoughts i won't repeat my reasons for educating them differently at present we have but half the woman to go through life with and thank you' dartrey stopped 'don't be disturbed' he added 'there's no ground for alarm not of any sort' nataly said 'what name' 'her name is mrs marsett' 'the name is' 'captain marsett will be sir edward he came back from the continent yesterday' a fit of shuddering seized nataly it grew in violence and speaking out of it with a pause of sickly empty chatter of the jaws she said 'always that name' 'before the maiden name may have been or not' 'not you say' 'i don't accurately know' dartrey sprang to his legs 'my dear soul dear friend one of the best if we go on fencing in the dark there'll be wounds your way of taking this affair disappointed me now i understand it's the disease of a trouble to fly at comparisons no real one exists i wished to protect the woman from a happier sister's judgement to save you from alarm concerning nesta quite groundless if you'll believe me come there's plenty of benevolent writing abroad on these topics now facts are more looked at and a good woman may join us in taking them without the horrors and loathings of angels rather too much given to claim distinction from the luckless a girl who's unprotected may go through adventures before she fixes and be a creature of honest intentions better if protected we all agree better also if the world did not favour the girl's multitude of enemies your system of not dealing with facts openly is everyway favourable to them i am glad to say victor recognizes what corruption that spread of wealth is accountable for and now i must go and have a talk with the what a change from the blue butterfly eaglet i ought to have said i dine with you for victor may bring news' 'would anything down there be news to you dartrey' 'he makes it wherever he steps' 'he would reproach me for not detaining you tell nesta i have to lie down after talking she has a child's confidence in you' a man of middle age he said to himself it is the particular ejaculation which tames the senior whose heart is for a dash of holiday he resolved that the mother might trust to the discretion of a man of his age and he went down to nesta grave with the weight his count of years should give him seeing her the light of what he now knew of her was an ennobling equal to celestial for this fair girl was one of the active souls of the world his dream to discover in woman's form she the little nesta the tall pure eyed girl before him was young though she was already in the fight with evil a volunteer of the army of the simply christian the worse for it sowerby would think so she was not of the order of young women who in sheer ignorance or in voluntary consent to the peace with evil and are kept externally safe from the smirch of evil and are the ornaments of their country glory of a country prizing ornaments higher than qualities dartrey could have been momentarily incredulous of things revealed by mrs marsett not incredulous of the girl's heroism that capacity he caught and gauged in her shape of head cut of mouth and the measurements he was accustomed to make at a glance but her beauty or the form of beauty which was hers argued against her having set foot of thought in our fens here and far there we meet a young saint vowed to service along by those dismal swamps and saintly she looks not of this earth nesta was of the blooming earth where do we meet girl or woman comparable to garden flowers who can dare to touch to lift the spotted of her sex he was puzzled by nesta's unlikeness in deeds and in aspect he remembered her eyes on the day when he and colonel sudley beheld her presently he was at quiet grapple with her mind his doubts cleared off then the question came how could a girl of heroical character be attached to the man sowerby that entirely passed belief and was it possible his wishes beguiled his hearing her tones were singularly vibrating they talked for a while before drawing a deep breath she said 'i fancy i am in disgrace with my mother' 'you have a suspicion why' said he 'i have' she would have told him why the words were at her lips previous to her emotion on the journey home the words would have come out they were arrested by the thunder of the knowledge that the nobleness in him drawing her to be able to speak of scarlet matter was personally worshipped he attributed the full rose upon her cheeks to the forbidding subject to spare pain he said 'no misunderstanding with the dear mother will last the day through can i help' 'oh captain dartrey' 'drop the captain dartrey will do' 'how could i' 'you're not wanting in courage nesta' 'hardly for that' 'by and by then' 'though i could not say mr fenellan' 'you see dartrey it must be' 'if i could' 'but the fellow is not a captain and he is a friend an old friend very old friend he'll be tipped with grey in a year or two' 'i might be bolder then' 'imagine it now there is no disloyalty in your calling your friends by their names' her nature rang to the implication 'i am not bound' dartrey hung fast speculating on her visibly 'i heard you were' 'no i must be free' 'it is not an engagement' 'will you laugh i have never quite known my father desired it and my desire is to please him i think i am vain enough to think i read through blinds and shutters the engagement what there was has been to my reading broken more than once i have not considered it to settle my thoughts on it until lately and now i may suspect it to be broken i have given cause if it is known there is no blame elsewhere i am not unhappy captain dartrey' 'captain by courtesy very well tell me how nesta judges the engagement to be broken' she was mentally phrasing before she said 'absence' 'he was here yesterday' all that the visit embraced was in her expressive look as of sight drawing inward like our breath in a spell of wonderment 'then i understand it enlightens me my own mother my poor mother he should have come to me i was the guilty person not she and she is the sufferer that if in life were direct retribution but the very meaning of having a heart is to suffer through others or for them' 'you have soon seen that dear girl' said dartrey 'so my own mother and loving me as she does blames me' nesta sighed she took a sharp breath 'you do you blame me too' he pressed her hand enamoured of her instantaneous divination and heavenly candour but he was admonished that to speak high approval would not be honourable advantage taken of the rival condemning and he said 'blame some think it is not always the right thing to do the right thing i've made mistakes with no bad design a good mother's view is not often wrong' 'you pressed my hand' she murmured that certainly had said more 'glad to again' he responded it was uttered airily and was meant to be as lightly done nesta did not draw back her hand 'i feel strong when you press it' her voice wavered and as when we hear a flask sing thin at the filling ceased upon evidence of a heart surcharged how was he to relax the pressure he had to give her the strength she craved and he vowed it should be but for half a minute half a minute longer her tears fell she eyed him steadily she had the look of sunlight in shower 'oldish men are the best friends for you i suppose' he said and her gaze turned elusive phrases to vapour he was compelled to see the fiery core of the raincloud lighting it for a revealment that allowed as little as it retained of a shadow of obscurity the sight was keener than touch and the run of blood with blood to quicken slumbering seeds of passion but here is the place of broken ground and tangle which calls to honourable men not bent on sport to be wary to guard the gunlock he stopped the word at his mouth it was not in him to stop or moderate the force of his eyes she met them with the slender unbendingness that was her own a feminine of inspirited manhood there was no soft expression only the direct shot of light on both sides conveying as much as is borne from sun to earth from earth to sun and when such an exchange has come between the two they are past plighting they are the wedded one nesta felt it without asking whether she was loved she was his she had not a thought of the word of love or the being beloved showers of painful blissfulness went through her as the tremours of a shocked frame while she sat quietly showing scarce a sign and after he had let her hand go she had the pressure on it the quivering intense of the moment of his eyes and grasp was lord of her lord of the day and of all days coming that is how love slays death never did girl so give her soul she would have been the last to yield it unreservedly to a man untrusted for the character she worshipped but she could have given it to dartrey despite his love of another because it was her soul without any of the cravings except to bestow he perceived that he had been carried on for the number of steps which are countless miles and do not permit the retreat across the desert behind and he was in some amazement at himself remindful of the different nature of our restraining power when we have a couple playing on it yet here was this girl who called him up to the heights of young life again and a brave girl and she bled for the weak had no shrinking from the women underfoot for the reason that she was a girl sovereignly pure angelically tender was there a point of honour to hold him back nataly entered the room she kissed nesta and sat silent 'mother will you speak of me to him if i go out' nesta said 'we have spoken' her mother replied vexed by the unmaidenly allusion to that theme she would have asked how did you guess i knew of it but that the why should i speak of you to him struck the louder note in her bosom and then what is there that this girl cannot guess filled the mother's heart with apprehensive dread and an inward cry what things will she not set going to have them discussed and the appalling theme sitting offensive though draped in their midst was taken for a proof of the girl's unblushingness after standing as one woman against the world so long nataly was relieved to be on the side of a world now convictedly unjust to her in the confounding of her with the shameless her mind had taken the brand of that thought and nesta had brought her to it and dudley sowerby a generous representative of the world had kindly having the deputed power to do so sustained her only partially blaming nesta not casting them off as the world with which nataly felt under a sense of the protection calling up all her gratitude to young dudley would have approved his doing she was passing through a fit of the cowardice peculiar to the tediously strained who are being more than commonly tried persecuted as they say when they are not supplicating their tyrannical authority for aid the world will continue to be indifferent to their view of it and behaviour toward it until it ceases to encourage the growth of hypocrites these are moments when the faces we are observing drop their charm showing us our perversion internal if we could but reflect to see it very many thousand times above dudley sowerby nataly ranked dartrey fenellan and still she looked at him where he sat beside nesta ungenially critical of the very features jealously in the interests of dudley and recollecting too that she had once prayed for one exactly resembling dartrey fenellan to be her nesta's husband but as she would have said that was before the indiscretion of her girl had shown her to require for her husband a man whose character and station guaranteed protection instead of inciting to rebellion and dartrey the loved and prized was often in the rebel ranks he was dissatisfied with matters as they are was restless for action angry with a country denying it to him he made enemies he would surely bring down inquiries about nesta's head and cause the forgotten or quiescent to be stirred he would scarcely be the needed hand for such a quiver of the lightnings as nesta was dartrey read nataly's brows this unwonted uncomeliness of hers was an indication to one or other of our dusky pits not a revealing chapter xxxix a chapter in the shadow of mrs marsett he read her more closely when arlington brought in the brown paper envelope of the wires to which the mate of victor ought to have become accustomed she took it her eyelids closed and her features were driven to whiteness 'only these telegrams' she said in apology 'lakelands on fire' dartrey murmured to nesta and she answered 'i should not be sorry' nataly coldly asked her why she would not be sorry dartrey interposed 'i'm sure she thinks lakelands worries her mother' 'that ranks low among the worries' nataly sighed opening the envelope nesta touched her arm 'mother even before captain dartrey if you will let me' she turned to him 'before' at the end of her breath she said 'dartrey fenellan you shall see my whole heart mother' her mother looked from her at him 'victor returns by the last train he telegraphs that he dines with ' she handed the paper to dartrey 'marsett' he read aloud and she flushed she was angry with him for not knowing that the name was a term of opprobrium flung at her 'it's to tell you he has done what he thought good' said dartrey 'in other words as i interpret he has completed his daughter's work so we won't talk about it till he comes you have no company this evening' 'oh there is a pause to night it's nearly as unceasing as your brother simeon's old french lady in the ronde with her young bridegroom till they danced her to pieces i do get now and then an hour's repose' nataly added with a vision springing up of the person to whom the story had applied 'my dear you are a good girl to call me dartrey' the owner of the name said to nesta nataly saw them both alert in the terrible manner peculiar to both for the directest of the bare statements she could have protested that her love of truth was on an equality with theirs and certainly that her regard for decency was livelier pass the deficiency in a man but a girl who could speak by allusion of mrs marsett of the existence of a mrs marsett in the presence of a man and he excusing encouraging and this girl her own girl it seemed to her that the world reeled she could hardly acknowledge the girl save under the penitential admission of her sin's having found her out she sent nesta to her room when they went upstairs to dress unable to endure her presence after seeing her show a placid satisfaction at dartrey's nod to the request for him to sleep in the house that night it was not at all a gleam of pleasure hardly an expression it was a manner of saying one drop more in my cup of good fortune an absurd and an offensive exhibition of silly optimism of the young blind that they are for were it known and surely the happening of it would be known that dudley sowerby had shaken off the nesta of no name who was the abominable mrs marsett's friend a whirlwind with a trumpet would sweep them into the wilderness on a blast frightfuller than any ever heard nataly had a fit of weeping for want of the girl's embrace against whom her door was jealously locked she hoped those two would talk much madly if they liked during dinner that she might not be sensible through any short silence of the ardour animating them especially glowing in nesta ready behind her quiet mask to come brazenly forth but both of them were mercilessly ardent and a sickness of the fear that they might fall on her to capture her and hurry her along with them perforce of the allayed once fatal inflammable element in herself shook the warmth from her limbs causing her to say to herself aloud in a ragged hoarseness very strangely every thought of mine now has a physical effect on me they had not been two minutes together when she descended to them yet she saw the girl's heart brimming either with some word spoken to her or for joy of an unmaidenly confession during dinner they talked without distressful pauses whatever said whatever done was manifestly another drop in nesta's foolish happy cup could it be all because dartrey fenellan countenanced her acquaintance with that woman the mother had lost hold of her the tortured mother had lost hold of herself dartrey in the course of the evening begged to hear the contralto and nataly refusing was astounded by the admission in her blank mind of the truth of man's list of charges against her sex starting from their capriciousness for she could have sung in a crowded room and she had now a desire for company for stolid company or giddy an ocean of it this led to her thinking that the world of serious money getters and feasts and the dance the luxurious displays and the reverential sunday service will always ultimately prove itself right in opposition to critics and rebels and to any one vainly trying to stand alone and the thought annihilated her for she was past the age of the beginning again and no footing was left for an outsider not self justified in being where she stood she heard dartrey's praise of nesta's voice for tearing her mother's bosom with notes of intolerable sweetness and it was haphazard irony no doubt we do not the less bleed for the accident of a shot at last after midnight victor arrived nesta most impudently expected to be allowed to remain 'pray go dear' her mother said victor kissed his fredi 'some time to morrow' said he and she forbore to beseech him he stared though mildly at sight of her taking dartrey's hand for the good night and deliberately putting her lips to it was she a girl whose notion of rectifying one wrong thing done was to do another nataly could merely observe a voice pertaining to no one present said in her ear mothers have publicly slapped their daughter's faces for less than that it was the voice of her incapacity to cope with the girl she watched nesta's passage from the room somewhat affected by the simple bearing for which she was reproaching her 'and our poor darling has not seen a mountain this year' victor exclaimed to have mentionable grounds for pitying his girl 'i promised fredi she should never count a year without highlands or alps you remember mama down in the west highlands fancy the dear bit of bundle dartrey we had laid her in her bed she was about seven or eight and there she lay wide awake what 's fredi thinking of i'm thinking of the tops of the mountains at night dada she could climb them now she has the legs' nataly said 'you have some report to make you dined with those people' 'the marsetts yes well suited couple enough it's to happen before winter ends at once before christmas positively before next spring fredi's doing he has to manage arrange she's a good looking woman good height well rounded well behaved too she won't make a bad lady marsett every time that woman spoke of our girl the tears jumped to her eyelids' 'come to me before you go to bed' nataly said rising her voice foundering 'good night dartrey' she turned to the door she could not trust herself to shake hands with composure not only was it a nauseous mixture she was forced to gulp from victor it burned like a poison 'really fredi's doing chiefly' said victor as soon as dartrey and he were alone comfortably settled in the smoking room 'i played the man of pomp with marsett good heavy kind of creature attached to the woman she's the better horse as far as brains go good enough lady marsett i harped on major worrell my daughter insulted he knew of it spoke of you properly the man offered all apologies he has told the major he is no gentleman not a fit associate for gentlemen quite so and has cut him dead will marry her as i said make her as worthy as he can of the honour of my daughter's acquaintance rather comical grimace when he vowed he'd fasten the tie he doesn't like marriage but he can't give her up and she's for patronizing the institution but she is ready to say good bye to him rather than see the truest lady in the world insulted her words and so he swallows his dose for health and looks a trifle sourish antecedents i suppose has to stomach them but if a man's fond of a woman if he knows he saves her from slipping lower and it's an awful world for us to let a woman be under its wheels i say a woman who has a man to lean on unless she's as downright corrupt as two or three of the men we've known upon my word dartrey i come round to some of your ideas on these matters it's this girl of mine this wee bit of girl in her little nightshirt with the frill astonishes me most thinking of the tops of the mountains at night she has positively done the whole of this work main part i smiled when i left the house to have to own our little fredi starting us all on the road it seems marsett had sworn he would amorous vow you know he never came nearer to doing it i hope it's his better mind now i do hope the man won't have cause to regret it he speaks of nesta sort of rustic tone of awe mrs marsett has impressed him he expects the title soon will leave the army the poor plucked british army as you call it and lead the life of a country squire hunting well it's not only the army it's over great britain with this infernal wealth of ours and all for pleasure eh or paradise lost for a sugar plum eh dartrey upon my word it appears to me esau's the englishman jacob the german of these times i wonder old colney hasn't said it if we're not plucked as your regiments are of the officers who have learnt their work we're emasculated the nation's half made up of the idle and the servants of the idle' 'ay and your country squires and your manufacturers contrive to give the army a body of consumptive louts fit for nothing else than to take the shilling and not worth it' said dartrey 'sounds like old colney' victor remarked to himself 'but believe me i'm ashamed of the number of servants who wait on me it wouldn't so much matter as skepsey says if they were trained to arms and self respect that little fellow skepsey's closer to the right notion and the right practice too than any of us with his matilda pridden he has jumped out of himself to the proper idea of women too and there's a man who has been up three times before the magistrates and is considered a disorderly subject one among the best of english citizens i declare i never think of skepsey without the most extraordinary witless kind of envy as if he were putting in action an idea i once had and never quite got hold of again the match for him is fredi she threatens to be just as devoted just as simple as he i positively doubt whether any of us could stop her if she had set herself to do a thing she thought right' 'i should not like to think our trying it possible' said dartrey 'all very well but it's a rock ahead we shall have to alter our course my friend you know i dined with that couple after the private twenty minutes with marsett he formally propounded the invitation as we were close on his hour rather late and i wanted to make the woman happy besides putting a seal of cordiality on his good intentions politic and subsequently i heard from her that you'll think nothing of it fredi promised to stand by her at the altar' dartrey said shrugging 'she needn't do that' 'so we may say you're dealing with nesta victoria spare me a contest with that girl i undertake to manage any man or woman living' 'when the thing to be done is thought right by her' 'but can we always trust her judgement my dear dartrey' 'in this case she would argue that her resolution to keep her promise would bind or help to bind marsett to fulfil his engagement' 'odd her mother has turned dead round in favour of that fellow dudley sowerby i don't complain it suits but one thinks eh women' 'well yes one thinks or should think that if you insist on having women rooted to the bed of the river they'll veer with the tides like water weeds and no wonder' 'your heterodoxy on that subject is a mania dartrey we can't have women independent' 'then don't be exclaiming about their vagaries' victor mused 'it's wonderful that little girl of mine good height now but what a head she has oh she'll listen to reason only mark what i say with that quiet air of hers the husband if a young fellow will imagine she's the most docile of wives in the world and as to wife i'm not of the contrary opinion but qua individual female supposing her to have laid fast hold of an idea of duty it's he who'll have to turn the corner second if they're to trot in the yoke together or it may be an idea of service to a friend or to her sex that mrs marsett says she feels for bleeds for her sex the poor woman didn't show to advantage with me because she was in a fever to please talks in jerks hot phrases she holds herself well at the end of the dinner she behaved better odd you can teach women with hints and a lead but marsett 's marsett to the end rather touching the poor fellow said deuce of a bad look out for me if judith doesn't have a child first rate sportsman i hear he should have thought of his family earlier you know dartrey the case is to be argued for the family as well you won't listen and for society too off you go' a battery was opened on that wall of composite 'ah well' said victor 'but i may have to beg your help as to the so called promise to stand at the altar i don't mention it upstairs' he went to nataly's room she was considerately treated and was aware of being dandled that she might have sleep she consented to it in a loathing of the topic those women invade us we cannot keep them out was her inward cry with a reverberation of the unfailing accompaniment the world holds you for one of them victor tasked her too much when his perpetual readiness to doat upon his girl for whatever she did set him exalting nesta's conduct she thought was nesta so sympathetic with her mother of late by reason of a moral insensibility to the offence this was her torture through the night of a labouring heart that travelled to one dull shock again and again repeated the apprehended sound in fact of dudley sowerby's knock at the street door or sometimes a footman handed her his letter courteously phrased to withdraw from the alliance or else he came to a scene with nesta and her mother was dragged into it and the intolerable subject steamed about her the girl was visioned as deadly she might be indifferent to the protection of dudley's name robust sanguine victor's child she might her mother listened to a devil's whisper but no nesta's aim was at the heights she was pure in mind as in body no but the world would bring the accusation and the world would trace the cause heredity it would say would it say falsely nataly harped on the interrogation until she felt her existence dissolving to a dark stain of the earth and she found herself wondering at the breath she drew doubting that another would follow speculating on the cruel force which keeps us to the act of breathing though i could draw wild blissful breath if i were galloping across the moors her worn heart said to her youth and out of ken of the world i could regain a portion of my self esteem nature thereat renewed her old sustainment with gentle murmurs that were supported by dr themison's account of the virtuous married lady who chafed at the yoke on behalf of her sex and deemed the independent union the ideal nataly's brain had a short gallop over moorland it brought her face to face with victor's girl and she dropped once more to her remorse in herself and her reproaches of nesta the girl had inherited from her father something of the cataract's force which won its way by catching or by mastering uprooting ruining in the morning she was heavily asleep victor left word with nesta that the dear mother was not to be disturbed consequently when dudley called to see mrs victor radnor he was informed that miss radnor would receive him their interview lasted an hour dudley came to victor in the city about luncheon time his perplexity of countenance was eloquent he had before seeing the young lady digested an immense deal more as it seemed to him than any english gentleman should be asked to consume she now referred him to her father who had spent a day in brighton and would she said explain whatever there was to be explained but she added that if she was expected to abandon a friend she could not dudley had argued with her upon the nature of friendship the measurement of its various dues he had lectured on the choice of friends the impossibility for young ladies necessarily inexperienced to distinguish the right class of friends the dangers they ran in selecting friends unwarranted by the stamp of honourable families 'and what did fredi say to that' victor inquired 'miss radnor said i may be dense i cannot comprehend that the precepts were suitable for seminaries of pharisees when it is a question of a young lady associating with a notorious woman' 'not notorious you spoil your case if you speak extremely as a friend says i saw her yesterday she worships miss radnor' nesta will know when she is older she will thank me' said dudley hurriedly 'as it is at present i may reckon i hope that the association ceases her name i have to consider my family' 'good anchorage you must fight it out with the girl and depend upon this you're not the poorer for being the husband of a girl of character unless you try to bridle her she belongs to her time i don't mind owning to you she has given me a lead fredi 'll be merry to night here's a letter i have from the sanfredini dated milan fresh this morning invitation to bring the god child to her villa on como in may desirous to embrace her she wrote to the office not a word of her duque she has pitched him to the winds you may like to carry it off to fredi and please her' 'i have business' dudley replied 'away to it then' said victor 'you stand by me we expect our south london borough to be open in january early next year at least may be february you have family interest there' 'personally i will do my best' dudley said and he escaped feeling with the universal censor's angry spite that the revolutions of the world had made one of the wealthiest of city men the head of a set of bohemians and there are eulogists of the modern time and the man's daughter was declared to belong to it a visit in may to the italian cantatrice separated from her husband would render the maiden an accomplished flinger of caps over the windmills at home victor discovered that there was not much more than a truce between nesta and nataly he had a medical hint from dr themison and he counselled his girl to humour her mother as far as could be particularly in relation to dudley whom nataly now womanlike after opposing strongly favoured how are we ever to get a clue to the labyrinthine convolutions and changeful motives of the sex dartrey's theories were absurd did nataly think them dangerous for a young woman the guess hinted at a clue of some sort to the secret of her veering 'mr sowerby left me with an adieu' said nesta 'mr sowerby my dear he is bound bound in honour bound at heart you did not dismiss him' 'i repeated the word he used i thought of mother the blood leaves her cheeks at a disappointment now she has taken to like him' 'why you like him' 'i could not vow' 'tush' 'ah don't press me dada but you will see he has disengaged himself' he had done it though not in formal speech slow digestion of his native antagonism to these bohemians to say nothing of his judicial condemnation of them brought him painfully round to the writing of a letter to nataly cunningly addressed to the person on whom his instinct told him he had the strongest hold she schooled herself to discuss the detested matter forming dudley's grievance and her own with nesta and it was a woeful half hour for them but nataly was not the weeper another interview ensued between nesta and her suitor dudley bore no resemblance to mr barmby who refused to take the word no from her and had taken it and had gone to do holy work for which she revered him dudley took the word leaving her to imagine freedom until once more her mother or her father inspired by him came interceding her mother actually supplicating so that the reality of dudley's love rose to conception like a london dawn over nesta and how honourably decently positively to sever herself from it grew to be an ill visaged problem she glanced in soul at dartrey fenellan for help she had her wild thoughts having once called him dartrey the virginal barrier to thoughts was broken and but for love of her father for love and pity of her mother she would have ventured the step to make the man who had her whole being in charge accept or reject her nothing else appeared in prospect her father and mother were urgently one to favour dudley and the sensitive gentleman presented himself to receive his wound and to depart with it but always he returned at last as if under tuition he refrained from provoking a wound he stood there to win her upon any terms and he was a handsome figure acknowledged by the damsel to be increasing in good looks as more and more his pretensions became distasteful to her the slight cast of sourness on his lower features had almost vanished his nature seemed to have enlarged he complimented her for her 'generous benevolence' vaguely yet with evident sincereness he admitted that the modern world is 'attempting difficulties with at least commendable intentions' and that the position of women demands improvement consideration for them also he said feelingly 'they have to bear extraordinary burdens' there he stopped the sharp intelligence fronting him understood that this compassionate ejaculation was the point where she too must cry halt he had however still under tuition perhaps withdrawn his voice from the pursuit of her and so she in gratitude silenced her critical mind beneath a smooth conceit of her having led him two steps to a broader tolerance susceptible as she was she did not influence him without being affected herself in other things than her vanity his prudishness affected her only when her heart flamed did she disdain that real haven of refuge with its visionary mount of superiority offered by society to its effect in the habit of ignoring the sins it fosters under cloak not less than did the naked barbaric time and far more to the vitiation of the soul he fancied he was moulding her therefore winning her it followed that he had the lover's desire for assurance of exclusive possession and reflecting that he had greatly pardoned he grew exacting he mentioned his objections to some of mr dartrey fenellan's ideas nesta replied 'i have this morning had two letters to make me happy' a provoking evasion he would rather have seen antagonism bridle and stiffen her figure 'is one of them from that gentleman' 'one is from my dear friend louise de seilles she comes to me early next month' 'the other' 'the other is also from a friend' 'a dear friend' 'not so dear her letter gives me happiness' 'she writes not from france from you tempt me to guess' 'she writes to tell me that mr dartrey fenellan has helped her in a way to make her eternally thankful' 'the place she writes from is' the drag of his lips betrayed his enlightenment insisted on doubting he demanded assurance 'it matters in no degree' she said dudley 'thought himself excusable for inquiring' she bowed gently the stings and scorpions and degrading itches of this nest of wealthy bohemians enraged him 'are you i beg to ask are you still i can hardly think it nesta i surely have a claim to advise it cannot be with your mother's consent in communication in correspondence with' again she bowed her head saying 'it is true' 'with that person' he could not but look the withering disgust of the modern world in a conservative gentleman who has been lured to go with it a little way only to be bitten 'i decline to believe it' he said with forcible sound 'she is married' was the rather shameless exasperating answer 'married or not' he cried and murmured 'i have borne these may be mr dartrey fenellan's ideas they are not mine i have something at least is due to me ask any lady there are clergymen i know clergymen who are for uplifting quite right but not associating to call one of them a friend ask any lady any your mother' 'i beg you will not distress my mother' said nesta 'i beg to know whether this correspondence is to continue' said dudley 'all my life if i do not feel dishonoured by it' 'you are' he added hastily 'counsels of prudence there is not a lady living who would tell you otherwise at all events in public opinion if it were known and it would certainly be known a lady wife or spinster would suffer would not escape the at least shadow of defilement from relationship any degree of intimacy with hard words are wholesome in such a case touch pitch yes my sense is coherent' 'quite' said nesta 'and you do not agree with me' 'i do not' 'do you pretend to be as able to judge as i' 'in this instance better' 'then i retire i cannot retain my place here you may depend upon it the world is not wrong when it forbids young ladies to have cognizance of women leading disorderly lives' 'only the women mr sowerby' 'men too of course' 'you do not exclude the men from society' 'oh one reads that kind of argument in books' 'oh the worthy books then i would read them if i could find them' 'they are banned by self respecting readers' 'it grieves me to think differently' dudley looked on this fair girl as yet innocent girl and contrasting her with the foulness of the subject she dared discuss it seemed to him that a world which did not puff at her and silence if not extinguish was in a state of liquefaction remembering his renewed repentances his absence he said 'i do hope you may come to see that the views shared by your mother and me are not erroneous' 'but do not distress her' nesta implored him 'she is not well when she has grown stronger her kind heart will move her to receive the lady so that she may not be deprived of the society of good women i shall hope she will not disapprove of me i cannot forsake a friend' 'i beg to say good bye' said dudley she had seen a rigidity smite him as she spoke and so little startling was it that she might have fancied it expected save for her knowing herself too serious to have played at wiles to gain her ends he 'wished her prudent advisers' she thanked him 'in a few days louise de seilles will be here' a frenchwoman and papist was the interjection of his twist of brows surely i must now be free she thought when he had covered his farewell under a salutation regretful in frostiness a week later she had the embrace of her louise and armandine was made happy with a piece of parisian riband winter was rapidly in passage changes were visible everywhere earth and house of commons and the south london borough exhibited them mrs burman was the sole exception to the stupefaction of physicians in a manner to make a sane man ask whether she was not being retained as an instrument for one of the darker purposes of providence and where are we standing if we ask such things she held on to her thread of life february went by and not a word from themison nor from carling nor from the rev groseman buttermore nor from jarniman that is to say the two former accepted invitations to grand dinners the two latter acknowledged contributions to funds in which they were interested but they had apparently grown to consider mrs burman as an establishment one of our fixtures on the other hand there was nothing to be feared from her lakelands feared nothing the entry into lakelands was decreed for the middle of april those good creatures enclosed the poor woman and nourished her on comfortable fiction so the death of the member for the south london borough fifteen years younger than the veteran in maladies was not to be called premature and could by no possibility lead to an exposure of the private history of the candidate for his vacant seat chapter xl an expiation nataly had fallen to be one of the solitary who have no companionship save with the wound they nurse to chafe it rather than try at healing so rational a mind as she had was not long in outliving mistaken impressions she could distinguish her girl's feeling and her aim she could speak on the subject with dartrey and still her wound bled on louise de seilles comforted her partly through an exaltation of nesta mademoiselle however by means of a change of tone and look when dudley sowerby and dartrey fenellan were the themes showed a too pronounced preference of the more unstable one or rather the man adventurous out of the world's highways whose image as husband of such a daughter as hers smote the wounded mother with a chillness mademoiselle's occasional thrill of fervency in an allusion to dartrey might have tempted a suspicious woman to indulge suppositions accounting for the young frenchwoman's novel tenderness to england of which nesta proudly very happily boasted the suspicion proposed itself and was rejected for not even the fever of an insane body could influence nataly's generous character to let her moods divert and command her thoughts of persons her thoughts were at this time singularly lucid upon everything about her with the one exception of the reason why she had come to favour dudley and how it was she had been smitten by that woman at brighton to see herself in her position altogether with the world's relentless unexamining hard eyes bitterness added of mrs marsett she is made an honest woman and there was a strain of the lower in nataly to reproach the girl for causing the reflection to be cast on the unwedded otherwise her mind was open she was of aid to victor in his confusion over some lost idea he had often touched on latterly and she was the one who sent him ahead at a trot under a light by saying 'you would found a new and more stable aristocracy of the contempt of luxury' when he talked of combatting the jews with a superior weapon that being in fact as colney durance had pointed out to him the weapon of self conquest used by them 'before they fell away to flesh pottery' was it his idea he fancied an aching at the back of his head when he speculated but his idea had been surpassingly luminous alive a creation and this came before him with the yellow skin of a theory bred born of books though nataly's mention of the aristocracy of self denying discipline struck a lucifer in his darkness nesta likewise helped but more in what she did than in what she said she spoke intelligently enough to make him feel a certain increase of alarm amounting to a cursory secret acknowledgement of it both at her dealings with dudley and with himself she so quietly displaced the lady visiting him at the city offices his girl's disregard of hostile weather and her company her talk delighted him still he remonstrated at her coming daily she came nor was there an instigation on the part of her mother clearly none her mother asked him once whether he thought she met the dreadful brighton woman his fredi drove constantly to walk back beside him westward as he loved to do whenever it was practicable and exceeding the flattery of his possession of the gallant daughter her conversation charmed him to forget a disappointment caused by the defeat and entire exclusion of the lady visiting him so complimentarily for his advice on stocks shares mines et caetera the lady resisted she was vanquished as the shades are displaced by simple apparition of daylight his fredi was like the daylight to him she was the very daylight to his mind whatsoever their theme of converse for by stimulating that ready but vagrant mind to quit the leash of the powerful senses and be a ethereally excursive she gave him a new enjoyment which led to reflections a sounding of nature almost a question to her on the verge of a doubt are we in fact harmonious with the great mother when we yield to the pressure of our natures for indulgence is she when translated into us solely the imperious appetite here was fredi his little fredi stately girl that she had grown and grave too for all her fun and her sail on wings lifting him to pleasures not followed by clamorous and perfectly satisfactory yet discomposingly violent appeals to nature they could be vindicated or could they when they would not bear a statement of the case he could not imagine himself stating it namelessly to his closest friend not to simeon fenellan as for speaking to dartrey the notion took him with shivers young dudley would have seemed a more possible confidant and he represented the puritan world and young dudley was getting over fredi's infatuation for the woman she had rescued he was beginning to fancy he saw a right enthusiasm in it in the abstract if only the fair maid would drop an unseemly acquaintance he had called at the office to say so victor stammered the plea for him 'never dear father' came the smooth answer a shocking answer in contrast with the tones her english was as lucid as her eyes when she continued up to the shock she dealt 'do not encourage a good man to waste his thoughts upon me i have chosen my mate and i may never marry him i do not know whether he would marry me he has my soul i have no shame in saying i love him it is to love goodness greatness of heart he is a respecter of women of all women not only the fortunate he is the friend of the weaker everywhere he has been proved in fire he does not sentimentalize over poor women as we know who scorns people for doing and that is better than hardness meaning kindly he is not one of the unwise advocates he measures the forces against them he reads their breasts he likes me he is with me in my plans he has not said has not shown he loves me it is too high a thought for me until i hear it' 'has your soul' was all that victor could reply while the whole conception of lakelands quaked under the crumbling structure remonstrance argument a word for dudley swelled to his lips and sank in dumbness her seeming intuition if it was not a perception of the point where submission to the moods of his nature had weakened his character and required her defence of him struck victor with a serious fear of his girl and it was the more illuminatingly damnatory for being recognized as the sentiment which no father should feel he tried to think she ought not to be so wise of the things of the world an effort to imagine a reproof showed him her spirit through her eyes in her deeds too she had already done work on the road colney durance dartrey fenellan anything but sentimentalists either of them strongly backing her upholding her victor could no longer so naturally name her fredi he spoke it hastily under plea of some humorous tenderness when he ventured when dudley calling on him in the city to discuss the candidature for the south london borough named her fredi that he might regain a vantage of familiarity by imitating her father it struck victor as audacious it jarred in his recollection though the heir of the earldom spoke in the tone of a lover was really at high pitch he appeared to be appreciating her to have suffered stings of pain he offered himself he made but one stipulation victor regretfully assured him he feared he could do nothing the thought of his entry into lakelands with nesta victoria refusing the foundation stone of the place grew dim but he was now canvassing for the borough hearty at the new business as the braced swimmer on seas which instantly he became with an end in view to be gained late one april night expecting nataly to have gone to bed and nesta to be waiting for him he reached home and found nataly in her sitting room alone 'nesta was tired' she said 'we have had a scene she refuses mr sowerby i am sick of pressing it he is very much in earnest painfully she blames him for disturbing me she will not see the right course a mother reads her daughter if my girl has not guidance she means rightly she is rash' nataly could not utter all that her insaneness of feeling made her think with regard to victor's daughter daughter also of the woman whom her hard conscience accused of inflammability 'here is a note from dr themison dear' victor seized it perused and drew the big breath 'from themison' he said he coughed 'don't think to deceive me' said she 'i have not read the contents i know them' 'the invitation at last for to morrow sunday four pm odd that next day at eight of the evening i shall be addressing our meeting in the theatre simeon speaks beaves urmsing insists on coming tory though he is those tories are jollier fellows than well no wonder there will be no surgical the poor woman is very low a couple of days at the outside of course i go' 'hand me the note dear' it had to be given up out of the pocket 'but' said victor 'the mention of you is merely formal' she needed sleep she bowed her head nataly was the first at the breakfast table in the morning a fair sunday morning she was going to mrs john cormyn's church and she asked nesta to come with her she returned five minutes before the hour of lunch having left nesta with mrs john louise de seilles undertook to bring nesta home at the time she might choose fenellan mr pempton peridon and catkin lunched and chatted nataly chatted at a quarter to three o'clock victor's carriage was at the door he rose he had to keep an appointment nataly said to him publicly 'i come too' he stared and nodded in the carriage he said 'i'm driving to the gardens for a stroll to have a look at the beasts sort of relief poor crazy woman however it 's a comfort to her so' 'i like to see them' said nataly 'i shall see her i have to do it' up to the gate of the gardens victor was arguing to dissuade his dear soul from this very foolish totally unnecessary step alighting he put the matter aside for good angels to support his counsel at the final moment bears lions tigers eagles monkeys they suggested no more than he would have had from prints they sprang no reflection except that the coming hour was a matter of indifference to them they were about him and exercised so far a distraction he took very kindly to an old mother monkey relinquishing her society at sight of nataly's heave of the bosom southward across the park the dread house rose he began quoting colney durance with relish while sarcastically confuting the cynic who found much pasture in these gardens over southward too he would be addressing a popular assembly to morrow evening between now and then there was a ditch to jump he put on the sympathetic face of grief 'after all a caged wild beast hasn't so bad a life' he said to be well fed while they live and welcome death as a release from the maladies they develop in idleness is the condition of wealthy people creatures of prey horrible thought yet allied to his idea it seemed yes but these good caged beasts here set them an example in not troubling relatives and friends when they come to the gasp mrs burman's invitation loomed as monstrous a final act of her cruelty his skin pricked with dews he thought of nataly beside him jumping the ditch with him as a relief if she insisted on doing it he hoped she would not for the sake of her composure it was a ditch void of bottom but it was a mere matter of an hour less the state of health of the invalid could bear only a few minutes in any case we are sure that the hour will pass our own arrive certainly 'capital place for children' he exclaimed and here startlingly before him in the clusters of boys and girls was the difference between young ones and their elders feeling quite as young the careless youngsters have not to go and sit in the room with a virulent old woman and express penitence and what not and hear words of pardon after their holiday scamper and stare at the caged beasts attention to the children precipitated him upon acquaintances hitherto cleverly shunned he nodded them off after the brightest of greetings such anodyne as he could squeeze from the incarcerated wild creatures was exhausted he fell to work at nataly's 'aristocracy of the contempt of luxury' signifying that we the wealthy will not exist to pamper flesh but we live for the promotion of brotherhood ay and that our england must make some great moral stand if she is not to fall to the rear and down unuttered it caught the skirts of the idea it evaporated when spoken still this theme was almost an exorcism of mrs burman he consulted his watch 'thirteen minutes to four i must be punctual' he said nataly stepped faster seated in the carriage he told her he had never felt the horror of that place before 'put me down at the corner of the terrace dear i won't drive to the door' 'i come with you victor' she replied after entreaties and reasons intermixed to melt her resolve he saw she was firm and he asked himself whether he might not be constitutionally better adapted to persuade than to dissuade the question thumped having that house of drugs in view he breathed more freely for the prospect of feeling his nataly near him beneath the roof 'you really insist dear love' he appealed to her and her answer 'it must be' left no doubt though he chose to say 'not because of standing by me' and she said 'for my peace victor' they stepped to the pavement the carriage was dismissed seventeen houses of the terrace fronting the park led to the funereal one and the bell was tolled in the breast of each of the couple advancing with an air of calmness to the inevitable black door jarniman opened it 'his mistress was prepared to see them' not like one near death they were met in the hall by the rev groseman buttermore 'you will find a welcome' was his reassurance to them gently delivered on the stoop of a large person his whispered tones were more agreeably deadening than his words mr buttermore ushered them upstairs 'can she bear it' victor said and heard 'her wish ten minutes' 'soon over' he murmured to nataly with a compassionate exclamation for the invalid they rounded the open door they were in the drawing room it was furnished as in the old time gold and white looking new all the same as of old save for a division of silken hangings and these were pale blue the colour preferred by victor for a bedroom he glanced at the ceiling to bathe in a blank space out of memory here she lived here she slept behind the hangings there was refreshingly that little difference in the arrangement of the room the corner northward was occupied by the grand piano and victor had an inquiry in him tuned he sighed expecting a sight to come through the hangings sensible that nataly trembled he perceived the rev groseman buttermore half across a heap of shawl swathe on the sofa mrs burman was present seated people may die seated she had always disliked the extended posture except for the night's rest she used to say imagining herself to be not inviting the bolt of sudden death in her attitude when seated by day and often at night the poor woman had to sit up for the qualms of her dyspepsia but i 'm bound to think humanely be christian be kind benignant he thought and he fetched the spirit required to behold her face emerge from a pale blue silk veiling as it were the inanimate wasted led up from the mould by morning mr buttermore signalled to them to draw near wasted though it was the face of the wide orbits for sunken eyes was distinguishable as the one once known if the world could see it and hear that it called itself a man's wife she looked burnt out two chairs had been sent to front the sofa execution there victor thought and he garrotted the unruly mind of a man really feeling devoutness in the presence of the shadow thrown by the dread shade 'ten minutes' mr buttermore said low after obligingly placing them on the chairs he went they were alone with mrs burman no voice came they were unsure of being seen by the floating grey of eyes patient to gaze from their vast distance big drops fell from nataly's victor heard the french timepiece on the mantel shelf where a familiar gilt cupid swung for the seconds his own purchase the time of day on the clock was wrong the cupid swung nataly's mouth was taking breath of anguish at moments more than a minute of the terrible length of the period of torture must have gone two if not three a quaver sounded 'you have come' the voice was articulate thinner than the telephonic trans atlantic by deep sea cable victor answered 'we have' another minute must have gone in the silence and when we get to five minutes we are on the descent rapidly counting our way out of the house into the fresh air where we were half an hour back among those happy beasts in the pleasant gardens mrs burman's eyelids shut 'i said you would come' victor started to the fire screen 'your sight requires protection' she dozed 'and natalia dreighton' she next said they were certainly now on the five minutes now for the slide downward and outward nataly should never have been allowed to come 'the white waistcoat' struck his ears 'old customs with me always' he responded 'the first of april always white is a favourite pale blue too but i fear i hope you have not distressing nights in my family we lay great stress on the nights we pass my cousins the miss duvidneys go so far as to judge of the condition of health by the nightly record' 'your daughter was in their house' she knew everything 'very fond of my daughter the ladies' he remarked 'i wish her well' 'you are very kind' mrs burman communed within or slept 'victor natalia we will pray' she said her trembling hands crossed their fingers nataly slipped to her knees the two women mutely praying pulled victor into the devotional hush it acted on him like the silent spell of service in a church he forgot his estimate of the minutes he formed a prayer he refused to hear the cupid swinging he droned a sound of sentences to deaden his ears ideas of eternity rolled in semblance of enormous clouds death was a black bird among them the piano rang to nataly's young voice and his the gold and white of the chairs welcomed a youth suddenly enrolled among the wealthy by an enamoured old lady on his arm cupid tick ticked poor soul poor woman how little we mean to do harm when we do an injury an incomprehensible world indeed at the bottom and at the top we get on fairly at the centre yet it is there that we do the mischief making such a riddle of the bottom and the top what is to be said prayer quiets one victor peered at nataly fervently on her knees and mrs burman bowed over her knotted fingers the earnestness of both enforced an effort at a phrased prayer in him plungeing through a wave of the scent of marechale that was a tremendous memory to haul him backward and forward he beheld his prayer dancing across the furniture a diminutive thin black figure elvish irreverent appallingly unlike his proper emotion and he brought his hands just to touch and got to the edge of his chair with split knees at once the figure vanished by merely looking at nataly he passed into her prayer a look at mrs burman made it personal his own he heard the cluck of a horrible sob coming from him after a repetition of his short form of prayer deeply stressed he thanked himself with the word 'sincere' and a queer side thought on our human susceptibility to the influence of posture we are such creatures nataly resumed her seat mrs burman had raised her head she said 'we are at peace' she presently said with effort 'it cannot last with me i die in nature's way i would bear forgiveness with me that i may have it above i give it here to you to all my soul is cleansed i trust much was to say my strength will not unto god you both' the rev groseman buttermore was moving on slippered step to the back of the sofa nataly dropped before the unseeing scarce breathing lady for an instant victor murmured an adieu grateful for being spared the ceremonial shake of hands he turned away then turned back praying for power to speak to say that he had found his heart was grateful would hold her in memory he fell on a knee before her and forgot he had done so when he had risen they were conducted by the rev gentleman to the hall door he was not speechless jarniman uttered something that black door closed behind them chapter xli the night of the great undelivered speech to a man issuing from a mortuary where a skull had voice london may be restorative as air of summer alps it is by contrast blooming life observe the fellowship of the houses shoulder to shoulder and that straight ascending smoke of the preparation for dinner and the good policeman yonder blessedly idle on an orderly sabbath evening and the families of the minor people trotting homeward from the park to tea here and again an amiable carriage of the superimposed people driving to pay visits they are so social friendly inviting to him they strip him of the shroud sing of the sweet old world he cannot but be moved to the extremity of the charitableness neighbouring on tears a stupefaction at the shock of the positive reminder echo of the fact still shouting in his breast that he had seen mrs burman and that the interview was over the leaf turned and the book shut held victor in a silence until his gratefulness to london city was borne down by the more human burst of gratitude to the dying woman who had spared him as much as she could a scene of the convulsive pathetic and had not called on him for any utterance of penitence that worm like thread of voice came up to him still from sexton depths it sounded a larger forgiveness without the word he felt the sorrow of it all as he told nataly at the same time bidding her smell 'the marvellous oxygen of the park' he declared it to be quite equal to lakelands she slightly pressed his arm for answer perhaps she did not feel so deeply she was free of the horrid associations with the scent of marechale at any rate she had comported herself admirably victor fancied he must have shuddered when he passed by jarniman at the door who was almost now seeing his mistress's ghost would have the privilege to morrow he called a cab and drove to mrs john cormyn's at nataly's request for nesta and mademoiselle enjoying the londonized odour of the cab nataly did not respond to his warm and continued eulogies of mrs burman she rather disappointed him he talked of the gold and white furniture he just alluded to the cupid reserving his mental comment that the time piece was all astray the cupid regular on the swing strange touching terrible if really the silly gilt figure symbolized and we are a silly figure to be sitting in a cab imagining such things when nesta and mademoiselle were opposite he had the pleasure to see nataly take nesta's hand and hold it until they reached home those two talking together in the brief words of their deep feeling had tones that were singularly alike the mezzo soprano filial to the divine maternal contralto those two dear ones mounted to nataly's room the two dear ones showed themselves heart in heart together once more each looked the happier for it dartrey was among their dinner guests and nataly took him to her little blue room before she went to bed he did not speak of their conversation to victor but counselled him to keep her from excitement 'my dear fellow if you had seen her with mrs burman' victor said and loudly praised her coolness she was never below a situation he affirmed he followed his own counsel to humour his nataly she began panting at a word about mr barmby's ready services when however she related the state of affairs between dartrey and nesta by the avowal of each of them to her he said embracing her 'your wisdom shall guide us my love' and almost extinguished a vexation by concealing it she sighed 'if one could think that a girl with nesta's revolutionary ideas of the duties of women and their powers would be safe or at all rightly guided by a man who is both one of the noblest and the wildest in the ideas he entertains' victor sighed too he saw the earldom which was to dazzle the gossips crack on the sky in a futile rocket bouquet she was distressed she moaned 'my girl my girl i should wish to leave her with one who is more fixed the old fashioned husband new ideas must come in politics but in society and for women and the young having heads are the most endangered nesta vows her life to it dartrey supports her' 'see colney' said victor 'odd colney does you good some queer way he has though you don't care for his rival tongues and the last number was funny with semhians on the pacific impressively addressing a farewell to his cricket bat before he whirls it away to neptune and the blue hand of his nation's protecting god observed to seize it dead failure with the public of course however he seems to seem wise with you the poor old fellow gets his trouncing from the critics monthly see colney to morrow my love now go to sleep we have got over the worst i speak at my meeting to morrow and am a champagne bottle of notes and points for them' his lost idea drew close to him in sleep or he thought so when awaking to the conception of a people solidified rich and poor by the common pride of simple manhood but it was not coloured not a luminous globe and the people were in drab not a shining army on the march to meet the future it looked like a paragraph in a newspaper upon which a leading article sits dutifully arousing the fat worm of sarcastic humour under the ribs of cradled citizens with an exposure of its excellent folly he would not have it laughed at still he could not admit it as more than a skirt of the robe of his idea for let none think him a mere city merchant millionnaire boon fellow or music loving man of the world he had ideas to shoot across future ages provide against the shrinkage of our coal beds against and for if you like the thickening jumbling threatening excess of population in these islands in europe america all over our habitable sphere now that mrs burman on her way to bliss was no longer the dungeon cell for the man he would show himself to be this name for successes corporate nucleus of the enjoyments this victor montgomery radnor intended impressing himself upon the world as a factory of ideas colney's insolent charge that the english have no imagination a doomed race if it be true would be confuted for our english require but the lighted leadership to come into cohesion and step ranked and chant harmoniously the song of their benevolent aim and that astral head giving as a commencement example of the right use of riches the nation is one part of the riddle of the future solved surely he had here the idea he had it so warmly that his bath water heated only the vision was wanted on london bridge he had seen it a great thing done to the flash of brilliant results that was after a fall there had been a fall also of the scheme of lakelands come to us with no superstitious whispers of indications and significations in the fall but there had certainly been a moral fall fully to the level of the physical in the maintaining of that scheme of lakelands now ruined by his incomprehensible nesta who had saved him from falling further his bath water chilled he jumped out and rubbed furiously with his towels and flesh brushes chasing the idea for simple warmth to have something inside him to feel just that sustainment with the cry but no one can say i do not love my nataly and he tested it to prove it by his readiness to die for her which is heroically easier than the devotedly living and has a weight of evidence in our internal courts for surpassing the latter tedious performance his nesta had knocked lakelands to pieces except for the making of money the whole year of an erected lakelands notwithstanding uninterrupted successes was a blank or rather we have to wish it were a blank the scheme departs payment for the enlisted servants of it is in prospect a black agent not willingly enlisted yet pointing to proofs of service refuses payment in ordinary coin and we tell him we owe him nothing that he is not a man of the world has no understanding of nature and still the fellow thumps and alarums at a midnight door we are astonished to find we have in our daylight house how is it would other men be so sensitive to him victor was appeased by the assurance of his possession of an exceptionally scrupulous conscience and he settled the debate by thinking 'after all for a man like me battling incessantly a kind of vesuvius i must have can't be starved must be fed though pah but i'm not to be questioned like other men but how about an aristocracy of the contempt of distinctions but there is no escaping distinctions my aristocracy despises indulgence and indulges say an exceptional nature supposing a certain beloved woman to pronounce on the case she cannot no woman can be a just judge of it' he cried my love of her is testified by my having barmby handy to right her to day tomorrow the very instant the clock strikes the hour of my release mention of the clock swung that silly gilt figure victor entered into it condemned to swing and be a thrall his intensity of sensation launched him on an eternity of the swinging in ridiculous nakedness to the measure of time gone crazy he had to correct a reproof of mrs burman as the cause of the nonsense he ran down to breakfast hopeing he might hear of that clock stopped and that sickening motion with it another letter from the sanfredini in milan warmly inviting to her villa over como acted on him at breakfast like the waving of a banner 'we go' victor said to nataly and flattered up a smile about her lips too much a resurrection smile there was talk of the meeting at the theatre simeon fenellan had spoken there in the cause of the deceased member was known and was likely to have a good reception fun and enthusiasm might be expected 'and my darling will hear her husband speak to night' he whispered as he was departing and did a mischief he had to fear for a shadowy knot crossed nataly's forehead she seemed paler he sent back nesta and mademoiselle in consequence at the end of the green park their dinner hour was early simeon fenellan colney durance and mr peridon pleasing to nataly for his faithful siege of the french fortress were the only guests when they rose nataly drew victor aside he came dismayed to nesta she ran to her mother 'not hear papa speak oh mother mother then i stay with her but can't she come he is going to unfold ideas to us there' 'my naughty girl is not to poke her fun at orators' nataly said 'no dearest it would agitate me to go i'm better here i shall be at peace when the night is over' 'but you will be all alone here dear mother' nataly's eyes wandered to fall on colney he proposed to give her his company she declined it nesta ventured another entreaty either that she might be allowed to stay or have her mother with her at the meeting 'my love' nataly said 'the thought of the meeting ' she clasped at her breast and she murmured 'i shall be comforted by your being with him there is no danger there but i shall be happy i shall be at peace when this night is over' colney persuaded her to have him for companion mr peridon who was to have driven with nesta and mademoiselle won admiration by proposing to stay for an hour and play some of mrs radnor's favourite pieces nesta and victor overbore nataly's objections to the lover's generosity so mr peridon was left nesta came hurrying back from the step of the carriage to kiss her mother again saying 'just one last kiss my own and she's not to look troubled i shall remember everything to tell my own mother it will soon be over' her mother nodded but the embrace was passionate nesta called her father into the passage bidding him prohibit any delivery to her mother of news at the door 'she is easily startled now by trifles you have noticed' victor summoned his recollections and assured her he had noticed as he believed he had 'the dear heart of her is fretting for the night to be over and think seven days and she is in lakelands a fortnight and we have our first concert durandarte oh the dear heart 'll be at peace when i tell her of a triumphant meeting not a doubt of that even though colney turns the shadow of his back on us' 'one critic the less for you' said nesta skepsey was to meet her carriage at the theatre ten minutes later victor and simeon fenellan were proceeding thitherward on foot 'i have my speech' said victor 'you prepare the way for me following our influential friend dubbleson colewort winds up any one else they shout for we shall have a great evening i suspect i shall find themison or jarniman when i get home you don't believe in intimations i've had crapy processions all day before my eyes no wonder after yesterday' 'dubbleson mustn't drawl it out too long' said fenellan 'we 'll drop a hint where's dartrey' 'he'll come he's in one of his black moods not temper he's got a notion he killed his wife by dragging her to africa with him she was not only ready to go she was glad to go she had a bit of the heroine in her and a certainty of tripping to the deuce if she was left to herself' 'tell nataly that' said victor 'and tell her about dartrey harp on it once she was all for him and our girl but it's a woman though the dearest i defy any one to hit on the cause of their changes we must make the best of things if we're for swimming the task for me to night will be to keep from rolling out all i've got in my head and i'm not revolutionary i'm for stability only i do see that the firm stepping place asks for a long stride to be taken one can't get the english to take a stride unless it's for a foot behind them bother old colney too timid or too scrupulous down we go into the mire there but i want to say it i want to save the existing order i want christianity instead of the mammonism we 're threatened with great fortunes now are becoming the giants of old to stalk the land or mediaeval barons dispersion of wealth is the secret nataly's of that mind with me a decent poverty she's rather wearying wants a change i've a steam yacht in my eye for next month on the mediterranean all our set she likes quiet i believe in my political recipe for it' he thumped on a method he had for preserving aristocracy true aristocracy amid a positively democratic flood of riches 'it appears to me you're on the road of priscilla graves and pempton' observed simeon 'strike off priscilla's viands and friend pempton's couple of glasses and there's your aristocracy established but with rather a dispersed recognition of itself' 'upon my word you talk like old colney except for a twang of your own' said victor 'colney sours at every fresh number of that serial the last with delphica detecting the plot of falarique is really not so bad the four disguised members of the comedie francaise on board the vessel from san francisco to declaim and prove the superior merits of the gallic tongue jumped me to bravo the cleverness and bobinikine turning to the complexion of the remainder of cupboard dumplings discovered in an emigrant's house to let and semhians i forget what and mytharete's forefinger over the bridge of his nose like a pensive vulture on the skull of a desert camel but i complain there's nothing to make the english love the author and it's wasted he's basted and the book 'll have no sale i hate satire' 'rough soap for a thin skin victor does it hurt our people much' 'not a bit doesn't touch them but i want my friends to succeed' their coming upon westminster bridge changed the theme victor wished the houses of parliament to catch the beams of sunset he deferred to the suggestion that the hospital's doing so seemed appropriate 'i'm always pleased to find a decent reason for what is' he said then he queried 'but what is if we look at it and while we look simeon she may be going or she's gone already poor woman i shall have that scene of yesterday everlastingly before my eyes like a drop curtain only you know simeon they don't feel the end as we in health imagine colney would say we have the spasms and they the peace i 've a mind to send up to regent's park with inquiries it would look respectful god forgive me the poor woman perverts me at every turn though i will say a certain horror of death i had she whisked me out of it yesterday i don't feel it any longer what are you jerking at' 'only to remark that if the thing's done for us we haven't it so much on our sensations' 'more if we're sympathetic but that compels us to be philosophic or who could live poor woman' 'waft her gently victor' 'tush now for the south side of the bridges and i tell you simeon what i can't mention to night i mean to enliven these poor dear people on their forsaken south of the city i 've my scheme elected or not i shall hardly be accused of bribery when i put down my first instalment' fenellan went to work with that remark in his brain for the speech he was to deliver he could not but reflect on the genial man's willingness and capacity to do deeds of benevolence constantly thwarted by the position into which he had plunged himself they were received at the verge of the crowd outside the theatre doors by skepsey who wriggled tore and clove a way for them where all were obedient but the numbers lumped and clogged when finally they reached the stage they spied at nesta's box during the thunder of the rounds of applause after shaking hands with mr dubbleson sir abraham quatley dudley sowerby and others and with beaves urmsing a politician 'never of the opposite party to a deuce of a funny fellow go anywhere to hear him' he vowed 'miss radnor and mademoiselle de seilles arrived quite safely' said dudley feasting on the box which contained them and no dartrey fenellan in it nesta was wondering at dartrey's absence not before mr dubbleson the chairman the 'gentleman of local influence' had animated the drowsed wits and respiratory organs of a packed audience by yielding place to simeon did dartrey appear simeon's name was shouted in proof of the happy explosion of his first anecdote as dartrey took seat behind nesta 'half an hour with the dear mother' he said nesta's eyes thanked him she pressed the hand of a demure young woman sitting close behind louise de seilles 'you know matilda pridden' dartrey held his hand out 'has she forgiven me' matilda bowed gravely enfolding her affirmative in an outline of the no need for it with perfect good breeding dartrey was moved to think skepsey's choice of a woman to worship did him honour he glanced at louise her manner toward matilda pridden showed her sisterly with nesta he said 'i left mr peridon playing a little anxiety to hear that the great speech of the evening is done it's nothing else i'll run to her as soon as it's over' 'oh good of you and kind of mr peridon' she turned to louise who smiled at the simple art of the exclamation assenting victor below on the stage platform indicated the waving of a hand to them and his delight at simeon's ringing points which were to dartrey's mind vacuously clever and crafty dartrey despised effects of oratory save when soldiers had to be hurled on a mark or citizens nerved to stand for their country nesta dived into her father's brilliancy of appreciation a trifle pained by dartrey's aristocratic air when he surveyed the herd of heads agape and another cheer rang round he smiled with her to be with her at a hit here and there he would not pretend an approval of this manner of winning electors to consider the country's interests and their own one fellow in the crowded pit affecting a familiarity with simeon that permitted the taking of liberties with the orator's christian name mildly amused him he had no objection to hear 'simmy' shouted as louise de seilles observed she was of his mind in regard to the rough machinery of freedom skepsey entered the box 'we shall soon be serious miss nesta' he said after a look at matilda pridden there was a prolonged roaring on the cheerful side 'and another word about security that your candidate will keep his promises' continued simeon 'you have his word my friends' and he told the story of the old governor of goa who wanted money and summoned the usurers and they wanted security whereupon he laid his hidalgo hand on a cataract of kronos beard across his breast and pulled forth three white hairs and presented them 'and as honourably to the usurious jews as to the noble gentleman himself that security was accepted' emerging from hearty clamours the illustrative orator fell upon the question of political specifics mr victor radnor trusted to english good sense too profoundly to be offering them positive cures as they would hear the enemy say he did yet a bit of a cure may be offered if we 're not for pushing it too far in pursuit of the science of specifics in the style of the foreign physician probably spanish who had no practice and wished for leisure to let him prosecute his anatomical and other investigations to discover his grand medical nostrum so to get him fees meanwhile he advertised a cure for dyspepsia the resource of starving doctors and sure enough his patient came showing the grand fat fellow we may be when we carry more of the deciduously mortal than of the scraggy vital upon our persons any one at a glance would have prescribed water cresses to him water cresses exclusively to eat for a fortnight and that the good physician did away went his patient returning at the end of the fortnight lean and with the appetite of a toledo blade for succulent slices he vowed he was the man our estimable doctor eyed him tapped at him pinched his tender parts and making him swear he was really the man and had eaten nothing whatever but unadulterated water cresses in the interval seized on him in an ecstasy by the collar of his coat pushed him into the surgery knocked him over killed him cut him up and enjoyed the felicity of exposing to view the very healthiest patient ever seen under dissecting hand by favour of the fortunate discovery of the specific for him all to further science to which in spite of the petitions of all the scientific bodies of the civilized world he fell a martyr on the scaffold poor gentleman but we know politics to be no such empirical science simeon ingeniously interwove his analogy he brought it home to beaves urmsing whose laugh drove any tone of apology out of it yet the orator was asked 'do you take politics for a joke simmy' he countered his questioner 'just to liberate you from your moribund state my friend' and he told the story of the wrecked sailor found lying on the sands flung up from the foundered ship of a salvation captain and how that nothing could waken him and there he lay fit for interment until presently a something of a voice grew down into his ears and it was his old chum polly whom he had tied to a board to give her a last chance in the surges and polly shaking the wet from her feathers and shouting 'polly tho dram dry' which struck on the nob of jack's memory to revive all the liquorly tricks of the cabin under salvationism and he began heaving and at last he shook in a lazy way and then from sputter to sputter got his laugh loose and he sat up and cried 'that did it now to business' for he was hungry 'and when i catch the ring of this world's laugh from you my friend' simeon's application of the story was drowned after the outburst they heard his friend again interruptingly 'you keep that tongue of yours from wagging as it did when you got round the old widow woman for her money simmy' victor leaned forward simeon towered he bellowed 'and you keep that tongue of yours from committing incest on a lie' it was like a lightning flash in the theatre the man went under simeon flowed conscience reproached him with the little he had done for victor and he had now his congenial opportunity up in the box the powers of the orator were not so cordially esteemed to matilda pridden his tales were barely decently the flesh and the devil smothering a holy occasion to penetrate and exhort dartrey sat rigid as with the checked impatience for a leap nesta looked at louise when some one was perceived on the stage bending to her father it was mr peridon he never once raised his face apparently he was not intelligible or audible but the next moment victor sprang erect dartrey quitted the box nesta beheld her father uttering hurried words to right and left he passed from sight mr peridon with him and dartrey did not return nesta felt her father's absence as light gone his eyes rayed light besides she had the anticipation of a speech from him that would win matilda pridden she fancied simeon fenellan to be rather under the spell of the hilarity he roused a gentleman behind him spoke in his ear and simeon instead of ceasing resumed his flow matilda pridden's gaze on him and the people was painful to behold nesta saw her mind she set herself to study a popular assembly it could be serious to the call of better leadership she believed her father had been telling her of late of a faith he had in the english that they or so her intelligence translated his remarks had power to rise to spiritual ascendancy and be once more the islanders heading the world of a new epoch abjuring materialism some such idea very quickening to her as it would be to this earnest young woman worshipped by skepsey her father's absence and the continued shouts of laughter the insatiable thirst for fun darkened her in her desire to have the soul of the good working sister refreshed they had talked together not much enough for each to see at either's breast the wells from the founts of life the box door opened dartrey came in he took her hand she stood up to his look he said to matilda pridden 'come with us she will need you' 'speak it' said nesta he said to the other 'she has courage' 'i could trust to her' matilda pridden replied nesta read his eyes 'mother' his answer was in the pressure 'ill' 'no longer' 'oh dartrey' matilda pridden caught her fast 'i can walk dear' nesta said dartrey mentioned her father she understood 'i am thinking of him' the words of her mother 'at peace when the night is over' rang along the gassy passages of the back of the theatre the sound coming from an applausive audience was as much a thunder as rage would have been it was as void of human meaning as a sea chapter xlii the last in the still dark hour of that april morning the rev septimus barmby was roused by mr peridon with a scribbled message from victor which he deciphered by candlelight held close to the sheet of paper between short inquiries and communications losing more and more the sense of it as his intelligence became aware of what dread blow had befallen the stricken man he was bidden come to fulfil his promise instantly he remembered the bearing of the promise mr peridon's hurried explanatory narrative made the request terrific out of tragically lamentable a semblance of obedience had to be put on and the act of dressing aided it mr barmby prayed at heart for guidance further the two gentlemen drove westward speaking little they had the dry sob in the throat 'miss radnor' mr barmby asked 'she is shattered she holds up she would not break down' 'i can conceive her to possess high courage' 'she has her friend mademoiselle de seilles' mr barmby remained humbly silent affectionate deep regrets moved him to say 'a loss irreparable we have but one voice of sorrow and how sudden the dear lady had no suffering i trust' 'she fell into the arms of mr durance she died in his arms she was unconscious he says i left her straining for breath she said victor she tried to smile i understood i was not to alarm him' 'and he too late' 'he was too late by some minutes' 'at least i may comfort miss radnor must be a blessing to him' 'they cannot meet her presence excites him' that radiant home of all hospitality seemed opening on from darker chambers to the deadly dark the immorality in the moral situation could not be forgotten by one who was professionally a moralist but an incorruptible beauty in the woman's character claimed to plead for her memory even the rigorous in defence of righteous laws are softened by a sinner's death to hear excuses and may own a relationship haply perceive the faint nimbus of the saint death among us proves us to be still not so far from the nature saying at every avenue to the mind 'earth makes all sweet' mr durance had prophesied a wailful end ever to the carol of optimists yet it is not the black view which is the right view there is one between the path adopted by septimus barmby if he could but induce his brethren to enter on it the dreadful teaching of circumstances might help to the persuading of a fair young woman under his direction having her hand disengaged mr barmby started himself in the dream of his uninterred passion for the maiden he chased it seized it hurled it hence as a present sacrilege constantly and at the pitch of our highest devotion to serve are we assailed by the tempter is it that the love of woman is our weakness for if so then would a celibate clergy have grant of immunity but alas it is not so with them we have to deplore the hearing of reports too credible again we are pushed to contemplate woman as the mysterious obstruction to the perfect purity of soul nor is there a refuge in asceticism no more devilish nourisher of pride do we find than in pain voluntarily embraced and strangely at the time when our hearts are pledged to thoughts upon others they are led by woman to glance revolving upon ourself our vile self mr barmby clutched it by the neck light now as of a strong memory of day along the street assisted him to forget himself at the sight of the inanimate houses of this london all revealed in a quietness not less immobile than tombstones of an unending cemetery with its last ghost laid did men but know it the habitual necessity to amass matter for the weekly sermon set him noting his meditative exclamations the noble army of platitudes under haloes of good use to men justifiably turned over in his mind for their good he had to think that this act of the justifying of the act reproached him with a lack of due emotion in sympathy with agonized friends truly dear drawing near the hospitable house his official and a cordial emotion united as we see sorrowful crape wreathed countenances his heart struck heavily when the house was visible could it be the very house the look of it belied the tale inside but that threw a ghostliness on the look some one was pacing up and down they greeted dudley sowerby his ability to speak was tasked they gathered that mademoiselle and 'a miss pridden' were sitting with nesta and that their services in a crisis had been precious at such times one of them reflected woman has indeed her place when life's battle waxes red her soul must be capable of mounting to the level of the man's then it is a lesson dudley said he was waiting for dr themison to come forth he could not tear himself from sight of the house the door opened to dr themison departing colney durance and simeon fenellan bare headed colney showed a face with stains of the lashing of tears dr themison gave his final counsels 'her father must not see her for him it may have to be a specialist we will hope the best mr dartrey fenellan stays beside him good as to the ceremony he calls for a form of it might soothe any soothing possible no music i will return in a few hours' he went on foot mr barmby begged advice from colney and simeon concerning the message he had received the ceremony requiring his official presidency neither of them replied they breathed the morning air they gave out long drawn sighs of relief looking on the trees of the park a man came along the pavement working slow legs hurriedly simeon ran down to him 'humour as much as you can' colney said to mr barmby 'let him imagine' 'miss radnor' 'not to speak of her' 'the daughter he so loves' mr barmby's tender inquisitiveness was unanswered were they inducing him to mollify a madman but was it possible to associate the idea of madness with mr radnor simeon ran back 'jarniman' he remarked 'it's over' 'now' colney's shoulders expressed the comment 'well now mr barmby you can do the part desired come in it's morning' he stared at the sky all except dudley passed in mr barmby wanted more advice his dilemma being acute it was moderated though not more than moderated when he was informed of the death of mrs burman radnor an event that occurred according to jarniman's report forty five minutes after skepsey had a second time called for information of it at the house in regent's park five hours and a half as colney made his calculation after the death of nataly he was urged by some spur of senseless irony to verify the calculation and correct it in the minutes dudley crossed the road no sign of the awful interior was on any of the windows of the house either to deepen awe or relieve they were blank as eyeballs of the mindless he shivered death is our common cloak but calamity individualizes to set the unwounded speculating whether indeed a stricken man who has become the cause of woeful trouble may not be pointing a moral pacing on the park side of the house he saw skepsey drive up and leap out with a gentleman mr radnor's lawyer could it be that there was no will written could a will be executed now the moral was more forcibly suggested dudley beheld this mr victor radnor successful up all the main steps persuasive popular brightest of the elect of fortune felled to the ground within an hour he and all his house and if at once to pass beneath the ground the blow would have seemed merciful for him or if instead of chattering a mixture of the rational and the monstrous he had been heard to rave like the utterly distraught recollection of some of the things he shouted was an anguish a notion came into the poor man that he was the dead one of the two and he cried out 'cremation no colney's right it robs us of our last laugh i lie as i fall' he 'had a confession for his nataly for her only for no one else' he had 'an idea' his begging of dudley to listen without any punctilio putting a vulgar oath before it was the sole piece of unreasonableness in the explanation of the idea and that was not much wilder than the stuff dudley had read from reports of radical speeches he told dudley he thought him too young to be 'best man to a widower about to be married' and that barmby was 'coming all haste to do the business because of no time to spare' dudley knew but the half and he did not envy dartrey fenellan his task of watching over the wreck of a splendid intelligence humouring and restraining according to the rumours mr radnor had not shown the symptoms before the appearance of his daughter for awhile he hung and then fell like an icicle nesta came with a cry for her father he rose dartrey was by hugged fast in iron muscles the unhappy creature raved of his being a caged lion these things dudley had heard in the house there are scenes of life proper to the grave cloth nataly's dead body was her advocate with her family with friends with the world victor had more need of a covering shroud to keep calamity respected earth makes all sweet and we when the privilege is granted us do well to treat the terribly stricken as if they had entered to the bosom of earth that night's infinite sadness was concentrated upon nesta she had need of her strength of mind and body the night went past as a year the year followed it as a refreshing night slowly lifting her from our abysses it was a good angel to the girl permission could not be given for her to see her father she had a home in the modest home of louise de seilles on the borders of dauphins and with french hearts at their best in winningness around her she learned again as an art the natural act of breathing calmly she had by degrees a longing for the snow heights when her imagination could perch on them with love and pride she began to recover the throb for a part in human action it set her nature flowing to the mate she had chosen who was her counsellor her supporter and her sword she had awakened to new life not to sink back upon a breast of love though thoughts of the lover were as blows upon strung musical chords of her bosom her union with dartrey was for the having an ally and the being an ally in resolute vision of strife ahead through the veiled dreams that bear the blush this was behind a maidenly demureness are not young women hypocrites who shall fathom their guile a girl with a pretty smile a gentle manner a liking for wild flowers up on the rocks and graceful with resemblances to the swelling proportions of garden fruits approved in young women by the connoisseur eye of man distinctly designed to embrace the state of marriage that she might a girl of singularly lucid and receptive eyes the better give battle to men touching matters which they howl at an eccentric matron for naming so it was and the yielding of her hand to dartrey would have appeared at that period of her revival as among the baser compliances of the fleshly if she had not seen in him whom she owned for leader her fellow soldier warrior friend hero of her own heart's mould but a greater she was on como at the villa of the signora giulia sanfredini when dudley's letter reached her with the supplicating offer of the share of his earldom an english home meanwhile was proposed to her at the house of his mother the countess he knew that he did not write to a brilliant heiress the generosity she had always felt that he possessed he thus proved in figures they are convincing and not melting but she was moved to tears by his goodness in visiting her father as well as by the hopeful news he sent he wrote delicately withholding the title of her father's place of abode there were expectations of her father's perfect recovery the signs were auspicious he appeared to be restored to the 'likeness to himself' in the instances dudley furnished his appointment with him for the flute duet next day and particularly his enthusiastic satisfaction with the largeness and easy excellent service of the residence 'in which he so happily found himself established' he held it to be 'on the whole superior to lakelands' the smile and the tear rolled together in nesta reading these words and her father spoke repeatedly of longing to embrace his fredi of the joy her last letter had given him of his intention to send an immediate answer and he showed dudley a pile of manuscript ready for the post he talked of public affairs was humorous over any extravagance or eccentricity in the views he took notably when he alluded to his envy of little skepsey he said he really did envy and his daughter believed it and saw fair prospects in it her grateful reply to the young earl conveyed all that was perforce ungentle in the signature of the name of nesta victoria fenellan a name he was to hear cited among the cushioned conservatives and plead for as he best could under a pressure of disapprobation and compelled esteem and regrets the day following the report of her father's wish to see her she and her husband started for england on that day victor breathed his last dudley had seen the not hopeful but an ominous illumination of the stricken man for whom came the peace his nataly had in earth often did nesta conjure up to vision the palpitating form of the beloved mother with her hand at her mortal wound in secret through long years of the wearing of the mask to keep her mate inspirited her gathered knowledge of things and her ruthless penetrativeness made it sometimes hard for her to be tolerant of a world whose tolerance of the infinitely evil stamped blotches on its face and shrieked in stains across the skin beneath its gallant garb that was only when she thought of it as the world condemning her mother she had a husband able and ready in return for corrections of his demon temper to trim an ardent young woman's fanatical overflow of the sisterly sentiments scholarly friends too for such restrainings from excess as the mind obtains in a lamp of history exhibiting man's original sprouts to growth and fitful continuation of them her first experience of the grief that is in pleasure for those who have passed a season was when the old concert set assembled round her when she heard from the mouth of a living woman that she had saved her from going under the world's waggon wheels and taught her to know what is actually meant by the good living of a shapely life nesta had the taste of a harvest happiness richer than her recollection of the bride's though never was bride in fuller flower to her lord than she who brought the dower of an equal valiancy to dartrey fenellan you are aware of the reasons the many why a courageous young woman requires of high heaven far more than the commendably timid a doughty husband she had him otherwise would that puzzled old world which beheld her step out of the ranks to challenge it and could not blast her personal reputation have commissioned a paw to maul her character perhaps instructing the gossips to murmur of her parentage nesta victoria fenellan had the husband who would have the world respectful to any brave woman this one was his wife daniel skepsey rejoices in service to his new master owing to the scientific opinion he can at any moment of the day apply for as to the military defences of the country instead of our attempting to arrest the enemy by vociferations of persistent prayer the sole point of difference between him and his matilda and it might have been fatal but that nesta's intervention was persuasive the two members of the army first in the field to enrol and give rank according to the merits of either to both sexes were made one colney durance practically cynical when not fancifully men said stood by skepsey at the altar his published exercises in satire produce a flush of the article in the reviews of his books meat and wine in turn fence the hymen beckoning priscilla and mr pempton the forms of religion more than the channel's division of races keep louise de seilles and mr peridon asunder and in the uniting of them colney is interested because it would have so pleased the woman of the loyal heart no longer beating he let victor's end be his expiation and did not phrase blame of him he considered the shallowness of the abstract optimist exposed enough in victor's history he was reconciled to it when looking on their child he discerned that for a cancelling of the errors chargeable to them the father and mother had kept faith with nature etext editor's bookmarks admiration of an enemy or oppressor doing great deeds all of us an ermined owl within us to sit in judgement an incomprehensible
