note there is a short list of bookmarks or pointers at the end of the file for those who may wish to sample the authors ideas before making an entire meal of them dw the gentleman of fifty and the damsel of nineteen an early uncompleted fragment by george meredith chapter i passing over ickleworth bridge and rounding up the heavilyshadowed river of our narrow valley i perceived a commotion as of bathers in a certain bright space immediately underneath the vicars terracegarden steps my astonishment was considerable when it became evident to me that the vicar himself was disporting in the water which reaching no higher than his waist disclosed him in the ordinary habiliments of his cloth i knew my friend to be one of the most absentminded of men and my first effort to explain the phenomenon of his appearance there suggested that he might have walked in the victim of a fit of abstraction and that he had not yet fully comprehended his plight but this idea was dispersed when i beheld the very portly lady his partner in joy and adversity standing immersed and perfectly attired some short distance nearer to the bank as i advanced along the bank opposed to them i was further amazed to hear them discoursing quite equably together so that it was impossible to say on the face of it whether a catastrophe had occurred or the great heat of a cloudless summer day had tempted an eccentric couple to seek for coolness in the directest fashion without absolute disregard to propriety i made a point of listening for the accentuation of the my dear which was being interchanged but the keynote to the harmony existing between husband and wife was neither excessively unctuous nor shrewd and the connubial shuttlecock was so well kept up on both sides that i chose to await the issue rather than speculate on the origin of this strange exhibition i therefore as i could not be accused of an outrage to modesty permitted myself to maintain what might be invidiously termed a satyrlike watch from behind a forward flinging willow whose business in life was to look at its image in a brown depth branches trunk and roots the sole indication of discomfort displayed by the pair was that the ladys hand worked somewhat fretfully to keep her dress from ballooning and puffing out of all proportion round about her person while the vicar who stood without his hat employed a spongy handkerchief from time to time in tempering the ardours of a vertical sun if you will consent to imagine a bald blackbird his neck being shrunk in apprehensively as you may see him in the first rolling of the thunder you will gather an image of my friends appearance he performed his capital ablutions with many loud poofs and a casting up of dazzled eyes an action that gave point to his recital of the invocation of chryses to smintheus which brought upon the greeks disaster and much woe between the lines he replied to his wife whose remarks increased in quantity and also as i thought in emphasis under the river of verse which he poured forth unbaffled broadening his chest to the sonorous greek music in a singular rapture of obliviousness a wise man will not squander his laughter if he can help it but will keep the agitation of it down as long as he may the simmering of humour sends a lively spirit into the mind whereas the boiling over is but a prodigal expenditure and the disturbance of a clear current for the comic element is visible to you in all things if you do but keep your mind charged with the perception of it as i have heard a great expounder deliver himself on another subject and he spoke very truly so i continued to look on with the gravity of nature herself and i could not but fancy and with less than our usual wilfulness when we fancy things about natures moods that the mother of men beheld this scene with half a smile differently from the simple observation of those cows whisking the flies from their flanks at the edge of the shorn meadow and its aspens seen beneath the curved roof of a broad oakbranch save for this happy upward curve of the branch we are encompassed by breathless foliage even the gloom was hot the little insects that are food for fish tried a flight and fell on the waters surface as if panting here and there a sullen fish consented to take them and a circle spread telling of past excitement i had listened to the vicars homeric lowing for the space of a minute or sowhat some one has called the great beastlike bellowlike roar and roll of the iliad hexameter it stopped like a cut cord one of the numerous daughters of his house appeared in the arch of white cluster roses on the lower gardenterrace and with an exclamation stood petrified at the extraordinary spectacle and then she laughed outright i had hitherto resisted but the young ladys frank and boisterous laughter carried me along and i too let loose a peal and discovered myself the vicar seeing me acknowledged a consciousness of his absurd position with a laugh as loud as for the scapegrace girl she went off into a run of highpitched shriekings like twenty woodpeckers crying i mama mama you look as if you were in jordan the vicar cleared his throat admonishingly for it was apparent that miss alice was giving offence to her mother and i presume he thought it was enough for one of the family to have done so wilt thou come out of jordan i cried i am sufficiently baptized with the water said the helpless man indeed mr amble observed his spouse you can lecture a woman for not making the best of circumstances i hope youll bear in mind that its you who are irreverent i can endure this no longer you deserve mr pollingrays ridicule upon this i interposed pray maam dont imagine that you have anything but sympathy from mebut as i was protesting having my mouth open the terrible miss alice dragged the laughter remorselessly out of me they have been trying franks new boat mr pollingray and theyve upset it oh oh and again there was the woodpeckers chorus alice i desire you instantly to go and fetch john the gardener said the angry mother mama i cant move wait a minute only a minute johns gone about the geraniums oh dont look so resigned papa youll kill me mama come and take my hand oh oh the young lady put her hands in against her waist and rolled her body like a possessed one why dont you come in through the boathouse she asked when she had mastered her fit ah said the vicar i beheld him struck by this new thought how utterly absurd you are mr amble exclaimed his wife when you know that the boathouse is locked and that the boat was lying under the camshot when you persuaded me to step into it hearing this explanation of the accident alice gave way to an ungovernable emotion you see my dear the vicar addressed his wife she can do nothing its useless if ever patience is counselled to us it is when accidents befall us for then as we are not responsible we know we are in other hands and it is our duty to be comparatively passive perhaps i may say that in every difficulty patience is a lifebelt i beg of you to be patient still mr amble i shall think you foolish said the spouse with a nod of more than emphasis my dear you have only to decide was the meek reply by this time miss alice had so far conquered the fiend of laughter that she could venture to summon her mother close up to the bank and extend a rescuing hand mrs amble waded to within reach her husband following arrangements were made for alice to pull and the vicar to push both in accordance with mrs ambles stipulations for even in her extremity of helplessness she affected rule and sovereignty unhappily at the decisive moment i chanced and i admit it was more than an inadvertence on my part it was a most illconsidered thing to do i chanced i say to call outand that i refrained from quoting voltaire is something in my favour how on earth did you manage to tumble in there can be no contest of opinion that i might have kept my curiosity waiting and possibly it may be said with some justification that i was the direct cause of my friends unparalleled behaviour but could a mortal man guess that in the very act of assisting his wifes return to dry land and while she wasif i may put it somodestly in his hands he would turn about with a quotation that compared him to old palinurus all the while allowing his worthy and admirable burden to sink lower and dispread in excess upon the surface of the water until the vantage of her daughters help was lost to her i beheld the consequences of my indiscretion dismayed i would have checked the preposterous virgilian but in contempt of my uplifted hand and averted head and regardless of the fact that his wife was then literally dependent upon him the vicar declaimed and the drenching effect produced by latin upon a lady at such a season may be thought on vix primos inopina quies laxaverat artus et super incumbens cum puppis parte revulsa cumque gubernaclo liquidas projecit in undas it is not easy when you are unacquainted with the language to retort upon latin even when the attempt to do so is made in english very few even of the uneducated ears can tolerate such anticlimax vituperative as english after sounding latin mrs amble kept down those sentiments which her vernacular might have expressed i heard but one groan that came from her as she lay huddled indistinguishably in the arms of her husband notpraecipitem i am happy to say my senseless friend remarked further and laughed cheerfully as he fortified his statement with a run of negatives no no in a way peculiar to him no no if i plant my grey hairs anywhere it will be on dry land no but now my dear he returned to his duty why youre down again come one two and up he was raising a dead weight the passion for sarcastic speech was manifestly at war with common prudence in the bosom of mrs amble prudence however overcame it she cast on him a look of a kind that makes matrimony terrific in the dreams of bachelors and then wedding her energy to the assistance given she made one of those senseless springs of the upper half of the body which strike the philosophic eye with the futility of an effort that does not arise from a solid basis owing to the want of concert between them the vicars impulsive strength was expended when his wifes came into play alice clutched her mother bravely the vicar had force enough to stay his wifes descent but alice she boasts of her muscle had not the force in the other directionand no wonder there are few young ladies who could pull fourteen stone sheer up a camshot mrs amble remained in suspense between the two oh mr pollingray if you were only on this side to help us miss alice exclaimed very piteously though i could see that she was half mad with the internal struggle of laughter at the parents and concern for them now pull alice shouted the vicar no not yet screamed mrs amble im sinking pull alice now mama oh push papa im down up maam jane woman up gently papa abraham i will not my dear but you must and that man opposite what pollingray hes fifty i found myself walking indignantly down the path even now i protest my friend was guilty of bad manners though i make every allowance for him i excuse i pass the order but whywhat justifies one mans bawling out another mans age what purpose does it serve i suppose the vicar wished to reassure his wife on the principle i have heard him enunciate it that the sexes are merged at fiftyby which he means i must presume that something which may be good or bad and is generally silly of course i admire and respect modesty and pudeur as much as any man something has gone a recognition of the bounds of division there is if that is a lamentable matter a loss of certain of our young tricks at fifty we have ceased to blush readily and let me ask you to define a blush is it an involuntary truth or an ingenuous lie i know that this will sound like the language of a man not a little jealous of his youthful compeers i can but leave it to rightly judging persons to consider whether a healthy man in his prime who has enough and is not cursed by ambition need be jealous of any living soul a shriek from miss alice checked my retreating steps the vicar was staggering to support the breathing half of his partner while she regained her footing in the bed of the river their effort to scale the camshot had failed happily at this moment i caught sight of master franks boat which had floated bottom upwards against a projecting mudbank of forgetmenots i contrived to reach it and right it and having secured one of the sculls i pulled up to the rescue though not before i had plucked a flower actuated by a motive that i cannot account for the vicar held the boat firmly against the camshot while i at the imminent risk of joining them i shall not forget the combined expression of miss alices retreating eyes and the malicious corners of her mouth hoisted the lady in and the river with her from the seat of the boat she stood sufficiently high to project the step towards land without peril when she had set her foot there we all assumed an attitude of respectful attention and the vicar who could soar over calamity like a fairweather swallow acknowledged the return of his wife to the element with a series of apologetic yesses and short coughings that would furnish a good concert for the poets he remarked a parting a separation of lovers even as a body from the watertorn or from the water plucked eh do you thinkso i weep round her tearful in her track an excellent but the outraged woman dripping in grievous discomfort above him made a peremptory gesture mr amble will you come on shore instantly i have borne with your stupidity long enough i insist upon your remembering sir that you have a family dependent upon you other men may commit these follies this was a blow at myself a bachelor whom the lady had never persuaded to dream of relinquishing his freedom my dear i am coming said the vicar then come at once or i shall think you idiotic the wife retorted i have been endeavouring the vicar now addressed me to prove by a practical demonstration that women are capable of as much philosophy as men under any sudden and afflicting revolution of circumstances and if you get a sunstroke you will be rightly punished and i shall not be sorry mr amble i am coming my dear jane pray run into the house and change your things not till i see you out of the water sir you are losing your temper my love you would make a saint lose his temper mr amble there were female saints my dear the vicar mildly responded and addressed me further up to this point i assure you pollingray no conduct could have been more exemplary than mrs ambles i had got her into the boata good boat a capital boatbut getting in myself we overturned the first impulse of an ordinary woman would have been to reproach and scold but mrs amble succumbed only to the first impulse discovering that all effort unaided to climb the bank was fruitless she agreed to wait patiently and make the best of circumstances and she did and she learnt to enjoy it there is marrow in every bone my dear jane i have never admired you so much i tried her pollingray in metaphysics i talked to her of the opera we last heard i think fifty years ago and as it is less endurable for a woman to be patient in tribulationthe honour is greater when she overcomes the fleshy trial insomuch the vicar put on a bland air of abnegation of honour that i am disposed to consider any male philosopher our superior when youve found one ha hawhen youve found one o sol pulcher i am ready to sing that the day has been glorious so far pulcher ille dies mrs amble appealed to me would anybody not swear that he is mad to see him standing waistdeep in the water and the sun on his bald head i am reduced to entreat you not tothough you have no family of your ownnot to encourage him it is amusing to you pray reflect that such folly is too often fatal compel him to come on shore the logic of the appeal was no doubt distinctly visible in the ladys mind though it was not accurately worded i saw that i stood marked to be the scape goat of the day and humbly continued to deserve well notwithstanding by dint of simple signs and nods of affirmative and a constant propulsion of my friends arm i drew him into the boat and thence projected him up to the level with his wife who had perhaps deigned to understand that it was best to avoid the arresting of his divergent mind by any remark during the passage and remained silent no sooner was he established on his feet than she plucked him away your papas hat she called flashing to her daughter and streamed up the lawn into the rosetrellised pathways leading on aloft to the vicarage house behind roses the weeping couple disappeared the last i saw of my friend was a smiting of his hand upon his head in a vain effort to catch at one of the fleeting ideas sowed in him by the quick passage of objects before his vision and shaken out of him by abnormal hurry the rev abraham amble had been lord of his wife in the water but his innings was over he had evidently enjoyed it vastly and i now understood why he had chosen to prolong it as much as possible your eccentric characters are not uncommonly amateurs of petty artifice there are hours of vengeance even for henpecked men i found myself sighing over the enslaved condition of every benedict of my acquaintance when the thought came like a surprise that i was alone with alice the fair and pleasant damsel made a clever descent into the boat and having seated herself she began to twirl the scull in the rowlock and said do you feel disposed to join me in looking after the other scull and papas hat mr pollingray i suggested will you not get your feet wet i couldnt manage to empty all the water in the boat oh cried she with a toss of her head i wet feet never hurt young people there was matter for an admonitory lecture in this let me confess i was about to give it when she added but mr pollingray i am really afraid that your feet are wet you had to step into the water when you righted the boat my reply was to jump down by her side with as much agility as i could combine with a proper discretion the amateur craft rocked threateningly and i found myself grasped by and grasping the pretty damsel until by great good luck we were steadied and preserved from the same misfortune which had befallen her parents she laughed and blushed and we tottered asunder would you have talked metaphysics to me in the water mr pollingray alice was here guilty of one of those naughty sort of innocent speeches smacking of eve most strongly though of course of eve in her best days i took the rudder lines to steer against the sculling of her single scull and was adam enough to respond to temptation i should perhaps have been grateful to your charitable construction of it as being metaphysics she laughed colloquially to fill a pause it had not been coquetry merely the woman unconsciously at play a man is bound to remember the seniority of his years when this occurs for a veteran of ninety and a worn out young debauchee will equally be subject to it if they do not shun the society of the sex my long robust health and perfect self reliance apparently tend to give me unguarded moments or lay me open to fitful impressions indeed there are times when i fear i have the heart of a boy and certainly nothing more calamitous can be conceived supposing that it should ever for one instant get complete mastery of my head this is the peril of a man who has lived soberly do we never know when we are safe i am in reflecting thereupon positively prepared to say that if there is no fool like what they call an old fool and a man in his prime who can be laughed at is the worlds old fool there is wisdom in the wild oats theory and i shall come round to my nephews way of thinking that is as far as master charles by his acting represents his thinking i shall at all events be more lenient in my judgement of him and less stern in my allocutions for i shall have no text to preach from we picked up the hat and the scull in one of the little muddy bays of our brown river forming an amphitheatre for waterrats and draped with great dockleaves nettleflowers ragged robins and other weeds for which the learned young lady gave the botanical names it was pleasant to hear her speak with the full authority of absolute knowledge of her subject she has intelligence she is decidedly too good for charles unless he changes his method of living shall we row on she asked settling her arms to work the pair of sculls you have me in your power said i and she struck out her shape is exceedingly graceful i was charmed by the occasional tightening in of her lips as she exerted her muscle while at intervals telling me of her race with one of her boastful younger brothers whom she had beaten i believe it is only when they are using physical exertion that the eyes of young girls have entire simplicitythe simplicity of nature as opposed to that other artificial simplicity which they learn from their governesses their mothers and the admiration of witlings attractive purity or the nice glaze of no comprehension of anything which is considered to be improper in a wicked world and is no doubt very useful is not to my taste french girls as a rule cannot compete with our english in the purer graces they are only incomparable when as women they have resort to art alice could look at me as she rowed without thinking it necessary to force a smile or to speak or to snigger and be foolish i felt towards the girl like a comrade we went no further than hatchards mile where the water plumps the poor sleepy river from a sidestream and as it turned the boats head quite round i let the boat go these studies of young women are very well as a pastime but they soon cease to be a recreation she forms an agreeable picture when she is rowing and possesses a musical laugh now and then she gives way to the bad trick of laughing without caring or daring to explain the cause for it she is moderately wellbred i hope that she has principle certain things a man of my time of life learns by associating with very young people which are serviceable to him what a different matter this earth must be to that girl from what it is to me i knew it before andmark the differencei feel it now chapter ii she papa never will cease to meet with accidents and adventures if he only walks out to sit for half an hour with one of his old dames as he calls them something is sure to happen to him and it is almost as sure that mr pollingray will be passing at the time and mixed up in it since mr pollingrays return from his last residence on the continent i have learnt to know him and like him charles is unjust to his uncle he is not at all the grave kind of man i expected from charless description he is extremely entertaining and then he understands the world and i like to hear him talk he is so unpretentious and uses just the right words no one would imagine his age from his appearance and he has more fun than any young man i have listened to but i am convinced i have discovered his weakness it is my fatal peculiarity that i cannot be with people ten minutes without seeing some point about them where they are tenderest mr pollingray wants to be thought quite youthful he can bear any amount of fatigue he is always fresh and a delightful companion but you cannot get him to show even a shadow of exhaustion or to admit that he ever knew what it was to lie down beaten this is really to pretend that he is superhuman i like him so much that i could wish him superior to suchit is nothing other thanvanity which is worse a young man giving himself the air of a sage orbut no one can call mr pollingray an old man he is a confirmed bachelor that puts the case charles when he says of him that he is a gentleman in a good state of preservation means to be ironical i doubt whether charles at fifty would object to have the same said of mr charles everett mr pollingray has always looked to his health he has not been disappointed i am sure he was always very good but whatever he was he is now very pleasant and he does not talk to women as if he thought them singular and feel timid i mean confused as some men show that they feelthe good ones perhaps he felt so once and that is why he is still free charless dread that his uncle will marry is most unworthy he never will but why should he not mama declares that he is waiting for a woman of intellect i can hear her depend upon it a woman of intellect will marry dayton manor should that mighty event not come to pass poor charles will have to sink the name of everett in that of pollingray mr pollingrays name is the worst thing about him when i think of his name i see him ten times older than he is my feelings are in harmony with his pedigree concerning the age of the name one would have to be a woman of profound intellect to see the advantage of sharing it mrs pollingray she must be a lady with a wig it was when we were rowing up by hatchards mill that i first perceived his weakness he was looking at me so kindly and speaking of his friendship for papa and how glad he was to be fixed at last near to us at dayton i wished to use some term of endearment in reply and said i remember yes and we are also glad godpapa i was astonished that he should look so disconcerted and went on have you forgotten that you are my godpapa he answered am i oh yesthe name of alice still he looked uncertain uncomfortable and i said do you want to cancel the past and cast me off no certainly not he i suppose thought he was assuring me i saw his lips move at the words i cancel the past though he did not speak them out he positively blushed i know the sort of young man he must have been exactly the sort of young man mama would like for a son inlaw and her daughters would accept in pure obedience when reduced to be capable of the virtue by rigorous diet or consumption he let the boat go round instantly this was enough for me it struck me then that when papa had said to mama as he did in that absurd situation he is fifty mr pollingray must have heard it across the river for he walked away hurriedly he came back it is true with the boat but i have my own ideas he is always ready to do a service but on this occasion i think it was an afterthought i shall not venture to call him godpapa again indeed if i have a desire it is that i may be blind to peoples weakness my insight is inveterate papa says he has heard mr pollingray boast of his age if so there has come a change over him i cannot be deceived i see it constantly after my unfortunate speech mr pollingray shunned our house for two whole weeks and scarcely bowed to us when coming out of church miss pollingray idolises himspoils him she says that he is worth twenty of charles nous savons ce que nous savons nous autres charles is wild but charles would be above these littlenesses how could miss pollingray comprehend the romance of charless nature my sister evelina is now mr pollingrays favourite she could not say godpapa to him if she would persons who are very much petted at home are always establishing favourites abroad for my part let them praise me or not i know that i can do any thing i set my mind upon at present i choose to be frivolous i know i am frivolous what then if there is fun in the world am i not to laugh at it i shall astonish them by and by but i will laugh while i can i am sure there is so much misery in the world it is a mercy to be able to laugh mr pollingray may think what he likes of me when charles tells me that i must do my utmost to propitiate his uncle he cannot mean that i am to refrain from laughing because that is being a hypocrite which i may become when i have gone through all the potential moods and not before it is preposterous to suppose that i am to be tied down to the views of life of elderly people i dare say i did laugh a little too much the other night but could i help it we had a dinner party present were mr pollingray mrs kershaw the wilbury people three charles my brother duncan evelina mama papa myself and mr and mrs put them last for emphasis romer pattlecombe mrs pattlecombe the same number of syllables as pollingray and a p to begin with is thirtyone years her husbands junior and she is twentysix full of fun and always making fun of him the mildest kindest goody old thing who has never distressed himself for anything and never will mrs romer not only makes fun but is fun when you have done laughing with her you can laugh at her she is the salt of society in these parts some one as we were sitting on the lawn after dinner alluded to the mishap to papa and mama and mama who has never forgiven mr pollingray for having seen her in her ridiculous plight said that men were in her opinion greater gossips than women that is indisputable maam said mr pollingray he loves to bewilder her only we never mention it there is an excuse for us said mrs romer our trials are so great we require a diversion and so we talk of others now really said charles i dont think your trials are equal to ours for which remark papa bantered him and his uncle was sharp on him and charles i know spoke half seriously though he was seeking to draw mrs romer out he has troubles from this we fell upon a comparison of sufferings and mrs romer took up the word she is a fair smallish nervous woman with delicate hands and outlines exceedingly sympathetic so much so that while you are telling her anything she makes half a face in anticipation and is ready to shriek with laughter or shake her head with uttermost grief and sometimes if you let her go too far in one direction she does both all her narrations are with ups and downs of her hands her eyes her chin and her voice taking poor good old mr romer by the roll of his coat she made as if posing him and said there now its all very well for you to say that there is anything equal to a womans sufferings in this world i do declare you know nothing of what we unhappy women have to endure its dreadful no male creature can possibly know what tortures i have to undergo mama neatly contrived after interrupting her to divert the subject i think that all the ladies imagined they were in jeopardy but i knew mrs romer was perfectly to be trusted she has wit which pleases jusquaux ongles and her sense of humour never overrides her discretion with more than a glancenever with preparation now she pursued let me tell you what excruciating trials i have to go through this man she rocked the patient old gentleman to and fro this man will be the death of me he is utterly devoid of a sense of propriety again and again i say to himcannot the tailor cut down these trowsers of yours yes mr amble you preach patience to women but this is too much for any womans endurance now do attempt to picture to yourself what an agony it must be to mehe will shave and he will wear those enormously high trowsers that when they are braced reach up behind to the nape of his neck only yesterday morning as i was lying in bed i could see him in his dressingroom i tell you he will shave and he will choose the time for shaving early after he has braced these immensely high trowsers that make such a placard of him oh my goodness my dear romer i have said to him fifty times if i have said it once my goodness me why can you not get decent trowsers such as other men wear he has but one answerhe has been accustomed to wear those trowsers and he would not feel at home in another pair and what does he say if i continue to complain and i cannot but continue to complain for it is not only moral it is physical torment to see the sight he makes of himself he says my dear you should not have married an old man what i say to him must an old man wear antiquated trowsers no nothing will turn him those are his habits but you have not heard the worst the sight of those hideous trowsers totally destroying all shape in the man is horrible enough but it is absolutely more than a woman can bear to see himfor he will shavefirst cover his face with white soap with that ridiculous centrepiece to his trowsers reaching quite up to his poll and then you can fancy a womans rage and anguish the figure lifts its nose by the extremist tip oh its degradation what respect can a woman have for her husband after that sight imagine it and i have implored him to spare me its useless you sneer at our hbops and say that you are inconvenienced by them but you gentlemen are not degradedoh unutterablyas i am every morning of my life by that cruel spectacle of a husband i have but faintly sketched mrs romers style evelina who is prudish and thinks her vulgar refused to laugh but it came upon me as the picture of your own old husband with so irresistibly comic an effect that i was overcome by convulsions of laughter i do not defend myself it was as much a fit as any other attack i did all i could to arrest it at last i ran indoors and upstairs to my bedroom and tried hard to become dispossessed i am sure i was an example of the sufferings of my sex it could hardly have been worse for mrs romer than it was for me i was drowned in internal laughter long after i had got a grave face early in the evening mr pollingray left us chapter iii he i am carried by the fascination of a musical laugh apparently i am doomed to hear it at my own expense we are secure from nothing in this life i have determined to stand for the county an unoccupied man is a prey to every hook of folly be dilettante all your days and you might as fairly hope to reap a moral harvest as if you had chased butterflies the activities created by a profession or determined pursuit are necessary to the growth of the mind heavens i find myself writing like an illegitimate son of la rochefoucauld or of vauvenargues but it is true that i am fifty years old and i am not mature i am undeveloped somewhere the question for me to consider is whether this development is to be accomplished by my being guilty of an act of egregious folly dans la cinquantaine the reflection should produce a gravity in men such a number of years will not ring like bridal bells in a mans ears i have my books about me my horses my dogs a contented household i move in the centre of a perfect machine and i am dissatisfied i rise early i do not digest badly what is wrong the calamity of my case is that i am in danger of betraying what is wrong with me to others without knowing it myself some woman will be suspecting and tattling because she has nothing else to do girls have wonderfully shrewd eyes for a weakness in the sex which they are instructed to look upon as superior but i am on my guard the fact is manifest i feel i have been living more or less uselessly it is a fat time there are a certain set of men in every prosperous country who having wherewithal and not being compelled to toil become subjected to the moral ideal most of them in the end sit down with our sixth henry or second richard and philosophise on shepherds to be no better than a simple hind am i better prime bacon and an occasional draft of shrewd beer content him and they do not me yet i am sound and can sit through the night and be ready and on the morrow i shall stand for the county i made the announcement that i had thoughts of entering parliament before i had half formed the determination at my sisters lawn party yesterday gilbert she cried and raised her hands a woman is hurt if you do not confide to her your plans as soon as you can conceive them she must be present to assist at the birth or your plans are unblessed plans i had been speaking aside in a casual manner to my friend amble whose idea is that the church is not represented with sufficient strength in the commons and who at once as i perceived grasped the notion of getting me to promote sundry measures connected with schools and clerical stipends for his eyes dilated he said well if you do i can put you up to several things and imparting the usual chorus of yesses to his own mind he continued absently pollingray might be made strong on church rates there is much to do he has lived abroad and requires schooling in these things we want a man yes yes yes its a good idea a notion my sister however was of another opinion she did me the honour to take me aside gilbert were you serious just now quite serious is it not my characteristic not on these occasions i saw the idea come suddenly upon you you were looking at charles continue and at what was he looking he was looking at alice amble and the young lady she looked at you i was here attacked by a singularly pertinacious fly and came out of the contest with a laugh did she have that condescension towards me and from the glance my resolution to enter parliament was born it is the french vaudevillistes doctrine of great events from little causes the slipper of a soubrette trips the heart of a king and changes the destiny of a nationthe history of mankind it may be true if i were but shot into the house from a little girls eye with this i took her arm gaily walked with her and had nearly overreached myself with excess of cunning i suppose we are reduced to see more plainly that which we systematically endeavour to veil from others it is best to flutter a handkerchief instead of nailing up a curtain the principal advantage is that you may thereby go on deceiving yourself for this reason few sentiments are wholly matter of fact but when they are half so you make them concrete by deliberately seeking either to crush or conceal them and you are doubly betrayedbetrayed to the besieging eye and to yourself when a sentiment has grown to be a passion mercifully may i be spared different tactics are required by that time you will have already betrayed yourself too deeply to dare to be flippant the investigating eye is aware that it has been purposely diverted knowing some things it makes sure of the rest from which you turn it away if you want to hide a very grave case you must speak gravely about itat which season be but sure of your voice and simulate a certain depth of sentimental philosophy and you may once more and for a long period bewilder the investigator of the secrets of your bosom to sum up in the preliminary stages of a weakness be careful that you do not show your own alarm or all will be suspected should the weakness turn to fever let a little of it be seen like a careless man and nothing will really be thought i can say this i can do this and is it still possible that a pins point has got through the joints of the armour of a man like me elizabeth quitted my side with the conviction that i am as considerate an uncle as i am an affectionate brother i said to her apropos i have been observing those two it seems to me they are deciding things for themselves i have been going to speak to you about them gilbert said she and i the girl must be studied the family is good while charles is in wales you must have her at dayton she laughs rather vacantly dont you think but the sound of it has the proper wholesome ring i will give her what attention i can while she is here but in the meantime i must have a bride of my own and commence courting parliament you mean said elizabeth with a frank and tender smile the hostess was summoned to welcome a new guest and she left me pleased with her successful effort to reach my meaning and absorbed by it i would not have challenged machiavelli but i should not have encountered the florentine ruefully i feel the same keen delight in intellectual dexterity on some points my sister is not a bad match for me she can beat me seven games out of twelve at chess but the five i win sequently for then i am awake there is natural art and artificial art and the last beats the first fortunately for us women are strangers to the last they have had to throw off a mask before they have got the schooling so when they are thus armed we know what we meet and what are the weapons to be used alice if she is a fine fencer at all will expect to meet the ordinary english squire in me i have seen her at the baptismal font it is inconceivable she will fancy that at least she is ten times more subtle than i when i get the masteryit is unlikely to make me the master what may happen is that the nature of the girl will declare itself under the hard light of intimacy vulgar charles i cause to be absent for six weeks so there will be time enough for the probation i do not see him till he returns if by chance i had come earlier to see him and he to allude to her he would have had my conscience on his side and that is what a scrupulous man takes care to prevent i wonder whether my friends imagine me to be the same man whom they knew as gilbert pollingray a month back i see the change i feel the change but i have no retrospection no remorse no looking forward no feeling none for others very little for myself i am told that i am losing fluency as a dinnertable talker there is now more savour to me in a silvery laugh than in a spiced wit and this is the man who knows women and is far too modest to give a decided opinion upon any of their merits search myself through as i may i cannot tell when the change began or what the change consists of or what is the matter with me or what charm there is in the person who does the mischief she is the counterpart of dozens of girls lively browneyed brownhaired underbredit is not too harsh to say sounderbred slightly halfeducated whether quickwitted i dare not opine she is undoubtedly the last whom i or another person would have fixed upon as one to work me this unmitigated evil i do not know her and i believe i do not care to know her and i am thirsting for the hour to come when i shall study her is not this to have the poison of a bite in ones blood the wrath of venus is not a fable i was a hard reader and i despised the sex in my youth before the family estates fell to me since when i have playfully admired the sex i have dallied with a passion and not read at all save for diversion her anger is not a fable you may interpret many a mythic tale by the facts which lie in your own blood my emotions have lain altogether dormant in sentimental attachment i have i suppose boasted of python slain and cupid has touched me up with an arrow i trust to my own skill rather than to his mercy for avoiding a second from his quiver i will understand this girl if i have to submit to a close intimacy with her for six months there is no doubt of the elegance of her movements charles might as well take his tour and let us see him again next year yes her movements are or will be gracious in a years time she will have acquired the fuller tones and poetry of womanliness perhaps then too her smile will linger instead of flashing i have known infinitely lovelier women than she one i have known but let her be louise and i have long since said adieu chapter iv she behold me installed in dayton manor house and brought here for the express purpose so charles has written me word of my being studied that it may be seen whether i am worthy to be on some august future occasionpossiblya member oh so much to mumble of this great family had i known it when i was leaving home i should have countermanded the cording of my boxes if you please i do the packing and not the cording i must practise being polite or i shall be horrifying these good people i am mortally offended i am very very angry i shall show temper indeed i have shown it mr pollingray must and does think me a goose dear sir and i think you are justified if any one pretends to guess how i have names to suit that person i am a ninny an ape and mind i call myself these bad things because i deserve worse i am flighty i believe i am heartless charles is away and i suffer no pangs the truth is i fancied myself so exceedingly penetrating and it was my vanity looking in a glass i saw something that answered to my nods and howdyedos andbut i am ashamed and so penitent i might begin making a collection of beetles i cannot lift up my head mr pollingray is such a different man from the one i had imagined what that one was i have now quite forgotten i remember too clearly what the wretched guesser was i have been three weeks at dayton and if my sisters know me when i return to the vicarage they are not foolish virgins for my part i know that i shall always hate mrs romer pattlecombe and that i am unjust to the good woman but i do hate her and i think the stories shocking and wonder intensely what it was that i could have found in them to laugh at i shall never laugh again for many years perhaps when i am an old woman i may i wish the time had come all young people seem to me so helplessly silly i am one of them for the present and have no hope that i can appear to be anything else the young are a crowda shoal of small fry their elders are the select of the world on the morning of the day when i was to leave home for dayton a distance of eight miles i looked out of my window while dressingas early as halfpast sevenand i saw mr pollingrays groom on horseback leading up and down the walk a darling little round plump black cob that made my heart leap with an immense bound of longing to be on it and away across the downs and then the maid came to my door with a letter mr pollingray in return for her considerate good behaviour and saving of trouble to him officially begs his goddaughter to accept the accompanying little animal height h age years hunts is sure footed and likely to be the best jumper in the county i flew downstairs i rushed out of the house and up to my treasure and kissed his nose and stroked his mane i could not get my fingers away from him horses are so like the very best and beautifullest of women when you caress them they show their pleasure so at being petted they curve their necks and paw and look proud they take your flattery like sunshine and are lovely in it i kissed my beauty peering at his black mottled skin which is like allingborough heath in the twilight the smell of his new saddle and bridleleather was sweeter than a garden to me the man handed me a large ridingwhip mounted with silver i longed to jump up and ride till midnight then mama and papa came out and read the note and looked at my darling little cob and my sisters saw him and kissed me for they are not envious girls the most distressing thing was that we had not a riding habit in the family i was ready to wear any sort i would have ridden as a guy rather than not ride at all but mama gave me a promise that in two days a ridinghabit should be sent on to dayton and i had to let my pet be led back from where he came i had no life till i was following him i could have believed him to be a fairy prince who had charmed me i called him prince leboo because he was black and good i forgive anybody who talks about first love after what my experience has been with prince leboo what papa thought of the present i do not know but i know very well what mama thought and for my part i thought everything not distinctly including that for i could not suppose such selfishness in one so generous as mr pollingray but i came to dayton in a state of arrogant pride that gave assurance if not ease to my manners i thanked mr pollingray warmly but in a way to let him see it was the matter of a horse between us you give i register thanks and theres an end he thinks me a fool a fool my habit i said comes after me i hope we shall have some rides together many replied mr pollingray and his bow inflated me with ideas of my condescension and because miss pollingray queen elizabeth he calls her looked half sad i read it i do not write what i read it to be behold the uttermost fool of all female creation led over the house by mr pollingray he showed me the family pictures i am no judge of pictures mr pollingray you will learn to see the merits of these im afraid not though i were to study them for years you may have that opportunity oh that is more than i can expect you will develop intelligence on such subjects by and by a dull sort of distant blow struck me in this remark but i paid no heed to it he led me over the gardens and the grounds the great john methlyn pollingray planted those trees and designed the house and the flower garden still speaks of his task but he is not my master and consequently i could not share his three greatgrandsons veneration for him there are high firwoods and beech woods and a long ascending narrow meadow between them through which a brook falls in continual cascades it is the sort of scene i love for it has a woodland grandeur and seclusion that leads me to think and makes a better girl of me but what i said was yes it is the place of all others to come and settle in for the evening of ones days you could not take to it now said mr pollingray now my expression of face must have been a picture you feel called upon to decline such a residence in the morning of your days he persisted in looking at me as he spoke and i felt like something withering scarlet i am convinced he saw through me while his face was polished brass my selfpossession returned for my pride was not to be dispersed immediately please take me to the stables i entreated and there i was at home there i saw my prince leboo and gave him a thousand caresses he knows me already i said then he is some degrees in advance of me said mr pollingray is not cold dissection of ones character a cruel proceeding and i think too that a form of hospitality like this by which i am invited to be analysed at leisure is both mean and base i have been kindly treated and i am grateful but i do still say even though i may have improved under it it is unfair to proceed the dinner hour arrived the atmosphere of his own house seems to favour mr pollingray as certain soils and sites favour others he walked into the diningroom between us with his hands behind him talking to us both so easily and smoothly cheerfullynaturally and pleasantlyinimitable by any young man you hardly feel the change of room we were but three at table but there was no lack of entertainment mr pollingray is an admirable host he talks just enough himself and helps you to talk what does comfort me is that it gives him real pleasure to see a hearty appetite young men i know it for a certainty never quite like us to be so human ah which is right i would not miss the faith in our nobler essence which charles has but if it nobler one who has lived longer in the world ought to know better and mr pollingray approves of naturalness in everything i have now seen through charless eyes for several months so implicitly that i am timid when i dream of trusting to anothers judgement it is however a fact that i am not quite natural with charles every day mr pollingray puts on evening dress out of deference to his sister if young men had these good habits they would gain our respect and lose their own selfesteem less early after dinner i sang then mr pollingray read an amusing essay to us and retired to his library miss pollingray sat and talked to me of her brother and of her nephewfor whom it is that mr pollingray is beginning to receive company and is going into society charless subsequently received letter explained the receive company i could not comprehend it at the time the house has been shut up for years or rarely inhabited by us for more than a month in the year mr pollingray prefers france all his asociations i may say his sympathies are in france latterly he seems to have changed a little but from normandy to touraine and dauphinywe had a triangular home over there indeed we have it still i am never certain of my brother while miss pollingray was speaking my eyes were fixed on a vidal crayon drawing faintly coloured with chalks of a foreign ladyi could have sworn to her being frenchyoung quite girlish i doubt if her age was more than mine she is pretty is she not said miss pollingray she is almost beautiful i exclaimed and miss pollingray seeing my curiosity was kind enough not to keep me in suspense that is the marquise de mazardouinnee louise de riverolles you will see other portraits of her in the house this is the most youthful of them if i except one representing a baby and bearing her initials i remembered having noticed a similarity of feature in some of the portraits in the different rooms my longing to look at them again was like a sudden jet of flame within me there was no chance of seeing them till morning so promising myself to dream of the face before me i dozed through a conversation with my hostess until i had got the french ladys eyes and hair and general outline stamped accurately as i hoped on my mind i was no sooner on my way to bed than all had faded the torment of trying to conjure up that face was inconceivable i lay and tossed and turned to right and to left and scattered my sleep but by and by my thoughts reverted to mr pollingray and then like sympathetic ink held to the heat i beheld her again but vividly as she must have been when she was sitting to the artist the hair was naturally crisped waving thrice over the forehead and brushed clean from the temples showing the small ears and tied in a knot loosely behind her eyebrows were thick and dark but soft flowing eyebrows far lovelier to my thinking than any pencilled arch dark eyes and full not prominent i find little expression of inward sentiment in very prominent eyes on the contrary they seem to have a fishlike dependency of gaze on what is without and show fishy depths if any for instance my eyes are rather prominent and i am just the little foolbut the french lady is my theme madame la marquise your eyes are sweeter to me than celestial i never saw such candour and unaffected innocence in eyes before accept the compliment of the pauvre anglaise did you do mischief with them did vidals delicate sketch do justice to you your lips and chin and your throat all repose in such girlish grace that if ever it is my good fortune to see you you will not be aged to me i slept and dreamed of her in the morning i felt certain that she had often said mon cher gilbert to mr pollingray had he ever said ma chere louise he might have said ma bien aimee for it was a face to be loved my change of feeling towards him dates from that morning he had previously seemed to me a man so much older i perceived in him now a youthfulness beyond mere vigour of frame i could not detach him from my dreams of the night he insists upon addressing me by the terms of our official relationship as if he made it a principle of our intercourse well and is your godpapa to congratulate you on your having had a quiet rest was his greeting i answered stupidly oh yes thank you and would have given worlds for the courage to reply in french but i distrusted my accent at breakfast the opportunity or rather the excuse for an attempt was offered his french valet francois waits on him at breakfast mr pollingray and his sister asked for things in the french tongue and as if fearing some breach of civility mr pollingray asked me if i knew french yes i know it that is i understand it i stuttered allons nous parlerons francais said he but i shook my head and remained like a silly mute i was induced towards the close of the meal to come out with a few french words i was utterly shamefaced mr pollingray has got the french manner of protesting that one is all but perfect in ones speaking i know how absurd it must have sounded but i felt his kindness and in my heart i thanked him humbly i believe now that a residence in france does not deteriorate an englishman mr pollingray when in his own house has the best qualities of the two countries he is gay and yes while he makes a study of me i am making a study of him which of us two will know the other first he was papas college friendpapas junior of course and infinitely more papas junior now i observe that weakness in him i mean his clinging to youthfulness less and less but i do see it i cannot be quite in error the truth is i begin to feel that i cannot venture to mistrust my infallible judgement or i shall have no confidence in myself at all after breakfast i was handed over to miss pollingray with the intimation that i should not see him till dinner gilbert is anxious to cultivate the society of his english neighbours now that he has as he supposes really settled among them she remarked to me at his time of life the desire to be useful is almost a malady but he cherishes the poor and that is more than an occupation it is a virtue her speech has become occasionally french in the construction of the sentences mais oui i said shyly and being alone with her i was not rebuffed by her smile especially as she encouraged me on i am she told me to see a monde of french people here in september so the story of me is to be completer or continued in september i could not get miss pollingray to tell me distinctly whether madame la marquise will be one of the guests but i know that she is not a widow in that case she has a husband in that case what is the story of her relations towards mr pollingray there must be some story he would not surely have so many portraits of her about the house and they travel with him wherever he goes if she were but a lovely face to him i cannot understand it they were frequent constant visitors to one anothers estates in france always together perhaps a man of mr pollingrays age or perhaps m le marquisand here i lose myself french habits are so different from ours one thing i am certain of no charge can be brought against my englishman i read perfect rectitude in his face i would cast anchor by him he must have had a dreadful unhappiness mama kept her promise by sending my riding habit and hat punctually but i had run far ahead of all the wishes i had formed when i left home and i half feared my ride out with mr pollingray that was before i had received charless letter letting me know the object of my invitation here i require at times a morbid pride to keep me up to the work i suppose i rode befittingly for mr pollingray praised my seat on horseback i know i can ride or feel the blast of a horse like my own as he calls it yet he never could have had a duller companion my conversation was all yes and no as if it went on a pair of crutches like a miserable cripple i was humiliated and vexed all the while i was trying to lead up to the french lady and i could not commence with a single question he appears to have really cancelled the past in every respect save his calling me his goddaughter his talk was of the english poor and vegetation and papas goodness to his old dames in ickleworth parish and defects in my education acknowledged by me but not likely to restore me in my depressed state the ride was beautiful we went the length of a twelvemile ridge between ickleworth and hillford over high commons with immense views on both sides and through beechwoods oakwoods and furzy dells and downs spotted with juniper and yewtrees old picnic haunts of mine but mr pollingrays fresh delight in the landscape made them seem new and strange home through the valley the next day miss pollingray joined us wearing a feutre gris and green plume which looked exceedingly odd until you became accustomed to it her hair has decided gray streaks and that and the queen elizabeth nose and the feutre grisbut she is so kind i could not even smile in my heart it is singular that mr pollingray whos but three years her junior should look at least twenty years youngerat the very least his moustache and beard are of the colour of a corn sheaf and his blue eyes shining over them remind me of summer that describes him he is summer and has not fallen into his autumn yet miss pollingray helped me to talk a little she tried to check her brothers enthusiasm for our scenery and extolled the french paysage he laughed at her for when they were in france it was she who used to say there is nothing here like england miss fool rode between them attentive to the jingling of the bells in her cap yes and no at anybodys command in and out of season thank you charles for your letter i was beginning to think my invitation to dayton inexplicable when that letter arrived i cannot but deem it an unworthy baseness to entrap a girl to study her without a warning to her i went up to my room after i had read it and wrote in reply till the breakfastbell rang i resumed my occupation an hour later and wrote till one oclock in all fifteen pages of writing which i carefully folded and addressed to charles sealed the envelope stamped it and destroyed it i went to bed no i wont ride out to day i have a headache i repeated this about halfadozen times to nobodys knocking on the door and when at last somebody knocked i tried to repeat it once but having the message that mr pollingray particularly wished to have my company in a ride i rose submissively and cried this humiliation made my temper ferocious mr pollingray observed my face and put it down in his notebook a savage disposition or no an untamed little rebel for he has hopes of me he had the cruelty to say so what i am i shall remain said i he informed me that it was perfectly natural for me to think it and on my replying that persons ought to know themselves best at my age perhaps he said and added i cannot speak very confidently of my knowledge of myself then you make us out to be nothing better than puppets mr pollingray if we have missed an early apprenticeship to the habit of selfcommand ma filleule merci mon parrain he laughed my french i suppose i determined that if he wanted to study me i would help him i can command myself when i choose but it is only when i choose this seemed to me quite a reasonable speech until i found him looking for something to follow in explanation and on coming to sift my meaning i saw that it was temper and getting more angry continued the sort of young people who have such wonderful command of themselves are not the pleasantest no he said they disappoint us we expect folly from the young i shut my lips prince leboo knew that he must go and a good gallop reconciled me to circumstances then i was put to jumping little furzes and ditches which one cannot pretend to do without a fair appearance of gaiety for while you are running the risk of a tumble you are compelled to look cheerful and gay at least i am to fall frowning will never do i had no fall my gallant leboo made my heart leap with love of him though millstones were tied to it i may be vexed when i begin but i soon ride out a bad temper and he is mine i am certainly inconstant to charles for i think of leboo fifty times more besides there is no engagement as yet between charles and me i have first to be approved worthy by mr and miss pollingray two pairs of eyes and ears over which i see a solemnly downy owl sitting conning their reports of me it is a very unkind ordeal to subject any inexperienced young woman to it was harshly conceived and it is being remorselessly executed i would complain more loudlyin shrieksif i could say i was unhappy but every night i look out of my window before going to bed and see the long falls of the infant river through the meadow and the dark woods seeming to enclose the house from harm i dream of the old inhabitant his ancestors and the numbers and numbers of springs when the wildflowers have flourished in those woods and the nightingales have sung there and i feel there will never be a home to me like dayton chapter v he for twenty years of my life i have embraced the phantom of the fairest woman that ever drew breath i have submitted to her whims i have worshipped her feet i have i believe strengthened her principle i have done all in my devotion but adopt her religious faith and i have as i trusted some time since awakened to perceive that those twenty years were a period of mere sentimental pastime perfectly useless fruitless unless as is possible it has saved me from other follies but it was a folly in itself can ones nature be too stedfast the question whether a spice of frivolousness may not be a safeguard has often risen before me the truth i must learn to think is that my mental power is not the match for my ideal or sentimental apprehension and native tenacity of attachment i have fallen into one of the pits of a wellmeaning but idle man the world discredits the existence of pure platonism in love i myself can barely look back on those twenty years of amatory servility with a full comprehension of the part i have been playing in them and yet i would not willingly forfeit the exalted admiration of louise for my constancy as little willingly as i would have imperilled her purity i cling to the past as to something in which i have deserved well though i am scarcely satisfied with it according to our english notions i know my name english notions however are not to be accepted in all matters any more than the flat declaration of a fact will develop it in alt its bearings when our english society shall have advanced to a high civilization it will be less expansive in denouncing the higher stupidities among us much of the social judgement of bodge upon the relations of men to women is the stereotyped opinion of the land there is the dictum here for a man who adores a woman who is possessed by a husband if he has long adored her and known himself to be preferred by her in innocency of heart if he has solved the problem of being her bosoms lord without basely seeking to degrade her to being his mistress the epithets to characterise him in our vernacular will probably be all the less flattering politically we are the most selfconscious people upon earth and socially the frankest animals the terrorism of our social laws is eminently serviceable for without it such frank animals as we are might run into bad excesses i judge rather by the abstract evidence than by the examples our fair matrons give to astounded foreigners when abroad louise writes that her husband is paralysed the marquis de mazardouin is at last tasting of his mortality i bear in mind the day when he married her she says that he has taken to priestly counsel and like a woman she praises him for that it is the one thing which i have not done to please her she anticipates his decease should she be free what then my heart does not beat the faster for the thought there are twenty years upon it and they make a great load but i have a desire that she should come over to us the old folly might rescue me from the new one not that i am any further persecuted by the dread that i am in imminent danger here i have established a proper mastery over my young lady nous avons change de role alice is subdued she laughs feebly is becoming consciousa fact to be regretted if i desired to check the creatures growth there is vast capacity in the girl she has plainly not centred her affections upon charles so that a mans conscience might be at ease ifif he chose to disregard what is due to decency but why when i contest it do i bow to the worlds opinion concerning disparity of years between husband and wife i know innumerable cases of an old husband making a young wife happy my friend dr galliot married his ward and he had the best wife of any man of my acquaintance she has been publishing his learned manuscripts ever since his death that is an extreme case for he was fortyfive years her senior and stood bald at the altar old general althorpe married julia dahoop and but for his preposterous jealousy of her might be cited in proof that the ordinary reckonings are not to be a yoke on the neck of one who earnestly seeks to spouse a fitting mate though late in life but what are fifty years they mark the prime of a healthy mans existence he has by that time seen the world can decide and settle and is virtually more eligibleto use the cant phrase of gossipsthan a young man even for a young girl and may not some fair and fresh reward be justly claimed as the crown of a virtuous career i say all this yet my real feeling is as if i were bald as dr galliot and jealous as general althorpe for with my thorough knowledge of myself i were i like either one of them should not have offered myself to the mercy of a young woman or of the world nor as i am and know myself to be would i offer myself to the mercy of alice amble when my filleule first drove into dayton she had some singularly audacious ideas of her own those vivid young feminine perceptions and untamed imaginations are desperate things to encounter there is nothing beyond their reach our safety from them lies in the fact that they are always seeing too much and imagining too wildly so that with a little help from us they may be taught to distrust themselves and when they have once distrusted themselves we need not afterwards fear them their supernatural vitality has vanished i fancy my pretty alice to be in this state now she leaves us tomorrow in the autumn we shall have her with us again and louise will scan her compassionately i desire that they should meet it will be hardly fair to the english girl but if i stand in the gap between them i shall summon up no small quantity of dormant compatriotic feeling the contemplation of the contrast too may save me from both like the logic ass with the two trusses of hay on either side of him chapter vi she i am at home there was never anybody who felt so strange in her home it is not a month since i left my sisters and i hardly remember that i know them they all and even papa appear to be thinking about such petty things they complain that i tell them nothing what have i to tell my prince my own leboo if i might lie in the stall with you then i should feel thoroughly happy that is if i could fall asleep evelina declares we are not eight miles from dayton it seems to me i am eight millions of miles distant and shall be all my life travelling along a weary road to get there again just for one long sunny day and it might rain when i got there after all my trouble nobody knows nobody knows a thing the night before my departure miss pollingray did me the honour to accompany me up to my bedroom she spoke to me searchingly about charles but she did not demand compromising answers she is not in favour of early marriages so she merely wishes to know the footing upon which we stand that of friends i assured her we were simply friends it is the firmest basis of an attachment she said and i did not look hurried but i gained my end i led her to talk of the beautiful marquise this is the tale mr pollingray when a very young man and comparatively poor went over to france with good introductions and there saw and fell in love with louise de riverolles she reciprocated his passion if he would have consented to abjure his religion and worship with her madame de riverolles her mother would have listened to her entreaties but gilbert was firm mr pollingray i mean refused to abandon his faith her mother consequently did not interfere and monsieur de riverolles her father gave her to the marquis de marzardouin a roue young nobleman immensely rich and shockingly dissipated and she married him no i cannot understand french girls do as i will it is quite incomprehensible to me how louise loving another could suffer herself to be decked out in bridal finery and go to the altar and take the marriage oaths not if perdition had threatened would i have submitted i have a feeling that mr pollingray should have shown at least one years resentment at such conduct and yet i admire him for his immediate generous forgiveness of her it was fatherly she was married at sixteen his forgiveness was the fruit of his few years seniority said miss pollingray whose opinion of the marquise i cannot arrive at at any rate they have been true and warm friends ever since constantly together interchangeing visits that is why mr pollingray has been more french than english for those long years miss pollingray concluded by asking me what i thought of the story i said it is very strange french habits are so different from ours i dare say i hope perhaps indeed mr pollingray seems happy now her idea of my wits must be that they are of the schoolgirl ordera perfect receptacle for indefinite impressions ah said she gilbert has burnt his heart to ashes by this time i slept with that sentence in my brain in the morning i rose and dressed dreaming as i was turning the handle of my door to go down to breakfast suddenly i swung round in a fit of tears it was so piteous to think that he should have waited by her twenty years in a slow anguish his heart burning out without a reproach or a complaint i saw him i still see him like a martyr some people miss pollingray said i permitted themselves to think evil of my brothers assiduous devotion to a married woman there is not a spot on his character or on that of the person whom gilbert loved i would believe it in the teeth of calumny i would cling to my belief in him if i were drowning i consider that those twenty years are just nothing if he chooses to have them so he has lived embalmed in a saintly affection no wonder he considers himself still youthful he is entitled to feel that his future is before him no amount of sponging would get the stains away from my horrid red eyelids i slunk into my seat at the breakfasttable not knowing that one of the maids had dropped a letter from charles into my hand and that i had opened it and was holding it open the letter as i found afterwards told me that charles has received an order from his uncle to go over to mr pollingrays estate in dauphiny on business i am not sorry that they should have supposed i was silly enough to cry at the thought of charless crossing the channel they did imagine it i know for by and by miss pollingray whispered les absents nauront pas tort cette fois nestcepas and mr pollingray was cruelly gentle an air of i would not intrude on such emotions and i heightened their delusions as much as i could there was no other way of accounting for my pantomime face why should he fancy i suffered so terribly he talked with an excited cheerfulness meant to relieve me of course but there was no justification for his deeming me a lovesick kind of woebegone ballad girl it caused him likewise to adopt a mannerwhat to call it i cannot think tender respect frigid regard anything that accompanies and belongs to the pressure of your hand with the fingertips he said goodbye so tenderly that i would have kissed his sleeve the effort to restrain myself made me like an icicle oh adieu mon parrain
