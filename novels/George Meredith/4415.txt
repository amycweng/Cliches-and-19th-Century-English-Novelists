and david widger widgercecometnet sandra belloni by george meredith book xviii return of the sentimentalist into bondage xix life at brookfield xx by wilming weir xxi return of mr pericles xxii the pitfall of sentiment xxiii wilfrid diplomatizes xxiv emilia makes a move xxv a farce within a farce chapter xviii meantime wilfrid was leading a town life and occasionally visiting stornley he was certainly not in love with lady charlotte chillingworth but he was in harness to that lady in love we have some idea whither we would go in harness we are simply driven and the destination may be anywhere to be reduced to this condition which will happen now and then in the case of very young men who are growing up to something and is if a momentary shame to them rather a sign of promise than not the gentle male need not be deeply fascinated lady charlotte was not a fascinating person she did not lay herself out to attract had she done so she would have failed to catch wilfrid whose soul thirsted for poetical refinement and filmy delicacies in a woman what she had and what he knew that he wanted and could only at intervals assume by acting as if he possessed it was a victorious aplomb which gave her a sort of gallant glory in his sight he could act it well before his sisters and here and there a damsel and coming fresh from lady charlotte's school he had recently done so with success and had seen the ladies feel toward him as he felt under his instructress in the art some nature however is required for every piece of art wilfrid knew that he had been brutal in his representation of the part and the retrospect of his conduct at brookfield did not satisfy his remorseless critical judgement in consequence when he again saw lady charlotte his admiration of that one prized characteristic of hers paralyzed him she looked and moved and spoke as if the earth were her own she was a note of true music and he felt himself to be an indecisive chord capable ultimately of a splendid performance it might be but at present crying out to be played upon this is the condition of a man in harness whom witlings may call what they will he is subjugated not won in this state of subjugation he will joyfully sacrifice as much as a man in love for having no consolatory sense of happiness such as encircles and makes a nest for lovers he seeks to attain some stature at least by excesses of apparent devotion lady charlotte believed herself beloved at last she was about to strike thirty and rumour stalking with a turban of cloud on her head enough that this shocking old celestial dowager from condemnation had passed to pity of the dashing lady beloved at last after a while there is no question of our loving but we thirst for love if we have not had it the key of lady charlotte will come in the course of events she was at the doubtful hour of her life a warm hearted woman known to be so by few generally consigned by devout visaged scandal for who save the devout will dare to sit in the chair of judgement as a hopeless rebel against conventional laws and worse than that far worse though what is not said at stornley the following letter from emilia hit its mark dear mr wilfrid it is time for me to see you come when you have read this letter i cannot tell you how i am because my heart feels beating in another body pray come come now come on a swift horse the thought of you galloping to me goes through me like a flame that hums you will come i know it is time if i write foolishly do forgive me i can only make sure of the spelling and i cannot please you on paper only when i see you the signature of 'emilia alessandra belloni' was given with her wonted proud flourish wilfrid stared at the writing what all this time she has been thinking the same thing her constancy did not swim before him in alluring colours he regarded it as a species of folly disgust had left him the pool of memory would have had to be stirred to remind him of the pipe smoke in her hair you are sure to please me when you see me he murmured you are very confident young lady so much had her charm faded and then he thought kindly of her and that a meeting would not be good for her and that she ought to go to italy and follow her profession if she grows famous whispered coxcombry why then oneself will take a little of the praises given to her and that seemed eminently satisfactory men think in this way when you have loved them ladies all men no only the coxcombs but it is to these that you give your fresh affection they are as it were the band of the regiment of adorers marching ahead while we sober working soldiers follow to their music if she grows famous why then i can bear in mind that her heart was once in my possession and it may return to its old owner perchance wilfrid indulged in a pleasant little dream of her singing at the opera house and he tied to a ferocious detested wife how softly and luxuriously would he then be sighing for the old time it was partly good seed in his nature and an apprehension of her force of soul that kept him from a thought of evil to her passion does not inspire dark appetite dainty innocence does i am told things are tested by the emotions they provoke wilfrid knew that there was no trifling with emilia so he put the letter by commenting thus she's right she doesn't spell badly behind which to those who have caught the springs of his character volumes may be seen he put the letter by two days later at noon the card of captain gambier was brought to him in the billiard room on it was written miss belloni waits on horseback to see you wilfrid thought waits and the impossibility of escape gave him a notion of her power so you are letting that go on said lady charlotte when she heard that emilia and the captain were in company there is no fear for her whatever there is always fear when a man gives every minute of his time to that kind of business retorted her ladyship wilfrid smiled the smile of the knowing rivalry with gambier and successful too did not make emilia's admiration so tasteless some one cries out but what a weak creature is this young man i reply he was at a critical stage of his career all of us are weak in the period of growth and are of small worth before the hour of trial this fellow had been fattening all his life on prosperity the very best dish in the world but it does not prove us it fattens and strengthens us just as the sun does adversity is the inspector of our constitutions she simply tries our muscle and powers of endurance and should be a periodical visitor but until she comes no man is known wilfrid was not absolutely engaged to lady charlotte she had taken care of that and being free and feeling his heart beat in more lively fashion he turned almost delightedly to the girl he could not escape from as when the wriggling eel that has been prodded by the countryman's fork finds that no amount of wriggling will release it to it twists in a knot around the imprisoning prong this simile says more than i mean it to say but those who understand similes will know the measure due to them there sat emilia on her horse has gambier been giving her lessons thought wilfrid she sat up well balanced and as he approached began to lean gently forward to him a greeting 'equal to any lady's' there was no doubt this was the point emilia had to attain in his severe contemplation a born lady on her assured level stood a chance of becoming a goddess but ladyship was emilia's highest mark such is the state of things to the sentimental fancy when girls are at a disadvantage she smiled and held out both hands he gave her one nodding kindly but was too confused to be the light hearted cavalier lady charlotte walked up to her horse's side after receiving captain gambier's salute and said come catch hold of my hands and jump no replied emilia i only came to see him but you will see him and me in the bargain if you stay i fancy she has given her word to return early interposed wilfrid then we'll ride back with her said lady charlotte give me five minutes i'll order a horse out for you she smiled and considerately removed the captain by despatching him to the stables a quivering dimple of tenderness hung for a moment in emilia's cheeks as she looked upon wilfrid then she said falteringly i think they wish to be as we do alone cried wilfrid yes that is why i brought him over he will come anywhere with me you must be mistaken no i know it did he tell you so no mr powys did told you that lady charlotte yes not is but was and he used that wordthere is no word like ithe said 'her lover' oh mine emilia lifted her arms her voice from its deepest fall had risen to a cry wilfrid caught her as she slipped from her saddle his heart was in a tumult stirred both ways stirred with wrath and with love he clasped her tightly am i am i he breathed my lover emilia murmured he was her slave again for here was something absolutely his own his own from the roots from the first growth of sensation something with the bloom on it to which no other finger could point and say there is my mark and ladies if you will consent to be likened to a fruit you must bear with these observations and really deserve the stigma if you will smile on men because they adore you as vegetable products take what ensues lady charlotte did no more than double the time she had asked for the party were soon at a quiet canter up the lanes but entering a broad furzy common with bramble plots and oak shaws the amazon flew ahead emilia's eyes were so taken with her that she failed to observe a tiny red flowing runlet in the clay with yellow ridged banks almost baked to brick over it she was borne but at the expense of a shaking that caused her to rely on her hold of the reins ignorant of the notions of a horse outstripped wilfrid looked to see that the jump had been accomplished and was satisfied gambier was pressing his hack to keep a respectable second lady charlotte spun round suddenly crying catch the mare and galloped back to emilia who was deposited on a bush of bramble dismounting promptly the lady said my child you're not hurt not a bit emilia blinked not frightened not a bit was half whispered that's brave now jump on your feet tell me why you rode over to us this morning quick don't hesitate because i want wilfrid to see his sister cornelia came the answer with the required absence of indecision emilia ran straightway to meet wilfrid approaching and as both her hands according to her fashion were stretched out to him to assure him of her safety and take his clasp forgetful of the instincts derived from riding habits her feet became entangled she trod herself down falling plump forward and looking foolish perhaps for the first time in her life plainly feeling so up little woman said lady charlotte supporting her elbow now sir wilfrid we part here and don't spoil her courage now she has had a spill by any 'assiduous attentions' and precautions she's sure to take as many as are needed if captain gambler thinks i require an escort he may offer the captain taken by surprise bowed and flowed in ardent commonplace wilfrid did not look of a wholesome colour do you return he stammered not without a certain aspect of righteous reproach yes you will ride over to us again probably in a day or two captain gambler will see me safe from the savage admirers that crowd this country if i interpreted him rightly emilia was lifted to her seat lady charlotte sprang unassisted to hers ta ta she waved her fingers from her lips the pairs then separated one couple turning into green lanes the other dipping to blue hills chapter xix gossip of course was excited on the subject of the choice of a partner made by the member for the county cornelia placed her sisters in one of their most pleasing of difficulties she had not as yet pledged her word it was supposed that she considered it due to herself to withhold her word for a term the rumour in the family was that sir twickenham appreciated her hesitation and desired that he might be intimately known before he was finally accepted when the tinleys called they heard that cornelia's acceptance of the baronet was doubtful the copleys on the other hand distinctly understood that she had decided in his favour owing to the amiable dissension between the copleys and the tinleys each party called again giving the ladies of brookfield further opportunity for studying one of the levels from which they had risen arabella did almost all the fencing with laura tinley contemptuously as a youth of station returned from college will turn and foil an ill conditioned villager whom formerly he has encountered on the green had they often met previous to thethe proposal inquired laura and laughed i was going to say 'popping' pray do not check yourself if a phrase appears to suit you returned arabella but it was in the neighbourhood was it not they have met in the neighbourhood at richford also at richford we thought it was sudden dear that's all why should it not be perhaps the best things are it is true you congratulate us upon a benefit he is to be congratulated seriously naturally when she decides let me know early i do entreat you becausewell i am of a different opinion from some people who talk of another attachment or engagement and i do not believe in it and have said so rising to depart laura tinley resumed most singular you are aware of course that poor creature our organist i ought to say yours who looked it was mr sumner i heard say it such a good thing as if he had been a gentleman in another world and was the ghost of one in this really one of the cleverest things but he is clever barrett's his name barrett and some musical name before it like handel i mean one that we are used to well the man has totally and unexpectedly thrown up his situation his appointment said arabella permitting no surprise to be visible she paused yes i don't think we shall give our consent to her filling the post laura let it be seen that her adversary was here a sentence too quick for her ah you mean your little miss belloni was it not of her you were thinking when asked laura shamefully bewildered when you alluded to mr barrett's vacant place not at the moment i thought you must be pointing to her advancement i confess it was not in my mind in what consisted the singularity then the singularity you prefaced your remarks with the exclamation 'singular' laura showed that arabella had passed her guard she hastened to compliment her on her kindness to emilia and so sheathed her weapon for the time having just enjoyed a casual inspection of mrs chump entering the room and heard the brogue an instant irish she whispered smiling with a sort of astonished discernment of the nationality and swept through the doorway thus conveying forcibly to arabella her knowledge of what the ladies of brookfield were enduring a fine parthian shot that cornelia should hold a notable county man a baronet and owner of great acres in a state between acceptance and rejection was considered high policy by the ladies whom the idea of it elevated and they encouraged her to pursue this course without having a suspicion shrewd as they were that it was followed for any other object than the honour of the family but mr pole was in the utmost perplexity and spoke of baronets as things almost holy to be kneeled to prayed for he was profane i thought papa said cornelia that women conferred the favour when they gave their hands it was a new light to the plain merchant how should you say if a prince came and asked for you still that he asked a favour at my hands oh went mr pole in the voice of a man whose reason is outraged the placidity of cornelia's reply was not without its effect on him nevertheless he had always thought his girls extraordinary girls and born to be distinguished perhaps she has a lord in view he concluded it being his constant delusion to suppose that high towering female sense has always a practical aim at a material thing he was no judge of the sex in its youth just speak to her he said to wilfrid wilfrid had heard from emilia that there was a tragic background to this outward placidity tears on the pillow at night and long vigils emilia had surprised her weeping and though she obtained no confidences the soft mood was so strong in the stately lady that she consented to weep on while emilia clasped her petitioning on her behalf to wilfrid for aid emilia had told him the scene and he with a man's stupidity alluded to it not thinking what his knowledge of it revealed to a woman why do you vacillate and keep us all in the dark as to what you mean he began i am not prepared said cornelia the voice of humility issuing from a monument one of your oracular phrases are you prepared to be straightforward in your dealings i am prepared for any sacrifice wilfrid the marrying of a man in his position is a sacrifice i cannot leave papa and why not he is ill he does not speak of it but he is ill his actions are strange they are unaccountable he has an old friend to reside in his house it is not that i have noticed him his mindhe requires watching and how long is it since you made this discovery one sees clearer perhaps when one is not quite happy not happy then it's for him that you turn the night to tears cornelia closed her lips she divined that her betrayer must be close in his confidence she went shortly after to emilia whose secret at once stood out bare to a kindled suspicion there was no fear that cornelia would put her finger on it accusingly or speak of it directly she had the sentimentalist's profound respect for the name and notion of love she addressed emilia vaguely bidding her keep guard on her emotions and telling her there was one test of the truth of masculine protestations this will he marry you the which if you are poor is a passably infallible test emilia sucked this in thoughtfully she heard that lovers were false why then of course they were not like her lover cornelia finished what she deemed her duty and departed while emilia thought i wonder whether he could be false to me and she gave herself shrewd half delicious jarrings of pain forcing herself to contemplate the impossible thing she was in this state when mrs chump came across her and with a slight pressure of a sovereign into her hand said there it's for you little belloni and i see ye've been thinkin' me one o' the scrape hards and close fists it's pole who keeps me low on purpose and i'm a wretch if i haven't my purse full so you see i'm all in the dark in the house and don't know half so much as the sluts o' the kitchen so ye'll tell me little belloni is arr'bella goin' to marry mr annybody and is cornelia goin' to marry sir tickleham and whether mr wilfrud's goin' to marry lady charlotte chill'nworth becas my dear there's arr'bella who's sharp she is as a north easter in january which chump 'd cry out for for the sake of his ships poor fella he kneelin' by 's bedside in a long nightgown and lookin' just twice what he was she has me like a nail to my vary words and shows me that nothin' can happen betas o' what i've said and cornelia if ye'll fancy a tall codfish on its tail 'mrs chump i beg ye'll not go to believe annything of me' so i says to her 'cornelia my dear do ye think now it's true that chump went and marrud his cook that ye treat me so becas my father' i tell her 'he dealt in porrk in a large way and i was a fine woman full of the arr'stocracy and chump a little puffed out bladder of a man' so then she says 'mrs chump i listen to no gossup listen you to no gossup 'and mr wilfrud my dear he sends me on the flat o' my back laughin' and ad'la she takes and turns me right about so that i don't see the thing i'm askin' after and there's nobody but you little belloni to help me and if ye do ye shall know what the crumple of paper sounds like mrs chump gave a sugary suck with her tongue emilia returned the money to her ye're foolush said mrs chump a shut fist's good in fight and bad in friendship do ye know that open your hand excuse me persisted emilia pooh take the money or i'll say ye're in a conspiracy to make me blindman's buff of the parrty take ut i don't want it maybe it's not enough i don't want any ma'am ma'am to the deuce with ye i'll be callin' ye a forr'ner in a minute i will emilia walked away from a volley of terrific threats for some reason unfathomed by her she wanted to be alone with wilfrid and put a question to him no other in sooth than the infallible test not mind you that she wished to be married but something she had heard she had forgotten what it was disturbed her and that recent trifling with pain in her excess of happiness laid her open to it her heart was weaker and fluttered as if with a broken wing she thought if i can be near him to lean against him for one full hour it would make her strong again for she found that if her heart was rising on a broad breath suddenly for no reason that she knew it seemed to stop in its rise break and sink like a wind beaten billow once or twice in a quick fear she thought what is this is this a malady coming before death she walked out gloomily thinking of the darkness of the world to wilfrid if she should die she plucked flowers and then reproached herself with plucking them she tried to sing no not till i have been with him alone she said chiding her voice to silence a shadow crossed her mind as a spring mist dulls the glory of may suppose all singing has gone from me will he love wretched me by and by she met him in the house come out of doors to night she whispered wilfrid's spirit of intrigue was never to be taken by surprise in the wood under the pine at nine he replied not there said emilia seeing this place mournfully dark from cornelia's grief it is too still say where there's water falling one can't be unhappy by noisy water wilfrid considered and named wilming weir and there we'll sit and you'll sing to me i won't dine at home so they won't susp a fancy anything soh and you want very much to be with me my bird what am i he bent his head my lover he pressed her hand rapturously half doubting whether her pronunciation of the word had not a rather too confident twang was it not delightful he asked her that they should be thus one to the other and none know of it she thought so too and smiled happily promising secresy at his request for the sake of continuing so felicitous a life you you know have an appointment with captain gambier and i with lady charlotte chillingworth said he how dare you make appointments with a captain of hussars and he bent her knuckles fondlingly emilia smiled as before he left her with a distinct impression that she did not comprehend that part of her lesson wilfrid had just bled his father of a considerable sum of money having assured him that he was the accepted suitor of lady charlotte chillingworth besides making himself pleasant in allusion to mrs chump so far as to cast some imputation on his sisters' judgement for not perceiving the virtues of the widow the sum was improvidently large mr pole did not hear aright when he heard it named even at the repetition he went eh two or three times vacantly the amount was distinctly nailed to his ear whereupon he said ah yes you young fellows want money must have it i suppose up from the bowels of the earth up from the you're sure they're not playing the fool with you over there wilfrid understood the indication to stornley i think you need have no fear of that sir and so his father thought after an examination of the youth who was of manly shape and had a fresh non fatuous air well if that's all right sighed mr pole of course you'll always know that money's money i wish your sisters wouldn't lose their time as they do time's worth more than money what sum i told you sir i wanted there's the yacht you know and a lot of tradesmen's bills which you don't like to see standing about perhaps i had better name the round sum suppose you write down eight hundred i shan't want more for some months if you fancy it too much mr pole had lifted his head but he spoke nothing his lips and brows were rigid in apparent calculation wilfrid kept his position for a minute or so and then a little piqued he moved about he had inherited the antipathy to the discussion of the money question and fretted to find it unnecessarily prolonged shall i come to you on this business another time sir no god bless my soul cried his father are you going to keep this hanging over me for ever eight hundred you said he mumbled salary of a chief clerk of twenty years' standing eight twice four there you have it exactly will you send it me in a letter said wilfrid out of patience i'll send it you in a letter assented his father upon which wilfrid changed his mind i can take a chair though i can easily wait for it now save trouble if i send it eh do you wish to see whether you can afford it sir i wish to see you show more sense with your confounded 'afford' have you any idea of bankers' books bankers' accounts mr pole fished his cheque book from a drawer and wrote wilfrid's name and the sum tore out the leaf and tossed it to him there i've written to day don't present it for a week he rubbed his forehead hastily touching here and there a paper to put it scrupulously in a line with the others wilfrid left him and thought kind old boy of course he always means kindly but i think i see a glimpse of avarice as a sort of a sign of age coming on i hope he'll live long wilfrid was walking in the garden imagining perhaps that he was thinking as the swarming sensations of little people help them to imagine when cornelia ran hurriedly up to him and said come with me to papa he's ill i fear he is going to have a fit i left him sound and well just now said wilfrid this is your mania i found him gasping in his chair not two minutes after you quitted him dearest he is in a dangerous state wilfrid stept back to his father and was saluted with a ready well as he entered but the mask had slipped from half of the old man's face and for the first time in his life wilfrid perceived that he had become an old man well sir you sent for me he said girls always try to persuade you you're ill that's all returned mr pole his voice was subdued but turning to cornelia he fired up it's preposterous to tell a man who carries on a business like mine you've observed for a long while that he's queer there my dear child i know that you mean well i shall look all right the day you're married this allusion and the sudden kindness drew a storm of tears to cornelia's eyelids papa if you will but tell me what it is she moaned a nervous frenzy seemed to take possession of him he ordered her out of the room she was gone but his arm was still stretched out and his expression of irritated command did not subside wilfrid took his arm and put it gently down on the chair saying you're not quite the thing to day sir are you a fool as well mr pole retorted what do you know of to make me ill i live a regular life i eat and drink just as you all do and if i have a headache i'm stunned with a whole family screaming as hard as they can that i'm going to die damned hard i say sir it's he fell into a feebleness a little glass of brandy i think wilfrid suggested and when mr pole had gathered his mind he assented begging his son particularly to take precautions to prevent any one from entering the room until he had tasted the reviving liquor chapter xx a half circle of high banked greensward studded with old park trees hung round the roar of the water distant enough from the white twisting fall to be mirrored on a smooth heaved surface while its out pushing brushwood below drooped under burdens of drowned reed flags that caught the foam keen scent of hay crossing the dark air met emilia as she entered the river meadow a little more and she saw the white weir piles shining and the grey roller just beginning to glisten to the moon eastward on her left behind a cedar the moon had cast off a thick cloud and shone through the cedar bars with a yellowish hazy softness making rosy gold of the first passion of the tide which writhing and straining on through many lights grew wide upon the wonderful velvet darkness underlying the wooded banks with the full force of a young soul that leaps from beauty seen to unimagined beauty emilia stood and watched the picture then she sat down hushed awaiting her lover wilfrid as it chanced was ten minutes late she did not hear his voice till he had sunk on his knee by her side what a reverie he said half jealously isn't it lovely here emilia pressed his hand but without turning her face to him as her habit was he took it for shyness and encouraged her with soft exclamations and expansive tenderness i wish i had not come here she murmured tell me why he folded his arm about her waist why did you let me wait said she wilfrid drew out his watch blamed the accident that had detained him and remarked that there were not many minutes to witness against him she appeared to throw off her moodiness you are here at last let me hold your hand and think and be quite silent you shall hold my hand and think and be quite silent my own girl if you will tell me what's on your mind emilia thought it enough to look in his face smiling has any one annoyed you he cried out no one then receive the command of your lord that you kiss him i will kiss him said emilia and did so the salute might have appeased an imperious lord but was not so satisfactory to an exacting lover he perceived however that whether as lover or as lord he must wait for her now owing to her having waited for him so he sat by her permitting his hand to be softly squeezed and trying to get at least in the track of her ideas while her ear was turned to the weir and her eyes were on the glowing edges of the cedar tree finally on one of many deep breaths she said it's over why were you late but never mind now never let it be long again when i am expecting you it's then i feel so much at his mercy i mean if i am where i hear falling water sometimes thunder wilfrid masked his complete mystification with a caressing smile not without a growing respect for the only person who could make him experience the pangs of conscious silliness you see he was not a coxcomb that german emilia enlightened him your old music master i wish it i wish it i should soon be free from him don't you know that dreadful man i told you about who's like a black angel to me because there is no music like his and he's a german i told you how i first dreamed about him and then regularly every night after talking with my father about italy and his black yellow tedeschi this man came over my pillow and made me call him master master and he is he seems as if he were the master of my soul mocking me making me worship him in spite of my hate i came here thinking only of you i heard the water like a great symphony i fell into dreaming of my music that's when i am at his mercy there's no one like him i must detest music to get free from him how can i he is like the god of music wilfrid now remembered certain of her allusions to this rival who had hitherto touched him very little perhaps it was partly the lovely scene that lifted him to a spiritual jealousy partly his susceptibility to a sentimental exaggeration and partly the mysterious new charm in emilia's manner that was as a bordering lustre showing how the full orb was rising behind her his name wilfrid asked for emilia's lips broke to the second letter of the alphabet but she cut short the word why should you hear it and now that you are here you drive him away and the best is she laughed i am sure you will not remember any of his pieces i wish i could not not that it's the memory but he seems all round me up in the air and when the trees move all togetheryou chase him away my lover it was like a break in music the way that emilia suddenly closed her sentence coming with a shock of flattering surprise upon wilfrid then she pursued my english lover i am like italy in chains to that german and youbut no no no it's not quite a likeness for my german is not a brute i have seen his picture in shop windows the wind seemed in his hair and he seemed to hear with his eyes his forehead frowning so look at me and see so emilia pressed up the hair from her temples and bent her brows it does not increase your beauty said wilfrid there's the difference emilia sighed mildly he sees angels cherubs and fairies and imps and devils or he hears them they come before him from far off in music they do to me now and then only now and then when my head's on fire my lover wilfrid pressed his mouth to the sweet instrument she took his kiss fully and gave her own frankly in return then sighing a very little she said do not kiss me much why not no but look at me i will look at you only take my hand see the moon is getting whiter the water there is like a pool of snakes and then they struggle out and roll over and over and stream on lengthwise i can see their long flat heads and their eyes almost their skins no my lover do not kiss me i lose my peace wilfrid was not willing to relinquish his advantage and the tender deep tone of the remonstrance was most musical and catching what if he pulled her to earth from that rival of his in her soul she would then be wholly his own his lover's sentiment had grown rageingly jealous of the lordly german but emilia said i have you on my heart more when i touch your hand only and think if you kiss me i go into a cloud and lose your face in my mind yes yes replied wilfrid pleased to sustain the argument for the sake of its fruitful promises but you must submit to be kissed my darling you will have to she gazed inquiringly when you are married i mean when will you marry me she said the heir apparent of the house of pole blinked probably at that moment more foolishly than most mortal men have done taming his astonishment to represent a smile he remarked when are you thinking about it already she answered in a quiet voice that conveyed the fact forcibly yes but you're too young yet and you're going to italy to learn in the schools you wouldn't take a husband there with you would you what would the poor devil do but you are not too young said she wilfrid supposed not could you not go to my italy with me impossible what as a dangling husband wilfrid laughed scornfully they would love you too she said they are such loving people oh come consent to come my lover i must learn if i do not you will despise me how can i bring anything to lay at your feet my dear my dear if i do not impossible wilfrid reiterated as one who had found moorings in the word then i will give up italy he had not previously acted hypocrite with this amazing girl nevertheless it became difficult not to do so he could scarcely believe that he had on a sudden and by strange agency slipped into an earnest situation emilia's attitude and tone awakened him to see it her hands were clenched straight down from the shoulders all that she conceived herself to be renouncing for his sake was expressed in her face would you really he murmured i will and be english altogether be yours mine yes from this time now stirred his better nature though not before had he sceptically touched her lips and found them cold as if the fire had been taken out of them by what they had uttered he felt that it was no animal love but the force of a soul drawn to him and forgetting the hypocritical foundation he had laid he said how proud i shall be of you i shall go with you to battle returned emilia my little darling you won't care to see those black fellows killed will you emilia shuddered no poor things why do you hurt them kill wicked people tyrant white coats and we will not talk of killing now proud of me if i can make you you sigh so heavily something makes me feel like a little beggar when i tell you i love you yes but i only feel rich when i am giving and i seem to have nothing to give now now that i have lost italy but you give me your love don't you all of it but i seem to give it to you in tatters it's like a beggar like a day without any sun do you think i shall have that idea when i hear you sing to me and know that this little leaping fountain of music here is mine dim rays of a thought led emilia to remark must not men keel to women i mean if they are to love them for ever wilfrid smiled gallantly i will kneel to you if it pleases you not now you should have done so once i dreamed only once just for a moment in italy when all were crying out to me that i had caught their hearts i fancied standing out like a bright thing in a dark crowd and then saying i am his pointing to you and folding my arms waiting for you to take me the lover's imagination fired at the picture and immediately he told a lover's lie for the emotion excited by the thought of her glory coloured deliciously that image of her abnegation of all to him he said i would rather have you as you are emilia leaned to him more and the pair fixed their eyes on the moon that had now topped the cedar and was pure silver silver on the grass on the leafage on the waters and in the west facing it was an arch of twilight and tremulous rose as if a spirit hung there over the shrouded sun at least thought wilfrid heaven and the beauty of the world approve my choice and he looked up fancying that he had a courage almost serene to meet his kindred with emilia on his arm she felt his arm dreamily stressing its clasp about her and said now i know you love me and you shall take me as i am i need not be so poor after all my dear my dear i cannot see beyond you is that your misery said he my delight my pleasure one can live a life anywhere and how can i belong to italy if i am yours do you know when we were silent just now i was thinking that water was the history of the world flowing out before me all mixed up of kings and queens and warriors with armour and shouting armies battles and numbers of mixed people and great red sunsets with women kneeling under them do you know those long low sunsets i love them they look like blood spilt for love the noise of the water and the moist green smell gave me hundreds of pictures that seemed to hug me i thought what could stir music in me more than this and am i not just as rich if i stay here with my lover instead of flying to strange countries that i shall not care for now so you shall take me as i am i do not feel poor any longer with that she gave him both her hands yes said wilfrid as if struck by the ridicule of so feeble a note falling upon her passionate speech he followed it up with the yes of a man adding whatever you are you are my dear girl my own love mine having said it he was screwed up to feel it as nearly as possible such virtue is there in uttered words then he set about resolutely studying to appreciate her in the new character she had assumed to him it is barely to be supposed that he should understand what in her love for him she sacrificed in giving up italy as she phrased it he had some little notion of the sacrifice but as he did not demand any sacrifice of the sort and as this involved a question perplexing irritating absurd he did not regard it very favourably as mistress of his fancy her prospective musical triumphs were the crown of gold hanging over her as wife of his bosom they were not to be thought of but the wife of his bosom must take her place by virtue of some wondrous charm what was it that emilia could show if not music beautiful eyebrows thick rare eyebrows no doubt couched upon her full eyes they were a marvel and her eyes were a marvel she had a sweet mouth too though the upper lip did not boast the aristocratic conventional curve of adorable pride or the under lip a pretty droop to a petty rounded chin her face was like the aftersunset across a rose garden with the wings of an eagle poised outspread on the light some such coloured vague magnified impression wilfrid took of her still it was not quite enough to make him scorn contempt should it whisper nor even quite enough to combat successfully the image of elegant dames in their chosen attitudes the queenly moments when perhaps they enter an assembly or pour out tea with an exquisite exhibition of arm or recline upon a couch commanding homage of the world of little men what else had this girl to count upon to make her exclusive a devoted heart she had a loyal heart and perfect frankness a mind impressible intelligent and fresh she gave promise of fair companionship at all seasons she could put a spell upon him moreover by that power of hers never wilfully exercised she came in spite of the effect left on him by her early awkwardnesses and 'animalities' nearer to his idea of superhuman nature than anything he knew of but how would she be regarded when the announcement of mrs wilfrid pole brought scrutinizing eyes and gossiping mouths to bear on her it mattered nothing he kissed her and the vision of the critical world faded to a blank whatever she was he was her prime luminary so he determined to think that he cast light upon a precious an unrivalled land you are my own are you not emilia yes i am she answered that water seems to say 'for ever' he murmured and emilia's fingers pressed upon his of marriage there was no further word her heart was evidently quite at ease and that it should be so without chaining him to a date was wilfrid's peculiar desire he could pledge himself to eternity but shrank from being bound to eleven o'clock on the morrow morning so now the soft summer hours flew like white doves from off the mounting moon and the lovers turned to go all being still even the noise of the waters still to their ears as life that is muffled in sleep they saw the cedar grey edged under the moon and night that clung like a bat beneath its ancient open palms the bordering sward about the falls shone silvery in its shadow was a swan these scenes are but beckoning hands to the hearts of lovers waving them on to that eden which they claim but when the hour has fled they know it and by the palpitating light in it they know that it holds the best of them chapter xxi at this season mr pericles reappeared he had been he said through paris turin milano veniss and by trieste over the summering to vienna on a tour for a voice and in no part of the continent his vehement declaration assured the ladies had he found a single one it was one universal croak ahi and mr pericles could affirm that purgatory would have no pains for him after the torments he had recently endured zey are frogs if zey are not geese said mr pericles i give up opera is dead hein for a time and he smiled almost graciously adding where is she for emilia was not present the ladies now perceived a greatness of mind in the greek's devotion to music and in his non mercenary travels to assist managers of opera by discovering genius his scheme for emilia fired them with delight they were about to lay down all the material arrangements at once but mrs chump who had heard that there was a new man in the house now entered the room prepared to conquer him as thus after a short form of introduction d'ye do sir and ye're mr paricles oh but ye're a sultan they say not in morr'ls sir and vary pleasant to wander on the cont'nent with a lot o' lacqueys at your heels it's what a bachelor can do but i ask ye sir is ut fair ye think to the poor garls that has to stop at home hereat the ladies of brookfield thus miserably indicated drew upon their self command that sprang from the high sense of martyrdom mr pericles did not reply to mrs chump at all he turned to adela saying aloud what is zis person it might have pleased them to hear any slight put publicly on mrs chump in the first resistance to the woman but in the present stage their pride defended her our friend was the reply with which arabella rebuked his rudeness and her sister approved her we can avoid showing that we are weak in our own opinion whatsoever degrades us they had said during a consultation simultaneously they felt that mr pericles being simply a millionaire and not in society being also a middle class foreigner a greek whose fathers ran with naked heels and long lank hair on the shores of the aegean before such a man they might venture to identify this their guest with themselves an undoubted duty in any case but not always to be done at least not with grace and personal satisfaction therefore the our friend dispersed a common gratulatory glow very small points my masters but how are coral islands built mrs chump fanned her cheek in complete ignorance of the offence and defence chump deceased in amorous mood had praised her management of the fan once when breath was in him 'martha says he winkin' a sort of 'mavourneen' at me ye know 'martha with a fan in your hand if ye're not a black eyed beauty of a spaniard ye little devil of seville' says he this she had occasionally confided to the ladies the marital eulogy had touched her and she was not a woman of coldly flowing blood she had an excuse for the constant employment of the fan and well mr paricles have ye got nothin' to tell us about foreign countesses and their slips because we can listen sir garls or not sure if they understand ye ye teach 'em nothin' and if they don't understand ye where's the harm done d'ye see sir it's clear in favour of talkin' mr pericles administered consolation to his moustache by twisting it into long waxy points i do not know i do not know he put her away with from time to time in the end mrs chump leaned over to arabella don't have 'm my dear she murmured you mean quoth arabella here's the driest stick that aver stood without sap arabella flushed when she took the implication that she was looking on the man as a husband adela heard the remarks and flushed likewise mrs chump eyed them both it's for the money o' the man she soliloquized aloud as her fashion was adela jumped up and with an easy sprightly posture of her fair commonly studious person and natural run of notes oh she cried i begin to feel what it is to be like a live fish on the fire frying frying frying and if he can keep his christian sentiments under this infliction what a wonderful hero he must be what a hot day she moved swiftly to the door and flung it open a sight met her eyes at which she lost her self possession she started back uttering a soft cry ah aha oh went the bitter ironic drawl of mr pericles whose sharp glance had caught the scene as well emilia came forward with a face like sunset diplomacy under the form of wilfrid pole kicked its heels behind and said a word or two in a tone of false cheerfulness oh so mr pericles frowned while emilia held her hand out to him yeas you are quite well h'm you are burnt like a bean hein i shall ask you what you have been doing by and by happily for decency mrs chump had not participated in the fact presented by ocular demonstration she turned about comfortably to greet wilfrid uttering the inspired remark ye look red from a sly kiss for one said he sharpening his blunted wits on this dull instrument the ladies talked down their talk then wilfrid and mr pericles interchanged quasi bows oh if he doesn't show his upper teeth like an angry cat or a leopard i've seen cried mrs chump in adela's ear designating mr pericles does he know mr wilfrud's in the british army and a new lieuten't gazetted and all mr pericles certainly did not look pleasantly upon wilfrid emilia received his unconcealed wrath and spite go and sing a note he said at the piano emilia quietly asked at piano harp what you will it is ze voice i want emilia pitched her note high from a full chest and with glad bright eyes which her fair critics thought just one degree brazen after the revelation in the doorway mr pericles listened wearing an aching expression as if he were sending one eye to look up into his brain for a judgement disputed in that sovereign seat still she held on and then gave a tremulous rich contralto note oh the human voice cried adela overcome by the transition of tones like going from the nightingale to the nightjar said arabella mrs chump remarked ye'll not find a more susceptible woman to musuc than me wilfrid looked away pride coursed through his veins in a torrent when the voice was still mr pericles remained in a pondering posture you go to play fool with zat voice in milano you are flogged he cried terribly shaking his forefinger wilfrid faced round in wrath but mr pericles would not meet his challenge continuing you hear you hear so and mr pericles brought the palms of his hands in collision marcy man mrs chump leaped from her chair d'ye mean that those horrud forr'ners'll smack a full grown young woman don't go to 'm my dear now take my 'dvice little belloni and don't go it isn't the sting o' the smack ye know shall i sing anything to you emilia addressed mr pericles the latter shrugged to express indifference nevertheless she sang she had never sung better mr pericles clutched his chin in one hand elbow on knee the ladies sighed to think of the loss of homage occasioned by the fact of so few being present to hear her wilfrid knew himself the fountain of it all and stood fountain like in a shower of secret adulation a really happy fellow this that his beloved should be the centre of eyes and pronounced exquisite by general approbation besides subjecting him to a personal spell this was what he wanted it was mournful to think that circumstance had not at the same time created the girl of noble birth or with an instinct for spiritual elegance but the world is imperfect presently he became aware that she was understood to be singing pointedly to him upon which he dismissed the council of his sensations and began to diplomatize cleverly leaning over to adela he whispered pericles wants her to go to italy my belief is that she won't and why returned adela archly reproachful well we've been spoiling her a little perhaps i mean we men of course but i really don't think that i'm chiefly to blame you won't allow captain gambier to be in fault i know why not said adela well if you will then he is the principal offender adela acted disbelief but unprepared for her brother's perfectly feminine audacity of dissimulation she thought he can't be in earnest about the girl and was led to fancy that gambier might and to determine to see whether it was so by this manoeuvre wilfrid prepared for himself a defender when the charge was brought against him mr pericles was thunderstruck on hearing emilia refuse to go to italy a scene of tragic denunciation on the one hand and stubborn decision on the other ensued i shall not mind zis he spoke of love and the awakening of the female heart not when you are trained it is good zen and you have fire from it but now little fool i say it is too airly too airly how shall you learn eh with your brain upon a man and your voice little fool a thing of caprice zat comes and goes as he will not you will hein like a barrel organ which he turns ze handle mon dieu why did i leave her mr pericles struck his brow with his wrist clutching at the long thin slice of hair that did greasy duty for the departed crop on his poll did i not know it was a woman and so you are what you say in lofe emilia replied i have not said so with exasperating coolness you have your eye on a man and i know him zat man when he is tired of you whiff away you go a puff of smoke and you zat i should make a queen of opera a queen you shall have more rule zan twenty queens forty see mr pericles made his hand go like an aspen leaf from his uplifted wrist so you shall set ze hearts of sossands to dream of you to adore you and flowers flowers everywhere on your head at your feet you choose your lofer from ze world a husband if it is your taste bose if you please zen i say you shall you shall lofe a man let him tease and sting ah it will be magnifique aha ze voice will sharpen go deep yeas to be a tale of blood lofe till you could stab yourself brava but now little fool i say emilia believed that she was verily forfeiting an empire her face wore a soft look of delight this renunciation of a splendid destiny for wilfrid's sake seemed to make her worthier of him and as mr pericles unrolled the list of her rejected treasures her bosom heaved without a regret ha mr pericles flung away from her go and be a little gutter girl the musical connoisseur drew on his own disappointment alone for eloquence had he been thinking of her he might have touched cunningly on her love for italy music was the passion of the man and a millionaire's passion is something that can make a stir he knew that in emilia he had discovered a pearl of song rarely to be found and his object was to polish and perfect her at all cost perhaps as a secondary and far removed consideration to point to her as a thing belonging to him for which emperors might envy him the thought of losing her drove him into fits of rage he took the ladies one by one and treated them each to a horrible scene of gesticulation and outraged english h accused their brother of conduct which they were obliged to throw by a process of their own into the region of fine shades before they dared venture to comprehend him gross facts in relationship with the voice this grievous machine not man as they said stated to them harshly impetuously the ladies felt that he had bored their ears with hot iron pins adela tried laughter as a defence from his suggestion against wilfrid but had shortly afterwards to fly from the fearful anatomist she served her brother thoroughly in the council of three so that mr pericles was led by them to trust that there had been mere fooling in his absence and that the emotions he looked to as the triumphant reserve in emilia's bosom to be aroused at some crisis when she was before the world slumbered still she on her part contrasting her own burning sensations with this quaint innocent devotion to art and passion for music felt in a manner guilty and whenever he stormed with additional violence she became suppliant and seemed to bend and have regrets mr pericles would then say with mollified irritability you will come to italy to morrow ze day after not at all the last was given with a roar for lack of her immediate response emilia would find a tear on her eyelids at times surround herself as she might with her illusions she had no resting place in wilfrid's heart and knew it she knew it as the young know that they are to die on a future day without feeling the sadness of it but with a dimly prevalent idea that this life is therefore incomplete and again her blood as with a wave of rich emotion washed out the blank spot she thought what can he want but my love and thus she satisfied her own hungry questioning by seeming to supply an answer to his the ladies of brookfield by no means encouraged emilia to refuse the generous offer of mr pericles they thought too that she might might she oh certainly she might go to italy under his protection would you let one of your blood asked wilfrid brutally with some cunning he led them to admit that emilia's parents should rightly be consulted in such a case one day mr pericles said to the ladies i shall give a fete a party monstre in ze air on grass i beg you to invite friends of yours before the excogitation of this splendid resolve he had been observed to wear for some period a conspiratorial aspect when it was delivered and arabella had undertaken the management of the party monstre which was to be on besworth lawn and as it was not their own party could be conducted with a sort of quasi contemptuous superiority to incongruous gatherings this being settled the forehead of mr pericles cleared and he ceased to persecute emilia i am not one that is wopped he said significantly nodding to his english hearers as if this piece of shrewd acquaintance with the expressive mysteries of their language placed them upon equal terms it was really 'a providential thing' as devout people phrase it that laura tinley and mabel copley should call shortly after this and invite the ladies to a proposed picnic of theirs on besworth lawn on besworth lawn of all places and they used the word 'picnic' a word suggestive of gnawed drumstick and ginger beer bottles adela quoted some scapegoat of her acquaintance as her way was when she wished to be pungent without incurring the cold sisterly eye of reproof for a vulgarism both laura and mabel when they heard of the mighty entertainment fixed for besworth lawn by mr pericles looked down they were invited and looked up there was the usual amount of fencing with the combative laura who gave ground at all points and as she was separating said so sweetly of course you have heard of the arrest of your what does one call him friend or a french word you mean quoth arabella that poor neatly brushed nice creature whom you patronized who played the organ she jerked to arabella's dubious eyes and he arabella smiled complacently then perhaps you may know that all is arranged for him said laura interpreting by the look more than the word after a habit of women indeed to tell you the truth i know nothing said arabella really laura turned sharply to cornelia who met her eyes and did not exhibit one weak dimple the story was that mr chips the bookseller of hillford objected to the departure of mr barrett until mr barrett had paid the bill of mr chips and had signified his objection in the form of a writ when if you know anything of law said laura you will see why he remains for a writ once served you are a prisoner that is i believe if it's above twenty pounds and mr chips' bill against mr barrett was i have heard twenty three pounds and odd shillings could anything be more preposterous and mr chips deserves to lose his money ah to soar out of such a set as this of which laura tinley is a sample are not some trifling acts of inhumanity and practices in the art of 'cutting' permissible so the ladies had often asked of the unseen in their onward course if they did not pointedly put the question now surely they had no desire to give pain but the nature that endowed them with a delicate taste inspired them to defend it they listened gravely to laura who related that not only english books but foreign repeated and emphasized had been supplied by mr chips to mr barrett they were in the library and laura's eyes rested on certain yellow and blue covers of books certainly not designed for the reading of mr pole i think you must be wrong as to mr barrett's position said adela no dear not at all laura was quick to reply unless you know anything he has stated that he awaits money remittances he has in fact overrun the constable and my brother albert says the constable is very likely to overrun ham in consequence only a joke but an organist with at the highest computation poor absurd thing fifty five pounds per annum additional for singing lessons it is true but an organist with a bookseller's bill of twenty three pounds consider foreign books too interjected adela not so particularly improving to his morals either added laura you are severe upon the greater part of the human race said arabella so are the preachers dear returned laura the men of our religion justify you asked arabella let me see where were we laura retreated in an affected mystification you had reached the enlightened belief that books written by any but english hands were necessarily destructive of men's innocence said arabella and her sisters thrilled at the neatness of the stroke for the moment while they forgot the ignoble object it transfixed laura was sufficiently foiled by it to be unable to return to the chips barrett theme throughout the interview cornelia had maintained a triumphant posture superior to arabella's skill in fencing seeing that it exposed no weak point of the defence by making an attack and concealed especially the confession implied by a relish for the conflict her sisters considerately left her to recover herself after this mighty exercise of silence chapter xxii cornelia sat with a clenched hand you are rich and he is poor was the keynote of her thoughts repeated from minute to minute and it is gold gives you the right in the world's eye to despise him she apostrophized the vanished laura clothing gold with all the baseness of that person now when one really hates gold one is at war with one's fellows the tide sets that way there is no compromise to hate it is to try to stem the flood it happens that this is one of the temptations of the sentimentalist who should reflect but does not that the fine feelers by which the iniquities of gold are so keenly discerned are a growth due to it nevertheless those 'fine feelers' or antennae of the senses come of sweet ease that is synonymous with gold in our island latitude the sentimentalists are represented by them among the civilized species it is they that sensitively touch and reject touch and select whereby the laws of the polite world are ultimately regulated and civilization continually advanced sometimes ridiculously the sentimentalists are ahead of us not by weight of brain but through delicacy of nerve and like all creatures in the front they are open to be victims i pray you to observe again the shrinking life that afflicts the adventurous horns of the snail for example such are the sentimentalists to us the fat body of mankind we owe them much and though they scorn us let us pity them especially when they are young they deserve pity for they suffer cruelly i for my part prefer to see boys and girls led into the ways of life by nature but i admit that in many cases in most cases our good mother has not occupied as her hands must be made them perfectly presentable by which fact i am warned to have tolerance for the finer beings who labour under these excessive sensual subtleties i perceive their uses and they are right good comedy for which i may say that i almost love them man is the laughing animal and at the end of an infinite search the philosopher finds himself clinging to laughter as the best of human fruit purely human and sane and comforting so let us be cordially thankful to those who furnish matter for sound embracing laughter cornelia detested gold entirely on general grounds and for abstract reasons not a word of mr barrett was shaped even in fancy but she interjected to herself with meditative eye and mouth the saints were poor the saints of whom he had read translating from that old latin book st francis how divine was his life and so forth until the figure of mr penniless barrett walked out in her imagination clad in saintly garments superior not only to his creditor mr chips but to all who bought or sold i have been false she said implying the to him seeing him on that radiant height above her she thought how could i have fallen so it was impossible for her mind to recover the delusion which had prompted her signing herself to bondage pledging her hand to a man she did not love could it have been that she was guilty of the immense folly simply to escape from that piece of coarse earth mrs chump cornelia smiled sadly saying oh no i should not have committed a wickedness for so miserable an object despairing for a solution of the puzzle she cried out i was mad and with a gasp of horror saw herself madly signing her name to perdition i was mad is a comfortable cloak to our sins in the past mournful to think that we have been bereft of reason but the fit is over and we are not in bedlam cornelia next wrestled with the pride of mr barrett why had he not come to her once after reading the line pencilled in the book was it that he would make her his debtor in everything he could have reproached her justly why had he held aloof she thirsted to be scourged by him to hang her head ashamed under his glance and hug the bitter pain he dealt her revolving how the worst man on earth would have behaved to a girl partially in his power hands had been permitted to be pressed and the gateways of the eyes had stood open all but vows had been interchanged she came to regard mr barrett as the best man on the earth that she alone saw it did not depreciate the value of her knowledge a goal gloriously illumined blazed on her from the distance too late she put a curb on the hot courses in her brain and they being checked turned all at once to tears and came in a flood how indignant would the fair sentimentalist have been at a whisper of her caring for the thing before it was too late cornelia now daily trod the red pathways under the firs and really imagined herself to be surprised even vexed when she met mr barrett there at last emilia was by his side near a drooping birch she beckoned to cornelia whose north pole armour was doing its best to keep down a thumping heart we are taking our last walk in the old wood said mr barrett admirably collected that is i must speak for myself you leave early cornelia felt her throat rattle hideously in two days i expect i hope said he why does he hope thought cornelia wounded until a vision of the detaining chips struck her with pity and remorse she turned to emilia our dear child is also going to leave us i cried emilia fierily out of languor does not your italy claim you i am nothing to italy any more have i not said so i love england now cornelia smiled complacently let us hope your heart is capacious enough to love both then your theory is mr barrett addressed cornelia in the winning old style that the love of one thing enlarges the heart for another should it not she admired his cruel self possession pitiably as she contrasted her own husky tones with it emilia looked from one to the other fancying that they must have her case somewhere in prospect since none could be unconscious of the vehement struggle going on in her bosom but they went farther and farther off from her comprehension and seemed to speak of bloodless matters and yet he is her lover she thought when they meet they talk across a river and he knows she is going to another man and does not gripe her wrist and drag her away the sense that she had no kinship with such flesh shut her mouth faster than wilfrid's injunctions which were ordinarily conveyed in too subtle a manner for her to feel their meaning enough to find them binding cornelia for a mask to her emotions gave emilia a gentle albeit high worded lecture on the artist's duty toward art quoting favourite passages from mr barrett's favourite art critic and her fashion of dropping her voice as she declaimed the more dictatorial sentences to imply one might guess by a show of personal humility that she would have you to know her preaching was vicarious that she stood humbly in the pulpit and was but a vessel for the delivery of the burden of the oracle all this was beautiful to him who could see it i cannot think it was wholesome for him nor that cornelia was unaware of a naughty wish to glitter temporarily in the eyes of the man who made her feel humble the sorcery she sent through his blood communicated itself to hers when she had done emilia convincedly vanquished by big words said i cannot talk and turned heavily from them without bestowing a smile upon either cornelia believed that the girl would turn back as abruptly as she had retreated and it was not until emilia was out of sight that she remembered the impropriety of being alone with mr barrett the pitfall of sentiment yawned visible but this lady's strength had been too little tried for her to lack absolute faith in it so out of deep silences the two leapt to speech and immediately subsided to the depths again as on a sultry summer's day fishes flash their tails in the sunlight and leave a solitary circle widening on the water then cornelia knew what was coming in set phrase and as one who performs a duty frigidly pleasant he congratulated her on her rumored union one hand was in his buttoned coat the other hung elegantly loose not a feature betrayed emotion he might have spoken it in a ballroom to cornelia who exulted in self compression after the roman method it was more dangerous than a tremulous tone you know me too well to say this mr barrett the words would come she preserved her steadfast air when they had escaped to conceal her shame seeing thus much he took it to mean that it was a time for plain speaking to what end he did not ask you have not to be told that i desire your happiness above all earthly things he said and the lady shrank back and made an effort to recover her footing had he not been so careful to obliterate any badge of the squire of low degree at his elbows cuffs collar kneecap and head piece she might have achieved it with better success for cynicism the younger brother of sentiment and inheritor of the family property is always on the watch to deal fatal blows through such vital parts as the hat or the h's or indeed any sign of inferior estate but mr barrett was armed at all points by a consummate education and a most serviceable clothesbrush you know how i love this neighbourhood said she and i above all that i have known they left the pathway and walked on mosses soft yellow beds run over with grey lichen and plots of emerald in the midst you will not fall off with your reading he recommenced she answered yes meaning no and corrected the error languidly thinking one of the weighty monosyllables as good as the other for what was reading to her now it would be ten thousand pities if you were to do as so many women do whenwhen they make these great changes he continued of what avail is the improvement of the mind she said and followed his stumble over the when and dropped on it of what avail is marriage to stop your intellectual growth without sympathy she faltered and was shocked at what she said but it seemed a necessity you must learn to conquer the need for it alas his admonition only made her feel the need more cravingly promise me one thing he said you will not fall into the rut let me keep the ideal you have given me for the sake of heaven do not cloud for me the one bright image i hold let me know always that you are growing and that the pure noble intelligence which distinguishes you advances and will not be subdued cornelia smiled faintly you have judged me too generously mr barrett too little so might i tell you he stopped short and she felt the silence like a great wave sweeping over her they were nearing the lake with the stump of the pollard willow in sight and toward it they went i shall take the consolation of knowing that i shall hear of you some day she said having recourse to a look of cheerfulness he knew her to allude to certain hopes of fame i am getting wiser i fear too wise for ambition that is a fallacy a sophism he pointed to the hollow tree is there promise of fruit from that youyou are young mr barrett and on a young forehead it may be written 'come not to gather more' cornelia put her hand out oh mr barrett unsay it the nakedness of her spirit stood forth in a stinging tear the words were cruel but if they live and are i feel that you must misjudge me when i wrote themyou cannot know the misery of our domestic life was so bitter and yet i have no excuse none i can only ask for pity and if you are wretched must not i be you pluck from me my last support this i petitioned providence to hear from you that you would be happy i can have no comfort but in that happy cornelia murmured the word musically as if to suck an irony from the sweetness of the sound are we made for happiness mr barrett quoted the favourite sage concluding but a brilliant home and high social duties bring consolation i do acknowledge that an eminent station will not only be graced by you but that you give the impression of being born to occupy it it is your destiny a miserable destiny it pleased cornelia to become the wilful child who quarrels with its tutor's teachings upon this point then mr barrett said quickly your heart is not in this union can you ask i have done my duty have you indeed his tone was severe in the deliberation of its accents was it her duty to live an incomplete life he gave her a definition of personal duty and shadowed out all her own ideas on the subject seeming thus to speak terrible unanswerable truth as one who changes the theme he said i have forborne to revert to myself in our interviews they were too divine for that you will always remember that i have forborne much yes she was willing at the instant to confess how much and if i speak now i shall not be misinterpreted you never would have been by me cornelia though she knew what was behind the door this flinging of it open with her name startled the lady and if he had faltered it would not have been well for him but plainly he claimed the right to call her by her christian name she admitted it and thenceforward they were equals it was an odd story that he told of himself she could not have repeated it to make it comprehensible she drank at every sentence getting no more from it than the gratification of her thirst his father at least was a man of title a baronet what was meant by estates not entailed what wild freak of fate put this noble young man in the power of an eccentric parent who now caressed him now made him an outcast she heard of the sum that was his coming from his dead mother to support him just one hundred pounds annual was ever fate so mournful practically she understood that if mr barrett would write to his father pledging himself to conform to his mysterious despotic will in something he would be pardoned and reinstated he concluded hitherto i have preferred poverty you have taught me at what a cost is it too late the fall of his voice with the repetition of her name seemed as if awakening her but not in a land of reason whywhy she whispered beloved why did you not tell me this before do you upbraid me oh no oh never she felt his hand taking hers gently my friend she said half in self defence and they who had never kissed as lovers kissed under the plea of friendship chapter xxiii all wilfrid's diplomacy was now brought into play to baffle mr pericles inspire emilia with the spirit of secresy and carry on his engagement to two women to their common satisfaction adela whose penetration he dreaded most he had removed by a flattering invitation to stornley and that emilia might be occupied during his absences and mr pericles thrown on a false scent he persuaded tracy runningbrook to come to brookfield and write libretti for emilia's operas the two would sit down together for an hour drawing wonderful precocious noses upon juvenile visages when emilia would sigh and say i can't work tracy adding with resignation i never can at first mr pericles dogged them assiduously after a little while he shrugged remarking it is a nonsense they were however perfectly serious about the production of an opera tracy furnishing verse to emilia's music he wrote with extraordinary rapidity but clung to graphic phrases that were not always supple enough for nuptials with modulated notes then emilia had to hit his sense of humour by giving the words as they came in the run of the song you make me crow or i croak she said the woman follows the man and music fits to verse cried tracy music's the vine verse the tree emilia meditated not if they grow up together she suggested and broke into a smile at his rapture of amusement which was succeeded by a dark perplexity worthy of the present aspect of mr pericles that's what has upset us he said we have been trying to 'grow up together' like first cousins and nature forbids the banns to morrow you shall have half a libretto and then really my child you must adapt yourself to the words i will emilia promised only not if they're like iron to the teeth my belief is said tracy savagely that music's a fashion and as delusive a growth as cobbett's potatoes which will go back to the deadly nightshade just as music will go back to the tom tom what have you called out when i sang to you emilia reproached him for this irreverent nonsense oh it was you and not the music he returned half cajolingly while he beat the tom tom on air hark here cried emilia she recited a verse doesn't that sound dead now hark she sang the verse and looked confidently for tracy's verdict at the close what a girl that is he went about the house raving of her to everybody with sundry gallic interjections until mrs chump said 'deed sir ye don't seem to have much idea of a woman's feelin's tracy produced in a night two sketches of libretti for emilia to choose from the roman clelia being one and camillus the other tracy praised either impartially and was indifferent between them he told her clelia offered the better theme for passionate song but there was a winning political object and rebuff to be given to radicalism in camillus think of rome he said emilia gave the vote for camillus beginning forthwith to hum with visions of a long roll of swarthy cavalry headed by a clear eyed young chief sunlight perching on his helm yes but you don't think of the situations in clelia and what i can do with her snapped tracy i see a song there that would light up all london unfortunately the sentiment's dead radical it wouldn't so much matter if we were certain to do camillus as well because one would act as a counterpoise to the other you know well follow your own fancy camillus is strictly classical i treat opera there as alfieri conceived tragedy clelia is modern style cast the die for camillus and let's take horse only we lose the love business exactly where i show my strength clelia in the camp of the king dactyllic chorus accompaniment while she in heavy voluptuous anapaests confesses her love for the enemy of her country remember this is our romantic opera where we do what we like with history and make up our minds for asses telling us to go home and read our 'student's rome' then that scene where she and the king dance the dactyls and the anapaests go to the chorus sublime let's go into the woods and begin we might give the first song or two to night in composition mind always strike out your great scene and work from it don't work up to it or you've lost fire when you reach the point that's my method they ran into the woods skipping like schoolboy and schoolgirl on hearing that camillus would not be permitted to love other than his ungrateful country emilia's conception of the roman lord grew pale and a controversy ensued she maintaining that a great hero must love a woman he declaring that a great hero might love a dozen but that it was beneath the dignity of this drama to allow of a rival to rome in camillus's love he will not do for music said emilia firmly and was immoveable in despair tracy proposed attaching a lanky barbarian daughter to brennus whose deeds of arms should provoke the admiration of the roman and so we relinquish alfieri for florian there's a sentimental burlesque at once the youth ejaculated in gloom i chose this subject entirely to give you rome for a theme emilia took his hand i do thank you if brennus has a daughter why not let her be half roman tracy fired out she's a bony woman with a brawny development mammoth haunches strong of the skeleton cheek bones flat forward as a fish 's rotting on a beach long scissor lips nippers to any wretched rose of a kiss a pugilist's nose to the nostrils of a phoca and eyes don't you see them luminaries of pestilence blotted yellow like a tallow candle shining through a horny lantern at this horrible forced poetic portrait emilia cried in pain you hate her suddenly i loathe the creature pah went tracy why do you make her so hideous emilia complained i feel myself hating her too look at me am i such a thing as that you tracy was melted in a trice and gave the motion of hugging as a commentary on his private opinion can you also be sure that camillus can love nothing but his country would one love stop the other she persisted gazing with an air of steady anxiety for the answer there isn't a doubt about it said tracy emilia caught her face in her hands and exclaimed in a stifling voice it's true it's true tracy saw that her figure was shaken with sobs unmistakeable hard sorrowful convulsions confound historical facts that make her cry he murmured to himself in a fury at the roman fables it's no use comforting her with niebuhr now she's got a live camillus in her brain and there he'll stick tracy began to mutter the emphatic d quite cognizant of her case as he supposed this intensity of human emotion about a dry faggot of history by no means surprised him and he was as tender to the grief of his darling little friend as if he had known the conflict that tore her in two subsequently he related the incident in a tone of tender delight to wilfrid whom it smote am i a brute asked the latter of the intelligences in the seat of his consciousness and they for the moment gravely affirmed it i have observed that when young men obtain this mental confirmation of their suspicions they wax less reluctant to act as brutes than when the doubt restrained them he reasoned thus i can bring my mind to the idea of losing her if it must be so hear hear from the unanimous internal parliament but i can't make her miserable cheers i can't go and break her heart loud cheers drowning a faint dissentient hum the scene of which tracy had told him gave wilfrid a kind of dread of the girl if that was her state of feeling upon a distant subject how would it be when he applied the knife simply impossible to use the knife at all wield it thou o circumstance babe munching chronos whosoever thou art that jarrest our poor human music effectually from hour to hour colonel pierson paid his promised visit on his way back to his quarters at verona his stay was shortened by rumours of anticipated troubles in italy one day at table he chanced to observe speaking of the milanese that they required another lesson and that it would save the shedding of blood if annually the chief men of the city took a flogging for the community senseless arrogance that sensible and even kindly men will sometimes be tempted to utter and prompted to act on in that deteriorating state of a perpetual repressive force emilia looked at him till she caught his eye i hope i shall never meet you there she said the colonel coloured and drew his finger along each curve of his moustache the table was silent colonel pierson was a gentleman but a false position and the irritating topic deprived him of proper self command what would you do he said not gallantly emilia would have been glad to have been allowed to subside but the tone stung her i could not do much i am a woman said she whereto the colonel it's only the women who do anything over there and that is why you flog them the colonel seeing himself surrounded by ladies lost the right guidance of his wits at this point reddened and was saved by an irish outcry of horror from some unpleasant and possibly unmanly retort mr paricles said exactly the same oh sir do ye wear an officer's uniform to go about behavin' in that shockin' way to poor helpless females this was the first time mrs chump had ever been found of service at the brookfield dining table colonel pierson joined the current smile and the matter passed he was affectionate with wilfrid and invited him to verona with the assurance that his the austrian school of cavalry was the best in the world you beat us in pace and weight but you can't skirmish you can't manage squadrons and you know nothing of outpost duty said the colonel wilfrid promised to visit him some day a fact he denied to emilia when she charged him with it her brain seemed to be set on fire by the presence of an austrian officer the miserable belief that she had abandoned her country pressing on her remorsefully she lost appetite briskness of eye and the soft reddish brown ripe blood hue that made her cheeks sweet to contemplate she looked worn small wretched her very walk indicated self contempt wilfrid was keen to see the change for which others might have accused a temporary headache now that she appeared under this blight it seemed easier to give her up and his magnanimity being thus encouraged i am not hard on him remember the constitution of love in which a heart un aroused is pure selfishness and a heart aroused heroic generosity they being one heart to outer life his magnanimity i say being under this favourable sun he said to himself that there should be an end of double dealing and possibly consoled by feeling a martyr he persuaded himself to act the gentle ruffian to which end he was again absent from brookfield for a space and bitterly missed emilia for the last two sundays had taken mr barrett's place at the organ she was playing the prelude to one of the evening hymns when the lover whose features she dreaded to be once more forgetting appeared in the curtained enclosure a stoppage in the tune and a prolonged squeal of the instrument gave the congregation below matter to speculate upon wilfrid put up his finger and sat reverently down while emilia plunged tremblingly at the note that was howling its life away and as she managed to swim into the stream of the sacred melody again her head was turned toward her lover under a new sensation and the first words she murmured were we have never been in church together before not in the evening he whispered likewise impressed no said emilia softly flattered by his greater accuracy if wilfrid could have been sure that he would be perfect master of that sentimental crew known to him under the denomination of his feelings the place he selected for their parting interview might be held creditable to this young officer's acknowledged strategical ability it was a place where any fervid appeals were impossible where he could contemplate her listen to her be near her alone with her having nothing to dread from tears supplications or passion as a consequence of the short indulgence of his tenderness but he had failed to reckon on the chances that he himself might prove weak and be betrayed by the crew for whose comfort he was always providing and now as she sat there her face being sideways to him the flush of delight faint on her cheek and her eyelids half raised to the gilded pipes while full and sonorous harmony rolled out from her touch it seemed the very chorus of the heavens that she commanded and a subtle misty glory descended upon her forehead which he was long in perceiving to be cast from a moisture on his eyelids when the sermon commenced emilia quitted the organ and took his hand in very low whispers they spoke i have wanted to see you so you see me now little woman on friday week next i am to go away nonsense you shall not your sisters say yes mr pericles has got my father's consent they say to take me to italy do you think of going emilia gazed at her nerveless hands lying in her lap you shall not go he breathed imperiously in her ear then you will marry me quite soon and emilia looked as if she would be smiling april at a word my dear girl he had an air of caressing remonstrance because she continued if my father finds me out i must go to italy or go to that life of torment in london seeing those jew people horrible or others and the thought of it is like being under the earth tasting bitter gravel i could almost bear it before you kissed me my lover it would kill me now say say tell me we shall be together i shudder all day and night and feel frozen hands catching at me i faint my heart falls deep down in the darki think i know what dying is now she stopped on a tearless sob and at her fingers' ends wilfrid felt the quivering of her frame my darling he interjected he wished to explain the situation to her as he then conceived it but he had in his calculation failed also to count on a peculiar nervous fretfulness that the necessity to reiterate an explanation in whispers must superinduce so when emilia looked vacant of the intelligence imparted to her he began anew and emphatically and ere he was half through it mr marter from the pulpit underneath sent forth a significant reprimand to the conscience of a particular culprit of his congregation in the form of a solemn cough emilia had to remain unenlightened and she proceeded to build on her previous assumption doing the whispering easily and sweetly in the prettiest way from her tongue's tip with her chin lifted up and sending the vowels on a prolonged hushed breath that seemed to print them on the hearing far more distinctly than a volume of sound wilfrid fell back on monosyllables he could not bring his mouth to utter flinty negatives so it appeared that he assented and then his better nature abused him for deluding her he grew utterly ashamed of his aimless selfish double dealing can it be he questioned his own mind and listened greedily to any mental confirmations of surpassing excellence in her that the world might possibly acknowledge having with great zeal created a set of circumstances he cursed them heartily after the fashion of little people he grew resigned to abandon lady charlotte and to give his name to this subduing girl but a comfortable quieting sensation came over him at the thought that his filial duty stood in the way his father he knew was anxious for him to marry into a noble family incomprehensibly anxious to have the affair settled and as two or three scenes rose in his mind wilfrid perceived that the obstacle to his present fancy was his father as clearly as he could with the dread of the preacher's admonishing cough before him wilfrid stated the case to emilia saying that he loved her with his whole heart but that the truth was his father was not in a condition of health to bear contradiction to his wishes and would he was sure be absolutely opposed to their union he brought on himself another reprimand from mr marter in seeking to propitiate emilia's reason to comprehend the position rightly and could add little more to the fact he had spoken than that his father had other views which it would require time to combat emilia listened attentively replying with a flying glance to the squeeze of his hand he was astonished to see her so little disconcerted but now the gradual fall of mr marter's voice gave them warning my lover breathed emilia hurriedly and eagerly questioning with eye and tone my darling returned wilfrid she sat down to the organ with a smile he was careful to retreat before the conclusion of the service somewhat chagrined by his success that smile of hers was inexplicable to him chapter xxiv mr pole was closeted in his city counting house with mr pericles before a heap of papers and newly opened foreign letters to one of which bearing a russian stamp he referred fretfully at times as if to verify a monstrous fact any one could have seen that he was not in a condition to transact business his face was unnaturally patched with colour and his grey tinged hair hung tumbled over his forehead like waves blown by a changeing wind still he maintained his habitual effort to look collected and defeat the scrutiny of the sallow eyed fellow opposite who quietly glanced now and then from the nervous feet to the nervous fingers and nodded to himself a sardonic outlandish nod now listen to me said mr pericles we shall not burst out about zis riga man he is a villain very well say it he is a villain say so and stop because and up went the greek's forefinger we must not have a scandal in ze fairst place we do not want pity in ze second saird we must seem to trust him in spite i say yeas what is pity to us of commerce it is contempt we trust him on and we lose what he pocket a sossand we burst on him and we lose twenty serty forty and we lose reputation i'd have every villain hanged cried mr pole the scoundrel i'd hang him with his own hemp he talks of a factory burnt and dares to joke about tallow and in a business letter and when he is telling one of a loss of money to that amount not bad ze joke grinned mr pericles it is a lesson of coolness we learn it but mind he say 'possible loss' it is not positif hein ze man is trying us so shall we burst out and make him desperate we are in his hand at riga you see i see this said mr pole that he's a confounded rascal and i'll know whether the law can't reach him ha ze law mr pericles sneered so you are you english always ze law but we are men we are not machine law for a machine not a man we punish him perhaps well he is punished he is imprisoned forty monz we pay for him a sossand pound a monz he is flogged forty lashes we pay for him a sossand pound a lash you can afford zat it is a luxury like anozer it is not for me how long are we to trust the villain said mr pole if we trust him at all mind i don't say i do or will ze money is locked up for a year my friend so soon we get it so soon he goes from ze toe off mr pericles' shining toe's tip performed an agile circuit and he smoothed his square clean jaw and venomous moustache reflectively not now he resumed while he hold us in his hand we will not drive him to ze devil or we go too i believe or part of ze way but now we say zat money is frozen in ze nord we will make it in australie and in greek waters i have exposed to you my plan yes said mr pole and i've told you i've no pretensions to be a capitalist we have no less than three ventures out already it is like you english when you have ze world to milk you go to one point and stick it fails and you fail what is zat word mr pericles tapped his brow pluck you want pluck it is your decadence greek and russian and yankee all zey beat you for it is pluck you make a pin's head not a pin it is in brain and heart you do fail you have only your position an island and ships and some favour you are no match in pluck we beat you and we live for pleasure while you groan and sweat mon dieu it is slavery mr pericles twinkled his white eyes over the blinking merchant and rose from his chair humming a bit of opera and announcing casually that a certain prima donna had obtained a divorce from her husband but he added suddenly i say to you if you cannot afford to speculate run away from it as ze fire run away from it and hold up your coat tail jump ditches and do not stop till you are safe home hein you say 'cosy' i hear my landlady run till you are safe cosy but if you are a man wis a head and a pocket zen you know that 'speculate' means a dozen ventures so you come clear or it is ruin it is ruin i say you have been playing an englishman returned mr pole disgusted at the shrugs he had witnessed an englishman's as good as any of you look at us look at our history look at our wealth by jingo but we like plain dealing and common sense and as to afford what do you mean no no mr pericles petitioned with uplifted hand my english is bad it is ah bad you shall look it over my plan it will strike your sense next week i go to italy i take ze little belloni you will manage all i have in you my friend perfec' confidence an englishman he is honest an englishman and a greek conjoined zey beat ze world it is true ma foi for zat i seek you and not a countryman a frenchman oh no a german not a bit a russian never a yankee save me i am a greek i take an englishman well well you must leave me to think it over said mr pole pleasantly smoothed down as to honesty that's a matter of course with us that's the mere footing we go upon we don't plume ourselves upon what's general here there is i regret to say a difference between us and other nations i believe it's partly their religion they swindle us and pay their priests for absolution with our money if you're a double dyed sinner you can easily get yourself whitewashed over there confound them when that fellow sent no remittance last month i told you i suspected him who was the shrewdest then as for pluck i never failed in that yet but i will see a thing clear the man who speculates blindfold is a fowl who walks into market to be plucked between being plucked and having pluck you'll see a distinction when you know the language better but you must make use of your head or the chances are you won't be much of a difference eh i'll think over your scheme i'm not a man to hesitate if the calculations are sound i'll look at the papers here my friend you will decide before zat i go to italy said mr pericles and presently took his leave when he was gone mr pole turned his chair to the table and made an attempt to inspect one of the papers deliberately having untied it he retied it with care put it aside marked 'immediate' and read the letter from riga anew this he tore into shreds with animadversions on the quality of the rags that had produced it and opened the important paper once more he got to the end of a sentence or two when his fingers moved about for the letter and then his mind conceived a necessity for turning to the directory for which he rang the bell the great red book was brought into his room by a youthful clerk who waited by while his master unaware of his presence tracked a name with his forefinger it stopped at pole samuel bolton and a lurking smile was on the merchant's face as he read the name a smile of curious meaning neither fresh nor sad the meditative smile of one who looks upon an afflicted creature from whom he is aloof after a lengthened contemplation of this name he said with a sigh poor chump i wonder whether he's here too a search for the defunct proved that he was out of date mr pole thrust his hand to the bell that he might behold poor chump in an old directory that would call up the blotted years i am here sir said his clerk who had been holding deferential watch at a few steps from the table what do you do here then sir all this time i waited sir because you waste and dawdle away twenty or thirty minutes when you ought to be doing your work what do you mean mr pole stood up and took an angry stride the young man could scarcely believe his master was not stooping to jest with him he said for that matter sir it can't be a minute that i have been wasting i called you in half an hour ago returned mr pole fumbling at his watch fob it must have been somebody else sir did you bring in this directory look at it this this is the book that i brought in sir how long since i think not a minute and a half sir mr pole gazed at him and coughed slowly i could have sworn he murmured and commenced blinking i suppose i must be a little queer he pursued and instantly his right hand struck out quivering the young clerk grasped it and drew him to a chair tush said his master working his feverish fingers across his forehead want of food i don't eat like you young fellows fetch me a glass of wine and a biscuit good wine mind port or no you can't trust tavern port brandy get it yourself don't rely on the porter and bring it yourself you understand the importance what is your name braintop replied the youth with the modesty of one whose name has been too frequently subjected to puns i think i never heard so singular a name in my life mr pole ejaculated seriously braintop it'll always make me think of brandy what are you waiting for now i took the liberty of waiting before to say that a lady wished to see you sir mr pole started from his chair a foreign lady she may be foreign she speaks english sir and her name i think was foreign i've forgotten it i fear it's the wife of that fellow from riga cried the merchant show her in show her in immediately i suspected this she's in london i know i'm equal to her show her in when you fetch the braintop and biscuit call me to the door you understand the youth affected meekly to enjoy this fiery significance given to his name and said that he understood without any doubt he retired and in a few moments ushered in emilia belloni mr pole was in the middle of the room wearing a countenance of marked severity and watchful to maintain it in his opening bow but when he perceived his little brookfield guest standing timidly in the doorway his eyebrows lifted and his hands spread out and well to be sure he cried while emilia hurried up to him she had to assure him that everything was right at home and was next called upon to state what had brought her to town but his continued exclamation of bless my soul reprieved her reply and she sat in a chair panting quickly mr pole spoke tenderly of refreshments wine and cake or biscuits i cannot eat or drink said emilia why what's come to you my dear returned mr pole in unaffected wonder i am not hungry you generally are at home about this time eh emilia sighed and feigned the sad note to be a breath of fatigue well and why are you here my dear mr pole was beginning to step to the right and the left of her uneasily i have come she paused with a curious quick speculating look between her eyes i have come to see you see me my dear you saw me this morning yes i wanted to see you alone emilia was having the first conflict with her simplicity out of which it was not to issue clear as in the foregone days she was thinking of the character of the man she spoke to studying him that she might win him to succour the object she had in view it was a quality going and a quality coming nor will we if you please lament a law of growth why you can see me alone any day my dear said mr pole for many a day i hope you are more alone to me here i cannot speak at brookfield oh and emilia had to still her heart's throbbing you do not want me to go to italy do you want you to go not a bit there is some talk of it isn't there i don't want you to go don't you want to go no no said emilia with decisive fervour don't want to go no to stay i want to stay eh to stay to stay with you never to leave england at least i want to give up all that i may stay all repeated mr pole evidently marvelling as to what that sounding box might contain and still more perplexed to hear emilia's vehement yes all as if there were that in the mighty abnegation to make a reasonable listener doubtful no i really don't want you to go he said in fact and the merchant's hospitable nature was at war with something in his mind i like you my dear i like to have you about me you're cheerful you're agreeable i like your smile your voice too you're a very pleasant companion only you know we may break up our house if the girls get married i must live somewhere in lodgings and i couldn't very well ask you to cook for me i can cook a little emilia smiled i went into the kitchen till adela objected yes but it wouldn't do you know pursued mr pole with the seriousness of a man thrown out of his line of argument you can cook eh got an idea of it i always said you were a useful little woman do have a biscuit and some wine no well where was i that confounded boy brainty top top that's it braintop was i talking of him my dear oh no about your getting married for if you can cook why not get a husband and then you won't got to italy you ought to get one some young fellows don't look for money i shall make money come in time said emilia in the leaping ardour of whose eyes might be seen that what she had journeyed to speak was hot within her i know i shall be worth having i shall win a name i think i do hope it well so pericles says he's got a great notion of you perhaps he means it himself he's rich rash i admit but as the chances go he's tremendously rich he may mean it what asked emilia marry you you know ah what a torture in that heat of her feelings she realized the horror of the words to her with an intensity that made them seem to quiver like an arrow in her breast you don't like him said mr pole not love him not love him yes yes but that comes after marriage often the case look here don't you go against your interests you mustn't be flighty if pericles speaks to you have him clap your hands dozens of girls would that i know but oh interposed emilia if he married me he would kiss me mr pole coughed and blinked well he remarked as one gravely cogitating and with the native delicacy of a briton turned it off in a playful so shall i now adding though i ain't your husband he stooped his head emilia put her hands on his shoulders and submitted her face to him there went mr pole 'pon my honour it does me good better than medicine but you mustn't give that dose to everybody my dear you don't of course all right all right i'm quite satisfied i was only thinking of you going to italy among those foreign rascals who've no more respect for a girl than they have for a monkey their brother a set of swindlers i took you for the wife of one when you came in at first and now business is business let's get it over what have you come about glad to see you understand that emilia lifted her eyes to his you know i love you sir i'm sure you're a grateful little woman she rose oh how can i speak it an idea that his daughters had possibly sent her to herald one of the renowned physicians of london concerning whom he was perpetually being plagued by them or to lead him to one flashed through mr pole he was not in a state to weigh the absolute value of such a suspicion but it seemed probable it explained an extraordinary proceeding and having conceived his wrath took it up as a fact and fought with it stop if that's what you've come for we'll bring matters to a crisis you fancy me ill don't you my dear you do not look well sir emilia's unhesitating reply confirmed his suspicion i am well i am i say and now understand that if that's your business i won't go to the fellow and i won't see him here they'll make me out mad next he shall never have a guinea from me while i live no nor when i die not a farthing sit down my dear and wait for the biscuits i wish to heaven they'd come there's brandy coming too where's braintop he took out his handkerchief to wipe his forehead and jerked it like a bell rope emilia in a singular bewilderment sat eyeing a beam of sombre city sunlight on the dusty carpet she could only suppose that the offending he was wilfrid but why he should be so she could not guess and how to plead for him divided her mind don't blame him be angry with me if you are angry she began softly i know he thinks of you anxiously i know he would do nothing to hurt you no one is so kind as he is would you deprive him of money because he offends you deprive him of money repeated mr pole with ungrudging accentuation well i've heard about women but i never knew one so anxious for a doctor to get his fee as you are emilia wonderingly fixed her sight on him an instant and quite unillumined resumed blame me sir but i know you will be too kind oh i love him so i must love you and i would not give you pain it is true he loves me you will not see him because he loves me the doctor muttered mr pole the doctor he almost bellowed and got sharp up from his chair and looked at himself in the glass blinking rapidly and then turned to inspect emilia emilia drew him to her side again go on he said and there became visible in his face a frightful effort to comprehend her and get to the sense of her words and why it was so frightful as to be tragic you will know presently he thought of the arrival of braintop freighted with brandy as the only light in the mist and breathing heavily from his nose almost snorting the air he took in from a widened mouth he sat and tried to listen to her words as well as for braintop's feet emilia was growing too conscious of her halting eloquence as the imminence of her happiness or misery hung balancing in doubtful scales before her oh he loves me and i love him she gasped and wondered why words should be failing her see us together sir and hear us we will make you well the exclamation good lord groaned out in a tone as from the lower pits of despair cut her short tearfully she murmured you will not see us sir together bawled the merchant yes i mean together if you're not mad i am and he jumped on his legs and walked to the farther corner of the room which of us is it his features twitched in horribly comic fashion what do you mean i can't understand a word my brain must have gone throwing his hand over his forehead i've feared so for the last four months good god a lunatic asylum and the business torn like a piece of old rag i know that fellow at riga's dancing like a cannibal and there there 'll be articles in the papers here girl come up to the light come here i say emilia walked up to him you don't look mad i dare say everybody else understands you do they the sad flushed pallor of his face provoked emilia to say you ought to have the doctor here immediately let me bring him sir a gleam as of a lantern through his oppressive mental fog calmed the awful irritability of his nerves somewhat you've got him outside no sir the merchant's eagerness faded out he put his hand to her shoulder and went along to a chair sinking into it and closing his eyelids so they remained emilia at his right hand she watched him breathing with a weak open mouth and thought more of the doctor now than of wilfrid chapter xxv braintop's knock at the door had been unheeded for some minutes at last emilia let him in the brandy and biscuits were placed on a table and emilia resumed her watch by mr pole she saw that his lips moved after a space and putting her ear down understood that he desired not to see any one who might come for an interview with him nor were the clerks to be admitted the latter direction was given in precise terms emilia repeated the orders outside on her return the merchant's eyes were open my forehead feels damp he said and i'm not hot at all just take hold of my hands they're like wet crumpets i wonder what makes me so stiff a man mustn't sit at business too long at a time sure to make people think he's ill what was that about a doctor i seem to remember i won't see one emilia had filled a glass with brandy she brought it nearer to his hand while he was speaking at the touch of the glass his fingers went round it slowly and he raised it to his mouth the liquor revived him he breathed ah several times and grimaced blinking as if seeking to arouse a proper brightness in his eyes then he held out his empty glass to her and she filled it and he sipped deliberately saying i'm warm inside i keep on perspiring so cold can't make it out look at my finger ends my dear they're whitish aren't they emilia took the hand he presented and chafed it and put it against her bosom half under one arm the action appeared to give some warmth to his heart for he petted her in return a third time he held out the glass and remarked that this stuff was better than medicine you women he sneered as at a reminiscence of their faith in drugs my legs are weak though he had risen and tested the fact very shaky i wonder what makes 'em i don't take much exercise pondering on this problem he pursued it's the stomach i'm as empty as an egg shell odd i've got no appetite but my spirits are up i begin to feel myself again i'll eat by and by my dear and i say i'll tell you what i'll take you to the theatre to night i want to laugh a man's all right when he's laughing i wish it was christmas don't you like to see the old pantaloon tumbled over my boy my girl i mean i did when i was a boy my father took me i went in the pit i can smell oranges when i think of it i remember we supped on german sausage or ham one or the other those were happy old days he shook his head at them across the misty gulf perhaps there's a good farce going on now if so we'll go girls ought to learn to laugh as well as boys i'll ring for braintop he rang the bell and bade emilia be careful to remind him that he wanted braintop's address for braintop was useful it appeared that there were farces at several of the theatres braintop rattled them out their plot and fun and the merits of the actors with delightful volubility as one whose happy subject had been finally discovered he was forthwith commissioned to start immediately and take a stage box at one of the places of entertainment where two great rivals of the doctor genus promised to laugh dull care out of the spirit of man triumphantly and at the description of whose drolleries any one with faith might be half cured the youth gave his address on paper to emilia make haste sir said mr pole and stop you shall go yourself go to the pit and have a supper and i'll pay for it when you've ordered the box do you know the bedford hotel go there and see mrs chickley and tell her i am coming to dine and sleep and shall bring one of my daughters dinner sittingroom and two bed rooms mind and tell mrs chickley we've got no carpet bag and must come upon her wardrobe all clear to you dinner at half past five going to theatre braintop bowed comprehendingly now that fellow goes off chirping said mr pole to emilia it's just the thing i used to wish to happen to me when i was his age my master to call me in and say there go and be jolly i dare say the rascal'll order a champagne supper poor young chap let his heart be merry ha ha heigho too much business is bad for man and boy i feel better already if it weren't for my legs my feet are so cold don't you think i'm pretty talkative my dear i am glad to hear you talk said emilia striving to look less perplexed than she felt he asked her slyly why she had come to london and she begged that she might speak of it by and by whereat mr pole declared that he intended to laugh them all out of that nonsense and what did you say about being in love with him a doctor in good practice but you needn't commence by killing me if you do go and marry the fellow eh what is it emilia was too much entangled herself to attempt to extricate him and apparently his wish to be enlightened passed away for he was the next instant searching among his papers for the letter from riga not finding it he put on his hat must give up business to day can't do business with a petticoat in the room i wish the lord mayor'd stop them all at temple bar now we'll go out and i'll show you a bit of the city he offered her his arm and she noticed that in walking through the office he was erect and the few words he spoke were delivered in the peremptory elastic tone of a vigorous man my girls he said to her in an undertone never come here well we don't expect ladies you know different spheres in this world they mean to be tip top in society and quite right too my dear i think we'll ride do you mind being seen in a cab he asked her hesitatingly and when emilia said oh no let us ride he seemed relieved i can't see the harm in a cab different tastes in this world my girls but thank the lord they've got carriages for an hour the merchant and emilia drove about the city he showed her all the great buildings and dilated on the fabulous piles of wealth they represented taking evident pleasure in her exclamations of astonishment yes yes they may despise us city fellows i say 'come and see that's all now look up that court do you see three dusty windows on the second floor that man there could buy up any ten princes in europe excepting one or two austrians or russians he wears a coat just like mine does he said emilia involuntarily examining the one by her side we don't show our gold linings in the city my dear but you are rich too oh i as far as that goes don't talk about me i'm i'm still cold in the feet now look at that corner house three months ago that man was one of our most respected city merchants now he's a bankrupt and can't show his head it was all rotten a medlar he tampered with documents betrayed trusts what do you think of him what was it he did asked emilia mr pole explained and excused him then he explained and abused him he hadn't a family my dear where did the money go he's called a rascal now poor devil business brings awful temptations you think this'll save me you catch hold of it and it snaps that'll save me but you're too heavy and the roots give way and down you go lower and lower lower and lower the gates of hell must be very low down if one of our bankrupts don't reach 'em he spoke this in a deep underbreath let's get out of the city there's no air look at that cloud it's about over brookfield i should say dear brookfield echoed emilia feeling her heart fly forth to sing like a skylark under the cloud and they're not satisfied with it murmured mr pole with a voice of unwonted bitterness at the hotel he was received very cordially by mrs chickley and simon the old waiter you look as young as ever ma'am mr pole complimented her cheerfully while he stamped his feet on the floor and put forward emilia as one of his girls but immediately took the landlady aside to tell her that she was merely a charge a ward something of that sort admitting gladly enough that she was a very nice young lady she's a genius ma'am in music going to do wonders she's not one of them and mr pole informed mrs chickley that when they came to town they usually slept in one or other of the great squares he for his part preferred old quarters comfort versus grandeur simon had soon dressed the dinner table by the time dinner was ready mr pole had sunk into such a condition of drowsiness that it was hard to make him see why he should be aroused and when he sat down fronting emilia his eyes were glazed and he complained that she was scarcely visible some of your old yellow seal simon that's what i want i haven't got better at home the contents of this old yellow seal formed the chief part of the merchant's meal emilia was induced to drink two full glasses doesn't that make your feet warm my dear said mr pole it makes me want to talk emilia confessed ah we shall have some fun to night to the rutte ta to if you could only sing begone dull care i like glees good honest english manly singing for me nothing like glees and madrigals to my mind with chops and baked potatoes and a glass of good stout they beat all other music emilia sang softly to him when she had finished mr pole applauded her mildly your music my dear my music mr runningbrook's words but only look he will not change a word and some of the words are so curious they make me lift my chin and pout it's all in my throat i feel as if i had to do it on tiptoe mr runningbrook wrote the song in ten minutes he can afford to comes of a family said mr pole and struck up a bit of celia's arbour which wandered into the soldier tired as he came bendingly both sets of fingers filliping toward emilia with one of those ancient glee suspensions taia haia haia haia etc which were meant for jolly fellows who could bear anything eh went mr pole to elicit approbation in return emilia smoothed the wrinkles of her face and smiled there's nothing like port said mr pole get little runningbrook to write a song there's nothing like port you put the music i'll sing it you will cried emilia yes upon my honour now my feet are warmer i by jingo what's that and again he wore that strange calculating look as if he were being internally sounded and guessed at his probable depth what a twitch something wrong with my stomach but a fellow must be all right when his spirits are up we'll be off as quick as we can taia haihaia hum if the farce is bad it's my last night of theatre going the delight at being in a theatre kept emilia dumb when she gazed on the glittering lights after an inspection of the house mr pole kindly remarked you must marry and get out of this this'd never do all very well in the boxes but on the stage oh no i shouldn't like you to be there if my girls don't approve of the doctor they shall look out somebody for you i shouldn't like you to be painted and rigged out and have to squall in this sort of place stage won't do for you no no emilia replied that she had given up the stage and looked mournfully at the drop scene as at a lost kingdom scarcely repressing her tears the orchestra tuned and played a light overture she followed up the windings of the drop scene valley meeting her lover somewhere beneath the castle ruin where the river narrowed and the trees intertwined on from dream to dream the music carried her and dull fell the first words of the farce mr pole said now then and began to chuckle as the farce proceeded he grew more serious repeating to emilia quite anxiously i wonder whether that boy braintop's enjoying it emilia glanced among the sea of heads and finally eliminated the head of braintop who was respectfully devoting his gaze to the box she occupied when mr pole had been assisted to discover him likewise his attention alternated between braintop and the stage and he expressed annoyance from time to time at the extreme composure of braintop's countenance why don't the fellow laugh does he think he's listening to a sermon poor braintop on his part sat in mortal fear lest his admiration of emilia was perceived divided between this alarming suspicion and a doubt that the hair on his forehead was not properly regulated he became uneasy and fitful in his deportment his imagination plagued him with a sense of guilt which his master's watchfulness of him increased he took an opportunity to furtively to eye himself in a pocket mirror and was subsequently haunted by an additional dread that emilia might have discovered the instrument and set him down as a vain foolish dog when he saw her laugh he was sure of it instead of responding to mr pole's encouragement he assumed a taciturn aspect worthy of a youthful anchorite and continued to be the spectator of a scene to which his soul was dead i believe that fellow's thinking of nothing but his supper said mr pole i dare say he dined early in the day returned emilia remembering how hungry she used to be in the evenings of the potatoe days yes but he might laugh all the same and mr pole gave emilia the sound advice mind you never marry a fellow who can't laugh braintop saw emilia smile then in an instant her face changed its expression to one of wonder and alarm and her hands clasped together tightly what on earth was the matter with her his agitated fancy centred in himself now decided that some manifestation of most shocking absurdity had settled on his forehead or his hair for he was certain of his neck tie braintop had recourse to his pocket mirror once more it afforded him a rapid interchange of glances with a face which he at all events could distinguish from the mass though we need not the youth was in the act of conveying the instrument to its retreat when conscience sent his eyes toward emilia who to his horror beckoned to him and touched mr pole entreating him to do the same mr pole gesticulated imperiously whereat braintop rose and requested his neighbour to keep his seat for ten minutes as he was going into that particular box and if i don't come back in ten minutes i shall stop there said braintop a little grandly through the confusion of his ideas as he guessed at the possible reasons for the summons emilia had seen her father in the orchestra there he sat under the leader sullenly fiddling the prelude to the second play like a man ashamed and one of the beaten in this world flight had been her first thought she had cause to dread him the more she lived and the dawning knowledge of what it is to be a woman in the world grew with her the more she shrank from his guidance and from reliance on him not that she conceived him designedly base but he outraged her now conscious delicacy and what she had to endure as a girl seemed unbearable to her now besides she felt a secret shuddering at nameless things which made her sick of the thought of returning to him and his jew friends but alas he looked so miserable a child of harmony among the sons of discord he kept his head down fiddling like a machine the old potatoe days became pathetically edged with dead light to emilia she could not be cruel when i am safe she laid stress on the word in her mind to awaken blessed images i will see him often and make him happy but i will let him know that all is well with me now and that i love him always so she said to mr pole i know one of those in the orchestra may i write a word to him on a piece of paper before we go i wish to mr pole reflected and seeing her earnest in her desire to do this replied well yes if you must the girls are not here emilia borrowed his pencil case and wrote sandra is well and always loves her caro papa and is improving and will see him soon her heart is full of love for him and for her mama and if they leave their lodgings they are to leave word where they go sandra never forgets italy and reads the papers she has a copy of the score of an unknown opera by our andronizetti and studies it and anatomy english french and pure italian and can ride a horse she has made rich friends who love her it will not be long and you will see her the hasty scrawl concluded with numerous little caressing exclamations in italian diminutives this done emilia thought but he will look up and see me she resolved not to send it till they were about to quit the theatre consequently braintop on his arrival was told to sit down you don't look cheerful in the pit said mr pole you're above it eh you're all alike in that none of you do what your dads did up up up you may get too high eh gallery and mr pole winked knowingly and laughed braintop thus elevated tried his best to talk to emilia who sat half fascinated with the fear of seeing her father lift his eyes and recognize her suddenly she sat boldly in the front as before not being a young woman to hide her head where there was danger and having perhaps a certain amount of the fatalism which is often youth's philosophy in the affairs of life if this is to be can i avert it mr pole began to nod at the actors heavily he said to emilia if there is any fun going on give me a nudge emilia kept her eyes on her father in the orchestra full of pity for his deplorable wig in which she read his later domestic history and sad tales of the family dinners do you see one of those she pointed him out to braintop he is next to the leader with his back to us are you sure i want you to give him this note before he goes when we go will you do it i shall always be thankful to you considering what braintop was ready to do that he might be remembered for a day and no more the request was so very moderate as to be painful to him you will leave him when you have given it into his hand you are not to answer any questions said emilia with a reassuring glance at the musician's wig braintop bent his head do see she pursued how differently he bows from the other men though it is only dance music oh how his ears are torn by that violoncello he wants to shriek he bears it she threw a piteous glance across the agitated instruments and braintop was led to inquire is he anything particular he can bring out notes that are more like honey if you can fancy a thread of honey drawn through your heart as if it would never end he is italian braintop modestly surveyed her hair and brows and cheeks and taking the print of her eyes on his brain to dream over smelt at a relationship with the wry black wig which cast a halo about it the musicians laid down their instruments and trooped out one by one emilia perceived a man brush against her father's elbow her father flicked at his offended elbow with the opposite hand and sat crumpled up till all had passed him then went out alone that little action of disgust showed her that he had not lost spirit albeit condemned to serve amongst an inferior race promoters of discord just as the third play was opening some commotion was seen in the pit rising from near braintop's vacated seat and presently a thing that shone flashing to the lights came on from hand to hand each hand signalling subsequently toward mr pole's box it approached braintop's eyes were in waiting on emilia who looked sadly at the empty orchestra a gentleman in the stalls a head beneath her bowed and holding up a singular article gravely said that he had been requested to pass it she touched mr pole's shoulder eh anything funny said he and glanced around he was in time to see braintop lean hurriedly over the box and snatch his pocket mirror from the gentleman's hand ha ha he laughed as if a comic gleam had illumined him a portion of the pit and stalls laughed too emilia smiled merrily what was it said she and perceiving many faces beneath her red among handkerchiefs she was eager to see the thing that the unhappy braintop had speedily secreted come sir let's see it quoth mr pole itching for a fresh laugh and in spite of braintop's protest and in defiance of his burning blush he compelled the wretched youth to draw it forth and be manifestly convicted of vanity a shout of laughter burst from mr pole no wonder these young sparks cut us all out lord what cunning dogs they are they ain't satisfied with seeing themselves in their boots but they ha ha by george we've got the best fun in our box i say braintop you ought to have two my boy then you'd see how you looked behind ha ha hah never enjoyed an evening so much in my life a looking glass for their pockets ha ha hooh luckily the farce demanded laughter or those parts of the pit which had not known braintop would have been indignant mr pole became more and more possessed by the fun as the contrast of braintop's abject humiliation with this glaring testimony to his conceit tickled him he laughed till he complained of hunger emilia though she thought it natural that braintop should carry a pocket mirror if he pleased laughed from sympathy until braintop reduced to the verge of forbearance stood up and remarked that to perform the mission entrusted to him he must depart immediately mr pole was loth to let him go but finally commending him to a good supper he sighed and declared himself a new man oh what a jolly laugh the very thing i wanted it's worth hundreds to me i was queer before no doubt about that again the ebbing convulsion of laughter seized him i feel as clear as day he said and immediately asked emilia whether she thought he would have strength to get down to the cab she took his hand trying to assist him from the seat he rose and staggered an instant a sort of reddish cloud he murmured feeling over his forehead ha i know what it is i want a chop a chop and a song but i couldn't take you and i like you by me good little woman he patted emilia's shoulder preparatory to leaning on it with considerable weight and so descended to the cab chuckling ever and anon at the reminiscence of braintop there was a disturbance in the street a man with a foreign accent was shouting by the door of a neighbouring public house that he would not yield his hold of the collar of a struggling gentleman till the villain had surrendered his child whom he scandalously concealed from her parents a scuffle ensued and the foreign voice was heard again wat wat you have de shame you have de pluck ah to tell me you know not where she is and you bring me a letter ho you have de cheeks to tell me this highly effective pluralizing of their peculiar slang brought a roar of applause from the crowd of britons only a street row said mr pole to calm emilia will he be hurt she cried i see a couple of policemen handy said mr pole and emilia cowered down and clung to his hand as they drove from the place etext editor's bookmarks and ladies if you will
