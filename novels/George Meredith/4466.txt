note there is a short list of bookmarks or pointers at the end of the file for those who may wish to sample the authors ideas before making an entire meal of them dw diana of the crossways by george meredith book ix shows how a position of delicacy for a lady and gentleman was met in simple fashion without hurt to either x the conflict of the night xi recounts the journey in a chariot with a certain amount of dialogue and a small incident on the road xii between emma and diana xiii touching the first days of her probation xiv giving glimpses of diana under her cloud before the world and of her further apprenticeship xv introduces the hon percy dacier xvi treats of a midnight bell and of a scene of early morning xvii the princess egeria chapter ix shows how a position of delicacy for a lady and gentleman was met in simple fashion without hurt to either redworths impulse was to laugh for very gladness of heart as he proffered excuses for his tremendous alarums and in doing so the worthy gentleman imagined he must have persisted in clamouring for admission because he suspected that if at home she would require a violent summons to betray herself it was necessary to him to follow his abashed sagacity up to the mark of his happy animation had i known it was you said diana bidding him enter the passage she wore a black silk mantilla and was warmly covered she called to her maid danvers whom redworth remembered a firm woman of about forty wrapped like her mistress in headcovering cloak scarf and shawl telling her to scour the kitchen for firewood diana led into a sittingroom i need not askyou have come from lady dunstane she said is she well she is deeply anxious you are cold empty houses are colder than out of doors you shall soon have a fire she begged him to be seated the small glow of candlelight made her dark rich colouring orange in shadow house and grounds are open to a tenant she resumed i say goodbye to them tomorrow morning the old couple who are in charge sleep in the village tonight i did not want them here you have quitted the government service i think a year or so since when did you return from america two days back and paid your visit to copsley immediately as early as i could that was true friendliness you have a letter for me i have he put his hand to his pocket for the letter presently she said she divined the contents and nursed her resolution to withstand them danvers had brought firewood and coal orders were given to her and in spite of the opposition of the maid and intervention of the gentleman diana knelt at the grate observing allow me to do this i can lay and light a fire he was obliged to look on she was a woman who spoke her meaning she knelt handling paper firewood and matches like a housemaid danvers proceeded on her mission and redworth eyed diana in the first fireglow he could have imagined a madonna on an old black spanish canvas the act of service was beautiful in gracefulness and her simplicity in doing the work touched it spiritually he thought as she knelt there that never had he seen how lovely and how charged with mystery her features were the dark large eyes full on the brows the proud line of a straight nose in right measure to the bow of the lips reposeful red lips shut and their curve of the slumbersmile at the corners her forehead was broad the chin of a sufficient firmness to sustain that noble square the brows marked by a soft thick brush to the temples her black hair plainly drawn along her head to the knot revealed by the mantilla fallen on her neck elegant in plainness the classic poet would have said of her hair and dress she was of the women whose wits are quick in everything they do that which was proper to her position complexion and the hour surely marked her appearance unaccountably this night the fair fleshly presence overweighted her intellectual distinction to an observer bent on vindicating her innocence or rather he saw the hidden in the visible owner of such a woman and to lose her redworth pitied the husband the crackling flames reddened her whole person gazing he remembered lady dunstane saying of her once that in anger she had the nostrils of a warhorse the nostrils now were faintly alive under some sensitive impression of her musings the olive cheeks pale as she stood in the doorway were flushed by the firebeams though no longer with their swarthy central rose tropic flower of a pure and abounding blood as it had seemed she was now beset by battle his pity for her and his eager championship overwhelmed the spirit of compassion for the foolish wretched husband dolt the man must be redworth thought and he asked inwardly did the miserable tyrant suppose of a woman like this that she would be content to shine as a candle in a grated lanthorn the generosity of men speculating upon other mens possessions is known yet the man who loves a woman has to the full the husbands jealousy of her good name and a lover that without the claims of the alliance can be wounded on her behalf is less distracted in his homage by the personal luminary to which mans manufacture of balm and incense is mainly drawn when his love is wounded that contemplation of her incomparable beauty with the multitude of his ideas fluttering round it did somewhat shake the personal luminary in redworth he was conscious of pangs the question bit him how far had she been indiscreet or wilful and the bite of it was a keen acid to his nerves a woman doubted by her husband is always and even to her champions in the first hours of the noxious rumour until they had solidified in confidence through service a creature of the wilds marked for our ancient running nay more than a cynical world these latter will be sensible of it the doubt casts her forth the general yelp drags her down she runs like the prey of the forest under spotting branches clear if we can think so but it has to be thought in devotedness her character is abroad redworth bore a strong resemblance to his fellowmen except for his power of faith in this woman nevertheless it required the superbness of her beauty and the contrasting charm of her humble posture of kneeling by the fire to set him on his right track of mind he knew and was sure of her he dispersed the unhallowed fry in attendance upon any stirring of the reptile part of us to look at her with the eyes of a friend and if a little mouse of a thought scampered out of one of the chambers of his head and darted along the passages fetching a sweat to his brows well whatsoever the fact his heart was hers he hoped he could be charitable to women she rose from her knees and said now please give me the letter he was entreated to excuse her for consigning him to firelight when she left the room danvers brought in a dismal tallow candle remarking that her mistress had not expected visitors her mistress had nothing but tea and bread and butter to offer him danvers uttered no complaint of her sufferings happy in being the picture of them im not hungry said he a plate of andrew hedgers own would not have tempted him the foolish frizzle of bacon sang in his ears as he walked from end to end of the room an illusion of his fancy pricked by a frostedged appetite but the anticipated contest with diana checked and numbed the craving was warwick a man to proceed to extremities on a mad suspicionwhat kind of proof had he redworth summoned the portrait of mr warwick before him and beheld a sweeping of close eyes in cloud a long upper lip in cloud the rest of him was all cloud as usual with these conjurations of a face the index of the nature conceived by him displayed itself and no more but he took it for the whole physiognomy and pronounced of the husband thus delineated that those close eyes of the long upper lip would both suspect and proceed madly he was invited by danvers to enter the diningroom there diana joined him the best of a dinner on bread and butter is that one is ready for supper soon after it she said swimming to the teatray you have dined at the inn he replied the three ravens when my fathers guests from london flooded the crossways the three ravens provided the overflow with beds on nights like this i have got up and scraped the frost from my windowpanes to see them step into the old fly singing some song of his the inn had a good reputation for hospitality in those days i hope they treated you well excellently said redworth taking an enormous mouthful while his heart sank to see that she who smiled to encourage his eating had been weeping but she also consumed her bread and butter that poor maid of mine is an instance of a woman able to do things against the grain she said danvers is a fosterchild of luxury she loves it great houses plentiful meals and the crowd of twinkling footmens calves yet you see her here in a desolate house consenting to cold and i know not what terrors of ghosts poor soul i have some mysterious attraction for her she would not let me come alone i should have had to hire some old storling grannam or retain the tattling keepers of the house she loves her native country too and disdains the foreigner my tea you may trust redworth had not a doubt of it he was becoming a teataster the merit of warmth pertained to the beverage i think you get your tea from scoppins in the city he said that was the warehouse for mrs warwicks tea they conversed of teas the black the green the mixtures each thinking of the attack to come and the defence meantime the cut bread and butter having flown redwerth attacked the loaf he apologized oh pay me a practical compliment diana said and looked really happy at his unfeigned relish of her simple fare she had given him one opportunity in speaking of her maids love of native country but it came too early they say that bread and butter is fattening he remarked you preserve the mean said she he admitted that his health was good for some little time to his vexation at the absurdity she kept him talking of himself so flowing was she and so sweet the motion of her mouth in utterance that he followed her lead and he said odd things and corrected them he had to describe his ride to her yes the view of the downs from dewhurst she exclaimed or any point along the ridge emma and i once drove there in summer with clotted cream from her dairy and we bought freshplucked wortleberries and stewed them in a hollow of the furzes and ate them with ground biscuits and the clotted cream iced and thought it a luncheon for seraphs then you dropped to the road round under the sandheightsand meditated railways just a notion or two you have been very successful in america successful perhaps we exclude extremes in our calculations of the still problematical i am sure said she you always have faith in your calculations her innocent archness dealt him a stab sharper than any he had known since the day of his hearing of her engagement he muttered of his calculations being human he was as much of a fool as other menmore oh no said she positively i cannot think it i know it mr redworth you will never persuade me to believe it he knocked a rising groan on the head and rejoined i hope i may not have to say so tonight diana felt the edge of the dart and meditating railways you scored our poor land of herds and flocks and night fell and the moon sprang up and on you came it was clever of you to find your way by the moonbeams thats about the one thing i seem fit for but what delusion is this in the mind of a man succeeding in everything he does cried diana curious despite her wariness is there to be the revelation of a hairshirt ultimatelya journal of confessions you succeeded in everything you aimed at and broke your heart over one chance miss my heart is not of the stuff to break he said and laughed off her fortuitous thrust straight into it another cup yes i came by night said she and cleverly found your way and dined at the three ravens and walked to the crossways and met no ghosts on the contraryor at least i saw a couple tell me of them we breed them here we sell them periodically to the newspapers well i started them in their natal locality i saw them going down the churchyard and bellowed after them with all my lungs i wanted directions to the crossways i had missed my way at some turning in an instant they were vapour diana smiled it was indeed a voice to startle delicate apparitions so do roar hyrcanean tigers pyramus and thisbeslaying lions one of your ghosts carried a loaf of bread and dropped it in fright one carried a pound of fresh butter for home consumption they were in the churchyard for one in passing to kneel at her fathers grave and kiss his tombstone she bowed her head forgetful of her guard the pause presented an opening redworth left his chair and walked to the mantelpiece it was easier to him to speak not facing her you have read lady dunstanes letter he began she nodded i have can you resist her appeal to you i must she is not in a condition to bear it well you will pardon me mrs warwick fully fully i venture to offer merely practical advice you have thought of it all but have not felt it in these cases the one thing to do is to make a stand lady dunstane has a clear head she sees what has to be endured by you consider she appeals to me to bring you her letter would she have chosen me or any man for her messenger if it had not appeared to her a matter of life and death you count me among your friends one of the truest here are two then and your own good sense for i do not believe it to be a question of courage he has commenced let him carry it out said diana her desperation could have added the cryand give me freedom that was the secret in her heart she had struck on the hope for the detested yoke to be broken at any cost i decline to meet his charges i despise them if my friends have faith in meand they mayi want nothing more well i wont talk commonplaces about the world said redworth we can none of us afford to have it against us consider a moment to your friends you are the diana merion they knew and they will not suffer an injury to your good name without a struggle but if you fly you leave the dearest you have to the whole brunt of it they will if they love me they will but think of the shock to her lady dunstane reads you not quite no not if she even wishes me to stay said diana he was too intent on his pleading to perceive a signification she reads you as clearly in the dark as if you were present with her oh why am i not ten years older diana cried and tried to face round to him and stopped paralyzed ten years older i could discuss my situation as an old woman of the world and use my wits to defend myself and then you would not dream of flight before it no she does not read me no she saw that i might come to the crossways sheno one but myself can see the wisdom of my holding aloof in contempt of this baseness and of allowing her to sink under that which your presence would arrest her strength will not support it emma oh cruel diana sprang up to give play to her limbs she dropped on another chair go i must i cannot turn back she saw my old attachment to this place it was not difficult to guess who but i can see the wisest course for me it comes to this that the blow aimed at you in your absence will strike her and mortally said redworth then i say it is terrible to have a friend said diana with her bosom heaving friendship i fancy means one heart between two his unstressed observation hit a bell in her head and set it reverberating she and emma had spoken written the very words she drew forth her emmas letter from under her left breast and read some halfblinded lines redworth immediately prepared to leave her to her feelingstrustier guides than her judgement in this crisis adieu for the night mrs warwick he said and was guilty of eulogizing the judgement he thought erratic for the moment night is a calm adviser let me presume to come again in the morning i dare not go back without you she looked up as they faced together each saw that the other had passed through a furnace scorching enough to him though hers was the delicacy exposed the reflection had its weight with her during the night danvers is getting ready a bed for you she is airing linen diana said but the bed was declined and the hospitality was not pressed the offer of it seemed to him significant of an unwary cordiality and thoughtlessness of tattlers that might account possibly for many things supposing a fool or madman or malignants to interpret them then good night said she they joined hands he exacted no promise that she would be present in the morning to receive him and it was a consolation to her desire for freedom until she reflected on the perfect confidence it implied and felt as a quivering butterfly impalpably pinned chapter x the conflict of the night her brain was a steamwheel throughout the night everything that could be thought of was tossed nothing grasped the unfriendliness of the friends who sought to retain her recurred for lookto fly could not be interpreted as a flight it was but a stepping aside a disdain of defending herself and a wrapping herself in her dignity women would be with her she called on the noblest of them to justify the course she chose and they did in an almost audible murmur and o the rich reward a black archwaygate swung open to the glittering fields of freedom emma was not of the chorus emma meditated as an invalid how often had emma bewailed to her that the most grievous burden of her malady was her fatal tendency to brood sickly upon human complications she could not see the blessedness of the prospect of freedom to a woman abominably yoked what if a miserable woman were dragged through mire to reach it married the mire was her portion whatever she might do that manbut pass him and that otherthe dear the kind careless highhearted old friend he could honestly protest his guiltlessness and would smilingly leave the case to go its ways of this she was sure that her decision and her pleasure would be his they were tied to the stake she had already tasted some of the mortal agony did it matter whether the flames consumed her reflecting on the interview with redworth though she had performed her part in it placidly her skin burned it was the beginning of tortures if she stayed in england by staying to defend herself she forfeited her attitude of dignity and lost all chance of her reward and name the sort of world it is dear friends for which we are to sacrifice our one hope of freedom that we may preserve our fair fame in it diana cried aloud my freedom feeling as a butterfly flown out of a box to stretches of sunny earth beneath spacious heavens her bitter marriage joyless in all its chapters indefensible where the man was right as well as where insensately wrong had been imprisonment she excused him down to his last madness if only the bonds were broken here too in this very house of her happiness with her father she had bound herself to the man voluntarily quite inexplicably voluntarily as we say but there must be a spell upon us at times upon young women there certainly is the wild brain of diana armed by her later enlightenment as to the laws of life and nature dashed in revolt at the laws of the world when she thought of the forces natural and social urging young women to marry and be bound to the end it should be a spotless world which is thus ruthless but were the world impeccable it would behave more generously the world is ruthless dear friends because the world is hypocrite the world cannot afford to be magnanimous or even just her dissensions with her husband their differences of opinion and puny wranglings hoistings of two standards reconciliations for the sake of decency breaches of the truce and his detested meanness the man behind the mask and glimpses of herself too the halfknown halfsuspected developing creature claiming to be diana and unlike her dreamed diana deformed by marriage irritable acerb rebellious constantly justifiable against him but not in her own mind and therefore accusing him of the double crime of provoking her and perverting herthese were the troops defiling through her head while she did battle with the hypocrite world one painful sting was caused by the feeling that she could have loved whom an ideal had he the imagined but unvisioned been her yoke fellow would she now lie raising cagedbeast cries in execration of the yoke she would not now be seeing herself as hare serpent tigress the hypothesis was reviewed in negatives she had barely a sense of softness just a single little heave of the bosom quivering upward and leadenly sinking when she glanced at a married diana heartily mated the regrets of the youthful for a life sailing away under medical sentence of death in the sad eyes of relatives resemble it she could have loved goodbye to that a womans brutallest tussle with the world was upon her she was in the arena of the savage claws flung there by the man who of all others should have protected her from them and what had she done to deserve it she listened to the advocate pleading her case she primed him to admit the charges to say the worst in contempt of legal prudence and thereby expose her transparent honesty the very things awakening a mad suspicion proved her innocence but was she this utterly simple person oh no she was the diana of the pride in her power of fencing with evilby no means of the order of those ninny young women who realize the popular conception of the purely innocent she had fenced and kept her guard of this it was her angry glory to have the knowledge but she had been compelled to fence such are men in the world of facts that when a woman steps out of her domestic tangle to assert because it is a tangle her rights to partial independence they sight her for their prey or at least they complacently suppose her accessible wretched at home a woman ought to bury herself in her wretchedness else may she be assured that not the cleverest wariest guard will cover her character against the husband her cause was triumphant against herself she decided not to plead it for this reason that the preceding court which was the public and only positive one had entirely and justly exonerated her but the holding of her hand by the friend half a minute too long for friendship and the overfriendliness of looks letters frequency of visits would speak within her she had a darting view of her husbands estimation of them in his present mood she quenched it they were trifles things that women of the world have to combat the revelation to a fairminded young woman of the majority of men being naught other than men and some of the friendliest of men betraying confidence under the excuse of temptation is one of the shocks to simplicity which leave her the alternative of misanthropy or philosophy diana had not the heart to hate her kind so she resigned herself to pardon and to the recognition of the state of duel between the sexesactive enough in her sphere of society the circle hummed with it many lived for it could she pretend to ignore it her personal experience might have instigated a less clear and less intrepid nature to take advantage of the opportunity for playing the popular innocent who runs about with astonished eyes to find herself in so hunting a world and wins general compassion if not shelter in unsuspected and unlicenced places there is perpetually the inducement to act the hypocrite before the hypocrite world unless a woman submits to be the humbly knitting housewife unquestioningly worshipful of her lord for the world is ever gracious to an hypocrisy that pays homage to the mask of virtue by copying it the world is hostile to the face of an innocence not conventionally simpering and quite surprised the world prefers decorum to honesty let me be myself whatever the martyrdom she cried in that phase of young sensation when to the blooming woman the putting on of a mask appears to wither her and reduce her to the show she parades yet in common with her sisterhood she owned she had worn a sort of mask the world demands it of them as the price of their station that she had never worn it consentingly was the plea for now casting it off altogether showing herself as she was accepting martyrdom becoming the first martyr of the modern womans causea grand position and one imaginable to an excited mind in the dark which does not conjure a critical humour as light does to correct the feverish sublimity she was then this martyr a woman capable of telling the world she knew it and of confessing that she had behaved in disdain of its rigider rules according to her own ideas of her immunities o brave but was she holding the position by flight it involved the challenge of consequences not an evasion of them she moaned her mental steamwheel stopped fatigue brought sleep she had sensationally led her rebellious wits to the crossways distilling much poison from thoughts on the way and there for the luxury of a still seeming indecision she sank into oblivion chapter xi recounts the journey in a chariot with a certain amount of dialogue and a small incident on the road in the morning the fight was over she looked at the signpost of the crossways whilst dressing and submitted to follow obediently as a puppet the road recommended by friends though a voice within that she took for the intimations of her reason protested that they were wrong that they were judging of her case in the general and unwisely disastrously for her the mistaking of her desires for her reasons was peculiar to her situation so i suppose i shall some day see the crossways again she said to conceive a compensation in the abandonment of freedom the nights red vision of martyrdom was reserved to console her secretly among the unopened lockers in her treasury of thoughts it helped to sustain her and she was too conscious of things necessary for her sustainment to bring it to the light of day and examine it she had a pitiful bit of pleasure in the gratification she imparted to danvers by informing her that the journey of the day was backward to copsley if i may venture to say so maam i am very glad said her maid you must be prepared for the questions of lawyers danvers oh maam theyll get nothing out of me and their wigs wont frighten me it is usually their baldness that is most frightening my poor danvers nor their baldness maam said the literal maid i never cared for their heads or them ive been in a case before indeed exclaimed her mistress and she had a chill danvers mentioned a notorious case adding they got nothing out of me in my case you will please to speak the truth said diana and beheld in the lookingglass the primming of her maids mouth the sight shot a sting understand that there is to be no hesitation about telling the truth of what you know of me said diana and the answer was no maam for danvers could remark to herself that she knew little and was not a person to hesitate she was a maid of the world with the quality of faithfulness by nature to a good mistress redworths further difficulties were confined to the hiring of a conveyance for the travellers and hotwater bottles together with a postillion not addicted to drunkenness he procured a postingchariot an ancient and musty of a late autumnal yellow unrefreshed by paint the only bottles to be had were dutch schiedam his postillion inspected at storling carried the flag of habitual inebriation on his nose and he deemed it adviseable to ride the mare in accompaniment as far as riddlehurst notwithstanding the postillions vows upon his honour that he was no drinker the emphasis to a gentleman acquainted with his countrymen was not reassuring he had hopes of enlisting a trustier fellow at riddlehurst but he was disappointed and while debating upon what to do for he shrank from leaving two women to the conduct of that inflamed troughsnout brisby despatched to storling by an afterthought of lady dunstanes rushed out of the riddlehurst inn taproom and relieved him of the charge of the mare he was accommodated with a seat on a stool in the chariot my triumphal car said his captive she was very amusing about her postillion danvers had to beg pardon for laughing you are happy observed her mistress but redworth laughed too and he could not boast of any happiness beyond the temporary satisfaction nor could she who sprang the laughter boast of that little she said to herself in the midst of the hilarity wherever i go now in all weathers i am perfectly naked and remembering her readings of a certain wonderful old quarto book in her fathers library by an eccentric old scottish nobleman wherein the wearing of garments and sleeping in houses is accused as the cause of human degeneracy she took a forced merry stand on her return to the primitive healthful state of man and woman and affected scorn of our modern ways of dressing and thinking whence it came that she had some of her wildest seizures of iridescent humour danvers attributed the fun to her mistresss gladness in not having pursued her bent to quit the country redworth saw deeper and was nevertheless amazed by the airy hawkpoise and pouncedown of her wit as she ranged high and low now capriciously generalizing now dropping bolt upon things of passagethe postillion jogging from rum to gin the rustics baconly agape the horsekneed ostlers she touched them to the life in similes and phrases and next she was aloft derisively philosophizing but with a comic afflatus that dispersed the sharpness of her irony in mocking laughter the afternoon refreshments at the inn of the county markettown and the english idea of public hospitality as to manner and the substance provided for wayfarers were among the themes she made memorable to him she spoke of everything tolerantly just naming it in a simple sentence that fell with a ring and chimed their hosts ready acquiescence in receiving orders his contemptuous disclaimer of stuff he did not keep his flat indifference to the sheep he sheared and the phantom halfcrown flickering in one eye of the anticipatory waiter the pervading and confounding smell of stale beer over all the apartments the prevalent notion of bread butter tea milk sugar as matter for the exercise of a native inventive geniusthese were reviewed in quips of metaphor come we can do better at an inn or two known to me said redworth surely this is the best that can be done for us when we strike them with the magic wand of a postillion said she it depends as elsewhere on the individuals entertaining us yet you admit that your railways are rapidly polishing off the individual they will spread the metropolitan idea of comfort i fear they will feed us on nothing but that big word it booms a curfew bellfor every poor little light that we would read by seeing their beaconnosed postillion preparing too mount and failing in his jump redworth was apprehensive and questioned the fellow concerning potation lord sir they call me half a horse but i cant bids water was the reply with the assurance that he had not taken a pailful habit enabled him to gain his seat it seems to us unnecessary to heap on coal when the chimney is afire but he may know the proper course diana said convulsing danvers and there was discernibly to redworth under the influence of her phrases a likeness of the flaming halfhorse with the animals all smoking in the frost to a railway engine your wrinkled centaur she named the man of course he had to play second to her and not unwillingly but he reflected passingly on the instinctive push of her rich and sparkling voluble fancy to the initiative which women do not like in a woman and men prefer to distantly admire english women and men feel toward the quickwitted of their species as to aliens having the demerits of alienswordiness vanity obscurity shallowness an empty glitter the sin of posturing a quickwitted woman exerting her wit is both a foreigner and potentially a criminal she is incandescent to a breath of rumour it accounted for her having detractors a heavy counterpoise to her enthusiastic friends it might account for her husbands discontent the reduction of him to a state of mere masculine antagonism what is the husband of a vanward woman he feels himself but a diminished man the english husband of a voluble woman relapses into a dreary mute ah for the choice of places redworth would have yielded her the loquent lead for the smallest of the privileges due to him who now rejected all except the public scourging of her the conviction was in his mind that the husband of this woman sought rather to punish than be rid of her but a part of his own emotion went to form the judgement furthermore lady dunstanes allusion to her enemies made him set down her growing crops of backbiters to the trick she had of ridiculing things english if the english do it themselves it is in a professionally robust a jocose kindly way always with a glance at the other things great things they excel in and it is done to have the credit of doing it they are keen to catch an inimical tone they will find occasion to chastise the presumptuous individual unless it be the leader of a party therefore a power for they respect a power redworth knew their quaintnesses without overlooking them he winced at the acid of an irony that seemed to spring from aversion and regretted it for her sake he had to recollect that she was in a sharpstrung mood bitterly surexcited moreover he reminded himself of her many and memorable phrases of enthusiasm for englandshakespeareland as she would sometimes perversely term it to sink the country in the poet english fortitude english integrity the english disposition to do justice to dependents adolescent english ingenuousness she was always ready to laud only her enthusiasm required rousing by circumstances it was less at the brim than her satire hence she made enemies among a placable people he felt that he could have helped her under happier conditions the beautiful vision she had been on the night of the irish ball swept before him and he looked at her smiling why do you smile she said i was thinking of mr sullivan smith ah my dear compatriot and think too of lord larrian she caught her breath instead of recreation the names brought on a fit of sadness it deepened shy neither smiled nor rattled any more she gazed across the hedgeways at the white meadows and baretwigged copses showing their last leaves in the frost i remember your words observation is the most enduring of the pleasures of life and so i have found it she said there was a brightness along her undereyelids that caused him to look away the expected catastrophe occurred on the descent of a cutting in the sand where their cordial postillion at a trot bumped the chariot against the sturdy wheels of a waggon which sent it reclining for support upon a beechtrees huge intertwisted serpent roots amid strips of brown bracken and pendant weeds while he exhibited one short stump of leg all boot in air no one was hurt diana disengaged herself from the shoulder of danvers and mildly said that reminds me i forgot to ask why we came in a chariot redworth was excited on her behalf but the broken glass had done no damage nor had danvers fainted the remark was unintelligible to him apart from the comforting it had been designed to give he jumped out and held a hand for them to do the same i never foresaw an event more positively said he and it was nothing but a back view that inspired you all the way said diana a waggoner held the horses another assisted redworth to right the chariot the postillion had hastily recovered possession of his official seat that he might as soon as possible feel himself again where he was most intelligent and was gay in stupidity indifferent to what happened behind him diana heard him counselling the waggoner as to the common sense of meeting small accidents with a cheerful soul lord he cried i been pitched a somerset in my time and taken up for dead and that didnt beat me disasters of the present kind could hardly affect such a veteran but he was painfully disconcerted by redworths determination not to entrust the ladies any farther to his guidance danvers had implored for permission to walk the mile to the town and thence take a fly to copsley her mistress rather sided with the postillion who begged them to spare him the disgrace of riding in and delivering a box at the red lion whatll they say and they know arthur dance well there he groaned what arthur chariotin a box and me a better man to his work now than i been for many a long season fit for double the journey a bit of a shake always braces me up i could read a newspaper right off small print and all come along sir and hand the ladies in danvers vowed her thanks to mr redworth for refusing they walked ahead the postillion communicated his mixture of professional and human feelings to the waggoners and walked his horses in the rear meditating on the weakheartedness of gentryfolk and the means for escaping being chaffed out of his boots at the old red lion where he was to eat drink and sleep that night ladies might be fearsome after a bit of a shake he would not have supposed it of a gentleman he jogged himself into an arithmetic of the number of nips of liquor he had taken to soothe him on the road in spite of the gentleman for some of em are sworn enemies of poor men as yonder one neer a doubt diana enjoyed her walk beneath the lingering brownred of the frosty november sunset with the scent of sandearth strong in the air i had to hire a chariot because there was no twohorse carriage said redworth and i wished to reach copsley as early as possible she replied smiling that accidents were fated as a certain marriage had been the comparison forced itself on her reflections but this is quite an adventure said she reanimated by the brisker flow of her blood we ought really to be thankful for it in days when nothing happens redworth accused her of getting that idea from the perusal of romances yes our lives require compression like romances to be interesting and we object to the process she said real happiness is a state of dulness when we taste it consciously it becomes mortala thing of the seasons but i like my walk how long these november sunsets burn and what hues they have there is a scientific reason only dont tell it me now i understand why you always used to choose your holidays in november she thrilled him with her friendly recollection of his customs as to happiness the looking forward is happiness he remarked oh the looking back back she cried forward that is life and backward death if you will and still at is happiness death and our postillion ay i wonder why the fellow hangs to the rear said redworth turning about its his cunning strategy poor creature so that he may be thought to have delivered us at the head of the town for us to make a purchase or two if we go to the inn on foot said diana we ll let the manoeuvre succeed redworth declared that she had a head for everything and she was flattered to hear him so passing from the southern into the western road they saw the town lights beneath an amber sky burning out sombrely over the woods of copsley and entered the town the postillion following chapter xii between emma and diana diana was in the arms of her friend at a late hour of the evening and danvers breathed the amiable atmosphere of footmen once more professing herself perished this maid of the world who could endure hardships and loss of society for the mistress to whom she was attached no sooner saw herself surrounded by the comforts befitting her station than she indulged in the luxury of a wailful dejectedness the better to appreciate them she was unaffectedly astonished to find her outcries against the cold and the journeyings to and fro interpreted as a serving womans muffled comments on her mistresss behaviour lady dunstanes maid bartlett and mrs bridges the housekeeper and foster the butler contrived to let her know that they could speak an if they would and they expressed their pity of her to assist her to begin the speaking she bowed in acceptance of fosters offer of a glass of wine after supper but treated him and the other two immediately as though they had been interrogating bigwigs they wormed nothing out of me she said to her mistress at night undressing her but what a set they are theyve got such comfortable places theyve all their days and hours for talk of the doings of their superiors they read the vilest of those town papers and they put their two and two together of what is happening in and about and not one of the footmen thinks of staying because it s so dull and they and the maids objectdid one ever hearto the three uppers retiring when they ve done dining to the private room to dessert that is the custom observed her mistress foster carries the decanter maam and mrs bridges the biscuits and bartlett the plate of fruit and they march out in order the man at the head of the procession probably oh yes and the others though they have everything except the wine and dessert dont like it when i was here last they were new and hadnt a word against it now they say its invidious lady dunstane will be left without an underservant at copsley soon i was asked about your boxes maam and the moment i said they were at dover that instant all three peeped they let out a mouse to me they do love to talk her mistress could have added and you too my good danvers trustworthy though she knew the creature to be in the main now go and be sure you have bedclothes enough before you drop asleep she said and danvers directed her steps to gossip with bartlett diana wrapped herself in a dressinggown lady dunstane had sent her and sat by the fire thinking of the powder of tattle stored in servants halls to explode beneath her and but for her choice of roads she might have been among strangers the liking of strangers best is a curious exemplification of innocence yes i was in a muse she said raising her head to emma whom she expected and sat armed to meet unaccountably ironnerved i was questioning whether i could be quite as blameless as i fancy if i sit and shiver to be in england you will tell me i have taken the right road i doubt it but the road is taken and here i am but any road that leads me to you is homeward my darling she tried to melt determining to be at least open with her i have not praised you enough for coming said emma when they had embraced again praise a little your truest friend of women your letter gave the tug i might have resisted it he came straight from heaven but cruel tony where is your love it is unequal to yours dear i see i could have wrestled with anything abstract and distant from being certain but here i am but my own dear girl you never could have allowed this infamous charge to be undefended i think so ive an odd apathy as to my character rather like death when one dreams of flying the soul what does it matter i should have left the flies and wasps to worry a corpse and thengoodbye gentility i should have worked for my bread i had thoughts of america i fancy i can write and americans one hears are gentle to women ah tony theres the looking back and of all women you or else dearwell perhaps once on foreign soil in a different air i mightmight have looked back and seen my whole self not shattered as i feel it now and come home again compassionate to the poor persecuted animal to defend her perhaps that was what i was running away for i fled on the instinct often a good thing to trust i saw you at the crossways i remembered i had the dread that you would though i did not imagine you would reach me so swiftly my going there was an instinct too i suppose we are all instinct when we have the world at our heels forgive me if i generalize without any longer the right to be included in the common human sum pariah and taboo are words we borrow from barbarous tribes they stick to me my tony you look as bright as ever and you speak despairingly call me enigma i am that to myself emmy you are not quite yourself to your friend since the blow i have been bewildered i see nothing upright it came on me suddenly stunned me a bolt out of a clear sky as they say he spared me a scene there had been threats and yet the sky was clear or seemed when we have a man for arbiter he is our sky emma pressed her tonys unresponsive hand feeling strangely that her friend ebbed from her has he to mislead him she said colouring at the breach in the question proofs he has the proofs he supposes not to justify suspicion he broke open my desk and took my letters horrible but the letters emma shook with a nervous revulsion you might read them basest of men that is the unpardonable cowardice exclaimed emma the world will read them dear said diana and struck herself to ice she broke from the bitter frigidity in fury they are lettersnone very longsometimes two short sentenceshe wrote at any spare moment on my honour as a woman i feel for him most the lettersi would bear any accusation rather than that exposure letters of a man of his age to a young woman he rates too highly the world reads them do you hear it saying it could have excused her for that fiddlefaddle with a youngera young lover and had i thought of a lover i had no thought of loving or being loved i confess i was flattered to you emma i will confess you see the public ridiculeand half his age he and i would have appeared a romantic couple confess i said well dear the stake is lighted for a trial of its effect on me it is this he was never a dishonourable friend but men appear to be capable of friendship with women only for as long as we keep out of pulling distance of that line where friendship ceases they may step on it we must hold back a league i have learnt it you will judge whether he disrespects me as for him he is a man at his worst not one of the worst at his best better than very many there now emma you have me stripped and burning there is my full confession except for thisyes one thing furtherthat i do rage at the ridicule and could choose but for you to have given the world cause to revile me or think me romantic something or somebody to suffer for would really be agreeable it is a singular fact i have not known what this love is that they talk about and behold me marched into smithfieldsocietys heretic if you please i must own i think it hard emma chafed her cold hand softly it is hard i understand it she murmured and is your sunday visit to us in the list of offences an item you gave me a happy day then it counts for me in heaven he set spies on you so we may presume emma went through a sphere of tenuious reflections in a flash he will rue it perhaps now he may now be regretting his wretched frenzy and tony could pardon she has the power of pardoning in her heart oh certainly dear but tell me why it is you speak tonight rather unlike the sedate philosophical emma in a tonewell tolerably sentimental i am unaware of it said emma who could have retorted with a like reproach i am anxious i will not say at present for your happiness for your peace and i have a hope that possibly a timely word from some friendlukin or anothermight induce him to consider to pardon me do you mean cried diana flushing sternly not pardon suppose a case of faults on both sides you address a faulty person my dear but do you know that you are hinting at a reconcilement might it not be open your eyes to what it involves i trust i can pardon let him go his ways do his darkest or repent but return to the roof of the basest of men who was guilty of the unpardonable cowardice you expect me to be superhuman when i consent to that i shall be out of my womans skin which he has branded go back to him she was taken with a shudder of head and limbs no i really have the power of pardoning and i am bound to for among my debts to him this present exemption that is like liberty dragging a chain or say an escaped felon wearing his manacles should count i am sensible of my obligation the price i pay for it is an immovable patchattractive to male idiots i have heard and a mark of scorn to females between the two the remainder of my days will be lively out out damned spot but it will not and not on the handon the forehead well talk of it no longer i have sent a note with an enclosure to my lawyers i sell the crossways if i have the married womans right to any scrap of property for money to scatter fees my purse dear tony exclaimed emma my house you will stay with me why do you shake your head with me you are safe she spied at the shadows in her friends face ever since your marriage tony you have been strange in your trick of refusing to stay with me and you and i made our friendship the pledge of a belief in eternity we vowed it come i do talk sentimentally but my heart is in it i beg youall the reasons are with meto make my house your home you will you know i am rather lonely diana struggled to keep her resolution from being broken by tenderness and doubtless poor sir lukin had learnt his lesson still her defensive instincts could never quite slumber under his roof not because of any further fear that they would have to be summoned it was chiefly owing to the consequences of his treacherous foolishness for this halfhome with her friend thenceforward denied to her she had accepted a protector called husbandrashly past credence in the retrospect but it had been her propelling motive and the loathings roused by her marriage helped to sicken her at the idea of a lengthened stay where she had suffered the shock precipitating her to an act of insanity i do not forget you were an heiress emmy and i will come to you if i need money to keep my head up as for staying two reasons are against it if i am to fight my battle i must be seen i must go about wherever i am received so my field is london that is obvious and i shall rest better in a house where my story is not known two or three questions ensued diana had to fortify her fictitious objection by alluding to her maids prattle of the household below and she excused the hapless overfed idle people of those regions to emma it seemed a not unnatural sensitiveness she came to a settled resolve in her thoughts as she said they want a change london is their element feeling that she deceived this true heart however lightly and necessarily diana warmed to her forgiving her at last for having netted and dragged her back to front the enemy an imposition of horrors of which the scene and the travelling with redworth the talking of her case with her most intimate friend as well had been a distempering foretaste they stood up and kissed parting for the night an odd world where for the sin we have not participated in we must fib and continue fibbing she reflected she did not entirely cheat her clearer mind for she perceived that her step in flight had been urged both by a weak despondency and a blind desperation also that the world of a fluid civilization is perforce artificial but her mind was in the background of her fevered senses and when she looked in the glass and mused on uttering the word liar to the lovely image her senses were refreshed her mind somewhat relieved the face appeared so sovereignly defiant of abasement thus did a nature distraught by pain obtain some short lull of repose thus moreover by closely reading herself whom she scourged to excess that she might in justice be comforted she gathered an increasing knowledge of our human constitution and stored matter for the brain chapter xiii touching the first days of her probation the result of her sleeping was that dianas humour locked up overnight insisted on an excursion as she lay with halfburied head and open eyelids thinking of the firm of lawyers she had to see and to whom and to the legal profession generally she would be under outward courtesies nothing other than the woman warwick she pursued the woman warwick unmercifully through a series of interviews with her decorous and crudelyminded defenders accurately perusing them behind their senior staidness her scorching sensitiveness sharpened her intelligence in regard to the estimate of discarded wives entertained by men of business and plain men of the world and she drove the woman warwick down their ranks amazed by the vision of a puppet so unlike to herself in reality though identical in situation that woman reciting her side of the case gained a gradual resemblance to danvers she spoke primly perpetually the creature aired her handkerchief she was bent on softening those sugarloaves the hard businessmen applying to her for facts facts were treated as unworthy of her mere stuff of the dustheap muttonbones old shoes she swam above them in a cocoon of her spinning sylphidine unseizable and between perplexing and mollifying the slaves of facts she saw them at their heels a tearful fry abjectly imitative of her melodramatic performances the spectacle was presented of a band of legal gentlemen vociferating mightily for swords and the onset like the austrian empresss magyars to vindicate her just and holy cause our lawcourts failing they threatened parliament and for a last resort the country we are not going to be the woman warwick without a stir my brethren emma an early riser that morning for the purpose of a private consultation with mr redworth found her lying placidly wakeful to judge by appearances you have not slept my dear child perfectly said diana giving her hand and offering the lips im only having a warm morning bath in bed she added in explanation of a chill moisture that the touch of her exposed skin betrayed for whatever the fun of the woman warwick there had been sympathetic feminine horrors in the frame of the sentient woman emma fancied she kissed a quiet sufferer a few remarks very soon set her wildly laughing both were laughing when danvers entered the room rather guilty being late and the sight of the primvisaged maid she had been driving among the lawyers kindled dianas comic imagination to such a pitch that she ran riot in drolleries carrying her friend headlong on the tide i have not laughed so much since you were married said emma nor i dear proving that the bar to it was the ceremony said diana she promised to remain at copsley three days then for the campaign in mr redworths metropolis i wonder whether i may ask him to get me lodgings a sittingroom and two bedrooms the crossways has a board up for letting i should prefer to be my own tenant only it would give me a hundred pounds more to get a substitutes money i should like to be at work writing instantly ink is my opium and the pen my nigger and he must dig up gold for me it is written danvers you can make ready to dress me when i ring emma helped the beautiful woman to her dressinggown and the step from her bed she had her thoughts and went down to redworth at the breakfasttable marvelling that any husband other than a madman could cast such a jewel away the material loveliness eclipses intellectual qualities in such reflections he must be mad she said compelled to disburden herself in a congenial atmosphere which however she infrigidated by her overflow of exclamatory wondermenta curtain that shook voluminous folds luring redworth to dreams of the treasure forfeited he became rigidly practical provision will have to be made for her lukin must see mr warwick she will do wisely to stay with friends in town mix in company women are the best allies for such cases who are her solicitors they are mine braddock thorpe and simnel a good firm she is in safe hands with them i dare say they may come to an arrangement i should wish it she will never consent redworth shrugged a womans never fell far short of outstripping the sturdy pedestrian time to his mind diana saw him drive off to catch the coach in the valley regulated to meet the train and much though she liked him she was not sorry that he had gone she felt the better clad for it she would have rejoiced to witness the departure on wings of all her friends except emma to whom her coldness overnight had bound her anew warmly in contrition and yet her friends were wellbeloved by her but her emotions were distraught emma told her that mr redworth had undertaken to hire a suite of convenient rooms and to these she looked forward the nest among strangers where she could begin to write earning bread an idea that with the pride of independence conjured the pleasant morning smell of a bakery about her she passed three peaceable days at copsley at war only with the luxury of the house on the fourth a letter to lady dunstane from redworth gave the address of the best lodgings he could find and diana started for london she had during a couple of weeks besides the first fresh exercising of her pen as well as the severe gratification of economy a savage exultation in passing through the streets on foot and unknown save for the plunges into the office of her solicitors she could seem to herself a woman who had never submitted to the yoke what a pleasure it was after finishing a number of pages to start eastward toward the lawyer regions full of imaginary cropping incidents and from that churchyard westward against smoky sunsets or in welcome fogs an atom of the crowd she had an affection for the crowd they clothed her she laughed at the gloomy forebodings of danvers concerning the perils environing ladies in the streets after dark alone the lights in the streets after dark and the quick running of her blood combined to strike sparks of fancy and inspirit the task of composition at night this new strange solitary life cut off from her adulatory society both by the shock that made the abyss and by the utter foreignness threw her in upon her natural forces recasting her and thinning away her memory of her past days excepting girlhood into the remote she lived with her girlhood as with a simple little sister they were two in one and she corrected the dreams of the younger protected and counselled her very sagely advising her to love truth and look always to reality for her refreshment she was ready to say that no habitable spot on our planet was healthier and pleasanter than london as to the perils haunting the head of danvers her experiences assured her of a perfect immunity from them and the maligned thoroughfares of a great city she was ready to affirm contrasted favourably with certain hospitable halls the longsuffering fates permitted her for a term to enjoy the generous delusion subsequently a sweet surprise alleviated the shock she had sustained emma dunstanes carriage was at her door and emma entered her sittingroom to tell her of having hired a house in the neighbourhood looking on the park she begged to have her for guest sorrowfully anticipating the refusal at least they were to be near one another you really like this life in lodgings asked emma to whom the stiff furniture and narrow apartments were a dreariness the miserably small fire of the sittingroom an aspect of cheerless winter i do said diana yes she added with some reserve and smiled at her damped enthusiasm i can eat when i like walk workand i am working my legs and my pen demand it let me be independent besides i begin to learn something of the bigger world outside the one i know and i crush my mincing tastes in return for that i get a sense of strength i had not when i was a drawingroom exotic much is repulsive but i am taken with a passion for reality they spoke of the lawyers and the calculated period of the trial of the husband too in his inciting belief in the falseness of his wife that is his excuse diana said her closed mouth meditatively dimpling the comers over thoughts of his grounds for fury he had them though none for the incriminating charge the sphinx mouth of the married woman at war and at bay must be left unriddled she and the law differed in their interpretation of the dues of wedlock but matters referring to her case were secondary with diana beside the importance of her storing impressions her mind required to hunger for something and this reality which frequently she was forced to loathe she forced herself proudly to accept despite her youthfulness her philosophy swallowed it in the lump as the great serpent his meal she hoped to digest it sleeping likewise her visits of curiosity to the law courts where she stood spying and listening behind a veil gave her a great deal of tough substance to digest there she watched the process of the tortures to be applied to herself and hardened her senses for the ordeal she saw there the ribbed and shanked old skeleton world on which our fair fleshly is moulded after all your fools paradise is not a garden to grow in charons ferryboat is not thicker with phantoms they do not live in mind or soul chiefly women people it a certain class of limp men women for the most part they are sown there and put their garden under the magnifying glass of intimacy what do we behold a world not better than the world it curtains only foolisher her conversations with lady dunstane brought her at last to the point of her damped enthusiasm she related an incident or two occurring in her career of independence and they discussed our state of civilization plainly and gravely save for the laughing peals her phrases occasionally provoked as when she named the intruders and disturbers of solitarily faring ladies cupids footpads her humour was created to swim on waters where a prescribed and cultivated prudery should pretend to be drowning i was getting an exalted idea of english gentlemen emmy rich and rare were the gems she wore i was ready to vow that one might traverse the larger island similarly respected i praised their chivalry i thought it a privilege to live in such a land i cannot describe to you how delightful it was to me to walk out and home generally protected i might have been seriously annoyed but that one of the clerks articled he called himselfof our lawyers happened to be by he offered to guard me and was amusing with his modest tiptoe air no i trust to the english common man more than ever he is a man of honour i am convinced he is matchless in any other country except ireland the english gentleman trades on his reputation he was condemned by an afflicted delicacy the sharpest of critical tribunals emma bade her not to be too sweeping from a bad example it is not a single one said diana what vexes me and frets me is that i must be a prisoner or allow danvers to mount guard and i cant see the end of it and danvers is no magician she seems to know her countrymen though she warded one of them off by saying to me this is the crossing my lady he fled lady dunstane affixed the popular title to the latter kind of gentleman she was irritated on her friends behalf and against the worrying of her sisterhood thinking in her heart nevertheless that the passing of a face and figure like dianas might inspire honourable emotions pitiable for being hapless if you were with me dear you would have none of these annoyances she said pleading forlornly diana smiled to herself no i should relapse into softness this life exactly suits my present temper my landlady is respectful and attentive the little housemaid is a willing slave danvers does not despise them pugnaciously they make a home for me and i am learning daily do you know the less ignorant i become the more considerate i am for the ignorance of othersi love them for it she squeezed emmas hand with more meaning than her friend apprehended so i win my advantage from the trifles i have to endure they are really trifles and i should once have thought them mountains for the moment diana stipulated that she might not have to encounter friends or others at lady dunstanes dinnertable and the season not being favourable to those gatherings planned by lady dunstane in her project of winning supporters there was a respite during which sir lukin worked manfully at his three clubs to vindicate dianas name from the hummers and hawers gaining half a dozen hot adherents and a body of lukewarm sufficiently stirred to be desirous to see the lady he worked with true champion zeal although an interview granted him by the husband settled his opinion as to any possibility of the two ever coming to terms also it struck him that if he by misadventure had been a woman and the wife of such a fellow by jove his apostrophe to the father of the gods of pagandom signifying the amount of matter warwick would have had reason to complain of in earnest by ricochet his military mind rebounded from his knowledge of himself to an ardent faith in mrs warwicks innocence for as there was no resemblance between them there must he deduced be a difference in their capacity for enduring the perpetual company of a prig a stick a petrified poser moreover the novel act of advocacy and the nature of the advocacy had effect on him and then he recalled the scene in the winter beechwoods and dianas wilddeer eyes her perfect generosity to a traitor and fool how could he have doubted her glimpses of the corrupting cause for it partly penetrated his density a conqueror of ladies in mid career doubts them all of course he had meant no harm nothing worse than some petty philandering with the loveliest woman of her time and by jove it was worth the rebuff to behold the beauty in her wrath the reflections of lothario however much tending tardily to do justice to a particular lady cannot terminate wholesomely but he became a gallant partisan his portrayal of mr warwick to his wife and his friends was fine caricature the fellow had his hand up at my first wordstood like a sentinel under inspection understand sir lukin that i receive you simply as an acquaintance as an intermediary permit me to state that you are taking superfluous trouble the case must proceed it is final she is at liberty in the meantime to draw on my bankers for the provision she may need at the rate of five hundred pounds per annum he spoke of the lady now bearing my name he was within an inch of saying dishonouring i swear i heard the dis and he caught himself up he again declined any attempt towards reconciliation it could only be founded on evasion of the truth to be made patent on the day of trial half his talk was lawyers lingo the fellows teeth looked like frost if lots wife had a brother his names warwick how diana merion who could have had the pick of the best of us ever came to marry a fellow like that passes my comprehension queer creatures as women are he can ride thats about all he can do i told him mrs warwick had no thought of reconciliation then sir lukin you will perceive that we have no standpoint for a discussion i told him the point was for a man of honour not to drag his wife before the public as he had no case to stand onless than nothing you should have seen the fellows face he shot a sneer up to his eyelids and flung his head back so i said goodday he marches me to the door with his compliments to lady dunstane i could have floored him for that bless my soul what fellows the world is made of when heres a man calling himself a gentleman who just because he gets in a rage with his wife for one thing or anotherand past all competition the handsomest woman of her day and the cleverest the nicest the best of the whole boilinghas her out for a public horsewhipping and sets all the idiots of the kingdom against her i tried to reason with him he made as if he were going to sleep standing sir lukin gratified lady dunstane by his honest championship of diana and now in his altered mood the thrice indebted rogue was just cloudily conscious of a desire to propitiate his dear wife by serving her friend he began a crusade against the scandalnewspapers going with an irish military comrade straight to the editorial offices and leaving his card and a warning that the chastisement for print of the name of the lady in their columns would be personal and condign captain carew mahony albeit unacquainted with mrs warwick had espoused her cause she was a woman she was an irishwoman she was a beautiful woman she had therefore three positive claims on him as a soldier and a man other irish gentlemen animated by the same swelling degrees were awaking to the intimation that they might be wanted some words were dropped here and there by general lord larrian he regretted his age and infirmities a goodly regiment for a bodyguard might have been selected to protect her steps in the public streets when it was bruited that the general had sent her a present of his great newfoundland dog leander to attend on her and impose a required respect but as it chanced that her address was unknown to the volunteer constabulary they had to assuage their ardour by thinking the dog luckier than they the report of the dog was a fact he arrived one morning at dianas lodgings with a soldier to lead him and a card to introducethe hercules of dogs a very ideal of the species toweringly big benevolent reputed a rescuer of lives disdainful of dogfighting devoted to his guardians office with a majestic paw to give and the noblest satisfaction in receiving caresses ever expressed by mortal male enfolded about the head kissed patted hugged snuggled informed that he was his new mistresss one love and darling she despatched a thrilling note of thanks to lord larrian sure of her touch upon an irish heart the dog leander soon responded to the attachment of a mistress enamoured of him he is my husband she said to emma and started a tear in the eyes of her smiling friend he promises to trust me and never to have the law of me and to love my friends as his own so we are certain to agree in rain snow sunshine through the parks and the streets he was the shadow of diana commanding on the whole apart from some desperate attempts to make him serve as introducer a civilized behaviour in the legions of cupids footpads but he helped innocently enough to create an enemy chapter xiv giving glimpses of diana under her cloud before the world and of her further apprenticeship as the day of her trial became more closely calculable dianas anticipated alarms receded with the deadening of her heart to meet the shock she fancied she had put on proofarmour unconscious that it was the turning of the inward flutterer to steel which supplied her cuirass and shield the necessity to brave society in the character of honest defendant caused but a momentary twitch of the nerves her heart beat regularly like a serviceable clock none of her faculties abandoned her save songfulness and none belied her excepting a disposition to tartness almost venomous in the sarcastic shafts she let fly at friends interceding with mr warwick to spare his wife when she had determined to be tried a strange fit of childishness overcame her powers of thinking and was betrayed in her manner of speaking thoughto herself her dwindled humour allowed her to appear the towering britomart she pouted contemptuously on hearing that a mr sullivan smith a remotely recollected figure had besought mr warwick for an interview and gained it by stratagem to bring the man to his senses but an ultrairishman did not compromise her battlefront as the busybody supplications of a personal friend like mr redworth did and that the latter without consulting her should be one of the plaintive crew whining about the heels of the plaintiff for a mercy she disdained and rejected was bitter to her taste he does not see that unless i go through the fire there is no justification for this wretched character of mine she exclaimed truce treaty withdrawal signified publicly pardon not exoneration by any means and now that she was in armour she had no dread of the public so she said redworths being then engaged upon the canvass of a borough added to the absurdity of his meddling with the dilemmas of a woman dear me emma think of stepping aside from the parliamentary road to entreat a husband to relent and arrange the domestic alliance of a contrary couple quixottry is agreeable reading a silly performance lady dunstane pleaded his friendship she had to quit the field where such darts were showering the first dinnerparty was aristocratic easy to encounter lord and lady crane lady pennon lord and lady esquart lord larrian mr and mrs montvert of halford manor lady singleby sir walter capperston friends admirers of diana patrons in the phrase of the time of her father were the guests lady pennon expected to be amused and was gratified for diana had only to open her mouth to set the great lady laughing she petitioned to have mrs warwick at her table that day week because the marquis was dying to make her acquaintance and begged to have all her sayings repeated to him vowed she must be salt in the desert and remember i back you through thick and thin said lady pennon to which diana replied if i am salt in the desert you are the spring and the old lady protested she must put that down for her book the witty mrs warwick of whom wit was expected had many incitements to be guilty of cheap wit and the beautiful mrs warwick being able to pass anything she uttered gave good and bad alike under the impulsion to give out something that the stripped and shivering mrs warwick might find a cover in applause she discovered the social uses of cheap wit she laid ambushes for anecdotes a telling form of it among a people of no conversational interlocution especially in the circles depending for dialogue upon perpetual fresh supplies of scandal which have plentiful crops yet not sufficient the old dinner and supper tables at the crossways furnished her with an abundant store and recollection failing she invented irish anecdotes are always popular in england as promoting besides the wholesome shake of the sides a kindly sense of superiority anecdotes also are portable unlike the lightning flash which will not go into the pocket they can be carried home they are disbursable at other tables these were dianas weapons she was perforce the actress of her part in happier times when light of heart and natural her vogue had not been so enrapturing doubtless cleopatra in her simple egyptian uniform would hardly have won such plaudits as her stress of barbaric oriental splendours evoked for her on the swan and serpent nilebargenot from posterity at least it is a terrible decree that all must act who would prevail and the more extended the audience the greater need for the mask and buskin from lady pennons table diana passed to lady cranes lady esquarts lady singlebys the duchess of rabys warmly clad in the admiration she excited she appeared at princess therese parylis first ball of the season and had her circle not of worshippers only she did not dance the princess a fair austrian benevolent to her sisterhood an admirer of dianas contrasting complexion would have had her dance once in a quadrille of her forming but yielded to the mute expression of the refusal wherever mrs warwick went her arts of charming were addressed to the women men may be counted on for falling bowled over by a handsome face and pointed tongue women require some wooing from their ensphered and charioted sister particularly if she is clouded and old womenexcellent buttressesmust be suavely courted now to woo the swimming matron and court the settled dowager she had to win forgiveness for her beauty and this was done easily done by forbearing to angle with it in the press of nibblers they ranged about her individually unnoticed seeming unaware of its effect where it kindled she smote a number of musical female chords compassion among them a general grave affability of her eyes and smiles was taken for quiet pleasure in the scene her fitful intentness of look when conversing with the older ladies told of the mind within at work upon what they said and she was careful that plain dialogue should make her comprehensible to them nature taught her these arts through which her wit became extolled entirely on the strength of her reputation and her beauty did her service by never taking aim abroad they are the womans arts of self defence as legitimately and honourably hers as the manful use of the fists with a coarser sex if it had not been nature that taught her the practice of them in extremity the sagacious dowagers would have seen brazenness rather than innocenceor an excuseable indiscretionin the part she was performing they are not lightly duped by one of their sex few tasks are more difficult than for a young woman under a cloud to hoodwink old women of the world they are the prey of financiers but time has presented them a magic ancient glass to scan their sex in at princess parylis ball two young men of singular elegance were observed by diana little though she concentered her attention on any figures of the groups she had the womans faculty transiently bestowed by perfervid jealousy upon men of distinguishing minutely in the calmest of indifferent glances she could see without looking and when her eyes were wide they had not to dwell to be detective it did not escape her that the englishman of the two hurried for the chance of an introduction nor that he suddenly after putting a question to a man beside him retired she spoke of them to emma as they drove home the princesss partner in the first quadrille hungarian i suppose he was like a tartar modelled by a greek supple as the scythians bow braced as the string he has the air of a born horseman and valses perfectly i wont say he was handsomer than a young englishman there but he had the advantage of soldierly training how different is that quick springy figure from our young mens lounging style it comes of military exercise and discipline that was count jochany a cousin of the princess and a cavalry officer said emma you dont know the other i am sure the one you mean must be percy dacier his retiring was explained the hon percy dacier was the nephew of lord dannisburgh often extolled to her as the promising youngster of his day with the reserve that he wasted his youth for the young gentleman was decorous and studious ambitious according to report a politician taking to politics much too seriously and exclusively to suit his uncles pattern for the early period of life uncle and nephew went their separate ways rarely meeting though their exchange of esteem was cordial thinking over his abrupt retirement from the crowded semicircle diana felt her position pinch her she knew not why lady dunstane was as indefatigable by day as by night in the business of acting goddess to her beloved tony whom she assured that the service instead of exhausting gave her such healthfulness as she had imagined herself to have lost for ever the word was passed and invitations poured in to choice conversational breakfasts private afternoon concerts all the humming seasons assemblies mr warwicks treatment of his wife was taken by implication for lunatic wherever she was heard or seen he had no case a jury of some hundreds of both sexes ready to be sworn pronounced against him only the personal enemies of the lord in the suit presumed to doubt and they exercised the discretion of a minority but there is an upper middle class below the aristocratic boasting an aristocracy of morals and eminently persuasive of public opinion if not commanding it previous to the relaxation by amendment of a certain legal process this class was held to represent the austerity of the country at present a relaxed austerity is represented and still the bulk of the members are of fair repute though not quite on the level of their pretensions they were then while more sharply divided from the titular superiors they are socially absorbing very powerful to brand a womans character whatever her rank might be having innumerable agencies and avenues for that high purpose to say nothing of the printingpress lady dunstanes anxiety to draw them over to the cause of her friend set her thinking of the influential mrs cramborne wathin with whom she was distantly connected the wife of a potent serjeantat law fast mounting to the bench and knighthood the centre of a circle and not strangely that despite her deficiency in the arts and graces for she had wealth and a cook a husband proud of his winecellar and the ambition to rule all the rewards together with the expectations of the virtuous she was a lady of incisive features bound in stale parchment complexion she had none but she had spotlessness of skin and sons and daughters just resembling her like cheaper editions of a precious quarto of a perished type you discerned the imitation of the type you acknowledged the inferior compositor mr cramborne wathin was by birth of a grade beneath his wife he sprang behind a curtain of horror from tradesmen the bench was in designation for him to wash out the stain but his children suffered in large hands and feet short legs excess of bone prominences misplaced their mother inspired them carefully with the religion she opposed to the pretensions of a nobler blood while instilling into them that the blood they drew from her was territorial far above the vulgar her appearance and her principles fitted her to stand for the puritan rich of the period emerging by the aid of an extending wealth into luxurious worldliness and retaining the maxims of their forefathers for the discipline of the poor and erring lady dunstane called on her ostensibly to let her know she had taken a house in town for the season and in the course of the chat mrs cramborne wathin was invited to dinner you will meet my dear friend mrs warwick she said and the reply was oh i have heard of her the formal consultation with mr cramborne wathin ended in an agreement to accept lady dunstanes kind invitation considering her husbands plenitude of old legal anecdotes and her own diligent perusal of the funny publications of the day that she might be on the level of the wits and celebrities she entertained mrs cramborne wathin had a right to expect the leading share in the conversation to which she was accustomed every honour was paid to them they met aristocracy in the persons of lord larrian of lady rockden colonel purlby the pettigrews but neither of them held the table for a moment the topics flew and were no sooner up than down they were unable to get a shot they had to eat in silence occasionally grinning because a woman labouring under a stigma would rattlerattle as if the laughter of the company were her due and decency beneath her notice some one alluded to a dog of mrs warwicks whereupon she trips out a story of her dogs amazing intelligence and pray said mrs cramborne wathin across the table merely to slip in a word what is the name of this wonderful dog his name is leander said diana oh leander i dont think i hear myself calling to a dog in a name of three syllables two at the most no so i call hero if i want him to come immediately said diana and the gentlemen to mrs cramborne wathins astonishment acclaimed it mr redworth at her elbow explained the point to her disgust that was dianas offence if it should seem a small one let it be remembered that a snub was intended and was foiled and foiled with an apparent simplicity enough to exasperate had there been no laughter of men to back the countering stroke a woman under a cloud she talked pushed to shine she would be heard would be applauded her chronicler must likewise admit the error of her giving way to a petty sentiment of antagonism on first beholding mrs cramborne wathin before whom she at once resolved to be herself for a holiday instead of acting demurely to conciliate probably it was an antagonism of race the shrinking of the skin from the burr but when tremendous powers are invoked we should treat any simple revulsion of our blood as a vice the gods of this worlds contests demand it of us in relation to them that the mind and not the instincts shall be at work otherwise the course of a prudent policy is never to invoke them but avoid the upper class was gained by her intrepidity her charm and her elsewhere offending wit however the case might go it is chivalrous but not alas inflammable in support of innocence the class below it is governed in estimates of character by accepted patterns of conduct yet where innocence under persecution is believed to exist the members animated by that belief can be enthusiastic enthusiasm is a heavensent steeplechaser and takes a flying leap of the ordinary barriers it is more intrusive than chivalry and has a passion to communicate its ardour two letters from stranger ladies reached diana through her lawyers and lady dunstane anonymous letters not so welcome being male effusions arrived at her lodgings one of them comical almost over the verge to pathos in its termination to me you will ever be the goddess dianamy faith in woman he was unacquainted with her she had not the heart to think the writers donkeys how they obtained her address was a puzzle they stole in to comfort her slightly they attached her to her position of defendant by the thought of what would have been the idea of her character if she had flowna reflection emanating from inexperience of the resources of sentimentalists if she had flown she was borne along by the tide like a butterfly that a fish may gobble unless a friendly hand shall intervene and could it in nature she was past expectation of release the attempt to imagine living with any warmth of blood in her vindicated character for the sake of zealous friends consigned her to a cold and empty house upon a foreign earth she had to set her mind upon the mysterious enshrouded twelve with whom the verdict would soon be hanging that she might prompt her human combativeness to desire the vindication at such a price as she would have to pay for it when emma dunstane spoke to her of the certainty of triumphing she suggested a possible dissentient among the fateful twelve merely to escape the drumming sound of that hollow big word the irreverent imp of her humour came to her relief by calling forth the twelve in the tone of the clerk of the court and they answered to their names of trades and crafts after the manner of titanias elves and were questioned as to their fitness by education habits enlightenment to pronounce decisively upon the case in dispute the case being plainly stated they replied that the long habit of dealing with scales enabled them to weigh the value of evidence the most delicate moreover they were englishmen and anything short of downright bullet facts went to favour the woman for thus we light the balance of legal injustice toward the sex we conveniently wink maam a rough oldfashioned way for us is it a breach of promiseshe may reckon on her damages we have daughters of our own is it a suit for divorcewell we have wives of our own and we can lash or we can spare thats as it may be but well keep the couple tied let em hate as they like if they cant furnish porkbutchers reasons for sundering because the man makes the money in this countrymy goodness what a funny people sirit s our way of holding the balance maambut would it not be better to rectify the law and the social system dear sirwhy maam we find it comfortabler to take cases as they come in the style of our fathersbut dont you see my good man that you are offering scapegoats for the comfort of the majoritywell maam there always were scapegoats and always will be we find it comes round pretty square in the end and i may be the scapegoat emmy it is perfectly possible the grocer the porkbutcher drysalter stationer teamerchant et caetera they sit on me i have studied the faces of the juries and mr braddock tells me of their composition and he admits that they do justice roughlya rough and tumble country to quote himthough he says they are honest in intention more shame to the man who drags you before themif he persists emma rejoined he will i know him i would not have him draw back now said diana catching her breath and dearest do not abuse him for if you do you set me imagining guiltiness oh heavensuppose me publicly pardoned no i have kinder feelings when we stand opposed it is odd and rather frets my conscience to think of the little resentment i feel hardly any he has not cause to like his wife i can own it and i am sorry for him heartily no two have ever come together so naturally antagonistic as we two we walked a dozen steps in stupefied union and hit upon crossways from that moment it was tug and tug he me i him by resisting i made him a tyrant and he by insisting made me a rebel and he was the maddest of tyrantsa weak one my dear he was also a doubledealer or no perhaps not in design he was moved at one time by his interests at another by his idea of his honour he took what i could get for him and then turned and drubbed me for getting it this is the creature you try to excuse exclaimed indignant emma yes becausebut fancy all the smart things i said being called my salliescan a woman live with itbecause i behaved i despised him too much and i showed it he is not a contemptible man before the world he is merely a very narrow one under close inspection i could notor did notconceal my feeling i showed it not only to him to my friend husband grew to mean to me stifler lungcontractor iron mask inquisitor everything antinatural he suffered under my sallies and it was the worse for him when he did not perceive their drift he is an upright man i have not seen marked meanness one might build up a respectable figure in negatives i could add a row of noughts to the single number he cherishes enough to make a millionnaire of him but strike away the first the rest are wind which signifies that if you do not take his estimate of himself you will think little of his negative virtues he is not eminently that is to say not saliently selfish not rancorous not obtrusivetatatata but dulldull as a woollen nightcap over eyes and ears and mouth oh an executioners black cap to me dull and suddenly staring awake to the idea of his honour i rendered him ridiculousi had caught a trick of using mens phrases dearest now that the day of trial draws nighyou have never questioned me and it was like you to spare me painbut now i can speak of him and myself diana dropped her voice here was another confession the proximity of the trial acted like fire on her faded recollection of incidents it may be that partly the shame of alluding to them had blocked her womans memory for one curious operation of the charge of guiltiness upon the nearly guiltless is to make them paint themselves pure white to the obliteration of minor spots until the whiteness being acknowledged or the ordeal imminent the spots recur and press upon their consciences she resumed in a rapid undertone you know that a certain degree of independence had been if not granted by him conquered by me i had the habit of it obedience with him is imprisonmenthe is a blind wall he received a commission greatly to his advantage and was absent he seems to have received information of some sort he returned unexpectedly at a late hour and attacked me at once middling violent my friendand that he is was coming from the house for a ten minutes talk as usual on his way home to refresh him after the long sitting and bearbaiting he had nightly to endure now let me confess i grew frightened mr warwick was off his head as they saycrazy and i could not bear the thought of those two meeting while he raged i threw open the window and put the lamp near it to expose the whole interiorcunning as a veteran intriguer horrible but it had to be done to keep them apart he asked me what madness possessed me to sit by an open window at midnight in view of the public with a damp wind blowing i complained of want of air and fanned my forehead i heard the steps on the pavement i stung him to retort loudly and i was relieved the steps passed on so the trick succeededthe trick it was the worst i was guilty of but it was a trick and it branded me trickster it teaches me to see myself with an abyss in my nature full of infernal possibilities i think i am hewn in black rock a woman who can do as i did by instinct needs to have an angel always near her if she has not a husband she reveres we are none of us better than you dear tony only some are more fortunate and many are cowards emma said you acted prudently in a wretched situation partly of your own making partly of the circumstances but a nature like yours could not sit still and moan that marriage was to blame the english notion of women seems to be that we are born white sheep or black circumstances have nothing to do with our colour they dread to grant distinctions and to judge of us discerningly is beyond them whether the fiction that their homes are purer than elsewhere helps to establish the fact i do not know there is a class that does live honestly and at any rate it springs from a liking for purity but i am sure that their method of impressing it on women has the dangers of things artificial they narrow their understanding of human nature and that is not the way to improve the breed i suppose we women are taken to be the second thoughts of the creator human natures fringes mere finishing touches not a part of the texture said diana the pretty ornamentation however i fancy i perceive some tolerance growing in the minds of the dominant sex our old lawyer mr braddock who appears to have no distaste for conversations with me assures me he expects the day to come when women will be encouraged to work at crafts and professions for their independence that is the secret of the opinion of us at presentour dependency give us the means of independence and we will gain it and have a turn at judging you my lords you shall behold a world reversed whenever i am distracted by existing circumstances i lay my finger on the material conditions and i touch the secret individually it may be moral with us collectively it is materialgross wrongs gross hungers i am a married rebel and thereof comes the social rebel i was once a dancing and singing girl you remember the night of the dublin ball a channel sea in uproar stirred by witches flows between you are as lovely as you were theni could say lovelier said emma i have unconquerable health and i wish i could give you the half of it dear i work late into the night and i wake early and fresh in the morning i do not sing that is all a few days more and my character will be up before the bulls head to face him in the arena the worst of a position like mine is that it causes me incessantly to think and talk of myself i believe i think less than i talk but the subject is growing stale as those who are long dying feel i dare sayif they do not take it as the compensation for their departure the bulls head or british jury of twelve with the wig on it was faced during the latter half of a week of good news first mr thomas redworth was returned to parliament by a stout majority for the borough of orrybridge the hon percy dacier delivered a brilliant speech in the house of commons necessarily pleasing to his uncle lord larrian obtained the command of the rock the house of the crossways was let to a tenant approved by mr braddock diana received the opening proof sheets of her little volume and an instalment of the modest honorarium and finally the plaintiff in the suit involving her name was adjudged to have not proved his charge she heard of it without a change of countenance she could not have wished it the reverse she was exonerated but she was not free far from that and she revenged herself on the friends who made much of her triumph and overlooked her plight by showing no sign of satisfaction there was in her bosom a revolt at the legal consequences of the verdictor blunt acquiescence of the law in the conditions possibly to be imposed on her unless she went straight to the relieving phial and the burden of keeping it under set her wildest humour alight somewhat as redworth remembered of her on the journey from the crossways to copsley this ironic fury coming of the contrast of the outer and the inner would have been indulged to the extent of permanent injury to her disposition had not her beloved emma immediately after the tension of the struggle ceased required her tenderest aid lady dunstane chanted victory and at night collapsed by the advice of her physician she was removed to copsley where dianas labour of anxious nursing restored her through love to a saner spirit the hopefulness of life must bloom again in the heart whose prayers are offered for a life dearer than its own to be preserved a little return of confidence in sir lukin also refreshed her when she saw that the poor creature did honestly in his shaggy rough male fashion reverence and cling to the flower of souls he named as his wife his piteous groans of selfaccusation during the crisis haunted her and made the conduct and nature of men a bewilderment to her still young understanding save for the knot of her sensations hardly a mental memory but a sullen knot which she did not disentangle to charge him with his complicity in the blind rashness of her marriage she might have felt sisterly as warmly as she compassionated him it was midwinter when dame gossip who keeps the exotic world alive with her fanning whispers related that the lovely mrs warwick had left england on board the schooneryacht clarissa with lord and lady esquart for a voyage in the mediterranean and behind her hand that the reason was urgent inasmuch as she fled to escape the meshes of the terrific net of the marital law brutally whirled to capture her by the man her husband chapter xv introduces the hon percy dacier the gods of this worlds contests against whom our poor stripped individual is commonly in revolt are as we know not miners they are reapers and if we appear no longer on the surface they cease to bruise us they will allow an arena character to be cleansed and made presentable while enthusiastic friends preserve discretion it is of course less than magnanimity they are not proposed to you for your worship they are little gods temporary as that great wave their parent human mass of the hour but they have one worshipful element in them which is the divine insistency upon there being two sides to a case to every case and the people so far directed by them may boast of healthfulness let the individual shriek the innocent triumphant have in honesty to admit the fact one side is vanquished according to decree of law but the superior council does not allow it to be extinguished dianas battle was fought shadowily behind her for the space of a week or so with some advocates on behalf of the beaten man then it became a recollection of a beautiful woman possibly erring misvalued by a husband who was neither a man of the world nor a gracious yokefellow nor anything to match her she however once out of the public flames had to recall her scorchings to be gentle with herself under a defeat she would have been angrily selfvindicated the victory of the ashen laurels drove her mind inward to gird at the hateful yoke in compassion for its pair of victims quite earnestly by such means yet always bearing a comical eye on her subterfuges she escaped the extremes of personal blame those advocates of her opponent in and out of court compelled her honest heart to search within and own to faults but were they not natural faults it was her marriage it was marriage in the abstract her own mistake and the worlds clumsy machinery of civilization these were the capital offenders not the wife who would laugh ringingly and would have friends of the other sex and shot her epigrams at the helpless despot and was at timesyes vixenish a nature driven to it but that was the word she was too generous to recount her charges against the vanquished if his wretched jealousy had ruined her the secret high tribunal within her bosom which judged her guiltless for putting the sword between their marriage tie when they stood as one because a quarrelling couple could not in honour play the embracing pronounced him just pardonable she distinguished that he could only suppose manlikely one bad cause for the division to this extent she used her unerring brains more openly than on her night of debate at the crossways the next moment she was off in vapour meditating grandly on her independence of her sex and the passions love she did not know it she was not acquainted with either the criminal or the domestic god and persuaded herself that she never could be she was a diana of coldness preferring friendship she could be the friend of men there was another who could be the friend of women her heart leapt to redworth conjuring up his clear trusty face at their grasp of hands when parting she thought of her visions of her future about the period of the dublin ball and acknowledged despite the erratic step to wedlock a gain in having met and proved so true a friend his face figure character lightest look lightest word all were loyal signs of a man of honour cold as she he was the man to whom she could have opened her heart for inspection rejoicing in her independence of an emotional sex the impulsive woman burned with a regret that at their parting she had not broken down conventional barriers and given her cheek to his lips in the antiinsular fashion with a brotherly friend and why not when both were cold spirit to spirit she did delightfully refreshed by her capacity to do so without a throb he had held her hands and looked into her eyes half a minute like a dear comrade as little arousing her instincts of defensiveness as the clearing heavens and sisterly love for it was his due a sisters kiss he needed a sister and should have one in her emmas recollected talk of tom redworth painted him from head to foot brought the living man over the waters to the deck of the yacht a stout champion in the person of tom redworth was left on british land but for some reason past analysis intermixed that is among a swarm of sensations diana named her champion to herself with the formal prefix perhaps because she knew a mans christian name to be dangerous handling they differed besides frequently in opinion when the habit of thinking of him as mr redworth would be best women are bound to such small observances and especially the beautiful of the sisterhood whom the world soon warns that they carry explosives and must particularly guard against the ignition of petty sparks she was less indiscreet in her thoughts than in her acts as is the way with the reflective daughter of impulse though she had fine mental distinctions what she could offer to do spirit to spirit for instance held nothing to her mind of the intimacy of calling the gentleman plain tom in mere contemplation of him her friend and champion was a volunteer far from a mercenary and he deserved the reward if she could bestow it unalarmed they were to meet in egypt meanwhile england loomed the home of hostile forces ready to shock had she been a visible planet and ready to secrete a virus of her past history had she been making new she was happily away borne by a whiter than swans wing on the sapphire mediterranean her letters to emma were peeps of splendour for the invalid her way of life on board the yacht and sketches of her host and hostess as lovers in wedlock on the other side of our perilous forties sketches of the bays the towns the peoplepriests dames cavaliers urchins infants shifting groups of supple southernersflashed across the page like a web of silk and were dashed off redolent of herself as lightly as the silvery spray of the blue waves she furrowed telling without allusions to the land behind her that she had dipped in the wells of blissful oblivion emma dunstane as is usual with those who receive exhilarating correspondence from makers of books condemned the authoress in comparison and now first saw that she had the gift of writing only one cry italy eden of exiles betrayed the seeming of a moan she wrote of her poet and others immediately thither had they fled with adieu to england how many have waved the adieu and it is england nourishing england protecting them england clothing them in the honours they wear only the posturing lower natures on the level of their buskins can pluck out the pocketknife of sentimental spite to cut themselves loose from her at heart in earnest the higher bleed as they may too pressingly feel their debt diana had the celtic vivid sense of country in england she was irish by hereditary and by wilful opposition abroad gazing along the waters observing comparing reflecting above all reading of the struggles at home the things done and attempted her soul of generosity made her though not less irish a daughter of britain it is at a distance that striving countries should be seen if we would have them in the pure idea and this young woman of fervid mind a reader of public speeches and speculator on the tides of politics desirous further to feel herself rather more in the pure idea began to yearn for england long before her term of holiday exile had ended she had been flattered by her friend her wedded martyr at the stake as she named him to believe that she could exercise a judgement in politicscould think even speak acutely on public affairs the reports of speeches delivered by the men she knew or knew of set her thrilling and she fancied the sensibility to be as independent of her sympathy with the orators as her political notions were sovereignty above a sex devoted to trifles and the feelings of a woman who had gone through fire she fancied it confidently notwithstanding a peculiar intuition that the plunge into the nobler business of the world would be a haven of safety for a woman with blood and imagination when writing to emma mr redworths great success in parliament is good in itself whatever his views of present questions and i do not heed them when i look to what may be done by a man of such power in striking at unjust laws which keep the really numerically betterhalf of the population in a state of slavery if he had been a lawyer it must be a lawyers initiativea lawyers bill mr percy dacier also spoke well as might have been expected and his uncles compliment to him was merited should you meet him sound him he has read for the bar and is younger than mr redworth the very young men and the old are our hope the middleaged are hard and fast for existing facts we pick our leaders on the slopes the incline and decline of the mountainnot on the upper tableland midway where all appears to men so solid so tolerably smooth save for a few excrescences roughnesses gradually to be levelled at their leisure which induces one to protest that the middleage of men is their time of delusion it is no paradox they may be publicly useful in a small way i do not deny it at all they must be near the gates of lifethe opening or the closingfor their minds to be accessible to the urgency of the greater questions otherwise the world presents itself to them under too settled an aspectunless of course vesuvian revolution shakes the land and that touches only their nerves i dream of some old judge there is oneif having caught we could keep him but i dread so tricksy a pilot you have guessed himthe ancient puck we have laughed all day over the paper telling us of his worrying the lords lady esquart congratulates her husband on being out of it puck biens ride and bewigged might perhapsexcept that at the critical moment he would be sure to plead allegiance to oberon however the work will be performed by some one i am propheticwhen maidens are grandmotherswhen your tony is wearing a perpetual laugh in the unhusbanded regions where there is no institution of the weddingtie for the reason that she was not to participate in the result of the old judges or young heros happy championship of the cause of her sex she conceived her separateness high aloof and actually supposed she was a contemplative simply speculative political spirit impersonal albeit a woman this as emma smiling at the lines had not to learn was always her secret pride of fancythe belief in her possession of a disengaged intellect the strange illusion so clearly exposed to her correspondent was maintained through a series of letters very slightly descriptive dated from the piraeus the bosphorus the coasts of the crimea all more or less relating to the latest news of the journals received on board the yacht and of english visitors fresh from the country she now seemed fond of calling home politics and gentle allusions to the curious exhibition of love in marriage shown by her amiable host and hostess these dear esquarts who are never tired of one another but courtly courting tempting me to think it possible that a fortunate selection and a mutual deference may subscribe to human happinessfilled the paragraphs reviews of her first literary venture were mentioned once i was well advised by mr redworth in putting antonia for authoress she is a buff jerkin to the stripes and i suspect that the signature of d e m written in full would have cawed woefully to hear that her style is affected her characters nullities her cleverness forced etc etc as it is i have much the same contempt for poor antonias performance cease penning little fool she writes with some comprehension of the passion of love i know her to be a stranger to the earliest cry so you see dear that utter ignorance is the mother of the art dialogues occasionally pointed she has a sister who may do betterbut why was i not apprenticed to a serviceable profession or a trade i perceive now that a hangeron of the market had no right to expect a happier fate than mine has been on the nile in the winter of the year diana met the hon percy dacier he was introduced to her at cairo by redworth the two gentlemen had struck up a house of commons acquaintanceship and finding themselves bound for the same destination had grown friendly redworths arrival had been pleasantly expected she remarked on daciers presence to emma without sketch or note of him as other than much esteemed by lord and lady esquart these with diana redworth dacier the german eastern traveller schweizerbarth and the french consul and egyptologist duriette composed a voyaging party up the river of which expedition redworth was lady dunstanes chief writer of the records his novel perceptiveness and shrewdness of touch made them amusing and his tenderness to the beautys coquettry between the two foreign rivals moved a deeper feeling the german had a guitar the frenchman a voice diana joined them in harmony they complained apart severally of the accompaniment and the singer our english criticized them apart and that is at any rate to occupy a post though it contributes nothing to entertainment at home the esquarts had sung duets diana had assisted redworths manly chestnotes at the piano each of them declined to be vocal diana sang alone for the credit of the country italian and french songs irish also she was in her mood of planxty kelly and garryowen all the way madame est irlandaise redworth heard the frenchman say and he owned to what was implied in the answering tone of the question we should be dull dogs without the irish leaven so tony in exile still managed to do something for her darling erin the solitary woman on her heights at copsley raised an exclamation of oh that those two had been or could be united she was conscious of a mystic symbolism in the prayer she was not apprehensive of any ominous intervention of another writing from venice diana mentioned mr percy dacier as being engaged to an heiress a miss asper niece of a mighty shipowner mr quintin manx lady esquart tells me money fabulous and necessary to a younger son devoured with ambition the elder brother lord creedmore is a common nimrod always absent in hungary russia america hunting somewhere mr dacier will be in the cabinet with the next ministry no more of him a new work by antonia was progressing the summer in south tyrol passed like a royal procession before young eyes for diana and at the close of it descending the stelvio idling through the valtelline como lake was reached diana full of her work living the double life of the author at bellagio one afternoon mr percy dacier appeared she remembered subsequently a disappointment she felt in not beholding mr redworth either with him or displacing him if engaged to a lady he was not an ardent suitor nor was he a pointedly complimentary acquaintance his enthusiasm was reserved for italian scenery she had already formed a sort of estimate of his character as an indifferent observer may do and any woman previous to the inflaming of her imagination if that is in store for her and she now fell to work resetting the puzzle it became as soon her positive conclusions had to be shaped again but women never can know young men she wrote to emma after praising his good repute as one of the brotherhood he drops pretty sentences now and then no compliments milky nuts of course he has a head or he would not be where he isand that seems always to me the most enviable place a young man can occupy she observed in him a singular conflicting of a buoyant animal nature with a curb of studiousness as if the fardels of age were piling on his shoulders before youth had quitted its pastures his build of limbs and his features were those of the finelybred english he had the english taste for sports games manly diversions and in the bloom of life under thirty his head was given to bend the head bending on a tall upright figure where there was breadth of chest told of weights working she recollected his open look larger than inquiring at the introduction to her and it recurred when she uttered anything specially taking what it meant was past a guess though comparing it with the frank directness of redworths eyes she saw the difference between a look that accepted her and one that dilated on two opinions her thought of the gentleman was of a brilliant young charioteer in the ruck of the race watchful for his chance to push to the front and she could have said that a dubious consort might spoil a promising career it flattered her to think that she sometimes prompted him sometimes illumined he repeated sentences she had spoken i shall be better able to describe mr dacier when you and i sit together my emmy and a stroke here and there completes the painting set descriptions are good for puppets living men and women are too various in the mixture fashioning themeven the external presentmentto be livingly rendered in a formal sketch i may tell you his eyes are pale blue his features regular his hair silky brownish his legs long his head rather stooping only the head his mouth commonly closed these are the facts and you have seen much the same in a nursery doll such literary craft is of the nursery so with landscapes the art of the pen we write on darkness is to rouse the inward vision instead of labouring with a dropscene brush as if it were to the eye because our flying minds cannot contain a protracted description that is why the poets who spring imagination with a word or a phrase paint lasting pictures the shakespearian the dantesque are in a line two at most he lends an attentive ear when i speak agrees or has a quaint pucker of the eyebrows dissenting inwardly he lacks mental livelinesscheerfulness i should say and is thankful to have it imparted one suspects he would be a dull domestic companion he has a veritable thirst for hopeful views of the world and no spiritual distillery of his own he leans to depression why the broken reed you call your tony carries a cargo all of her manufactureshe reeks of secret stills and here is a young mana sapling oakinclined to droop his nature has an air of imploring me que je darrose i begin to perform mrs dr pangloss on purpose to brighten himthe mind the views he is not altogether deficient in conversational gaiety and he shines in exercise but the world is a poor old ball bounding down a hillto an irish melody in the evening generally by request so far of mr percy dacier of whom i have some hopesdistant perhaps delusivethat he may be of use to our cause he listens it is an auspicious commencement lugano is the italian lake most lovingly encircled by mountain arms and every height about it may be scaled with esce the heights have their nest of waters below for a home scene the southern swiss peaks with celestial monta rosa in prospect it was there that diana reawakened after the trance of a deadly draught to the glory of the earth and her share in it she wakened like the princess of the kiss happily not to kisses to no sign touch or call that she could trace backward the change befell her without a warning after writing deliberately to her friend emma she laid down her pen and thought of nothing and into this dreamfulness a wine passed filling her veins suffusing her mind quickening her soul and coming whence out of air out of the yonder of air she could have imagined a seraphic presence in the room that bade her arise and live take the cup of the wells of youth arrested at her lips by her marriage quit her wintry bondage for warmth light space the quick of simple being and the strange pure ecstasy was not a transient electrification it came in waves on a continuous tide looking was living walking flying she hardly knew that she slept the heights she had seen rosy at eve were marked for her ascent in the dawn sleep was one wink and fresh as the dewy field and rockflowers on her way upward she sprang to more and more of heaven insatiable happily chirruping over her possessions the threading of the town among the dear common people before others were abroad was a pleasure and pleasant her solitariness threading the gardens at the base of the rock only she astir and the first rough steps of the winding footpath the first closed buds the sharper air the uprising of the mountain with her ascent and pleasant too was her hunger and the nibble at a little loaf of bread a linnet sang in her breast an eagle lifted her feet the feet were verily winged as they are in a season of youth when the blood leaps to light from the pressure of the under forces like a source at the wellheads and the whole creature blooms vital in every energy as a spirit to be a girl again was magical she could fancy her having risen from the dead and to be a girl with a womans broader vision and receptiveness of soul with knowledge of evil and winging to ethereal happiness this was a revelation of our human powers she attributed the change to the influences of natures beauty and grandeur nor had her womans consciousness to play the chrysalis in any shy recesses of her heart she was nowhere veiled or torpid she was illumined like the salvatore she saw in the evening beams and mounted in the mornings and she had not a spot of seeresy all her nature flew and bloomed she was bird flower flowing river a quivering sensibility unweighted enshrouded desires and hopes would surely have weighted and shrouded her she had none save for the upper air the eyes of the mountain which was the dreamher past life or this ethereal existence but this ran spontaneously and the other had often been stimulatedher vivaciousness on the nileboat for a recent example she had not a doubt that her past life was the dream or deception and for the reason that now she was compassionate large of heart toward all beneath her let them but leave her free they were forgiven even to prayers for their wellbeing the plural number in the case was an involuntary multiplying of the single coming of her incapacity during this elevation and rapture of the senses to think distinctly of that one who had discoloured her opening life freedom to breathe gaze climb grow with the grasses fly with the clouds to muse to sing to be an unclaimed self dispersed upon earth air sky to find a keener transfigured self in that radiationshe craved no more bear in mind her beauty her charm of tongue her present state of white simplicity in fervour was there ever so perilous a woman for the most guarded and clearesteyed of young men to meet at early morn upon a mountain side chapter xvi treats of a midnight bell and of a scene of early morning on a round of the mountains rising from osteno south eastward of lugano the esquart party rose from the natural grotto and headed their carriages up and down the defiles halting for a night at rovio a little village below the generoso lively with waterfalls and watercourses and they fell so in love with the place that after roaming along the flowery borderways by moonlight they resolved to rest there two or three days and try some easy ascents in the diurnal course of nature being pleasantly tired they had the avowed intention of sleeping there so they went early to their beds and carelessly wished one another good night none of them supposing slumber to be anywhere one of the warlike arts a paradoxical thing you must battle for and can only win at last when utterly beaten hard by their inn close enough for a priestly homily to have been audible stood a church campanile wherein hung a bell not ostensibly communicating with the demons of the pit in daylight rather a merry comrade but at night when the children of nerves lay stretched he threw off the mask as soon as they had fairly nestled he smote their pillows a shattering blow loud for the retold preluding quarters incredibly clanging the number ten then he waited for neighbouring campanili to box the ears of slumbers votaries in turn whereupon under pretence of excessive conscientiousness or else oblivious of his antecedent damnable misconduct or perhaps in actual league and trapdoor conspiracy with the surging goblin hosts beneath us he resumed his blaring strokes a sonorous recapitulation of the number all the others likewise it was an alarum fit to warn of attila or alaric and not simply the maniacal noise invaded the fruitful provinces of sleep like hun and vandal the irrational repetition ploughed the minds of those unhappy somnivolents leaving them worse than sheared by barbarians disrupt as by earthquake with the unanswerable question to providence whywhy twice designing slumberers are such infants when they have undressed and stretched themselves flat it seems that they have really gone back to their mothers breasts and they fret at whatsoever does not smack of nature or custom the cause of a repetition so senseless in its violence and so unnecessary set them querying and kicking until the inevitable quarters recommenced then arose an insurgent rabble in their bosoms it might be the loosened imps of darkness urging them to speculate whether the proximate monster about to dole out the eleventh hour in uproar would again forget himself and repeat his dreary arithmetic a second time for they were unaware of his religious obligation following the hour of the district to inform them of the tardy hour of rome they waited in suspense curiosity enabling them to bear the first crash callously his performance was the same and now they took him for a crazy engine whose madness had infected the whole neighbourhood now was the moment to fight for sleep in contempt of him and they began by simulating an entry into the fortress they were to defend plunging on their pillows battening down their eyelids breathing with a dreadful regularity alas it came to their knowledge that the bell was in possession and they the besiegers every resonant quarter was anticipated up to the blow without averting its murderous abruptness and an executioner midnight that sounded in addition to the reiterated quarters four and twenty ringing hammerstrokes with the aching pause between the twelves left them the prey of the legions of torturers which are summed though not described in the title of a sleepless night from that period the curse was milder but the victims raged they swam on vasty deeps they knocked at rusty gates they shouldered all the weapons of black insomnias armoury and became her soldiery doing her will upon themselves of her originally sprang the inspired teaching of the doom of men to excruciation in endlessness she is the fountain of the infinite ocean whereon the exceedingly sensitive soul is tumbled everlastingly with the diversion of hot pincers to appease its appetite for change dacier was never the best of sleepers he had taken to exercise his brains prematurely not only in learning but also in reflection and a reflectiveness that is indulged before we have a rigid mastery of the emotions or have slain them is apt to make a young man more than commonly a child of nerves nearly as much so as the dissipated with the difference that they are hilarious while wasting their treasury which he is not and he may recover under favouring conditions which is a point of vantage denied to them physically he had stout reserves for he had not disgraced the temple his intemperateness lay in the craving to rise and lead a precocious ambition this apparently modest young man started with an aimand if in the distance and with but a slingstone like the slender shepherd fronting the philistine all his energies were in his aimat government he had hung on the fringe of an administration his party was out and he hoped for higher station on its return to power many perplexities were therefore buzzing about his head among them at present one sufficiently magnified and voracious to swallow the remainder he added force to the interrogation as to why that bell should sound its inhuman strokes twice by asking himself why he was there to hear it a strange suspicion of a bewitchment might have enlightened him if he had been a man accustomed to yield to the peculiar kind of sorcery issuing from that sex he rather despised the power of women over men and nevertheless he was there listening to that bell instead of having obeyed the call of his family duties when the latter were urgent he had received letters at lugano summoning him home before he set forth on his present expedition the noisy alarum told him he floundered in quags like a silly creature chasing a marshlamp but was it so was it not on the contrary a serious pursuit of the secret of a womans characteroh a woman and her character ordinary women and their characters might set to work to get what relationship and likeness they could they had no secret to allure this one had she had the secret of lake waters under rock unfathomable in limpidness he could not think of her without shooting at nature and natures very sweetest and subtlest for comparison as to her sex his active mans contempt of the petticoated secret attractive to boys and graylings made him believe that in her he hunted the mind and the spirit perchance a double mind a twilighted spirit but not a mere woman she bore no resemblance to the bundle of women well she was worth studying she had ideas and could give ear to ideas furthermore a couple of the members of his family inclined to do her injustice at least they judged her harshly owing he thought to an inveterate opinion they held regarding lord dannisburghs obliquity in relation to women he shared it and did not concur in their verdict upon the woman implicated that is to say knowing something of her now he could see the possibility of her innocence in the special charm that her mere sparkle of features and speech and her freshness would have for a man like his uncle the possibility pleaded strongly on her behalf while the darker possibility weighted by his uncles reputation plucked at him from below she was delightful to hear delightful to see and her friends loved her and had faith in her so clever a woman might be too clever for her friends the circle he moved in hummed of women prompting novices as well as veterans to suspect that the multitude of them and notably the fairest yet more the cleverest concealed the serpent somewhere she certainly had not directed any of her arts upon him besides he was half engaged and that was a burning perplexity not because of abstract scruples touching the necessity for love in marriage the young lady great heiress though she was and willing as she allowed him to assume graceful too reputed a beauty struck him cold he fancied her transparent only arctic her transparency displayed to him all the common virtues and a serene possession of the inestimable and eminent one outweighing all but charm wit ardour intercommunicative quickness and kindling beauty airy grace were qualities that a man it seemed had to look for in women spotted by a doubt of their having the chief and priceless however he was not absolutely plighted nor did it matter to him whether this or that woman concealed the tail of the serpent and trail excepting the singular interest this woman managed to excite and so deeply as set him wondering how that resurrection bell might be affecting her ability to sleep was she sleepingor waking his nervous imagination was a torch that alternately lighted her lying asleep with the innocent like a babe and tossing beneath the overflow of her dark hair hounded by haggard memories she fluttered before him in either aspect and another perplexity now was to distinguish within himself which was the aspect he preferred great nature brought him thus to drink of her beauty under the delusion that the act was a speculation on her character the bell with its clash throb and long swoon of sound reminded him of her name dianaan attribute or a derision it really mattered nothing to him save for her being maligned and if most unfairly then that face of the varying expressions and the rich voice and the remembered gentle and taking words coming from her appealed to him with a supplicating vividness that pricked his heart to leap he was dozing when the bell burst through the thin division between slumber and wakefulness recounting what seemed innumerable peals hard on his cranium gray daylight blanched the window and the bed his watch said five of the morning he thought of the pleasure of a bath beneath some dashing sprayshowers and jumped up to dress feeling a queer sensation of skin in his clothes the sign of a feverish night and yawning he went into the air leftward the narrow village street led to the footway along which he could make for the mountainwall he cast one look at the head of the campanile silly as an owlish roysterers glazed stare at the young aurora and hurried his feet to check the yawns coming alarmingly fast in the place of ideas his elevation above the valley was about the kneecap of the generoso waters of past rainclouds poured down the mountainsides like veins of metal here and there flinging off a shower on the busy descent only dubiously animate in the lack lustre of the huge bulk piled against a yellow east that wafted fleets of pinky cloudlets overhead he mounted his path to a level with inviting grassmounds where water circled running from scoops and cups to curves and brookstreams and in his fancy calling to him to hear them to dip in them was his desire to roll and shiver braced by the icy flow was the spell to break that baleful incantation of the intolerable night so he struck across a ridge of boulders wreck of a landslip from the height he had hugged to the open space of shadowed undulations and soon had his feet on turf heights to right and to left and between them aloft a sky the rosy wheelcourse of the chariot of morn and below among the knolls choice of sheltered nooks where waters whispered of secresy to satisfy diana herself they have that whisper and waving of secresy in secret scenery they beckon to the bath and they conjure classic visions of the pudency of the goddess irate or unsighted the semimythological state of mind built of old images and favouring haunts was known to dacier the name of diana playing vaguely on his consciousness helped to it he had no definite thought of the mortal woman when the highest grassroll near the rock gave him view of a bowered source and of a pool under a chain of cascades bounded by polished shelves and slabs the very spot for him he decided at the first peep and at the second with fingers instinctively loosening his waistcoat buttons for a commencement he shouldered round and strolled away though not at a rapid pace nor far before he halted that it could be no other than she the figure he had seen standing beside the pool he was sure why had he turned thoughts thick and swift as a blush in the cheeks of seventeen overcame him and queen of all the thought bringing the picture of this mountainsolitude to vindicate a woman shamefully assailedshe who found her pleasure in these haunts of nymph and goddess at the fresh cold bosom of nature must be clear as day she trusted herself to the loneliness here and to the honour of men from a like irreflective sincereness she was unable to imagine danger where her own impelling thirst was pure the thoughts it will be discerned were but flashes of a momentary vivid sensibility where a womans charm has won half the battle her character is an advancing standard and sings victory let her do no more than take a quiet morning walk before breakfast but why had he turned his back on her there was nothing in his presence to alarm nothing in her appearance to forbid the motive and the movement were equally quaint incomprehensible to him for after putting himself out of sight he understood the absurdity of the supposition that she would seek the secluded sylvan bath for the same purpose as he yet now he was debarred from going to meet her she might have an impulse to bathe her feet her name was diana yes and a married woman and a proclaimed one and notwithstanding those brassy facts he was ready to side with the evidence declaring her free from stain and further to swear that her blood was dianas nor had dacier ever been particularly poetical about women the present diana had wakened his curiosity had stirred his interest in her pricked his admiration but gradually until a sleepless night with its flock of ravenfancies under that dominant bell ended by colouring her the moment she stood in his eyes as freshly as the morning heavens we are much influenced in youth by sleepless nights they disarm they predispose us to submit to soft occasion and in our youth occasion is always coming he heard her voice she had risen up the grassmound and he hung brooding halfway down she was dressed in some texture of the hue of lavender a violet scarf loosely knotted over the bosom opened on her throat the loop of her black hair curved under a hat of gray beaver memorably radiant was her face they met exchanged greetings praised the beauty of the morning and struck together on the bell she laughed i heard it at ten i slept till four i never wake later i was out in the air by halfpast were you disturbed he alluded to his troubles with the bell it sounded like a felons heart in skeleton ribs he said or a prosers tongue in a hollow skull said she he bowed to her conversible readiness and at once fell into the background as he did only with her to perform accordant bass in their dialogue for when a woman lightly caps our strained remarks we gallantly surrender the leadership lest she should too cuttingly assert her claim some sweet wild cyclamen flowers were at her breast she held in her left hand a bunch of buds and blown cups of the pale purple meadow crocus he admired them she told him to look round he confessed to not having noticed them in the grass what was the name colchicum in botany she said these are plucked to be sent to a friend otherwise im reluctant to take the life of flowers for a whim wild flowers i mean i am not sentimental about garden flowers they are cultivated for decoration grown for clipping i suppose they dont carry the same signification said dacier in the tone of a pupil to such themes they carry no feeling said she and that is my excuse for plucking these where they seem to spring like our towndream of happiness i believe they are sensible of it too but these must do service to my invalid friend who cannot travel are you ever as much interested in the woes of great ladies as of country damsels i am notnot unless they have natural distinction you have met lady dunstane the question sounded artless dacier answered that he thought he had seen her somewhere once and diana shut her lips on a rising undersmile she is the coeur dor of our time the one soul i would sacrifice these flowers to a bit of a bluestocking i think i have heard said she might have been admitted to the hotel rambouillet without being anything of a precieuse she is the woman of the largest heart now beating mr redworth talked of her as she deserved i am sure very warmly he would he told me you were the damon and pythias of women her one fault is an extreme humility that makes her always play second to me and as i am apt to gabble i take the lead and i am froth in comparison i can reverence my superiors even when tried by intimacy with them she is the next heavenly thing to heaven that i know court her if ever you come across her or have you a mans horror of women with brains am i expressing it said he do not breathe london or paris here on me she fanned the crocuses under her chin the early morning always has thisi wish i had a wordtouch whisper gleam beat of wingsi envy poets now more than everof eden i was going to say prose can paint evening and moonlight but poets are needed to sing the dawn that is because prose is equal to melancholy stuff gladness requires the finer language otherwise we have it coarseanything but a reproduction you politicians despise the little distinctions twixt tweedledum and tweedledee i fancy of the poetic sort daciers uncle certainly did for himself he confessed to not having thought much on them but how divine is utterance she said as we to the brutes poets are to us he listened somewhat with the head of the hanged a beautiful woman choosing to rhapsodize has her way and is not subjected to the critical commentary within us he wondered whether she had discoursed in such a fashion to his uncle i can read good poetry said he if you would have this valleyor mountaincleft one should call it described only verse could do it for you diana pursued and stopped glanced at his face and smiled she had spied the end of a towel peeping out of one of his pockets you came out for a bath go back by all means and mount that rise of grass where you first saw me and down on the other side a little to the right you will find the very place for a bath at a corner of the rocka natural fountain a bubbling pool in a ring of brushwood with falling water so tempting that i could have pardoned a push about five feet deep lose no time he begged to assure her that he would rather stroll with her it had been only a notion of bathing by chance when he pocketed the towel dear me she cried if i had been a man i should have scurried off at a signal of release quick as a hare i once woke up in a field with my foot on its back daciers eyebrows knotted a trifle over her eagerness to dismiss him he was not used to it but rather to be courted by women and to condescend i shall not long im afraid have the pleasure of walking beside you and hearing you i had letters at lugano my uncle is unwell i hear lord dannisburgh the name sprang from her lips unhesitatingly his nodded affirmative altered her face and her voice it is not a grave illness they rather fear it you had the news at lugano he answered the implied reproach i can be of no service but surely its even doubtful that he would be bothered to receive me we hold no views in commonexcepting one could i she exclaimed o that i might if he is really ill but if it is actually serious he would perhaps have a wish i can nurse i know i have the power to cheer him you ought indeed to be in england dacier said he had thought it better to wait for later reports i shall drive to lugano this afternoon and act on the information i get there probably it ends my holiday will you do me the favour to write me wordand especially tell me if you think he would like to have me near him said diana and let him know that if he wants nursing or cheerful companionship i am at any moment ready to come the flattery of a beautiful young woman to wait on him would be very agreeable to lord dannisburgh dacier conceived her offer to go was possibly purely charitable but the prudence of her occupation of the post obscured whatever appeared admirable in her devotedness her choice of a man like lord dannisburgh for the friend to whom she could sacrifice her good name less falteringly than she gathered those fieldflowers was inexplicable and she herself a darker riddle at each step of his reading he promised curtly to write i will do my best to hit a flying address your club enables me to hit a permanent one that will establish the communication said diana we shall not sleep another night at rovio lady esquart is the lightest of sleepers and if you had a restless time she and her husband must have been in purgatory besides permit me to say you should be with your party the times are troublousnot for holidays your holiday has had a haunted look creditably to your conscience as a politician these corn law agitations ah but no politics here said dacier politics everywherein the courts of faery they are not discord to me but not the last daythe last hour he pleaded well only do not forget your assurance to me that you would give some thoughts to irelandand the cause of women has it slipped from your memory if i see the chance of serving you you may trust to me she sent up an interjection on the misfortune of her not having been born a man it was to him the one smart of sourness in her charm as a woman among the boulderstones of the ascent to the path he ventured to propose a little masculine assistance in a hand stretched mutely although there was no great need for help her natural kindliness checked the inclination to refuse it when their hands disjoined she found herself reddening she cast it on the exertion her heart was throbbing it might be the exertion likewise he walked and talked much more airily along the descending pathway as if he had suddenly become more intimately acquainted with her she listened trying to think of the manner in which he might be taught to serve that cause she had at heart and the colour deepened on her cheeks till it set fire to her underlying consciousness blood to spirit a tremour of alarm ran through her his request for one of the crocuses to keep as a souvenir of the morning was refused they are sacred they were all devoted to my friend when i plucked them he pointed to a halfopen one with the petals in disparting pointing to junction and compared it to the famous tiptoe balletposture arms above head and fingers like swallows meeting in air of an operatic danseuse of the time i do not see it because i will not see it she said and she found a personal cooling and consolement in the phrasewe have this power of resisting invasion of the poetic by the commonplace the spirit by the blood if we please though you men may not think that we have her alarmed sensibilities bristled and made head against him as an enemy she fancied for the aforesaid reasonbecause she chose that it was on account of the offence to her shy morning pleasure by his londonizing at any other moment her natural liveliness and trained social ease would have taken any remark on the eddies of the tide of converse and so she told herself and did not the less feel wounded adverse armed he seemed somehowto have dealt a mortal blow to the happy girl she had become again the woman she was protested on behalf of the girl while the girl in her heart bent lowered sad eyelids to the woman and which of them was wiser of the truth she could not have said for she was honestly not aware of the truth but she knew she was divided in halves with one half pitying the other one rebuking and all because of the incongruous comparison of a wild flower to an opera dancer absurd indeed we human creatures are the silliest on earth most certainly dacier had observed the blush and the check to her flowing tongue did not escape him as they walked back to the inn down the narrow street of black rooms where the women gossiped at the fountain and the cobbler threaded on his doorstep his novel excitement supplied the deficiency sweeping him past minor reflections he was however surprised to hear her tell lady esquart as soon as they were together at the breakfast table that he had the intention of starting for england and further surprised and slightly stung too when on the poor ladys moaning over her recollection of the midnight bell and vowing she could not attempt to sleep another night in the place diana declared her resolve to stay there one day longer with her maid and explore the neighbourhood for the wild flowers in which it abounded lord and lady esquart agreed to anything agreeable to her after excusing themselves for the necessitated flight piteously relating the story of their sufferings my lord could have slept but he had remained awake to comfort my lady true knightliness diana said in praise of these long married lovers and she asked them what they had talked of during the night you my dear partly said lady esquart for an opiate an invocation of the morning said dacier lady esquart looked at diana and at him she thought it was well that her fair friend should stay it was then settled for diana to rejoin them the next evening at lugano thence to proceed to luino on the maggiore i fear it is goodbye for me dacier said to her as he was about to step into the carriage with the esquarts if you have not better news of your uncle it must be she replied and gave him her hand promptly and formally hardly diverting her eyes from lady esquart to grace the temporary gift with a look the last of her he saw was a waving of her arm and finger pointing triumphantly at the bell in the tower it said to an understanding unpractised in the feminine mysteries i can sleep through anything what that revealed of her state of conscience and her nature his efforts to preserve the lovely optical figure blocked his guessing he was with her friends who liked her the more they knew her and he was compelled to lean to their view of the perplexing woman she is a riddle to the world lady esquart said but i know that she is good it is the best of signs when women take to her and are proud to be her friend my lord echoed his wife she talked in this homely manner to stop any notion of philandering that the young gentleman might be disposed to entertain in regard to a lady so attractive to the pursuit as dianas beauty and delicate situation might make her seem she is an exceedingly clever person and handsomer than report which is uncommon said dacier becoming voluble on towntopics miss asper incidentally among them he denied lady esquarts charge of an engagement the matter hung his letters at lugano summoned him to england instantly i have taken leave of mrs warwick but tell her i regret et caetera he said and by the way as my uncles illness appears to be serious the longer she is absent the better perhaps it would never do said lady esquart understanding his drift immediately we winter in rome she will not abandon usi have her word for it next easter we are in paris and so home i suppose there will be no hurry before we are due at cowes we seem to have become confirmed wanderers for two of us at least it is likely to be our last great tour dacier informed her that he had pledged his word to write to mrs warwick of his uncles condition and the several appointed haltingplaces of the esquarts between the lakes and florence were named to him thus all things were openly treated all had an air of being on the surface the communications passing between mrs warwick and the hon percy dacier might have been perused by all the world none but that portion of it sage in suspiciousness which objects to such communications under any circumstances could have detected in their correspondence a spark of coming fire or that there was common warmth she did not feel it nor did he the position of the two interdicted it to a couple honourably sensible of social decencies and who were be it added kept apart the blood is the treacherous element in the story of the nobly civilized of which secret diana a wife and no wife a prisoner in liberty a blooming woman imagining herself restored to transcendent maiden ecstaciesthe highest youthful poetichad received some faint intimation when the blush flamed suddenly in her cheeks and her heart knelled like the towers of a city given over to the devourer she had no wish to meet him again without telling herself why she would have shunned the meeting disturbers that thwarted her simple happiness in sublime scenery were best avoided she thought so the more for a fitful blur to the simplicity of her sensations and a task she sometimes had in restoring and toning them after that sweet morning time in rovio chapter xvii the princess egeria london say what we will of it is after all the head of the british giant and if not the liveliest in bubbles it is past competition the largest brothpot of brains anywhere simmering on the hob over the steadiest of furnaces too and the oceans and the continents as you know are perpetual and copious contributors either to the heating apparatus or to the contents of the pot let grander similes besought this one fits for the smoky receptacle cherishing millions magnetic to tens of millions more with its caked outside of grime and the inward substance incessantly kicking the lid prankish but never casting it off a good stew you perceive not a parlous boiling weak as we may be in our domestic cookery our political has been sagaciously adjusted as yet to catch the ardours of the furnace without being subject to their volcanic activities that the social is also somewhat at fault we have proof in occasional outcries over the absence of these or those particular persons famous for inspiriting it sticks and clogs the improvising songster is missed the convivial essayist the humorous dean the travelled cynic and he the one of his day the iridescent irishman whose remembered repartees are a feast sharp and ringing at divers tables descending from the upper to the fat citizens where instead of coming in the sequence of talk they are exposed by blasting like fossil teeth of old deluge sharks in monotonous walls of our chalkquarries nor are these the less welcome for the violence of their introduction among a people glad to be set burning rather briskly awhile by the most unexpected of digs in the ribs dan merion to give an example that was dan merions joke with the watchman and he said that other thing to the marquis of kingsbury when the latter asked him if he had ever won a donkeyrace and old dan is dead and we are the duller for it which leads to the question is genius hereditary and the affirmative and negative are respectively maintained rather against the yes is the dispute until a member of the audience speaks of dan merions having left a daughter reputed for a sparkling wit not much below the level of his own why are you unaware that the mrs warwick of that scandal case of warwick versus dannisburgh was old dan merions girland his only child it is true for a friend had it from a man who had it straight from mr braddock of the firm of braddock thorpe and simnel her solicitors in the action who told him he could sit listening to her for hours and that she was as innocent as day a wonderful combination of a good woman and a clever woman and a real beauty only her misfortune was to have a furiously jealous husband and they say he went mad after hearing the verdict diana was talked of in the london circles a witty woman is such salt that where she has once been tasted she must perforce be missed more than any of the absent the dowering heavens not having yet showered her like very plentifully upon us then it was first heard that percy dacier had been travelling with her miss asper heard of it her uncle mr quintin manx the millionnaire was an acquaintance of the new judge and titled dignitary sir cramborne wathin and she visited lady wathin at whose table the report in the journals of the nileboat party was mentioned lady wathins table could dispense with witty women and for that matter witty men the intrusion of the spontaneous on the stereotyped would have clashed she preferred as hostess the old legal anecdotes sure of their laugh and the citations from the manufactories of fun in the press which were current and instantly intelligible to all her guests she smiled suavely on an impromptu pun because her experience of the humorous appreciation of it by her guests bade her welcome the upstart nothing else impromptu was acceptable mrs warwick therefore was not missed by lady wathin i have met her she said i confess i am not one of the fanatics about mrs warwick she has a sort of skill in getting men to clamour if you stoop to tickle them they will applaud it is a way of winning a reputation when the ladies were separated from the gentlemen by the stream of claret miss asper heard lady wathin speak of mrs warwick again an allusion to lord dannisburghs fit of illness in the house of lords led to her saying that there was no doubt he had been fascinated and that in her opinion mrs warwick was a dangerous woman sir cramborne knew something of mr warwick poor man she added a lady present put a question concerning mrs warwicks beauty yes lady wathin said she has good looks to aid her judging from what i hear and have seen her thirst is for notoriety sooner or later we shall have her making a noise you may be certain yes she has the secret of dressing wellin the french style a simple newspaper report of the expedition of a nileboat party could stir the powers to take her up and turn her on their wheel in this manner but others of the sons and daughters of london were regretting her prolonged absence the great and exclusive whitmonby who had dined once at lady wathins table and vowed never more to repeat that offence to his patience lamented bitterly to henry wilmers that the sole woman worthy of sitting at a little sunday evening dinner with the cream of the choicest men of the time was away wasting herself in that insane modern chase of the picturesque he called her a perverted celimene redworth had less to regret than the rest of her male friends as he was receiving at intervals pleasant descriptive letters besides manuscript sheets of antonias new piece of composition to correct the proofs for the press and he read them critically he thought he read them with a watchful eye to guard them from the critics antonia whatever her faults as a writer was not one of the order whose muse is the public taste she did at least draw her inspiration from herself and there was much to be feared in her work if a sale was the object otherwise redworths highly critical perusal led him flatly to admire this was like her and that was like her and here and there a phrase gave him the very play of her mouth the flash of her eyes could he possibly wish or bear to have anything altered but she had reason to desire an extended sale of the work her aim in the teeth of her independent style was at the means of independencea feminine method of attempting to conciliate contraries and after despatching the last sheets to the printer he meditated upon the several ways which might serve to assist her the main way running thus in his mindwe have a work of genius genius is good for the public what is good for the public should be recommended by the critics it should be how then to come at them to get it done as he was not a member of the honourable literary craft and regarded its arcana altogether externally it may be confessed of him that he deemed the incorruptible corruptiblenot of course with filthy coin slid into sticky palms critics are human and exceedingly beyond the common lot when touched and they are excited by mysterious hints of loftiness in authorship by rumours of veiled loveliness whispers of a general anticipation and also editors can jog them redworth was rising to be a railway king of a period soon to glitter with rails iron in the concrete golden in the visionary he had already his court much against his will the powerful magnetic attractions of those who can help the world to fortune was exercised by him in spite of his disgust of sycophants he dropped words to right and left of a coming work by antonia and who was antoniaah there hung the riddlean exalted personageso much so that he dared not name her even in confidence to ladies he named the publishers to men he said he was at liberty to speak of her only as the most beautiful woman of her time his courtiers of both sexes were recommended to read the new story the princess egeria oddly one great lady of his court had heard a forthcoming work of this title spoken of by percy dacier not a man to read silly fiction unless there was meaning behind the lines that is rich scandal of the aristocracy diversified by stinging epigrams to the address of discernible personages she talked of the princess egeria nay laid her finger on the identical princess others followed her dozens were soon flying with the torch a new work immediately to be published from the pen of the duchess of starsand the princess who lends her title to the book is a living portrait of the princess of highest eminence the hope of all civilizationorders for copies of the princess egeria reached the astonished publishers before the book was advertized speaking to editors redworth complimented them with friendly intimations of the real authorship of the remarkable work appearing he used a certain penetrative mildness of tone in saying that he hoped the book would succeed it deserved to it was original but the originality might tell against it all would depend upon a favourable launching of such a book mrs warwick mrs warwick said the most influential of editors mr marcus tonans what that singularly handsome woman the dannisburgh affair shes whitmonbys heroine if she writes as cleverly as she talks her work is worth trumpeting he promised to see that it went into good hands for the review and a prompt reviewan essential point none of your long digestions of the contents dianas indefatigable friend had fair assurances that her book would be noticed before it dropped dead to the public appetite for novelty he was anxious next notwithstanding his admiration of the originality of the conception and the cleverness of the writing lest the literary reviews should fail to do it justice he used the term for if they wounded her they would take the pleasure out of success and he had always present to him that picture of the beloved woman kneeling at the firegrate at the crossways which made the thought of her suffering any wound his personal anguish so crucially sweet and saintly had her image then been stamped on him he bethought him in consequence while sitting in the house of commons engaged upon the affairs of the nation and honestly engaged for he was a vigilant workerthat the irish secretary charles raiser with whom he stood in amicable relations had an interest to the extent of reputed ownership in the chief of the literary reviews he saw raiser on the benches and marked him to speak for him looking for him shortly afterward the man was gone off to the opera if hes not too late for the drop a neighbour said smiling queerly as though he ought to know and then redworth recollected current stories of raisers fantastical devotion to the popular prima donna of the angelical voicehe hurried to the opera and met the vomit and heard in the crushroom how divine she had been that night a fellow member of the house tolerably intimate with raiser informed him between frightful stomachic roulades of her final aria of the likeliest place where raiser might be found when the opera was over not at his club nor at his chambers on one of the bridgeswestminster he fancied there was no need for redworth to run hunting the man at so late an hour but he was drawn on by the similarity in dissimilarity of this devotee of a woman who could worship her at a distance and talk of her to everybody not till he beheld raisers tall figure cutting the bridge parapet with a star over his shoulder did he reflect on the views the other might entertain of the nocturnal solicitation to see justice done to a ladys new book in a particular review and the absurd outside of the request was immediately smothered by the natural simplicity and pressing necessity of its inside he crossed the road and said ah in recognition were you at the opera this evening oh just at the end said raiser pacing forward its a fine night did you hear her no too late raiser pressed ahead to meditate by himself as was his wont finding redworth beside him he monologuized in his depths theyll kill her she puts her soul into it gives her blood there s no failing of the voice you see how it wears her shes doomed half a years rest on como somewhere she might be saved she wont refuse to work have you spoken to her said redworth and next to berlin vienna a horse would be i i dont know her raiser replied some of their women stand it shes delicately built you cant treat a lute like a drum without destroying the instrument we look on at a murder the haggard prospect from that step of the climax checked his delivery redworth knew him to be a sober man in office a man with a head for statecraft he had made a weighty speech in the house a couple of hours back this opera cantatrice no beauty though gentle thrilling winning was his corner of romance do you come here often he asked yes i cant sleep london at night from the bridge looks fine by the way it s lonely here thats the advantage said rainer i keep silver in my pocket for poor girls going to their homes and im left in peace an hour later theres the dawn down yonder by the way redworth interposed and was told that after these nights of her singing she never slept till morning he swallowed the fact sympathized and resumed i want a small favour no business here please not a bit of it you know mrs warwick you know of her she s publishing a book i want you to use your influence to get it noticed quickly if you can warwick oh yes a handsome woman ah yes the dannisburgh affair yes what did i hearthey say she s thick with percy dacier at present who was talking of her yes old lady dacier so she s a friend of yours shes an old friend said redworth composing himself for the dose he had taken was not of the sweetest and no protestations could be uttered by a man of the world to repel a charge of tattlers the truth is her book is clever i have read the proofs she must have an income and she wont apply to her husband and literature should help her if she s fairly treated she s irish by descent merions daughter witty as her father its odd you havent met her the mere writing of the book is extraordinarily good if it s put into capable hands for review thats all it requires and full of life bright dialogue capital sketches the books a piece of literature only it must have competent critics so he talked while rainer ejaculated warwick warwick in the irritating tone of dozens of others what did i hear of her husband he has a post yes yes some one said the verdict in that case knocked him overheart disease or something he glanced at the dark thames water take my word for it the groves of academe wont compare with one of our bridges at night if you seek philosophy you see the london above and the london below round us the sleepy city and the stars in the water looking like souls of suicides i caught a girl with a bad fit on her once i had to lecture her its when we become parsons we find out our cousinship with these poor peripatetics whose last philosophy is a jump across the parapet the bridge at night is a bath for a public man but choose another leave me mine redworth took the hint he stated the title of mrs warwicks book and imagined from the thoughtful cast of rainers head that he was impressing the princess egeria on his memory rainer burst out with clenched fists he beats her the fellow lives on her and beats her strikes that woman he drags her about to every capital in europe to make money for him and the scoundrel pays her with blows in the course of a heavy tirade against the scoundrel redworth apprehended that it was the cantatrices husband he expressed his horror and regret paused and named the princess egeria and a certain critical review another outburst seemed to be in preparation nothing further was to be done for the book at that hour so with a blunt good night he left charles rainer pacing and thought on his walk home of the strange effects wrought by women unwittingly upon men englishmen those women or some of them as little knowing it as the moon her traditional influence upon the tides he thought of percy dacier too in his bed he could have wished himself peregrinating a bridge the princess egeria appeared with the reviews at her heels a pack of clappers causing her to fly over editions clean as a doe the gates and hedgesto quote mr sullivan smith who knew not a sentence of the work save what he gathered of it from redworth at their chance meeting on piccadilly pavement and then immediately he knew enough to blow his huntsmans horn in honour of the sale his hallali rang high heres another irish girl to win their laurels tis one of the blazing successes a most enthralling work beautifully composed and where is she now mr redworth since she broke away from that husband of hers that wears the clothes of the worst tailor ever begotten by a thread on a needle as i tell every soul of em in my part of the country you have seen him said redworth why sir wasnt he on show at the court he applied to for relief and damages as we heard when we were watching the case daily scarce drawing our breath for fear the innocentand one of our own blood would be crushed sure there he stood ay and looking the very donkey for a woman to flip off her fingers like the dust from my great uncles prise of snuff shes a glory to the old country and better you than another id say since it wasnt an irishman to have her but what induced the dear lady to take him is the question we re all of us asking and its mournful to think that somehow you contrive to get the pick of us in the girls if ever we re united twill be by a trick of circumvention of that sort pretty sure theres a turn in the market when they shut their eyes and drop to the handiest and londons a vortex that poor dear dull old dublin cant compete with i ll beg you for the address of the lady her friend lady dunstane mr sullivan smith walked with redworth through the park to the house of commons discoursing of rails and his excellent old friends rise to the top rung of the ladder and beanstalk land so elevated that one had to look up at him with watery eyes as if one had flung a ball at the meridian sun arrived at famed st stephens he sent in his compliments to the noble patriot and accepted an invitation to dinner and mind you read the princess egeria said redworth again and again my friend the book is bought sullivan smith slapped his breastpocket theres a bit of erin in it it sprouts from erin trumpet it loud as cavalry to the charge once with the title stamped on his memory the zealous irishman might be trusted to become an ambulant advertizer others personal friends adherents courtiers of
