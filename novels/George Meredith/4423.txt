and david widger widgercecometnet rhoda fleming by george meredith book xxi gives a glimpse of what poor villanies the story contains xxii edward takes his course xxiii major percy waring xxiv warbeach village church xxv of the fearful temptation which came upon anthony hackbut and of his meeting with dahlia xxvi in the park xxvii contains a study of a fool in trouble xxviii edward's letter xxix furthermore of the fool chapter xxi mrs boulby's ears had not deceived her it had been a bet and the day would have gone disastrously with robert if mrs lovell had not won her bet what was heroism to warbeach appeared very outrageous blackguardism up at fairly it was there believed by the gentlemen though rather against evidence that the man was a sturdy ruffian and an infuriated sot the first suggestion was to drag him before the magistrates but against this algernon protested declaring his readiness to defend himself with so vehement a magnanimity that it was clearly seen the man had a claim on him lord elling however when he was told of these systematic assaults upon one of his guests announced his resolve to bring the law into operation algernon heard it as the knell to his visit he was too happy to go away willingly and the great jew city of london was exceedingly hot for him at that period but to stay and risk an exposure of his extinct military career was not possible in his despair he took mrs lovell entirely into his confidence in doing which he only filled up the outlines of what she already knew concerning edward he was too useful to the lady for her to afford to let him go no other youth called her angel for listening complacently to strange stories of men and their dilemmas no one fetched and carried for her like algernon and she was a woman who cherished dog like adoration and could not part with it she had also the will to reward it at her intercession robert was spared an introduction to the magistrates she made light of his misdemeanours assuring everybody that so splendid a horseman deserved to be dealt with differently from other offenders the gentlemen who waited upon farmer eccles went in obedience to her orders then came the scene on ditley marsh described to that assembly at the pilot by stephen bilton when she perceived that robert was manageable in silken trammels and made a bet that she would show him tamed she won her bet and saved the gentlemen from soiling their hands for which they had conceived a pressing necessity and they thanked her and paid their money over to algernon whom she constituted her treasurer she was called the man tamer gracefully acknowledging the compliment colonel barclay the moustachioed horseman who had spoken the few words to robert in passing now remarked that there was an end of the military profession i surrender my sword he said gallantly another declared that ladies would now act in lieu of causing an appeal to arms similia similibus c said edward they can apparently cure what they originate ah the poor sex mrs lovell sighed when we bring the millennium to you i believe you will still have a word against eve the whole parade back to the stables was marked by pretty speeches by jove but he ought to have gone down on his knees like a horse when you've tamed him said lord suckling the young guardsman i would mark a distinction between a horse and a brave man lord suckling said the lady and such was mrs lovell's dignity when an allusion to robert was forced on her and her wit and ease were so admirable that none of those who rode with her thought of sitting in judgement on her conduct women can make for themselves new spheres new laws if they will assume their right to be eccentric as an unquestionable thing and always reserve a season for showing forth like the conventional women of society the evening was mrs lovell's time for this important re establishment of her position and many a silly youth who had sailed pleasantly with her all the day was wrecked when he tried to carry on the topics where she reigned the lady of the drawing room moreover not being eccentric from vanity but simply to accommodate what had once been her tastes and were now her necessities she avoided slang and all the insignia of eccentricity thus she mastered the secret of keeping the young men respectfully enthusiastic so that their irrepressible praises did not as is usual when these are in acclamation drag her to their level and the female world with which she was perfectly feminine and as silkenly insipid every evening of her life as was needed to restore her reputation admitted that she belonged to it which is everything to an adventurous spirit of that sex indeed the sole secure basis of operations you are aware that men's faith in a woman whom her sisters discountenance and partially repudiate is uneasy however deeply they may be charmed on the other hand she maybe guilty of prodigious oddities without much disturbing their reverence while she is in the feminine circle but what fatal breath was it coming from mrs lovell that was always inflaming men to mutual animosity what encouragement had she given to algernon that lord suckling should be jealous of him and what to lord suckling that algernon should loathe the sight of the young lord and why was each desirous of showing his manhood in combat before an eminent peacemaker edward laughed ah ha and rubbed his hands as at a special confirmation of his prophecy when algernon came into his room and said i shall fight that fellow suckling hang me if i can stand his impudence i want to have a shot at a man of my own set just to let peggy lovell see i know what she thinks just to let mrs lovell see edward echoed she has seen it lots of times my dear algy come this looks lively i was sure she would soon be sick of the water gruel of peace i tell you she's got nothing to do with it ned don't be confoundedly unjust she didn't tell me to go and seek him how can she help his whispering to her and then she looks over at me and i swear i'm not going to be defended by a woman she must fancy i haven't got the pluck of a flea i know what her idea of young fellows is why she said to me when suckling went off from her the other day these are our guards i shall fight him do said edward will you take a challenge i'm a lawyer mr mars you won't take a challenge for a friend when he's insulted i reply again i am a lawyer but this is what i'll do if you like i'll go to mrs lovely and inform her that it is your desire to gain her esteem by fighting with pistols that will accomplish the purpose you seek it will possibly disappoint her for she will have to stop the affair but women are born to be disappointed they want so much i'll fight him some way or other said algernon glowering and then his face became bright i say didn't she manage that business beautifully this morning not another woman in the world could have done it oh una and the lion mrs valentine and orson did you bet with the rest his cousin asked i lost my tenner but what's that there will be an additional five to hand over to the man sedgett what's that no hang it algernon shouted you've paid your ten for the shadow cheerfully pay your five for the substance do you mean to say that sedgett algernon stared miracles if you come to examine them algy have generally had a pathway prepared for them and the miracle of the power of female persuasion exhibited this morning was not quite independent of the preliminary agency of a scoundrel so that's why you didn't bet algernon signified the opening of his intelligence with his eyelids pronouncing by jingos and by joves to ease the sudden rush of ideas within him you might have let me into the secret ned i'd lose any number of tens to peggy lovell but a fellow don't like to be in the dark except algy that when you carry light you're a general illuminator let the matter drop sedgett has saved you from annoyance take him his five pounds annoyance be hanged my good ned algernon was aroused to reply i don't complain and i've done my best to stand in front of you and as you've settled the fellow i say nothing but between us two who's the guilty party and who's the victim didn't he tell you he had you in his power i don't remember that he did well i heard him the sturdy cur refused to be bribed so there was only one way of quieting him and you see what a thrashing does for that sort of beast i algy never abandon a friend mark that take the five pounds to sedgett algernon strode about the room first of all you stick me up in a theatre so that i'm seen with a girl and then you get behind me and let me be pelted he began grumbling and ask a fellow for money who hasn't a farthing i shan't literally have a farthing till that horse 'templemore' runs and then by george i'll pay my debts jews are awful things how much do you require at present said edward provoking his appetite for a loan oh fifty that is just now more like a thousand when i get to town and where it's to come from but never mind 'pon my soul i pity the fox i run down here i feel i'm exactly in his case in london however if i can do you any service ned edward laughed you might have done me the service of not excusing yourself to the squire when he came here in such a way as to implicate me but i was so tremendously badgered ned you had a sort of gratification in letting the squire crow over his brother and he did crow for a time on my honour ned as to crowing he went away cursing at me peggy lovell managed it somehow for you i was really awfully badgered yes but you know what a man my father is he hasn't the squire's philosophy in those affairs 'pon my soul mr ned i never guessed it before but i rather fancy you got clear with sir billy the banker by washing in my basin eh did you edward looked straight at his cousin saying you deserved worse than that you were treacherous you proved you were not to be trusted and yet you see i trust you call it my folly of course and i don't mind telling you i used my wits to turn the point of the attack i may be what they call unscrupulous when i'm surprised i have to look to money as well as you and if my father thought it went in a what he considers wrong direction the source would be choked by paternal morality you betrayed me listen i tell you ned i merely said to my governor listen to me you betrayed me i defended myself that is i've managed so that i may still be of service to you it was a near shave but you now see the value of having a character with one's father just open my writing desk there and toss out the cheque book i confess i can't see why you should have objected but let that pass how much do you want fifty say forty five and five i'll give you to pay to sedgett making fifty eighty before and fifty one hundred and thirty write that you owe me that sum on a piece of paper i can't see why you should wish to appear so uncommonly virtuous algernon scribbled the written acknowledgment which he despised himself for giving and the receiver for taking but was always ready to give for the money and said as he put the cheque in his purse it was this infernal fellow completely upset me if you were worried by a bull dog by jove ned you'd lose your coolness he bothered my head off ask me now and i'll do anything on earth for you my back's broad sir billy can't think worse of me than he does do you want to break positively with that pretty rival to peggy l i've got a scheme to relieve you my poor old ned and make everybody happy i'll lay the foundations of a fresh and brilliant reputation for myself algernon took a chair edward was fathoms deep in his book the former continued i'd touch on the money question last with any other fellow than you but you always know that money's the hinge and nothing else lifts a man out of a scrape it costs a stiff pull on your banker and that reminds me you couldn't go to sir billy for it you'd have to draw in advance by degrees anyhow look here there are lots of young farmers who want to emigrate and want wives and money i know one it's no use going into particulars but it's worth thinking over life is made up of mutual help ned you can help another fellow better than yourself as for me when i'm in a hobble i give you my word of honour i'm just like a baby and haven't an idea at my own disposal the same with others you can't manage without somebody's assistance what do you say old boy edward raised his head from his book some views of life deduced from your private experience he observed and algernon cursed at book worms who would never take hints and left him but when he was by himself edward pitched his book upon the floor and sat reflecting the sweat started on his forehead he was compelled to look into his black volume and study it his desire was to act humanely and generously but the question inevitably recurred how can i utterly dash my prospects in the world it would be impossible to bring dahlia to great houses and he liked great houses and the charm of mixing among delicately bred women on the other hand lawyers have married beneath them married cooks housemaids governesses and so forth and what has a lawyer to do with a dainty lady who will constantly distract him with finicking civilities and speculations in unprofitable regions what he does want is a woman amiable as a surface of parchment serviceable as his inkstand one who will be like the wig in which he closes his forensic term disreputable from overwear but suited to the purpose ah if i meant to be nothing but a lawyer edward stopped the flow of this current in dahlia's favour his passion for her was silent was it dead it was certainly silent since robert had come down to play his wild game of persecution at fairly the simple idea of dahlia had been edward's fever he detested brute force with a finely witted man's full loathing and dahlia's obnoxious champion had grown to be associated in his mind with dahlia he swept them both from his recollection abhorrently for in his recollection he could not divorce them he pretended to suppose that dahlia whose only reproach to him was her suffering participated in the scheme to worry him he could even forget her beauty forget all save the unholy fetters binding him she seemed to imprison him in bare walls he meditated on her character she had no strength she was timid comfort loving fond of luxury credulous preposterously conventional that is desirous more than the ordinary run of women of being hedged about and guarded by ceremonies mere ceremonies said edward forgetting the notion he entertained of women not so protected but it may be that in playing the part of fool and coward we cease to be mindful of the absolute necessity for sheltering the weak from that monstrous allied army the cowards and the fools he admitted even to himself that he had deceived her at the same time denouncing her unheard of capacity of belief which had placed him in a miserable hobble and that was the truth now men confessing themselves in a miserable hobble and knowing they are guilty of the state of things lamented by them intend to drown that part of their nature which disturbs them by its outcry the submission to a tangle that could be cut through instantaneously by any exertion of a noble will convicts them they had better not confide even to their secret hearts that they are afflicted by their conscience and the generosity of their sentiments for it will be only to say that these high qualities are on the failing side their inclination under the circumstances is generally base and no less a counsellor than uncorrupted common sense when they are in such a hobble will sometimes advise them to be base but in admitting the plea which common sense puts forward on their behalf we may fairly ask them to be masculine in their baseness or in other words since they must be selfish let them be so without the poltroonery of selfishness edward's wish was to be perfectly just as far as he could be now just to himself as well for how was he to prove of worth and aid to any one depending on him if he stood crippled just also to his family to his possible posterity and just to dahlia his task was to reconcile the variety of justness due upon all sides the struggle we will assume was severe for he thought so he thought of going to dahlia and speaking the word of separation of going to her family and stating his offence without personal exculpation thus masculine in baseness he was in idea but poltroonery triumphed the picture of himself facing his sin and its victims dismayed him and his struggle ended in his considering as to the fit employment of one thousand pounds in his possession the remainder of a small legacy hitherto much cherished a day later mrs lovell said to him have you heard of that unfortunate young man i am told that he lies in great danger from a blow on the back of his head he looked ill when i saw him and however mad he may be i'm sorry harm should have come to one who is really brave gentle means are surely best it is so with horses it must be so with men as to women i don't pretend to unriddle them gentle means are decidedly best said edward perceiving that her little dog algy had carried news to her and that she was setting herself to fathom him you gave an eminent example of it yesterday i was so sure of the result that i didn't bet against you why not have backed me the hard young legal face withstood the attack of her soft blue eyes out of which a thousand needles flew seeking a weak point in the mask the compliment was to incite you to a superhuman effort then why not pay the compliment i never pay compliments to transparent merit i do not hold candles to lamps true said she and as gentle means are so admirable it would be as well to stop incision and imbruing between those two boys which she asked innocently suckling and algy is it possible they are such boys exactly of the kind to do it don't you know and edward explained elaborately and cruelly the character of the boys who rushed into conflicts colour deep as evening red confused her cheeks and she said we must stop them alas he shook his head if it's not too late it never is too late perhaps not when the embodiment of gentle means is so determined come i believe they are in the billiard room now and you shall see she said the pair were found in the billiard room even as a pair of terriers that remember a bone mrs lovell proposed a game and offered herself for partner to lord suckling till total defeat do us part the young nobleman acquiesced and total defeat befell them during the play of the balls mrs lovell threw a jealous intentness of observation upon all the strokes made by algernon saying nothing but just looking at him when he did a successful thing she winked at some quiet stately betting that went on between him and lord suckling they were at first preternaturally polite and formal toward one another by degrees the influence at work upon them was manifested in a thaw of their stiff demeanour and they fell into curt dialogues which mrs lovell gave herself no concern to encourage too early edward saw and was astonished himself to feel that she had ceased to breathe that fatal inciting breath which made men vindictively emulous of her favour and mad to match themselves for a claim to the chief smile no perceptible change was displayed she was mrs lovell still vivacious and soft flame coloured with the arrowy eyelashes a pleasant companion who did not play the woman obtrusively among men and show a thirst for homage all the difference appeared to be that there was an absence as of some evil spiritual emanation and here a thought crossed him one of the memorable little evanescent thoughts which sway us by our chance weakness does she think me wanting in physical courage now though the difference between them had been owing to a scornful remark that she had permitted herself to utter on his refusal to accept a quarrel with one of her numerous satellites his knowledge of her worship of brains and his pride in his possession of the burdensome weight had quite precluded his guessing that she might haply suppose him to be deficient in personal bravery he was astounded by the reflection that she had thus misjudged him it was distracting sober thoughted as he was by nature he watched the fair simplicity of her new manner with a jealous eye her management of the two youths was exquisite but to him edward she had never condescended to show herself thus mediating and amiable why clearly because she conceived that he had no virile fire in his composition did the detestable little devil think silly duelling a display of valour did the fair seraph think him anything less than a man how beautifully hung the yellow loop of her hair as she leaned over the board how gracious she was and like a goddess with these boys as he called them she rallied her partner not letting him forget that he had the honour of being her partner while she appeared envious of algernon's skill and talked to both and got them upon common topics and laughed and was like a fair english flower of womanhood nothing deadly there algy you have beaten us i don't think i'll have lord suckling for my partner any more she said putting up her wand and pouting you don't bear malice said algernon revived there is my hand now you must play a game alone with lord suckling and beat him mind you beat him or it will redound to my discredit with which she and edward left them algy was a little crestfallen and no wonder she said he is soon set up again they will be good friends now isn't it odd that they should be ready to risk their lives for trifles thus edward tempted her to discuss the subject which he had in his mind she felt intuitively the trap in his voice ah yes she replied it must be because they know their lives are not precious so utterly at her mercy had he fallen that her pronunciation of that word precious carried a severe sting to him and it was not spoken with peculiar emphasis on the contrary she wished to indicate that she was of his way of thinking as regarded this decayed method of settling disputes he turned to leave her you go to your adeline i presume she said ah that reminds me i have never thanked you for my good services such as they are sir william will be very happy and it was for him a little more than for you that i went out of my way to be a matchmaker it was her character of course that struck you as being so eminently suited to mine can i tell what is the character of a girl she is mild and shy and extremely gentle in all probability she has a passion for battles and bloodshed i judged from your father's point of view she has money and you are to have money and the union of money and money is supposed to be a good thing and besides you are variable and off to morrow what you are on to day is it not so and heiresses are never jilted colonel barclay is only awaiting your retirement le roi est mort vive le roi heiresses may cry it like kingdoms i thought said edward meaningly the colonel had better taste do you not know that my friends are my friends because they are not allowed to dream they will do anything else if they are taken poorly i commend them to a sea voyage africa the north west passage the source of the nile men with their vanity wounded may discover wonders they return friendly as before whether they have done the geographical society a service or not that is they generally do then i begin to fancy i must try those latitudes oh you are my relative he scarcely knew that he had uttered margaret she replied to it frankly yes cousin ned you have made the voyage you see and have come back friends with me the variability of opals ah sir john you join us in season we were talking of opals is the opal a gem that stands to represent women sir john capes smoothed his knuckles with silken palms and with courteous antique grin responded it is a gem i would never dare to offer to a lady's acceptance it is by repute unlucky so you never can have done so exquisite exclaimed the veteran in smiles if what you deign to imply were only true they entered the drawing room among the ladies edward whispered in mrs lovell's ear he is in need of the voyage he is very near it she answered in the same key and swam into general conversation her cold wit satanic as the gleam of it struck through his mind gave him a throb of desire to gain possession of her and crush her chapter xxii the writing of a letter to dahlia had previously been attempted and abandoned as a sickening task like an idle boy with his holiday imposition edward shelved it among the nightmares saying how can i sit down and lie to her and thinking that silence would prepare her bosom for the coming truth silence is commonly the slow poison used by those who mean to murder love there is nothing violent about it no shock is given hope is not abruptly strangled but merely dreams of evil and fights with gradually stifling shadows when the last convulsions come they are not terrific the frame has been weakened for dissolution love dies like natural decay it seems the kindest way of doing a cruel thing but dahlia wrote crying out her agony at the torture possibly your nervously organized natures require a modification of the method edward now found himself able to conduct a correspondence he despatched the following my dear dahlia of course i cannot expect you to be aware of the bewildering occupations of a country house where a man has literally not five minutes' time to call his own so i pass by your reproaches my father has gone at last he has manifested an extraordinary liking for my society and i am to join him elsewhere perhaps run over to paris your city but at present for a few days i am my own master and the first thing i do is to attend to your demands not to write 'two lines' but to give you a good long letter what on earth makes you fancy me unwell you know i am never unwell and as to your nursing me when has there ever been any need for it you must positively learn patience i have been absent a week or so and you talk of coming down here and haunting the house such ghosts as you meet with strange treatment when they go about unprotected let me give you warning you have my full permission to walk out in the parks for exercise i think you are bound to do it for your health's sake pray discontinue that talk about the alteration in your looks you must learn that you are no longer a child cease to write like a child if people stare at you as you say you are very well aware it is not because you are becoming plain you do not mean it i know but there is a disingenuousness in remarks of this sort that is to me exceedingly distasteful avoid the shadow of hypocrisy women are subject to it and it is quite innocent no doubt i won't lecture you my cousin algernon is here with me he has not spoken of your sister your fears in that direction are quite unnecessary he is attached to a female cousin of ours a very handsome person witty and highly sensible who dresses as well as the lady you talk about having seen one day in wrexby church her lady's maid is a frenchwoman which accounts for it you have not forgotten the boulevards i wish you to go on with your lessons in french educate yourself and you will rise superior to these distressing complaints i recommend you to read the newspapers daily buy nice picture books if the papers are too matter of fact for you by looking eternally inward you teach yourself to fret and the consequence is or will be that you wither no constitution can stand it all the ladies here take an interest in parliamentary affairs they can talk to men upon men's themes it is impossible to explain to you how wearisome an everlasting nursery prattle becomes the idea that men ought never to tire of it is founded on some queer belief that they are not mortal parliament opens in february my father wishes me to stand for selborough if he or some one will do the talking to the tradesmen and provide the beer and the bribes i have no objection in that case my law goes to the winds i'm bound to make a show of obedience for he has scarcely got over my summer's trip he holds me a prisoner to him for heaven knows how long it may be months as for the heiress whom he has here to make a match for me he and i must have a pitched battle about her by and by at present my purse insists upon my not offending him when will old men understand young ones i burn your letters and beg you to follow the example old letters are the dreariest ghosts in the world and you cannot keep more treacherous rubbish in your possession a discovery would exactly ruin me your purchase of a black velvet bonnet with pink ribands was very suitable or did you write 'blue' ribands but your complexion can bear anything you talk of being annoyed when you walk out remember that no woman who knows at all how to conduct herself need for one moment suffer annoyance what is the 'feeling' you speak of i cannot conceive any 'feeling' that should make you helpless when you consider that you are insulted there are women who have natural dignity and women who have none you ask the names of the gentlemen here lord carey lord wippern both leave to morrow sir john capes colonel barclay lord suckling the ladies mrs gosling miss gosling lady carey mrs anybody to any extent they pluck hen's feathers all day and half the night i see them out and make my bow to the next batch of visitors and then i don't know where i am read poetry if it makes up for my absence as you say repeat it aloud minding the pulsation of feet go to the theatre now and then and take your landlady with you if she's a cat fit one of your dresses on the servant girl and take her you only want a companion a dummy will do take a box and sit behind the curtain back to the audience i wrote to my wine merchant to send champagne and sherry i hope he did the champagne in pints and half pints if not return them instantly i know how economy sitting solitary poor thing would not dare to let the froth of a whole pint bottle fly out be an obedient girl and please me your stern tutor edward the first he read this epistle twice over to satisfy himself that it was a warm effusion and not too tender and it satisfied him by a stretch of imagination he could feel that it represented him to her as in a higher atmosphere considerate for her and not so intimate that she could deem her spirit to be sharing it another dose of silence succeeded this discreet administration of speech dahlia replied with letter upon letter blindly impassioned and again singularly cold but with no reproaches she was studying she said her head ached a little only a little she walked she read poetry she begged him to pardon her for not drinking wine she was glad that he burnt her letters which were so foolish that if she could have the courage to look at them after they were written they would never be sent he was slightly revolted by one exclamation how ambitious you are because i cannot sit down for life in a london lodging house he thought and eyed her distantly as a poor good creature who had already accepted her distinctive residence in another sphere than his from such a perception of her humanity it was natural that his livelier sense of it should diminish he felt that he had awakened and he shook her off and now he set to work to subdue mrs lovell his own subjugation was the first fruit of his effort it was quite unacknowledged by him but when two are at this game the question arises which can live without the other and horrid pangs smote him to hear her telling musically of the places she was journeying to the men she would see and the chances of their meeting again before he was married to the heiress adeline i have yet to learn that i am engaged to her he said mrs lovell gave him a fixed look she has a half brother he stepped away in a fury devil he muttered absolutely muttered it knowing that he fooled and frowned like a stage hero in stagey heroics you think to hound me into this brutal stupidity of fighting do you upon my honour he added in his natural manner i believe she does though but the look became his companion it touched and called up great vanity in his breast and not till then could he placably confront the look he tried a course of reading every morning he was down in the library looking old in an arm chair over his book an intent abstracted figure mrs lovell would enter and eye him carelessly utter little commonplaces and go forth the silly words struck on his brain the book seemed hollow sounded hollow as he shut it this woman breathed of active striving life she was a spur to black energies a plumed glory impulsive to chivalry everything she said and did held men in scales and approved or rejected them intoxication followed this new conception of her he lost altogether his right judgement even the cooler after thoughts were lost what sort of man had harry been her first husband a dashing soldier a quarrelsome duellist a dull dog but dull to her she at least was reverential to the memory of him she lisped now and then of my husband very prettily and with intense provocation and yet she worshipped brains evidently she thirsted for that rare union of brains and bravery in a man and would never surrender till she had discovered it perhaps she fancied it did not exist it might be that she took edward as the type of brains and harry of bravery and supposed that the two qualities were not to be had actually in conjunction her admiration of his edward's wit therefore only strengthened the idea she entertained of his deficiency in that other companion manly virtue edward must have been possessed for he ground his teeth villanously in supposing himself the victim of this outrageous suspicion and how to prove it false how to prove it false in a civilized age among sober living men and women with whom the violent assertion of bravery would certainly imperil his claim to brains his head was like a stew pan over the fire bubbling endlessly he railed at her to algernon and astonished the youth who thought them in a fair way to make an alliance milk and capsicums he called her and compared her to bloody mustard haired saxon queens of history and was childishly spiteful and mrs lovell had it all reported to her as he was quite aware the woman seeking for an anomaly wants a master with this pompous aphorism he finished his reading of the fair enigma words big in the mouth serve their turn when there is no way of satisfying the intelligence to be her master however one must not begin by writhing as her slave the attempt to read an inscrutable woman allows her to dominate us too commandingly so the lordly mind takes her in a hard grasp cracks the shell and drawing forth the kernel says this was all the puzzle doubtless it is the fate which women like mrs lovell provoke the truth was that she could read a character when it was under her eyes but its yesterday and to morrow were a blank she had no imaginative hold on anything for which reason she was always requiring tangible signs of virtues that she esteemed the thirst for the shows of valour and wit was insane with her but she asked for nothing that she herself did not give in abundance and with beauty super added her propensity to bet sprang of her passion for combat she was not greedy of money or reckless in using it but a difference of opinion arising her instinct forcibly prompted her to back her own if the stake was the risk of a lover's life she was ready to put down the stake and would have marvelled contemptuously at the lover complaining sheep sheep she thought of those who dared not fight and had a wavering tendency to affix the epithet to those who simply did not fight withal mrs lovell was a sensible person clearheaded and shrewd logical too more than the run of her sex i may say profoundly practical so much so that she systematically reserved the after years for enlightenment upon two or three doubts of herself which struck her in the calm of her spirit from time to time france edward called her in one of their colloquies it was an illuminating title she liked the french though no one was keener for the honour of her own country in opposition to them she liked their splendid boyishness their unequalled devotion their merciless intellects the oneness of the nation when the sword is bare and pointing to chivalrous enterprise she liked their fine varnish of sentiment which appears so much on the surface that englishmen suppose it to have nowhere any depth as if the outer coating must necessarily exhaust the stock or as if what is at the source of our being can never be made visible she had her imagination of them as of a streaming banner in the jaws of storm with snows among the cloud rents and lightning in the chasms which image may be accounted for by the fact that when a girl she had in adoration kissed the feet of napoleon the giant of the later ghosts of history it was a princely compliment she received it curtseying and disarmed the intended irony in reply she called him great britain i regret to say that he stood less proudly for his nation indeed he flushed he remembered articles girding at the policy of peace at any price and half felt that mrs lovell had meant to crown him with a quaker's hat his title fell speedily into disuse but yes france and no france continued his effort being to fix the epithet to frivolous allusions from which her ingenuity rescued it honourably had she ever been in love he asked her the question she stabbed him with so straightforward an affirmative that he could not conceal the wound have i not been married she said he began to experience the fretful craving to see the antecedents of the torturing woman spread out before him he conceived a passion for her girlhood he begged for portraits of her as a girl she showed him the portrait of harry lovell in a locket he held the locket between his fingers dead harry was kept very warm could brains ever touch her emotions as bravery had done where are the brains i boast of he groaned in the midst of these sensational extravagances the lull of action was soon to be disturbed a letter was brought to him he opened it and read mr edward blancove when you rode by me under fairly park i did not know you i can give you a medical certificate that since then i have been in the doctor's hands i know you now i call upon you to meet me with what weapons you like best to prove that you are not a midnight assassin the place shall be where you choose to appoint if you decline i will make you publicly acknowledge what you have done if you answer that i am not a gentleman and you are one i say that you have attacked me in the dark when i was on horseback and you are now my equal if i like to think so you will not talk about the law after that night the man you employed i may punish or i may leave though he struck the blow but i will meet you to morrow a friend of mine who is a major in the army will be down here and will call on you from me or on any friend of yours you are pleased to name i will not let you escape whether i shall face a guilty man in you god knows but i know i have a right to call upon you to face me i am sir yours truly robert eccles edward's face grew signally white over the contents of this unprecedented challenge the letter had been brought in to him at the breakfast table read it read it said mrs lovell seeing him put it by and he had read it with her eyes on him the man seemed to him a man of claws who clutched like a demon would nothing quiet him edward thought of bribes for the sake of peace but a second glance at the letter assured his sagacious mind that bribes were powerless in this man's case neither bribes nor sticks were of service departure from fairly would avail as little the tenacious devil would follow him to london and what was worse as a hound from dahlia's family he was now on the right scent and appeared to know that he was how was a scandal to be avoided by leaving fairly instantly for any place on earth he could not avoid leaving the man behind and if the man saw mrs lovell again her instincts as a woman of her class were not to be trusted as likely as not she would side with the ruffian that is she would think he had been wronged perhaps think that he ought to have been met there is the democratic virus secret in every woman it was predominant in mrs lovell according to edward's observation of the lady the rights of individual manhood were as he angrily perceived likely to be recognized by her spirit if only they were stoutly asserted and that in defiance of station of reason of all the ideas inculcated by education and society i believe she'll expect me to fight him he exclaimed at least he knew she would despise him if he avoided the brutal challenge without some show of dignity on rising from the table he drew algernon aside it was an insufferable thought that he was compelled to take his brainless cousin into his confidence even to the extent of soliciting his counsel but there was no help for it in vain edward asked himself why he had been such an idiot as to stain his hands with the affair at all he attributed it to his regard for algernon having commonly the sway of his passions he was in the habit of forgetting that he ever lost control of them and the fierce black mood engendered by robert's audacious persecution had passed from his memory though it was now recalled in full force see what a mess you drag a man into he said algernon read a line of the letter oh confound this infernal fellow he shouted in sickly wonderment and snapped sharp drag you into the mess upon my honour your coolness ned is the biggest part about you if it isn't the best edward's grip fixed on him for they were only just out of earshot of mrs lovell they went upstairs and algernon read the letter through 'midnight assassin' he repeated by jove how beastly that sounds it's a lie that you attacked him in the dark ned eh i did not attack him at all said edward he behaved like a ruffian to you and deserved shooting like a mad dog did you though algernon persisted in questioning despite his cousin's manifest shyness of the subject did you really go out with that man sedgett and stop this fellow on horseback he speaks of a blow you didn't strike him did you ned i mean not a hit except in self defence edward bit his lip and shot a level reflective side look peculiar to him when meditating he wished his cousin to propose that mrs lovell should see the letter he felt that by consulting with her he could bring her to apprehend the common sense of the position and be so far responsible for what he might do that she would not dare to let her heart be rebellious toward him subsequently if he himself went to her it would look too much like pleading for her intercession the subtle directness of the woman's spirit had to be guarded against at every point he replied to algernon what i did was on your behalf oblige me by not interrogating me i give you my positive assurance that i encouraged no unmanly assault on him that'll do that'll do said algernon eager not to hear more lest there should come an explanation of what he had heard of course then this fellow has no right the devil's in him if we could only make him murder sedgett and get hanged for it he's got a friend who's a major in the army oh come i say this is pitching it too stiff i shall insist upon seeing his commission really ned i can't advise i'll stand by you that you may be sure of stand by you but what the deuce to say to help you go before the magistrate get lord elling to issue a warrant to prevent a breach of the peace no that won't do this quack of a major in the army's to call to morrow i don't mind if he shows his credentials all clear amusing him in any manner he likes i can't see the best scheme hang it ned it's very hard upon me to ask me to do the thinking i always go to peggy lovell when i'm bothered there mrs lovell mistress lovell madame my princess lovell if you want me to pronounce respectable titles to her name you're too proud to ask a woman to help you ain't you ned no said edward mildly in some cases their wits are keen enough one doesn't like to drag her into such a business hm went algernon i don't think she's so innocent of it as you fancy she's very clever said edward she's awfully clever cried algernon he paused to give room for more praises of her and then pursued she's so kind that's what you don't credit her for i'll go and consult her if positively you don't mind trust her for keeping it quiet come ned she's sure to hit upon the right thing may i go it's your affair more than mine said edward have it so if you like returned the good natured fellow it's worth while consulting her just to see how neatly she'll take it bless your heart she won't know a bit more than you want her to know i'm off to her now he carried away the letter edward's own practical judgement would have advised his instantly sending a short reply to robert explaining that he was simply in conversation with the man sedgett when robert the old enemy of the latter rode by and that while regretting sedgett's proceedings he could not be held accountable for them but it was useless to think of acting in accordance with his reason mrs lovell was queen and sat in reason's place it was absolutely necessary to conciliate her approbation of his conduct in this dilemma by submitting to the decided unpleasantness of talking with her on a subject that fevered him and of allowing her to suppose he required the help of her sagacity such was the humiliation imposed upon him further than this he had nothing to fear for no woman could fail to be overborne by the masculine force of his brain in an argument the humiliation was bad enough and half tempted him to think that his old dream of working as a hard student with fair and gentle dahlia ministering to his comforts and too happy to call herself his was best was it not after one particular step had been taken the manliest life he could have shaped out or did he imagine it so at this moment because he was a coward and because pride and vanity and ferocity alternately had to screw him up to meet the consequences of his acts instead of the great heart if a coward dahlia was his home his refuge his sanctuary mrs lovell was perdition and its scorching fires to a man with a taint of cowardice in him whatever he was edward's vanity would not permit him to acknowledge himself that still he did not call on his heart to play inspiriting music his ideas turned to subterfuge his aim was to keep the good opinion of mrs lovell while he quieted robert and he entered straightway upon that very perilous course the attempt for the sake of winning her to bewilder and deceive a woman's instincts chapter xxiii over a fire in one of the upper sitting rooms of the pilot inn robert sat with his friend the beloved friend of whom he used to speak to dahlia and rhoda too proudly not to seem betraying the weaker point of pride this friend had accepted the title from a private soldier of his regiment to be capable of doing which a man must be both officer and gentleman in a sterner and less liberal sense than is expressed by that everlasting phrase in the mouth of the military parrot major percy waring the son of a clergyman was a working soldier a slayer if you will from pure love of the profession of arms and all the while the sweetest and gentlest of men i call him a working soldier in opposition to the parading soldier the coxcomb in uniform the hero by accident and the martial boys of wealth and station who are of the army of england he studied war when the trumpet slumbered and had no place but in the field when it sounded to him the honour of england was as a babe in his arms he hugged it like a mother he knew the military history of every regiment in the service disasters even of old date brought groans from him this enthusiastic face was singularly soft when the large dark eyes were set musing the cast of it being such sometimes in speaking of a happy play of artillery upon congregated masses an odd effect was produced ordinarily the clear features were reflective almost to sadness in the absence of animation but an exulting energy for action would now and then light them up hilarity of spirit did not belong to him he was nevertheless a cheerful talker as could be seen in the glad ear given to him by robert between them it was robert and percy robert had rescued him from drowning on the east anglian shore and the friendship which ensued was one chief reason for robert's quitting the post of trooper and buying himself out it was against percy's advice who wanted to purchase a commission for him but the humbler man had the sturdy scruples of his rank regarding money and his romantic illusions being dispersed by an experience of the absolute class distinctions in the service robert that he might prevent his friend from violating them made use of his aunt's legacy to obtain release since that date they had not met but their friendship was fast percy had recently paid a visit to queen anne's farm where he had seen rhoda and heard of robert's departure knowing robert's birthplace he had come on to warbeach and had seen jonathan eccles who referred him to mrs boulby licenced seller of brandy if he wished to enjoy an interview with robert eccles the old man sent up regularly every day to inquire how his son was faring on the road to the next world said robert laughing he's tough old english oak i'm just to him what i appear at the time it's better having him like that than one of your jerky fathers who seem to belong to the stage of a theatre everybody respects my old dad and i can laugh at what he thinks of me i've only to let him know i've served an apprenticeship in farming and can make use of some of his ideas sound every one of 'em every one of 'em sound and that i say of my own father why don't you tell him percy asked i want to forget all about kent and drown the county said robert and i'm going to as far as my memory's concerned percy waited for some seconds he comprehended perfectly this state of wilfulness in an uneducated sensitive man she has a steadfast look in her face robert she doesn't look as if she trifled i've really never seen a finer franker girl in my life if faces are to be trusted it's t' other way there's no trifling in her case she's frank she fires at you point blank you never mentioned her in your letters to me robert no i had a suspicion from the first i was going to be a fool about the girl percy struck his hand you didn't do quite right do you say that robert silenced him with this question for there was a woman in percy's antecedent history the subject being dismissed they talked more freely robert related the tale of dahlia and of his doings at fairly oh we agree he said noting a curious smile that percy could not smooth out of sight i know it was odd conduct i do respect my superiors but believe me or not percy injury done to a girl makes me mad and i can't hold back and she's the sister of the girl you saw by heaven if it weren't for my head getting blind now when my blood boils i've the mind to walk straight up to the house and screw the secret out of one of them what i say is is there a god up aloft then he sees all and society is vapour and while i feel the spirit in me to do it i go straight at my aim if at the same time there's no brandy in you said percy which would stop your seeing clear or going straight the suggestion was a cruel shock robert nodded that's true i suppose it's my bad education that won't let me keep cool i'm ashamed of myself after it i shout and thunder and the end of it is i go away and think about the same of robert eccles that i've frightened other people into thinking perhaps you'll think me to blame in this case one of those mr blancoves not the one you've heard of struck me on the field before a lady i bore it it was part of what i'd gone out to meet i was riding home late at night and he stood at the corner of the lane with an old enemy of mine and a sad cur that is sedgett's his name nic the christian part of it there'd just come a sharp snowfall from the north and the moonlight shot over the flying edge of the rear cloud and i saw sedgett with a stick in his hand but the gentleman had no stick i'll give mr edward blancove credit for not meaning to be active in a dastardly assault but why was he in consultation with my enemy and he let my enemy by the way percy you dislike that sort of talk of 'my enemy' i know you like it put plain and simple but down in these old parts again i catch at old habits and i'm always a worse man when i haven't seen you for a time sedgett say sedgett as i passed made a sweep at my horse's knees and took them a little over the fetlock the beast reared while i was holding on he swung a blow at me and took me here robert touched his head i dropped like a horse chestnut from the tree when i recovered i was lying in the lane i think i was there flat face to the ground for half an hour quite sensible looking at the pretty colour of my blood on the snow the horse was gone i just managed to reel along to this place where there's always a home for me now will you believe it possible i went out next day i saw mr edward blancove and i might have seen a baby and felt the same to it i didn't know him a bit yesterday morning your letter was sent up from sutton farm somehow the moment i'd read it i remembered his face i sent him word there was a matter to be settled between us you think i was wrong major waring had set a deliberately calculating eye on him i want to hear more he said you think i have no claim to challenge a man in his position answer me first robert you think this mr blancove helped or instigated this man sedgett in his attack upon you i haven't a doubt that he did it's not plain evidence it's good circumstantial evidence at any rate you are perhaps justified in thinking him capable of this though the rule is to believe nothing against a gentleman until it is flatly proved when we drum him out of the ranks but if you can fancy it true would you put yourself upon an equal footing with him i would said robert then you accept his code of morals that's too shrewd for me but men who preach against duelling or any kind of man to man in hot earnest always fence in that way i detest duelling major waring remarked i don't like a system that permits knaves and fools to exercise a claim to imperil the lives of useful men let me observe that i am not a preacher against it i think you know my opinions and they are not quite those of the english magistrate and other mild persons who are wrathful at the practice upon any pretence keep to the other discussion you challenge a man you admit him your equal but why do i argue with you i know your mind as well as my own you have some other idea in the background i feel that he's the guilty man said robert you feel called upon to punish him no wait he will not fight but i have him and i'll hold him i feel he's the man who has injured this girl by every witness of facts that i can bring together and as for the other young fellow i led such a dog's life down here i could beg his pardon this one's eye met mine i saw it wouldn't have stopped short of murder opportunity given why because i pressed on the right spring i'm like a woman in seeing some things he shall repent by slap me on the face percy i've taken to brandy and to swearing damn the girl who made me forget good lessons bless her heart i mean she saw you did she did she colour when she heard your name very much said major waring was dressed in black with a crimson ribbon round the collar robert waved the image from his eyes i'm not going to dream of her peace and babies and farming and pride in myself with a woman by my side there you've seen her all that's gone i might as well ask the east wind to blow west her face is set the other way of course the nature and value of a man is shown by how he takes this sort of pain and hark at me i'm yelling i thought i was cured i looked up into the eyes of a lady ten times sweeter when somewhen i've lost dates but here's the girl at me again she cuddles into me slips her hand into my breast and tugs at strings there i can't help talking to you about her now we've got over the first step i'll soon give it up she wore a red ribbon if it had been spring you'd have seen roses oh what a stanch heart that girl has where she sets it mind her life where that creature sets her heart but for me not a penny of comfort now for a whole week of her day and night in that black dress with the coloured ribbon on she goes walking to church sitting at table looking out of the window will you believe i thought those thick eyebrows of hers ugly once a tremendous long time ago yes but what eyes she has under them and if she looks tender one corner of her mouth goes quivering and the eyes are steady so that it looks like some wonderful bit of mercy i think of that true hearted creature praying and longing for her sister and fearing there's shame that's why she hates me i wouldn't say i was certain her sister had not fallen into a pit i couldn't i was an idiot i thought i wouldn't be a hypocrite i might have said i believed as she did there she stood ready to be taken ready to have given herself to me if i had only spoken a word it was a moment of heaven and god the father could not give it to me twice the chance has gone oh what a miserable mad dog i am to gabble on in this way come in come in mother mrs boulby entered with soft footsteps bearing a letter from the park she said and commenced chiding robert gently to establish her right to do it with solemnity he will talk sir he's one o' them that either they talk or they hang silent and no middle way will they take and the doctor's their foe and health they despise and since this cruel blow obstinacy do seem to have been knocked like a nail into his head so fast persuasion have not a atom o' power over him there must be talking when friends meet ma'am said major waring ah returned the widow if it wouldn't be all on one side i've done now mother said robert mrs boulby retired and robert opened the letter it ran thus sir i am glad you have done me the favour of addressing me temperately so that i am permitted to clear myself of an unjust and most unpleasant imputation i will if you please see you or your friend to whom perhaps i shall better be able to certify how unfounded is the charge you bring against me i will call upon you at the pilot inn where i hear that you are staying or if you prefer it i will attend to any appointment you may choose to direct elsewhere but it must be immediate as the term of my residence in this neighbourhood is limited i am sir yours obediently edward blancove major waning read the lines with a critical attention it seems fair and open was his remark here robert struck his breast here's what answers him what shall i do shall i tell him to come write to say that your friend will meet him at a stated place robert saw his prey escaping i'm not to see him no the decent is the right way in such cases you must leave it to me this will be the proper method between gentlemen it appears to my idea said robert that gentlemen are always somehow stopped from taking the straight ahead measure you percy rejoined are like a civilian before a fortress either he finds it so easy that he can walk into it or he gives it up in despair as unassailable you have followed your own devices and what have you accomplished he will lie to you smoothly smoothly or not if i discover that he has spoken falsely he is answerable to me to me percy no to me he can elude you and will be acquitted by the general verdict but when he becomes answerable to me his honour in the conventional which is here the practical sense is at stake and i have him i see that yes he can refuse to fight me robert sighed hey lord it's a heavy world when we come to methods but will you percy will you put it to him at the end of your fist 'did you deceive the girl and do you know where the girl now is' why great heaven we only ask to know where she is she may have been murdered she's hidden from her family let him confess and let him go major waring shook his head you see like a woman perhaps robert you certainly talk like a woman i will state your suspicions when i have done so i am bound to accept his reply if we discover it to have been false i have my remedy won't you perceive that it isn't my object to punish him by and by but to tear the secret out of him on the spot now instantly robert cried i perceive your object and you have experienced some of the results of your system it's the primitive action of an appeal to the god of combats that is exploded in these days you have no course but to take his word she said robert struck his knee she said i should have the girl's address she said she would see her she pledged that to me i'm speaking of the lady up at fairly come things get clearer if she knows where dahlia is who told her this mr algernon not edward blancove was seen with dahlia in a box at the playhouse he was there with dahlia yet i don't think him the guilty man there's a finger of light upon that other who is this lady major waring asked with lifted eyebrows mrs lovell at the name major waring sat stricken lovell he repeated under his breath lovell was she ever in india i don't know indeed is she a widow ay that i've heard describe her robert entered upon the task with a dozen headlong exclamations and very justly concluded by saying that he could give no idea of her but his friend apparently had gleaned sufficient major waring's face was touched by a strange pallor and his smile had vanished he ran his fingers through his hair clutching it in a knot as he sat eyeing the red chasm in the fire where the light of old days and wild memories hangs as in a crumbling world robert was aware of there being a sadness in percy's life and that he had loved a woman and awakened from his passion her name was unknown to him in that matter his natural delicacy and his deference to percy had always checked him from sounding the subject closely he might be as he had said keen as a woman where his own instincts were in action but they were ineffective in guessing at the cause for percy's sudden depression she said this lady mrs lovell whoever she may be she said you should have the girl's address gave you that pledge of her word percy spoke half meditating how did this happen when did you see her robert related the incident of his meeting with her and her effort to be a peacemaker but made no allusion to mrs boulby's tale of the bet a peacemaker percy interjected she rides well best horsewoman i ever saw in my life was robert's ready answer major waring brushed at his forehead as in impatience of thought you must write two letters one to this mrs lovell say you are about to leave the place and remind her of her promise it's incomprehensible but never mind write that first then to the man say that your friend by the way this mrs lovell has small hands has she i mean peculiarly small did you notice or not i may know her never mind write to the man say don't write down my name say that i will meet him percy spoke on as in a dream appoint any place and hour to morrow at ten down by the river the bridge write briefly thank him for his offer to afford you explanations don't argue it with me any more write both the letters straight off his back was to robert as he uttered the injunction robert took pen and paper and did as he was bidden with all the punctilious obedience of a man who consents perforce to see a better scheme abandoned one effect of the equality existing between these two of diverse rank in life and perfect delicacy of heart was that the moment percy assumed the lead robert never disputed it muttering simply that he was incapable of writing except when he was in a passion he managed to produce what in percy's eyes were satisfactory epistles though robert had horrible misgivings in regard to his letter to mrs lovell the wording of it the cast of the sentences even down to the character of the handwriting these missives were despatched immediately you are sure she said that major waring inquired more than once during the afternoon and robert assured him that mrs lovell had given him her word he grew very positive and put it on his honour that she had said it you may have heard incorrectly i've got the words burning inside me said robert they walked together before dark to sutton farm but jonathan eccles was abroad in his fields and their welcome was from mistress anne whom major waring had not power to melt the moment he began speaking praise of robert she closed her mouth tight and crossed her wrists meekly i see said major waring as they left the farm your aunt is of the godly who have no forgiveness i'm afraid so cried robert cold blood never will come to an understanding with hot blood and the old lady's is like frozen milk she's right in her way i dare say i don't blame her her piety's right enough take it as you find it mrs boulby had a sagacious notion that gentlemen always dined well every day of their lives and claimed that much from providence as their due she had exerted herself to spread a neat little repast for major waring and waited on the friends herself grieving considerably to observe that the major failed in his duty as a gentleman as far as the relish of eating was concerned but she said below at her bar he smokes the beautifullest smelling cigars and drinks coffee made in his own way he's very particular which was reckoned to be in major waring's favour the hour was near midnight when she came into the room bearing another letter from the park she thumped it on the table ruffling and making that pretence at the controlling of her bosom which precedes a feminine storm her indignation was caused by a communication delivered by dick curtis in the parlour underneath to the effect that nicodemus sedgett was not to be heard of in the neighbourhood robert laughed at her and called her hebrew woman eye for eye and tooth for tooth woman leave real rascals to the lord above mother he's safe to punish them they've stepped outside the chances that's my idea i wouldn't go out of my way to kick them not i it's the half and half villains we've got to dispose of they're the mischief old lady percy however asked some questions about sedgett and seemed to think his disappearance singular he had been examining the handwriting of the superscription to the letter his face was flushed as he tossed it for robert to open mrs boulby dropped her departing curtsey and robert read out with odd pauses and puzzled emphasis mrs lovell has received the letter which mr robert eccles has addressed to her and regrets that a misconception should have arisen from anything that was uttered during their interview the allusions are obscure and mrs lovell can only remark that she is pained if she at all misled mr eccles in what she either spoke or promised she is not aware that she can be of any service to him should such an occasion present itself mr eccles may rest assured that she will not fail to avail herself of it and do her utmost to redeem a pledge to which he has apparently attached a meaning she can in no way account for or comprehend when robert had finished it's like a female lawyer he said that woman speaking and that woman writing they're two different creatures upon my soul they are quick sharp to the point when she speaks and read this can i venture to say of a lady she's a liar perhaps you had better not said major waring who took the letter in his hand and seemed to study it after which he transferred it to his pocket to morrow to morrow's sunday he observed we will go to church to morrow his eyes glittered why i'm hardly in the mood robert protested i haven't had the habit latterly keep up the habit said percy it's a good thing for men like you but what sort of a fellow am i to be showing myself there among all the people who've been talking about me and the people up at fairly robert burst out in horror of the prospect i shall be a sight among the people percy upon my honour i don't think i well can i'll read the bible at home if you like no you'll do penance said major waring are you meaning it the penance will be ten times greater on my part believe me robert fancied him to be referring to some idea of mocking the interposition of religion then we'll go to upton church he said i don't mind it at upton i intend to go to the church attended by 'the family' as we say in our parts and you must come with me to warbeach clasping one hand across his forehead robert cried you couldn't ask me to do a thing i hate so much go and sit and look sheepish and sing hymns with the people i've been badgering and everybody seeing me how can it be anything to you like what it is to me you have only to take my word for it that it is and far more said major waring sinking his voice come it won't do you any harm to make an appointment to meet your conscience now and then you will never be ruled by reason and your feelings have to teach you what you learn at any rate it's my request this terminated the colloquy upon that topic robert looked forward to a penitential sabbath day she is a widow still thought major waring as he stood alone in his bed room and drawing aside the curtains of his window looked up at the white moon chapter xxiv when the sun takes to shining in winter and the southwest to blowing the corners of the earth cannot hide from him the mornings are like halls full of light robert had spent his hopes upon a wet day that would have kept the congregation sparse and the guests at fairly absent from public devotions he perceived at once that he was doomed to be under everybody's eyes when he walked down the aisle for everybody would attend the service on such a morning as this already he had met his conscience in so far as that he shunned asking percy again what was the reason for their going to church and he had not the courage to petition to go in the afternoon instead of the morning the question are you ashamed of yourself then sang in his ears as a retort ready made there was no help for it so he set about assisting his ingenuity to make the best appearance possible brushing his hat and coat with extraordinary care percy got him to point out the spot designated for the meeting and telling him to wait in the warbeach churchyard or within sight of it strolled off in the direction of the river his simple neatness and quiet gentlemanly air abashed robert and lured him from his intense conception of abstract right and wrong which had hitherto encouraged and incited him so that he became more than ever crestfallen at the prospect of meeting the eyes of the church people and with the trembling sensitiveness of a woman who weighs the merits of a lover when passion is having one of its fatal pauses he looked at himself and compared himself with the class of persons he had outraged and tried to think better of himself and to justify himself and sturdily reject comparisons they would not be beaten back his enemies had never suggested them but they were forced on him by the aspect of his friend any man who takes the law into his own hands and chooses to stand against what is conventionally deemed fitting against the world as we say is open to these moods of degrading humility robert waited for the sound of the bells with the emotions of a common culprit could he have been driven to the church and deposited suddenly in his pew his mind would have been easier it was the walking there the walking down the aisle the sense of his being the fellow who had matched himself against those well attired gentlemen which entirely confused him and not exactly for his own sake for percy's partly he sickened at the thought of being seen by major waring's side his best suit and his hat were good enough as far as they went only he did not feel that he wore them he could not divine how it was with a proper air an air of signal comfort in fact the graceful negligence of an english gentleman's manner had been unexpectedly revealed to him and it was strange he reflected that percy never appeared to observe how deficient he was and could still treat him as an equal call him by his christian name and not object to be seen with him in public robert did not think at the same time that illness had impoverished his blood your sensational beings must keep a strong and a good flow of blood in their veins to be always on a level with the occasion which they provoke he remembered wonderingly that he had used to be easy in gait and ready of wit when walking from queen anne's farm to wrexby village church why was he a different creature now he could not answer the question two or three of his warbeach acquaintances passed him in the lanes they gave him good day and spoke kindly and with pleasant friendly looks their impression when they left him was that he was growing proud the jolly butcher of warbeach who had a hearty affection for him insisted upon clapping his hand and showing him to mrs billing and showing their two young ones to robert with a kiss to the children and a nod robert let them pass here and there he was hailed by young fellows who wore their hats on one side and jaunty fashioned coats sunday being their own bright day of exhibition he took no notice of the greetings he tried to feel an interest in the robins and twittering wrens and called to mind verses about little birds and kept repeating them behind a face that chilled every friendly man who knew him moody the boat builder asked him with a stare if he was going to church and on robert's replying that perhaps he was said i'm dashed and it was especially discouraging to one in robert's condition further to inspirit him he met jonathan eccles who put the same question to him and getting the same answer turned sharp round and walked homeward robert had a great feeling of relief when the bells were silent and sauntered with a superior composure round the holly and laurel bushes concealing the church not once did he ponder on the meeting between major waring and mr edward blancove until he beheld the former standing alone by the churchyard gate and then he thought more of the empty churchyard and the absence of carriages proclaiming the dreadful admonition that he must immediately consider as to the best way of comporting himself before an observant and censorious congregation major waring remarked you are late have i kept you waiting said robert not long they are reading the lessons is it full inside i dare say it is you have seen him i suppose oh yes i have seen him percy was short in his speech and pale as robert had never seen him before he requested hastily to be told the situation of lord elling's pew don't you think of going into the gallery said robert but received no answer and with an inward moan of good god they'll think i've come here in a sort of repentance he found himself walking down the aisle and presently to his amazement settled in front of the fairly pew and with his eyes on mrs lovell what was the matter with her was she ill robert forgot his own tribulation in an instant her face was like marble and as she stood with the prayer book in her hand her head swayed over it her lips made a faint effort at smiling and she sat quietly down and was concealed algernon and sir john capes were in the pew beside her as well as lady elling who with a backward turned hand and disregarding countenance reached out her smelling bottle is this because she fancies i know of her having made a bet of me thought robert and it was not his vanity prompted the supposition though his vanity was awakened by it or is she ashamed of her falsehood he thought again and forgave her at the sight of her sweet pale face the singing of the hymns made her evident suffering seem holy as a martyr's he scarce had the power to conduct himself reverently so intense was his longing to show her his sympathy that is mrs lovell did you see her just now he whispered ah said major waring i'm afraid she has fainted possibly but mrs lovell had not fainted she rose when the time for rising came again and fixing her eyes with a grave devotional collectedness upon the vicar at his reading desk looked quite mistress of herself but mistress of herself only when she kept them so fixed when they moved it was as if they had relinquished some pillar of support and they wavered livid shades chased her face like the rain clouds on a grey lake water some one fronting her weighed on her eyelids this was evident robert thought her a miracle of beauty she was in colour like days he had noted thoughtfully days with purple storm and with golden horizon edges she had on a bonnet of black velvet with a delicate array of white lace that was not suffered to disturb the contrast to her warm yellow hair her little gloved hands were both holding the book at times she perused it or the oppression becoming unendurable turned her gaze toward the corner of the chancel and thence once more to her book robert rejected all idea of his being in any way the cause of her strange perturbation he cast a glance at his friend he had begun to nourish a slight suspicion but it was too slight to bear up against percy's self possession for as he understood the story percy had been the sufferer and the lady had escaped without a wound how then if such were the case would she be showing emotion thus deep while he stood before her with perfect self command robert believed that if he might look upon that adorable face for many days together he could thrust rhoda's from his memory the sermon was not long enough for him and he was angry with percy for rising before there was any movement for departure in the fairly pew in the doorway of the church percy took his arm and asked him to point out the family tombstone they stood by it when lady elling and mrs lovell came forth and walked to the carriage receiving respectful salutes from the people of warbeach how lovely she is said robert do you think her handsome said major waring i can't understand such a creature dying robert stepped over an open grave the expression of percy's eyes was bitter i should imagine she thinks it just as impossible the warbeach villagers waited for lady elling's carriage to roll away and with a last glance at robert they too went off in gossiping groups robert's penance was over and he could not refrain from asking what good his coming to church had done i can't assist you said percy by the way mr blancove denies everything he thinks you mad he promises now that you have adopted reasonable measures to speak to his cousin and help as far as he can to discover the address you are in search of that's all cried robert that is all then where am i a bit farther than when i began you are only at the head of another road and a better one oh why do i ever give up trusting to my right hand robert muttered but the evening brought a note to him from algernon blancove it contained a dignified condemnation of robert's previous insane behaviour and closed by giving dahlia's address in london how on earth was this brought about robert now questioned it's singular is it not said major blaring but if you want a dog to follow you you don't pull it by the collar and if you want a potato from the earth you plant the potato before you begin digging you are a soldier by instinct my good robert your first appeal is to force i you see am a civilian i invariably try the milder methods do you start for london tonight i remain i wish to look at the neighbourhood robert postponed his journey to the morrow partly in dread of his approaching interview with dahlia but chiefly to continue a little longer by the side of him whose gracious friendship gladdened his life they paid a second visit to sutton farm robert doggedly refused to let a word be said to his father about his having taken to farming and jonathan listened to all major waring said of his son like a man deferential to the accomplishment of speaking but too far off to hear more than a chance word he talked in reply quite cheerfully of the weather and the state of the ground observed that the soil was a perpetual study but he knew something of horses and dogs and yorkshiremen were like jews in the trouble they took to over reach in a bargain walloping men is poor work if you come to compare it with walloping nature he said and explained that according to his opinion to best a man at buying and selling was as wholesome an occupation as frowzlin' along the gutters for parings and strays he himself preferred to go to the heart of things nature makes you rich if your object is to do the same for her yorkshire fellows never think except of making theirselves rich by fattening on your blood like sheep ticks in fine jonathan spoke sensibly and abused yorkshire without hesitating to confess that a certain yorkshireman against whom he had matched his wits in a purchase of horseflesh had given him a lively recollection of the encounter percy asked him what he thought of his country i'll tell you said jonathan englishmen's business is to go to war with the elements and so long as we fight them we're in the right academy for learnin' how the game goes our vulnerability commences when we think we'll sit down and eat the fruits and if i don't see signs o' that set me mole tunnelling self indulgence is the ruin of our time this was the closest remark he made to his relations with robert who informed him that he was going to london on the following day jonathan shook his hand heartily without troubling himself about any inquiries there's so much of that old man in me said robert when percy praised him on their return that i daren't call him a prince of an old boy and never a spot of rancour in his soul have a claim on him and there's your seat at his table take and offend him there's your seat still eat and drink but you don't get near his heart i'll surprise him some day he fancies he's past surprises well said percy you're younger than i am and may think the future belongs to you early next morning they parted robert was in town by noon he lost no time in hurrying to the western suburb as he neared the house where he was to believe dahlia to be residing he saw a man pass through the leafless black shrubs by the iron gate and when he came to the gate himself the man was at the door the door opened and closed on this man it was nicodemus sedgett or robert's eyes did him traitorous service he knocked at the door violently and had to knock a second and a third time dahlia was denied to him he was told that mrs ayrton had lived there but had left and her present address was unknown he asked to be allowed to speak a word to the man who had just entered the house no one had entered for the last two hours was the reply robert had an impulse to rush by the stolid little female liar but percy's recent lesson to him acted as a restraint though had it been a brawny woman or a lacquey in his path he would certainly have followed his natural counsel he turned away lingering outside till it was dusk and the bruise on his head gave great throbs and then he footed desolately farther and farther from the house to combat with evil in his own country village had seemed a simple thing enough but it appeared a superhuman task in giant london chapter xxv it requires happily many years of an ordinary man's life to teach him to believe in the exceeding variety and quantity of things money can buy yet when ingenuous minds have fully comprehended the potent character of the metal they are likely enough to suppose that it will buy everything after which comes the groaning anxiety to possess it this stage of experience is a sublime development in the great souls of misers it is their awakening moment and it is their first real sense of a harvest being in their hands they have begun under the influence of the passion for hoarding which is but a blind passion of the finger ends the idea that they have got together bit by bit a power travels slowly up to their heavy brains once let it be grasped however and they clutch a god they feed on everybody's hunger for it and let us confess they have in that a mighty feast anthony hackbut was not a miser he was merely a saving old man his vanity was to be thought a miser envied as a miser he lived in daily hearing of the sweet chink of gold and loved the sound but with a poetical love rather than with the sordid desire to amass gold pieces though a saving old man he had his comforts and if they haunted him and reproached him subsequently for indulging wayward appetites for herrings and whelks and other sea dainties that render up no account to you when they have disappeared he put by copper and silver continually weekly and monthly and was master of a sum he knew the breadth of this sum with accuracy and what it would expand to this day come a year and probably this day come five years he knew it only too well the sum took no grand leaps it increased but did not seem to multiply and he was breathing in the heart of the place of all places in the world where money did multiply he was the possessor of twelve hundred pounds solid and in haven that is the greater part in the bank of england and a portion in boyne's bank he had besides a few skirmishing securities and some such bits of paper as algernon had given him in the public house on that remarkable night of his visit to the theatre these when the borrowers were defaulters in their payments and pleaded for an extension of time inspired him with sentiments of grandeur that the solid property could not impart nevertheless the anti poetical tendency within him which warred with the poetical and set him reducing whatsoever he claimed to plain figures made it but a fitful hour of satisfaction he had only to fix his mind upon farmer fleming's conception of his wealth to feel the miserable smallness of what seemed legitimately his own and he felt it with so poignant an emotion that at times his fears of death were excited by the knowledge of a dead man's impotence to suggest hazy margins in the final exposure of his property there it would lie dead as himself contracted coffined contemptible what would the farmer think when he came to hear that his brother tony's estate was not able to buy up queen anne's farm when in point of fact he found that he had all along been the richer man of the two anthony's comfort was in the unfaltering strength of his constitution he permitted his estimate of it to hint at the probability of his outlasting his brother william john to whom he wished no earthly ill but only that he should not live with a mitigated veneration for him he was really nourished by the farmer's gluttonous delight in his supposed piles of wealth sometimes for weeks he had the gift of thinking himself one of the bank with which he had been so long connected and afterward a wretched reaction set in it was then that his touch upon bank money began to intoxicate him strangely he had at times thousands hugged against his bosom and his heart swelled to the money bags immense he was a dispirited but a grateful creature after he had delivered them up the delirium came by fits as if a devil lurked to surprise him with this money said the demon you might speculate and in two days make ten times the amount to which anthony answered my character's worth fifty times the amount such was his reply but he did not think it he was honest and his honesty had become a habit but the money was the only thing which acted on his imagination his character had attained to no sacred halo and was just worth his annual income and the respect of the law for his person the money fired his brain ah if it was mine he sighed if i could call it mine for just forty or fifty hours but it ain't and i can't he fought dogged battles with the tempter and beat him off again and again one day he made a truce with him by saying that if ever the farmer should be in town of an afternoon he would steal ten minutes or so and make an appointment with him somewhere and show him the money bags without a word let him weigh and eye them and then the plan was for anthony to talk of politics while the farmer's mind was in a ferment with this arrangement the infernal power appeared to be content and anthony was temporarily relieved of his trouble in other words the intermittent fever of a sort of harmless rascality was afflicting this old creature he never entertained the notion of running clear away with the money entrusted to him whither could an aged man fly he thought of foreign places as of spots that gave him a shivering sense of its being necessary for him to be born again in nakedness and helplessness if ever he was to see them and set foot on them london was his home and clothed him about warmly and honourably and so he said to the demon in their next colloquy anthony had become guilty of the imprudence of admitting him to conferences and arguing with him upon equal terms they tell us that this is the imprudence of women under temptation and perhaps anthony was pushed to the verge of the abyss from causes somewhat similar to those which imperil them and employed the same kind of efforts in his resistance in consequence of this compromise the demon by degrees took seat at his breakfast table when mrs wicklow his landlady could hear anthony talking in the tone of voice of one who was pushed to his sturdiest arguments she conceived that the old man's head was softening he was making one of his hurried rushes with the porterage of money on an afternoon in spring when a young female plucked at his coat and his wrath at offenders against the law kindled in a minute into fury hands off minx he cried you shall be given in charge where's a policeman uncle she said you precious swindler in petticoats anthony fumed but he had a queer recollection of her face and when she repeated piteously uncle he peered at her features saying no in wonderment several times her hair was cut like a boy's she was in common garments with a close shaped skull cap and a black straw bonnet on her head not gloved of ill complexion and with deep dark lines slanting down from the corners of her eyes yet the inspection convinced him that he beheld dahlia his remembering the niece he was amazed but speedily priceless trust in his arms and the wickedness of the streets he bade her follow him she did so with some difficulty for he ran and dodged and treated the world as his enemy suddenly vanished and appeared again breathing freely why my girl he said why dahl mrs what's your name why who'd have known you is that he got his eyes close to her hair is that the ladies' fashion now 'cause if it is our young street scamps has only got to buy bonnets and i say you don't look the pomp not as you used to miss ma'am i mean no that you don't well what's the news how's your husband uncle said dahlia will you please let me speak to you somewhere ain't we standing together oh pray out of the crowd come home with me if my lodgings ain't too poor for you said anthony uncle i can't i have been unwell i cannot walk far will you take me to some quiet place will you treat me to a cab anthony sneered vehemently i have left off riding uncle what hulloa anthony sang out cash is down in the mouth at home is it tell me that now dahlia dropped her eyelids and then entreated him once more to conduct her to a quiet place where they might sit together away from noise she was very earnest and very sad not seeming to have much strength do you mind taking my arm said anthony she leaned her hand on his arm and he dived across the road with her among omnibuses and cabs shouting to them through the roar we're the independence on two legs warranted sound and no competition and saying to dahlia lor' bless you there's no retort in 'em or i'd say something worth hearing it's like poking lions in cages with raw meat afore you get a chaffing match out o' them some of 'em know me they'd be good at it those fellows i've heard of good things said by 'em but there they sit and they've got no circulation ain't ready except at old women or when they catch you in a mess and getting the worst of it let me tell you you'll never get manly chaff out of big bundles o' fellows with ne'er an atom o' circulation the river's the place for that i've heard uncommon good things on the river not of 'em but heard 'em t' other's most part invention and they tell me horseback's a prime thing for chaff circulation again sharp and lively i mean not bawl and answer over your back most part impudence and nothing else and then out of hearing that sort o' chaff's cowardly boys are stiff young parties circulation and i don't tackle them pretty often 'xcept when i'm going like a ball among nine pins it's all a matter o' circulation i say my dear anthony addressed her seriously you should never lay hold o' my arm when you see me going my pace of an afternoon i took you for a thief and worse i did that i did had you been waiting to see me a little dahlia replied breathless you have been ill a little she said you've written to the farm o' course you have oh uncle wait moaned dahlia but ha' you been sick and not written home wait please wait she entreated him i'll wait said anthony but that's no improvement to queerness and 'queer''s your motto now we cross london bridge there's the tower that lived in times when no man was safe of keeping his own money 'cause of grasping kings all claws and crown i'm republican as far as 'none o' them' goes there's the ships the sun rises behind 'em and sets afore 'em and you may fancy if you like there's always gold in their rigging gals o' your sort think i say come tell me if you are a lady no uncle no dahlia cried and then drawing in her breath added not to you last time i crossed this bridge with a young woman hanging on my arm it was your sister they say she called on you and you wouldn't see her and a gal so good and a gal so true ain't to be got for a sister every day in the year what are you pulling me for dahlia said nothing but clung to him with a drooping head and so they hurried along until anthony stopped in front of a shop displaying cups and muffins at the window and leprous looking strips of bacon and sausages that had angled for appetites till they had become pallid sodden things like washed out bait into this shop he led her and they took possession of a compartment and ordered tea and muffins the shop was empty it's one of the expenses of relationship anthony sighed after probing dahlia unsatisfactorily to see whether she intended to pay for both or at least for herself and finding that she had no pride at all my sister marries your father and in consequence well a muffin now and then ain't so very much we'll forget it though it is a breach mind in counting up afterwards and two pences every day's equal to a good big cannonball in the castle wall at the end of the year have you written home dahlia's face showed the bright anguish of unshed tears uncle oh speak low i have been near death i have been ill for so long a time i have come to you to hear about them my father and rhoda tell me what they are doing and do they sleep and eat well and are not in trouble i could not write i was helpless i could not hold a pen be kind dear uncle and do not reproach me please tell me that they have not been sorrowful a keenness shot from anthony's eyes then where's your husband he asked she made a sad attempt at smiling he is abroad how about his relations ain't there one among 'em to write for you when you're ill he yes he has relatives i could not ask them oh i am not strong uncle if you will only leave following me so with questions but tell me tell me what i want to know well then you tell me where your husband banks returned anthony indeed i cannot say do you anthony stretched out alternative fingers do you get money from him to make payments in gold or do you get it in paper she stared as in terror of a pit fall paper she said at a venture well then name your bank there was no cunning in her eye as she answered i don't know any bank except the bank of england why the deuce didn't you say so at once eh cried anthony he gives you bank notes nothing better in the world and he a'n't been givin' you many lately is that it what's his profession or business he ishe is no profession then what is he is he a gentleman yes she breathed plaintively your husband's a gentleman eh and lost his money yes how did he lose it the poor victim of this pertinacious interrogatory now beat about within herself for succour i must not say she replied you're going to try to keep a secret are ye said anthony and she in her relief at the pause to her torment said i am with a little infantile withering half smile well you've been and kept yourself pretty secret the old man pursued i suppose your husband's proud he's proud ain't he he's of a family i'll be bound is he of a family how did he like your dressing up like a mill'ner gal to come down in the city and see me dahlia's guile was not ready he didn't mind she said he didn't mind didn't he he don't mind your cutting of your hair so didn't mind that she shook her head no anthony was down upon her like a hawk why he's abroad yes i mean he did not see me with which in a minute she was out of his grasp but her heart beat thick her lips were dry and her thoughts were in disorder then he don't know you've been and got shaved and a poll like a turnip head of a thief that's something for him to learn is it the picture of her beauty gone seared her eyes like heated brass she caught anthony's arm with one firm hand to hold him silent and with the other hand covered her sight and let the fit of weeping pass when the tears had spent themselves she relinquished her hold of the astonished old man who leaned over the table to her and dominated by the spirit of her touch whispered like one who had accepted a bond of secresy th' old farmer's well so's rhoda my darkie lass they've taken on a bit and then they took to religion for comfort th' old farmer attends methody meetin's and quotes scriptur' as if he was fixed like a pump to the book and couldn't fetch a breath without quotin' rhoda's oftenest along with your rector's wife down there and does works o' charity sicknussin' readin' old farmer does the preachin' old mother sumfit's fat as ever and says her money's for you old gammon goes on eatin' of the dumplins hey what a queer old ancient he is he seems to me to belong to a time afore ever money was that mr robert's offnever been down there since he left 'cause my darkie lass thought herself too good for him so she is too good for anybody they're going to leave the farm sell and come to london oh no exclaimed dahlia not going to leave the dear old farm and our lane and the old oaks leading up to the heath are they father will miss it rhoda will mourn so no place will ever be like that to them i love it better than any place on earth that's queer said anthony why do you refuse to go or won't let your husband take you down there if you like the place that raving like but 'queer''s your motto the truth is this you just listen hear me hush i won't speak in a bawl you're a reasonable being and you don't that's to say you do understand the old farmer feels it uncomfortable but i never helped him when i was there said dahlia suddenly shrinking in a perceptible tremble of acute divination i was no use i never helped him not at all i was no no use anthony blinked his eyes not knowing how it was that he had thus been thrown out of his direct road he began again in his circumlocutory delicacy never mind help or no help what th' old farmer feels is and quite nat'ral there's sensations as a father and sensations as a man and what th' old farmer feels is but rhoda has always been more to father than i have dahlia cried now stretching forward with desperate courage to confront her uncle distract his speech and avert the saying of the horrible thing she dreaded rhoda was everything to him mother perhaps took to me my mother the line of her long underlie drawn sharp to check her tears stopped her speaking all very well about rhoda said anthony she's everything to me too every everybody loves her dahlia took him up let 'em so long as they don't do no harm to her was anthony's remark there was an idea in this that he had said and the light of it led off his fancy it was some time before he returned to the attack neighbours gossip a good deal o' course you know that i never listen to them said dahlia who now felt bare at any instant for the stab she saw coming no not in london but country's different and a man hearing of his child 'it's very odd' and 'keepin' away like that' and 'what's become of her' and that sort of thing he gets upset dahlia swallowed in her throat as in perfect quietude of spirit and pretended to see no meaning for herself in anthony's words but she said inadvertently dear father and it gave anthony his opening there it is no doubt you're fond of him you're fond o' th' old farmer who's your father then why not make a entry into the village and show 'em i loves my father says you i can or i can't bring my husband you seems to say but i'm come to see my old father will you go down to morrow wi' me oh dahlia recoiled and abandoned all defence in a moan i can't i can't there said anthony you can't you confess you can't and there's reason for what's in your father's mind and he hearin' neighbours' gossip and it comes to him by a sort of extractin' 'where's her husband' bein' the question and 'she ain't got one' the answer it's nat'ral for him to leave the place i never can tell him how you went off or who's the man lucky or not you went off sudden on a morning after kissin' me at breakfast and no more dahly visible and he suspects he more'n suspects farm's up for sale th' old farmer thinks it's unbrotherly of me not to go and buy and i can't make him see i don't understand land it's about like changeing sovereigns for lumps o' clay in my notions and that ain't my taste long and the short is people down there at wrexby and all round say you ain't married he ain't got a answer for 'em it's cruel to hear and crueller to think he's got no answer poor old farmer and he's obliged to go inter exile farm's up for sale anthony thumped with his foot conclusively say i'm not married said dahlia and a bad colour flushed her countenance they say i'm not married i am i am it's false it's cruel of father to listen to them wicked people base base people i am married uncle tell father so and don't let him sell the farm tell him i said i was married i am i'm respected i have only a little trouble and i'm sure others have too we all have tell father not to leave it breaks my heart oh uncle tell him that from me dahlia gathered her shawl close and set an irresolute hand upon her bonnet strings that moved as if it had forgotten its purpose she could say no more she could only watch her uncle's face to mark the effect of what she had said anthony nodded at vacancy his eyebrows were up and did not descend from their elevation you see your father wants assurances he wants facts they're easy to give if give 'em you can ah there's a weddin' ring on your finger sure enough plain gold and lord how bony your fingers ha' got dahly if you are a sinner you're a bony one now and that don't seem so bad to me i don't accuse you my dear perhaps i'd like to see your husband's banker's book but what your father hears is you've gone wrong dahlia smiled in a consummate simulation of scorn and your father thinks that's true she smiled with an equal simulation of saddest pity and he says this 'proof' he says 'proof's what i want that she's an honest woman' he asks for you to clear yourself he says 'it's hard for an old man' these are his words 'it's hard for an old man to hear his daughter called' anthony smacked his hand tight on his open mouth he was guiltless of any intended cruelty and dahlia's first impulse when she had got her breath was to soothe him she took his hand dear father poor father dear dear father she kept saying rhoda don't think it anthony assured her no and dahlia's bosom exulted up to higher pain rhoda declares you are married to hear that gal fight for you there's ne'er a one in wrexby dares so much as hint a word within a mile of her my rhoda my sister dahlia gasped and the tears came pouring down her face in vain anthony lifted her tea cup and the muffin plate to her for consolation his hushings and soothings were louder than her weeping incapable of resisting such a protest of innocence he said and i don't think it neither she pressed his fingers and begged him to pay the people of the shop at which sign of her being probably moneyless anthony could not help mumbling though i can't make out about your husband and why he lets ye be cropped that he can't help may be but lets ye go about dressed like a mill'ner gal and not afford cabs is he very poor she bowed her head poor he is very poor is he or ain't he a gentleman dahlia seemed torn by a new anguish i see said anthony he goes and persuades you he is and you've been and found out he's nothin' o' the sort eh that'd be a way of accounting for your queerness more or less was it that fellow that wicklow gal saw ye with dahlia signified vehemently no then i've guessed right he turns out not to be a gentleman eh dahly go on noddin' if ye like never mind the shop people we're well conducted and that's all they care for i say dahly he ain't a gentleman you speak out or nod your head you thought you'd caught a gentleman and 'taint the case gentlemen ain't caught so easy they all of 'em goes to school and that makes 'em knowin' come he ain't a gentleman dahlia's voice issued from a terrible inward conflict like a voice of the tombs no she said then will you show him to me let me have a look at him pushed from misery to misery she struggled within herself again and again in the same hollow manner said yes you will yes seein's believin' if you'll show him to me or me to him oh don't talk of it dahlia struck her fingers in a tight lock i only want to set eye on him my gal whereabouts does he live down down a great very great way in the west anthony stared she replied to the look in the west of london a long way down that's where he is yes i thought hum went the old man suspiciously when am i to see him some day yes some day didn't i say sunday next sunday dahlia gave a muffled cry yes next sunday day after to morrow and i'll write off to morrow and ease th' old farmer's heart and rhoda 'll be proud for you she don't care about gentleman or no gentleman more do th' old farmer it's let us live and die respectable and not disgrace father nor mother old fashioned's best fashioned about them things i think come you bring him your husband to me on sunday if you object to my callin' on you make up your mind to not next sunday the sunday after dahlia pleaded he is not here now where is he anthony asked he's in the country anthony pounced on her as he had done previously you said to me he was abroad in the country abroad not not in the great cities i could not make known your wishes to him she gave this cool explanation with her eyelids fluttering timorously and rose as she uttered it but with faint and ill supporting limbs for during the past hour she had gone through the sharpest trial of her life and had decided for the course of her life anthony was witless thereof and was mystified by his incapability of perceiving where and how he had been deluded but he had eaten all the muffin on the plate and her rising proclaimed that she had no intention of making him call for another which was satisfactory he drank off her cup of tea at a gulp the waitress named the sum he was to pay and receiving a meditative look in return for her air of expectancy after the amount had been laid on the table at once accelerated their passage from the shop by opening the door if ever i did give pennies i'd give 'em to you said anthony when he was out of her hearing women beat men in guessing at a man by his face says she you're honourable you're legal but prodigal ain't your portion that's what she says without the words unless she's a reader now then dahly my lass you take my arm buckle to we'll to the west don't th' old farmer pronounce like 'toe' the west we'll 'toe' the west i can afford to laugh at them big houses up there where's the foundation if one of them's sound why in the city i'll take you by our governor's house you know you know don't ye dahly know we been suspecting his nephew 'cause we saw him with you at the theatre i didn't suspect i knew he found you there by chance somehow and i noticed your dress there no wonder your husband's poor he wanted to make you cut a figure as one of the handsomes and that's as ruinous as cabs ha ha anthony laughed but did not reveal what had struck him sir william blancove's house is a first rater i've been in it he lives in the library all the other rooms enter 'em and if 'taint like a sort of a social sepulchre dashed if he can get his son to live with him though they're friends and his son'll get all the money and go into parliament and cut a shine never fear by the way i've seen robert too he called on me at the bank asked after you 'seen her' says he 'no' i says 'ever see mr edward blancove here' he says i told him i'd heard say mr edward was continentalling and then robert goes off his opinion is you ain't in england 'cause a policeman he spoke to can't find you nowhere 'come says i 'let's keep our detectives to catch thieves and not go distracting of 'em about a parcel o' women' he's awfully down about rhoda she might do worse than take him i don't think he's got a ounce of a chance now religion's set in though he's the mildest big 'un i ever come across i forgot to haul him over about what he 'd got to say about mr edward i did remark i thought ain't i right mr algernon's not the man eh how come you in the theatre with him dahlia spoke huskily he saw me he had seen me at home it was an accident exactly how i put it to robert and he agreed with me there's sense in that young man your husband wouldn't let you come to us there eh because hewhy was that dahlia had it on her lips to say it because he was poorer than i thought but in the intensity of her torment the wretchedness of this lie revolted her oh for god's sake uncle give me peace about that the old man murmured ay ay and thought it natural that she should shun an allusion to the circumstance they crossed one of the bridges and dahlia stopped and said kiss me uncle i ain't ashamed said anthony this being over she insisted on his not accompanying her farther anthony made her pledge her word of honour as a married woman to bring her husband to the identical spot where they stood at three o'clock in the afternoon of sunday week she promised it i'll write home to th' old farmer a penny said anthony showing that he had considered the outlay and was prepared for it and uncle she stipulated in turn they are not to see me yet very soon but not yet be true to me and come alone or it will be your fault i shall not appear now mind and beg them not to leave the farm it will kill father can you not she said in the faded sweetness of her speech could you not buy it and let father be your tenant uncle he would pay you regularly anthony turned a rough shoulder on her good bye dahly you be a good girl and all 'll go right old farmer talks about praying if he didn't make it look so dark to a chap i'd be ready to fancy something in that you try it you try dahly say a bit of a prayer to night i pray every night dahlia answered her look of meek despair was hauntingly sad with anthony on his way home he tracked her sorrowfulness to the want of money and another of his terrific vague struggles with the money demon set in chapter xxvi sir william blancove did business at his bank till the hour of three in the afternoon when his carriage conveyed him to a mews near the park of fashion where he mounted horse and obeyed the bidding of his doctor for a space by cantering in a pleasant portly cock horsey style up and down the row it was the day of the great race on epsom downs and elderly gentlemen pricked by the doctors were in the ascendant in all london congregations on horseback like achilles if the bilious shade will permit the impudent comparison they dragged their enemy gout at their horses' heels for a term and vengeance being accomplished went to their dinners and revived him sir william was disturbed by his son's absence from england a youth to whom a baronetcy and wealth are to be bequeathed is an important organism and sir william though his faith reposed in his son was averse to his inexplicably prolonged residence in the french metropolis which a school for many things is not a school for the study of our parliamentary system and still less for that connubial career sir william wished him to commence edward's delightful cynical wit the worldly man's profundity and his apt quotations of the wit of others would have continued to exercise their charm if sir william had not wanted to have him on the spot that he might answer certain questions pertinaciously put by mama gosling on behalf of her daughter there is no engagement edward wrote let the maiden wait and discern her choice let her ripen and he quoted horace up to a point nor could his father help smiling and completing the lines he laughed too as he read the jog of a verse were i to marry the gosling pray which would be the goose he laughed but with a shade of disappointment in the fancy that he perceived a wearing away of the robust mental energy which had characterized his son and sir william knew the danger of wit and how the sharp blade cuts the shoots of the sapling he had thought that edward was veritable tough oak and had hitherto encouraged his light play with the weapon it became a question with him now whether wit and ambition may dwell together harmoniously in a young man whether they will not give such manifestation of their social habits as two robins shut in a cage will do of which pretty birds one will presently be discovered with a slightly ruffled bosom amid the feathers of his defunct associate thus painfully revolving matters of fact and feeling sir william cantered and like a cropped billow blown against by the wind drew up in front of mrs lovell and entered into conversation with that lady for the fine needles of whose brain he had the perfect deference of an experienced senior she however did not give him comfort she informed him that something was wrong with edward she could not tell what she spoke of him languidly as if his letters contained wearisome trifling he strains to be frenchy she said it may be a good compliment for them to receive it's a bad one for him to pay alcibiades is not the best of models murmured sir william he doesn't mention miss gosling oh dear yes i have a french acrostic on her name an acrostic a more contemptible form of mental exercise was not to be found according to sir william's judgement an acrostic he made it guttural well he writes word that he hears moliere every other night that can't harm him his reading is principally memoirs which i think i have heard you call 'the backstairs of history' we are dull here and i should not imagine it to be a healthy place to dwell in if the absence of friends and the presence of sunshine conspire to dullness algy of course is deep in accounts to day sir william remarked that he had not seen the young man at the office and had not looked for him but the mention of algernon brought something to his mind and he said i hear he is continually sending messengers from the office to you during the day you rule him with a rod of iron make him discontinue that practice i hear that he despatched our old porter to you yesterday with a letter marked 'urgent' mrs lovell laughed pleadingly for algernon no he shall not do it again it occurred yesterday and on no other occasion that i am aware of he presumes that i am as excited as he is himself about the race the lady bowed to a passing cavalier a smarting blush dyed her face he bets does he said sir william a young man whose income at the extreme limit is two hundred pounds a year may not the smallness of the amount in some degree account for the betting she asked whimsically you know i bet a little just a little if i have but a small sum i already regard it as a stake i am tempted to bid it fly in his case such conduct puts him on the high road to rascality said sir william severely he is doing no good then the squire is answerable for such conduct i think you presume to say that he is so because he allows his son very little money to squander how many young men have to contain their expenses within two hundred pounds a year not sons of squires and nephews of baronets said mrs lovell adieu i think i see a carrier pigeon flying overhead and as you may suppose i am all anxiety sir william nodded to her he disliked certain of her ways but they were transparent bits of audacity and restlessness pertaining to a youthful widow full of natural dash and she was so sweetly mistress of herself in all she did that he never supposed her to be needing caution against excesses old gentlemen have their pets and mrs lovell was a pet of sir william's she was on the present occasion quite mistress of herself though the stake was large she was mistress of herself when lord suckling who had driven from the downs and brushed all save a spot of white dust out of his baby moustache to make himself presentable rode up to her to say that the horse templemore was beaten and that his sagacity in always betting against favourites would in this last instance transfer a pot of money from alien pockets to his own algy blancove's in for five hundred to me he said adding with energy i hope you haven't lost no don't go and dash my jolly feeling by saying you have it was a fine heat neck and neck past the stand have you a little she confessed it's a failing of mine to like favourites i'm sorry for algy i'm afraid he's awfully hit what makes you think so he took it so awfully cool that may mean the reverse it don't with him but mrs lovell do tell me you haven't lost not much is it because i know there's no guessing when you are concerned the lady trifled with her bridle rein i really can't tell you yet i may have lost i haven't won i'm not cool blooded enough to bet against favourites addio son of fortune i'm at the opera to night as she turned her horse from lord suckling the cavalier who had saluted her when she was with sir william passed again she made a signal to her groom and sent the man flying in pursuit of him while she turned and cantered she was soon overtaken madam you have done me the honour i wish to know why it is your pleasure to avoid me major waring in this place wherever we may chance to meet i must protest do not the thing is evident they rode together silently her face was toward the sunset the light smote her yellow hair and struck out her grave and offended look as in a picture to be condemned without a hearing she said the most dastardly criminal gets that is it imagined that i have no common feelings is it manly to follow me with studied insult i can bear the hatred of fools contempt i have not deserved dead i should be dead if my conscience had once reproached me i am a mark for slander and brave men should beware of herding with despicable slanderers she spoke gazing frontward all the while the pace she maintained in no degree impeded the concentrated passion of her utterance but it was a more difficult task for him going at that pace to make explanations and she was exquisitely fair to behold the falling beams touched her with a mellow sweetness that kindled bleeding memories if i defend myself he said no all i ask is that you should accuse me let me know what i have done done that i have not been bitterly punished for what is it what is it why do you inflict a torture on me whenever you see me not by word not by look you are too subtle in your cruelty to give me anything i can grasp you know how you wound me and i am alone that is supposed to account for my behaviour she turned her face to him oh major blaring say nothing unworthy of yourself that would be a new pain to me he bowed in spite of a prepossessing anger some little softness crept through his heart you may conceive that i have dropped my pride she said that is the case or my pride is of a better sort madam i fully hope and trust said he and believe she added twisting his words to the ironic tongue you certainly must believe that my pride has sunk low did i ever speak to you in this manner before not in this manner i can attest did i speak at all when i was hurt she betrayed that he had planted a fresh sting if my recollection serves me said he your self command was remarkable mrs lovell slackened her pace your recollection serves you too well major waring i was a girl you judged the acts of a woman i was a girl and you chose to put your own interpretation on whatever i did you scourged me before the whole army was not that enough i mean enough for you for me perhaps not for i have suffered since and may have been set apart to suffer i saw you in that little church at warbeach i met you in the lanes i met you on the steamer on the railway platform at the review everywhere you kept up the look of my judge you and i have been 'margaret' to you major waring how many a woman in my place would attribute your relentless condemnation of her to injured vanity or vengeance in those days i trifled with everybody i played with fire i was ignorant of life i was true to my husband and because i was true and because i was ignorant i was plunged into tragedies i never suspected this is to be what you call a coquette stamping a name saves thinking could i read my husband's temper would not a coquette have played her cards differently there never was need for me to push my husband to a contest i never had the power to restrain him now i am wiser and now is too late and now you sit in judgement on me why it is not fair it is unkind tears were in her voice though not in her eyes major waring tried to study her with the coolness of a man who has learnt to doubt the truth of women but he had once yearned in a young man's frenzy of love to take that delicate shape in his arms and he was not proof against the sedate sweet face and keen sad ring of the voice he spoke earnestly you honour me by caring for my opinion the past is buried i have some forgiveness to ask much when i think of it very much i did you a public wrong from a man to a woman it was unpardonable it is a blot on my career i beg you humbly to believe that i repent it the sun was flaming with great wings red among the vapours and in the recollection of the two as they rode onward facing it arose that day of the forlorn charge of english horse in the indian jungle the thunder and the dust the fire and the dense knot of the struggle and like a ghost sweeping across her eyeballs mrs lovell beheld part in his english freshness part ensanguined the image of the gallant boy who had ridden to perish at the spur of her mad whim she forgot all present surroundings percy she said madam percy margaret oh what an undying day percy and then she was speechless chapter xxvii the park had been empty but the opera house was full and in the brilliance of the lights and divine soaring of the music the genius of champagne luncheons discussed the fate of the horse templemore some as a matter of remote history some as another delusion in horse flesh the greater number however with a determination to stand by the beaten favourite though he had fallen and proclaim him the best of racers and an animal foully mishandled on the course there were whispers and hints and assertions now implicating the jockey now the owner of templemore the manchester party and the yorkshire party and their diverse villanous tricks came under review several offered to back templemore at double the money they had lost against the winner a favourite on whom money has been staked not only has friends but in adversity he is still believed in nor could it well be otherwise for the money no doubt stands for faith or it would never have been put up to the risks of a forfeit foremost and wildest among the excited young men who animated the stalls and rushed about the lobby was algernon he was the genius of champagne luncheon incarnate on him devolves for a time the movement of this story and we shall do well to contemplate him though he may seem possibly to be worthless what is worthless if it be well looked at nay the most worthless creatures are most serviceable for examination when the microscope is applied to them as a simple study of human mechanism this youth is one of great nature's tom fools an elegant young gentleman outwardly of the very large class who are simply the engines of their appetites and to the philosophic eye still run wild in woods as did the primitive nobleman that made a noise in the earlier world algernon had this day lost ten times more than he could hope to be in a position to pay within ten years at the least if his father continued to argue the matter against providence and live he had lost and might speedily expect to be posted in all good betting circles as something not pleasantly odoriferous for circles where there is no betting nevertheless the youth was surcharged with gaiety the soul of mingled chicken and wine illumined his cheeks and eyes he laughed and joked about the horse his horse as he called templemore and meeting lord suckling won five sovereigns of him by betting that the colours of one of the beaten horses benloo were distinguished by a chocolate bar the bet was referred to a dignified umpire who a frenchman drew his right hand down an imperial tuft of hair dependent from his chin and gave a decision in algernon's favour lord suckling paid the money on the spot and algernon pocketed it exulting he had the idea that it was the first start in his making head against the flood the next instant he could have pitched himself upon the floor and bellowed for a soul of chicken and wine lightly elated is easily dashed and if he had but said to lord suckling that it might as well be deferred the thing would have become a precedent and his own debt might have been held back he went on saying as he rushed forward alone never mind suckling oh hang it put it in your pocket and the imperative necessity for talking and fancying what was adverse to fact enabled him to feel for a time as if he had really acted according to the prompting of his wisdom it amazed him to see people sitting and listening the more he tried it the more unendurable it became those sitters and loungers appeared like absurd petrifactions to him if he abstained from activity for ever so short a term he was tormented by a sense of emptiness and as he said to himself a man who has eaten a chicken and part of a game pie and drunk thereto champagne all day until the popping of the corks has become as familiar as minute guns he can hardly be empty it was peculiar he stood just for the sake of investigating the circumstance it was so extraordinary the music rose in a triumphant swell and now he was sure that he was not to be blamed for thinking this form of entertainment detestable how could people pretend to like it upon my honour he said aloud the hypocritical nonsense of pretending to like opera music disgusted him where is it algy a friend of his and suckling's asked with a languid laugh where's what your honour my honour do you doubt my honour algernon stared defiantly at the inoffensive little fellow not in the slightest very sorry to seeing that i have you down in my book latters ah yes said algernon musically and letting his under lip hang that he might restrain the impulse to bite it fifty or a hundred is it i lost my book on the downs fifty but wait till settling day my good fellow and don't fiddle at your pockets as if i'd been touching you up for the money come and sup with me to night algernon muttered a queer reply in a good tempered tone and escaped him he was sobered by that naming of settling day he could now listen to the music with attention if not with satisfaction as he did so the head of drowned memory rose slowly up through the wine bubbles in his brain and he flung out a far thought for relief how if i were to leave england with that dark girl rhoda at wrexby marry her like a man and live a wild ramping life in the colonies a curtain closed on the prospect but if memory was resolved that it would not be drowned he had at any rate dosed it with something fresh to occupy its digestion his opera glass had been scouring the house for a sight of mrs lovell and at last she appeared in lord elling's box i can give you two minutes algy she said as he entered and found her opportunely alone we have lost i hear no interjection pray let it be fors l'honneur with us come to me to morrow you have tossed trinkets into my lap they were marks of esteem my cousin take them in the same light back from me turn them into money and pay what is most pressing then go to lord suckling he is a good boy and won't distress you but you must speak openly to him at once perhaps he will help you i will do my best though whether i can i have yet to learn dear mrs lovell algernon burst out and the corners of his mouth played nervously he liked her kindness and he was wroth at the projected return of his gifts a man's gifts are an exhibition of the royalty of his soul and they are the last things which should be mentioned to him as matters to be blotted out when he is struggling against ruin the lady had blunt insight just then she attributed his emotion to gratitude the door may be opened at any minute she warned him it's not about myself he said it's you i believe i tempted you to back the beastly horse and he would have won a fair race and he would have won easy he was winning he passed the stand a head ahead he did win it's a scandal to the turf there's an end of racing in england it's up they've done for themselves to day there's a gang it's in the hands of confederates think so if it consoles you said mrs lovell don't mention your thoughts that is all i do think so why should we submit to a robbery it's a sold affair that frenchman baron vistocq says we can't lift our heads after it he conducts himself with decency i hope why he's won imitate him mrs lovell scanned the stalls always imitate the behaviour of the winners when you lose she resumed to speak of other things i have had no letter of late from edward he should be anxious to return i went this morning to see that unhappy girl she consents poor creature murmured algernon and added everybody wants money she decides wisely for it is the best she can do she deserves pity for she has been basely used poor old ned didn't mean algernon began pleading on his cousin's behalf when mrs lovell's scornful eye checked the feeble attempt i am a woman and in certain cases i side with my sex wasn't it for you that he betrayed her if that were so i should be sitting in ashes algernon's look plainly declared that he thought her a mystery the simplicity of his bewilderment made her smile i think your colonies are the right place for you algy if you can get an appointment which must be managed by and by call on me to morrow as i said algernon signified positively that he would not and doggedly refused to explain why then i will call on you said mrs lovell he was going to say something angrily when mrs lovell checked him hush she is singing algernon listened to the prima donna in loathing he had so much to inquire about and so much to relate such a desire to torment and be comforted before he could utter a word further the door opened and major waring appeared and he beheld mrs lovell blush strangely soon after lord elling came in and spoke the ordinary sentence or two concerning the day's topic the horse templemore algernon quitted the box his ears were surcharged with sound entirely foreign to his emotions and he strolled out of the house and off to his dingy chambers now tenanted by himself alone and there faced the sealed letters addressed to edward which had by order not been forwarded no less than six were in dahlia's handwriting he had imagination sufficient to conceive the lamentations they contained and the reproach they were to his own subserviency in not sending them he looked at the postmarks the last one was dated two months back how can she have cared a hang for ned if she's ready to go and marry a yokel for the sake of a home and respectability he thought rather in scorn and having established this contemptuous opinion of one of the sex he felt justified in despising all just like women they no peggy lovell isn't she's a trump card and she's a coquette can't help being one it's in the blood i never saw her look so confoundedly lovely as when that fellow came into the box one up one down ned's away and it's this fellow's turn why the deuce does she always think i'm a boy or else she pretends to but i must give my mind to business he drew forth the betting book which his lively fancy had lost on the downs prompted by an afterthought he went to the letter box saying who knows wait till the day's ended before you curse your luck there was a foreign letter in it from edward addressed to him and another addressed to mr blancuv that he tore open and read with disgusted laughter it was signed n sedgett algernon read it twice over for the enjoyment of his critical detection of the vile grammar with many oh by joves and a concluding this is a curiosity it was a countryman's letter ill spelt involved and of a character to give algernon a fine scholarly sense of superiority altogether novel everybody abused algernon for his abuse of common queen's english in his epistles but here was a letter in comparison with which his own were doctorial and accordingly he fell upon it with an acrimonious rapture of pedantry known to dull wits that have by extraordinary hazard pounced on a duller you're 'willing to forgeit and forgeive' are you you dog he exclaimed half dancing you'd forge anything you rascal if you could disguise your hand that i don't doubt you 'expeck the thousand pound to be paid down the day of my marriage' do you you impudent ruffian 'acording to agremint' what a mercenary vagabond this is algernon reflected a minute the money was to pass through his hands he compressed a desire to dispute with sedgett that latter point about the agreement and opened edward's letter it contained an order on a firm of attorneys to sell out so much bank stock and pay over one thousand pounds to mr a blancove the beautiful concision of style in this document gave algernon a feeling of profound deference toward the law and its officers now that's the way to write he said chapter xxviii accompanying this pleasant pregnant bit of paper possessed of such admirable literary excellence were the following flimsy lines from edward's self to algernon incomprehensible as there is a man to be seen behind these lines in the dull unconscious process of transformation from something very like a villain to something by a few degrees more estimable we may as well look at the letter in full it begins with a neat display of consideration for the person addressed common to letters that are dictated by overpowering egoism dear algy i hope you are working and attending regularly to office business look to that and to your health at present depend upon it there is nothing like work fix your teeth in it work is medicine a truism truisms whether they lie in the depths of thought or on the surface are at any rate the pearls of experience i am coming home let me know the instant this affair is over i can't tell why i wait here i fall into lethargies i write to no one but to you your supposition that i am one of the hangers on of the coquette of her time and that it is for her i am seeking to get free is conceived with your usual discrimination for margaret lovell do you imagine that i desire to be all my life kicking the beam weighed in capricious scales appraised to the direct nicety petulantly taken up probed for my weakest point and then flung into the grate like a child's toy that's the fate of the several asses who put on the long eared lovell livery all women are the same know one know all aware of this and too wise to let us study them successfully nature pretty language this is for you algy i can do nothing but write nonsense i am sick of life i feel choked after a month paris is sweet biscuit i have sent you the order for the money if it were two or twenty thousand pounds it would be the same to me i swear to heaven that my lowest cynical ideas of women and the loathing with which their simply animal vagaries inspires a thoughtful man are distanced and made to seem a benevolent criticism by the actualities of my experience i say that you cannot put faith in a woman even now i do not it's against reason i do not believe that she this dahlia means to go through with it she is trying me i have told her that she was my wife her self respect everything that keeps a woman's head up must have induced her to think so why she is not a fool how can she mean to give herself to an ignorant country donkey she does not mark me for her who is a really i may say the most refined nature i have ever met to affect this and think of deceiving me does not do credit to her wits and she is not without her share i did once mean that she should be honourably allied to me it's comforting that the act is not the wife of the intention or i should now be yoked to a mere thing of the seasons and the hours a creature whose 'no' to day is the 'yes' of to morrow women of this cast are sure to end comfortably for themselves they are so obedient to the whips of providence but i tell you candidly algy i believe she's pushing me that she may see how far i will let her go i do not permit her to play at this game with me the difficulty is in teaching women that we are not constituted as they are and that we are wilfully earnest while they who never can be so save under compulsion carry it on with us expecting that at a certain crisis a curtain will drop and we shall take a deep breath join hands and exclaim 'what an exciting play' weeping luxuriously the actualities of life must be branded on their backs you can't get their brains to apprehend them poor things they need pity i am ready to confess i did not keep my promise to her i am very sorry she has been ill of course having no brains nothing but sensations wherewith to combat every new revolution of fortune she can't but fall ill but i think of her and i wish to god i did not she is going to enter her own sphere though mark me it will turn out as i say that when it comes to the crisis there will be shrieks and astonishment that the curtain doesn't fall and the whole resolve itself to what they call a dream in our language a farce i am astonished that there should be no letters for me i can understand her not writing at first but apparently she cherishes rancour it is not like her i can't help thinking there must be one letter from her and that you keep it back i remember that i told you when i left england i desired to have no letter forwarded to me but i have repeatedly asked you since if there was a letter and it appears to me that you have shuffled in your answer i merely wish to know if there is a letter because i am at present out in my study of her character it seems monstrous that she should never have written don't you view it in that light to be ready to break with me without one good bye it's gratifying but i am astonished for so gentle and tender a creature such as i knew her never existed to compare with her ce qui est bien la preuve que je ne la connaissais pas i thought i did which was my error i have a fatal habit of trusting to my observation less than to my divining wit and la rochefoucauld is right 'on est quelquefois un sot avec de l'esprit mais on ne pest jamais avec du jugement' well better be deceived in a character than doubt it this will soon be over then back to the dear old dusky chambers with the pick and the axe in the mine of law till i strike a gold vein and follow it to the woolsack i want peace i begin to hate pleading i hope to meet death full wigged by my troth i will look as grimly at him as he at me meantime during a vacation i will give you holiday or better in the february days if i can spare time and equity is dispensed without my aid dine you and put you in the whirl of paris you deserve a holiday nunc est bibendum you shall sing it tell me what you think of her behaviour you are a judge of women i think i am developing nerves in fact work is what i need a file to bite and send me also the name of this man who has made the bargain who is to be her husband give me a description of him it is my duty to see that he has principle at least we're bound to investigate his character if it's really to go on i wonder whether you will ever perceive the comedy of life i doubt whether a man is happier when he does perceive it perhaps the fact is that he has by that time lost his power of laughter except in the case of here and there a very tremendous philosopher i believe that we comic creatures suffer more than your tragic personages we do you see are always looking to be happy and comfortable but in a tragedy the doomed wretches are liver complexioned from the opening act their laughter is the owl their broadest smile is twilight all the menacing horrors of an eclipse are ours for we have a sun over us but they are born in shades with the tuck of a curtain showing light and little can be taken from them so that they find scarce any terrors in the inevitable final stroke no the comedy is painfullest you and i algy old bachelors will earn the right just to chuckle we will take the point of view of science be the stage carpenters and let the actors move on and off by this we shall learn to take a certain pride in the machinery to become stage carpenter is to attain to the highest rank within the reach of intellectual man but your own machinery must be sound or you can't look after that of the theatre don't over tax thy stomach o youth and now farewell my worthy ass you have been thinking me one through a fair half of this my letter so i hasten to be in advance of you by calling you one you are one i likewise am one we are all one the universal language is hee haw done in a grievous yawn yours edward b ps don't fail to send a letter by the next post then go and see her write again exactly what she says and let me know the man's name you will not lose a minute also don't waste ink in putting mrs lovell's name to paper i desire not to hear anything of the woman algernon read this letter in a profound mystification marvelling how it could possibly be that edward and mrs lovell had quarrelled once more and without meeting they had parted he knew or supposed that he knew under an engagement to arrange the preliminaries of an alliance when edward should return from france in other words when edward had thrown grave dust on a naughty portion of his past severing an unwise connection such had certainly been edward's view of the matter but mrs lovell had never spoken to algernon on that subject she had spoken willingly and in deep sympathy of dahlia she had visited her pitied her comforted her and algernon remembered that she had looked very keen and pinched about the mouth in alluding to dahlia but how she and edward had managed to arrive at another misunderstanding was a prodigious puzzle to him and why if their engagement had snapped each consented to let dahlia's marriage which was evidently distasteful to both go on to the conclusion of the ceremony he could not comprehend there were however so many things in the world that he could not comprehend and he had grown so accustomed after an effort to master a difficulty to lean his head back upon downy ignorance that he treated this significant letter of edward's like a tough lesson and quietly put it by together with every recommendation it contained for all that was practical in it it might just as well not have been written the value of the letter lies in the exhibition it presents of a rather mark worthy young man who has passed through the hands of a what i must call her and in doing so i ask pardon of all the jack cades of letters who in the absence of a grammatical king and a government sit as lords upon the english tongue a crucible woman she may be inexcusable herself but you for you to be base for you to be cowardly even to betray a weakness though it be on her behalf though you can plead that all you have done is for her yea was partly instigated by her it will cause her to dismiss you with the inexorable contempt of nature when she has tried one of her creatures and found him wanting margaret lovell was of this description a woman fashioned to do both harm and good and more of harm than of good but never to sanction a scheme of evil or blink at it in alliance with another a woman in contact with whom you were soon resolved to your component elements separated from a certain fascination that there was for her in edward's acerb wit she saw that he was doing a dastardly thing in cold blood we need not examine their correspondence in a few weeks she had contrived to put a chasm between them as lovers had he remained in england boldly facing his own evil actions she would have been subjugated for however keenly she might pierce to the true character of a man the show of an unflinching courage dominated her but his departure leaving all the brutality to be done for him behind his back filled this woman with a cutting spleen it is sufficient for some men to know that they are seen through in order to turn away in loathing from her whom they have desired and when they do thus turn away they not uncommonly turn with a rush of old affection to those who have generously trusted them in the days past and blindly thought them estimable beings algernon was by no means gifted to perceive whether this was the case with his cousin in paris chapter xxix so long as the fool has his being in the world he will be a part of every history nor can i keep him from his place in a narrative that is made to revolve more or less upon its own wheels algernon went to bed completely forgetting edward and his own misfortunes under the influence of the opiate of the order for one thousand pounds to be delivered to him upon application the morning found him calmly cheerful until a little parcel was brought to his door together with a note from mrs lovell explaining that the parcel contained those jewels his precious gifts of what she had insultingly chosen to call esteem for her algernon took it in his hand and thought of flinging it through the window but as the window happened to be open he checked the impulse and sent it with great force into a corner of the room a perfectly fool like proceeding for the fool is after his fashion prudent and will never if he can help it do himself thorough damage that he may learn by it and be wiser i never stand insult he uttered self approvingly and felt manlier no not even from you ma'am he apostrophized mrs lovell's portrait that had no rival now upon the wall and that gave him a sharp fight for the preservation of his anger so bewitching she was to see her not sending up word that she wished him to come to her rendered his battle easier it looks rather like a break between us he said if so you won't find me so obedient to your caprices mrs margaret l though you are a pretty woman and know it smile away i prefer a staunch true sort of a woman after all and the colonies it must be i begin to suspect this set him conjuring before his eyes the image of rhoda until he cried i'll be hanged if the girl doesn't haunt me and considered the matter with some curiosity he was quickly away and across the square of lincoln's inn fields to the attorney's firm where apparently his coming was expected and he was told that the money would be placed in his hands on the following day he then communicated with edward in the brief caesarian tongue of the telegraph all right stay ceremony arranged after which he hailed a skimming cab and pronouncing the word epsom sank back in it and felt in his breast pocket for his cigar case without casting one glance of interest at the deep fit of cogitation the cabman had been thrown into by the suddenness of the order dash'd if it ain't the very thing i went and gone and dreamed last night said the cabman as he made his dispositions to commence the journey certain boys advised him to whip it away as hard as he could and he would come in the winner where shall i grub sir the cabman asked through the little door above to get some knowledge of the quality of his fare eat your 'grub' on the course said algernon ne'er a hamper to take up nowheres is there sir do you like the sight of one well it ain't what i object to then go fast my man and you will soon see plenty if you took to chaffin' a bit later in the day it'd impart more confidence to my bosom said the cabman but this he said to that bosom alone ain't no particular colours you'd like me to wear is there i'll get a rosette if you like sir and enter in triumph gives ye something to stand by that's always my remark founded on observation go to the deuce drive on algernon sang out red yellow and green lobster ale and salad said the cabman flicking his whip and good colours too tenpenny nail's the horse he's the colours i stick to and off he drove envied of london urchins as mortals would have envied a charioteer driving visibly for olympus algernon crossed his arms with the frown of one looking all inward at school this youth had hated sums all arithmetical difficulties had confused and sickened him but now he worked with indefatigable industry on an imaginary slate put his postulate counted probabilities allowed for chances added deducted multiplied and unknowingly performed algebraic feats till his brows were stiff with frowning and his brain craved for stimulant this necessity sent his hand to his purse for the calling of the cab had not been a premeditated matter he discovered therein some half crowns and a sixpence the latter of which he tossed in contempt at some boys who were cheering the vehicles on their gallant career there was something desperately amusing to him in the thought that he had not even money enough to pay the cabman or provide for a repast he rollicked in his present poverty yesterday he had run down with a party of young guardsmen in a very royal manner and yesterday he had lost to day he journeyed to the course poorer than many of the beggars he would find there and by a natural deduction to day he was to win he whistled mad waltzes to the measure of the wheels he believed that he had a star he pitched his half crowns to the turnpike men and sought to propitiate fortune by displaying a signal indifference to small change in which method of courting her he was perfectly serious he absolutely rejected coppers they crossed his luck nor can we say that he is not an authority on this point the goddess certainly does not deal in coppers anxious efforts at recollection perplexed him he could not remember whether he had turned his money on looking at the last new moon when had he seen the last new moon and where a cloud obscured it he had forgotten he consoled himself by cursing superstition tenpenny nail was to gain the day in spite of fortune algernon said this and entrenched his fluttering spirit behind common sense but he found it a cold corner the longing for champagne stimulant increased in fervour arithmetic languished as he was going up the hill the wheels were still for a moment and hearing tenpenny nail shouted he put forth his head and asked what the cry was concerning that horse gone lame was the answer it hit the centre of his nerves without reaching his comprehension and all englishmen being equal on epsom downs his stare at the man who had spoken and his sickly colour exposed him to pungent remarks hullos here's another ninepenny a penny short and similar specimens of epsom wit encouraged by the winks and retorts of his driver surrounded him but it was empty clamour outside a rage of emotions drowned every idea in his head and when he got one clear from the mass it took the form of a bitter sneer at providence for cutting off his last chance of reforming his conduct and becoming good what would he not have accomplished that was brilliant and beautiful and soothing but for this dead set against him it was clear that providence cared not a rap whether he won or lost was good or bad one might just as well be a heathen why not he jumped out of the cab tearing his coat in the acts minor evil but all of a piece as he said and made his way to the ring the bee swarm was thick as ever on the golden bough algernon heard no curses and began to nourish hope again as he advanced he began to hope wildly that this rumour about the horse was a falsity for there was no commotion no one declaiming he pushed to enter the roaring circle which the demand for an entrance fee warned him was a privilege and he stammered and forgot the gentlemanly coolness commonly distinguishing him under one of the acuter twinges of his veteran complaint of impecuniosity and then the cabman made himself heard a civil cabman but without directions and uncertain of his dinner and his pay tolerably hot also from threading a crowd after a deaf gentleman his half injured look restored to algernon his self possession ah there you are scurry away and fetch my purse out of the bottom of the cab i've dropped it on this errand the confiding cabman retired holding to a gentleman's purse is even securer than holding to a gentleman while algernon was working his forefinger in his waistcoat pocket reflectively a man at his elbow said with a show of familiar deference if it's any convenience to you sir and showed the rim of a gold piece 'twixt finger and thumb all right algernon replied readily and felt that he was known but tried to keep his eyes from looking at the man's face which was a vain effort he took the money nodded curtly and passed in once through the barrier he had no time to be ashamed he was in the atmosphere of challenges he heard voices and saw men whom not to challenge or try a result with was to acknowledge oneself mean and to abandon the manliness of life algernon's betting book was soon out and in operation while thus engaged he beheld faces passing and repassing that were the promise of luncheon and a loan and so comfortable was the assurance thereof to him that he laid the thought of it aside quite in the background and went on betting with an easy mind small senseless bets they merely occupied him and winning them was really less satisfactory than losing which at all events had the merit of adding to the bulk of his accusation against the ruling powers unseen algernon was too savage for betting when the great race was run he refused both at taunts and cajoleries but lord suckling coming by said name your horse and caught unawares algernon named little john one of the ruck at a hazard lord suckling gave him fair odds asking in tens fifties silver shrugged algernon implacable toward fortune and the kindly young nobleman nodded and made allowance for his ill temper and want of spirit knowing the stake he had laid on the favourite little john startled the field by coming in first at a canter men have committed suicide for less than this said algernon within his lips and a modest expression of submission to fate settled on his countenance he stuck to the ring till he was haggard with fatigue his whole nature cried out for champagne and now he burst away from that devilish circle looking about for lord suckling and a hamper food and a frothing drink were all that he asked from fortune it seemed to him that the concourse on the downs shifted in a restless way what's doing i wonder he thought aloud why sir the last race ain't generally fashionable said his cabman appearing from behind his shoulder don't you happen to be peckish sir 'cause luck or no luck that's my case i couldn't see your purse nowheres confound you how you hang about me what do you want algernon cried and answered his own question by speeding the cabman to a booth with what money remained to him and appointing a place of meeting for the return after which he glanced round furtively to make sure that he was not in view of the man who had lent him the sovereign it became evident that the downs were flowing back to london he hurried along the lines of carriages all getting into motion the ghastly conviction overtook him that he was left friendless to starve wherever he turned he saw strangers and empty hampers bottles straw waste paper the ruins of the feast fate's irony meantime besetting him with beggars who swallowed his imprecations as the earnest of coming charity in such places at last he was brought almost to sigh that he might see the man who had lent him the sovereign and his wish was hardly formed when nicodemus sedgett approached waving a hat encircled by preposterous wooden figures a trifle less lightly attired than the ladies of the ballet and as bold in the matter of leg as the female fashion of the period algernon eyed the lumpy headed heavy browed rascal with what disgust he had left in him for one who came as an instrument of the fates to help him to some poor refreshment sedgett informed him that he had never had such fun in his life just 'fore matrimony he communicated in a dull whisper a fellow ought to see a bit o' the world i says don't you sir and this has been rare sport that it has did ye find your purse sir never mind 'bout that ther' pound i'll lend you another if ye like how sh'll it be say the word algernon was meditating apparently on a remote subject he nodded sharply yes call at my chambers to morrow another sovereign was transferred to him but sedgett would not be shaken off i just wanted t' have a bit of a talk with you he spoke low hang it i haven't eaten all day snapped the irritable young gentleman fearful now of being seen in the rascal's company you come along to the jolliest booth i'll show it to you said sedgett and lifted one leg in dancing attitude come along sir the jolliest booth i ever was in dang me if it ain't ale and music them's my darlings the wretch vented his slang and i must have a talk with you i'll stick to you i'm social when i'm jolly that i be and i don't know a chap on these here downs here's the pint is all square am i t' have the cash in cash counted down i asks and is it to be before or is it to be after the ceremony there bang out say yes or no algernon sent him to perdition with infinite heartiness but he was dry dispirited and weak and he walked on sedgett accompanying him he entered a booth and partook of ale and ham feeling that he was in the dregs of calamity though the ale did some service in reviving it did not cheer him and he had a fit of moral objection to sedgett's discourse sedgett took his bluntness as a matter to be endured for the honour of hob a nobbing with a gentleman several times he recurred to the theme which he wanted as he said to have a talk upon he related how he had courted the young woman bashful like and had been so for she was a splendid young woman not so handsome now as she used to be when he had seen her in the winter but her illness had pulled her down and made her humble they had cut her hair during the fever which had taken her pride clean out of her and when he had put the question to her on the evening of last sunday she had gone into a sort of faint and he walked away with her affirmative locked up in his breast pocket and was resolved always to treat her well which he swore to married and got the money and the lease o' my farm disposed of i'm off to australia and leave old england behind me and thank ye mother thank ye and we shan't meet again in a hurry and what sort o' song i'm to sing for 'england is my nation ain't come across me yet australia's such a precious big world but that'll come easy in time and there'll i farm and damn all you gentlemen if you come anigh me the eyes of the fellow were fierce as he uttered this they were rendered fierce by a peculiar blackish flush that came on his brows and cheek bones otherwise the yellow about the little brown dot in the centre of the eyeball had not changed but the look was unmistakably savage animal and bad he closed the lids on them and gave a sort of churlish smile immediately afterward harmony's the game you act fair i act fair i've kept to the condition she don't know anything of my whereabouts res'dence i mean and thinks i met you in her room for the first time that's the truth mr blancove and thinks me a sheepish chap and i'm that when i'm along wi' her she can't make out how i come to call at her house and know her first gives up guessing i suppose for she's quiet about it and i pitch her tales about australia and life out there i've got her to smile once or twice she'll turn her hand to making cheeses never you fear only this i say i must have the money it's a thousand and a bargain no thousand and no wife for me not that i don't stand by the agreement i'm solid algernon had no power of encountering a human eye steadily or he would have shown the man with a look how repulsive he was to a gentleman his sensations grew remorseful as if he were guilty of handing a victim to the wretch but the woman followed her own inclination did she not there was no compulsion she accepted this man and if she could do that pity was wasted on her so thought he and so the world would think of the poor forlorn soul striving to expiate her fault that her father and sister might be at peace without shame algernon signified to sedgett that the agreement was fixed and irrevocable on his part sedgett gulped some ale hands on it he said and laid his huge hand open across the table this was too much my word must satisfy you said algernon rising so it shall so it do returned sedgett rising with him will you give it in writing i won't that's blunt will you come and have a look at a sparring match in yond' brown booth sir i am going back to london london and the theayter that's the fun now ain't it sedgett laughed algernon discerned his cabman and the conveyance ready and beckoned him perhaps sir said sedgett if i might make so bold i don't want to speak o' them sovereigns but i've got to get back too and cash is run low d' ye mind sir are you kind hearted a constitutional habit of servility to his creditor when present before him signalized algernon he detested the man but his feebleness was seized by the latter question and he fancied he might on the road to london convey to sedgett's mind that it would be well to split that thousand as he had previously devised jump in he said when sedgett was seated algernon would have been glad to walk the distance to london to escape from the unwholesome proximity he took the vacant place in horror of it the man had hitherto appeared respectful and in dahlia's presence he had seemed a gentle big fellow with a reverent affectionate heart sedgett rallied him you've had bad luck that's wrote on your hatband now if you was a woman i'd say tak' and go and have a peroose o' your bible that's what my young woman does and by george it's just like medicine to her that 'tis i've read out to her till i could ha' swallowed two quart o' beer at a gulp i was that mortal thirsty it don't somehow seem to improve men it didn't do me no good there was i cursin' at the bother down in my boots like and she with her hands in a knot staring the fire out o' count'nance they're weak poor sort o' things the intolerable talk of the ruffian prompted algernon to cry out for relief a scoundrel like you must be past any good to be got from reading his bible sedgett turned his dull brown eyes on him the thick and hateful flush of evil blood informing them with detestable malignity come you be civil if you're going to be my companion he said i don't like bad words they don't go down my windpipe 'scoundrel 's a name i've got a retort for and if it hadn't been you and you a gentleman you'd have had it spanking hot from the end o' my fist perhaps you don't know what sort of a arm i've got just you feel that ther' muscle he doubled his arm the knuckles of the fist toward algernon's face down with it you dog cried algernon crushing his hat as he started up it'll come on your nose if i downs with it my lord said sedgett you've what they londoners calls 'bonneted yourself' he pulled algernon by the coat tail into his seat stop algernon shouted to the cabman drive ahead roared sedgett this signal of a dissension was heard along the main street of epsom and re awakened the flagging hilarity of the road algernon shrieked his commands sedgett thundered his they tussled and each having inflicted an unpleasant squeeze on the other they came apart by mutual consent and exchanged half length blows overhead the cabman not merely a cabman but an individual flicked the flanks of his horse and cocked his eye and head in answer to gesticulations from shop doors and pavement let 'em fight it out i'm impartial he remarked and having lifted his little observing door and given one glance parrot wise below he shut away the troubled prospect of those mortals and drove along benignly epsom permitted it but ewell contained a sturdy citizen who smoking his pipe under his eaves contemplative of passers by saw strife rushing on like a meteor he raised the waxed end of his pipe and with an authoritative motion of his head at the same time pointed out the case to a man in a donkey cart who looked behind saw pugnacity upon wheels and manoeuvred a docile and wonderfully pretty stepping little donkey in such a manner that the cabman was fain to pull up the combatants jumped into the road that's right gentlemen i don't want to spile sport said the donkey's man o' course you ends your epsom day with spirit there's sunset on their faces said the cabman would you try a by lane gentlemen but now the donkey's man had inspected the figures of the antagonistic couple taint fair play he said to sedgett you leave that gentleman alone you sir the man with the pipe came up no fighting he observed we ain't going to have our roads disgraced it shan't be said englishmen don't know how to enjoy themselves without getting drunk and disorderly you drop your fists the separation had to be accomplished by violence for algernon's blood was up a crowd was not long in collecting which caused a stoppage of vehicles of every description a gentleman leaned from an open carriage to look at the fray critically and his companion stretching his neck to do likewise sedgett burst from his lips involuntarily the pair of original disputants for there were many by this time turned their heads simultaneously toward the carriage will you come on sedgett roared but whether to algernon or to one of the gentlemen or one of the crowd was indefinite none responding he shook with ox like wrath pushed among shoulders and plunged back to his seat making the cabman above bound and sway and the cab horse to start and antic greatly to the amazement of the spectators the manifest gentleman by comparison who had recently been at a pummelling match with him and bore the stains of it hung his head stepped on the cab and suffered himself to be driven away sort of a 'man and wife' quarrel was the donkey's man's comment there's something as corks 'em up and something uncorks 'em but what that something is i ain't nor you ain't man enough to inform the company he rubbed his little donkey's nose affectionately any gentleman open to a bet i don't overtake that ere hansom within three miles o' ewell he asked as he took the rein but his little donkey's quality was famous in the neighbourhood come on then he said and show what you can do without emilation master tom away the little donkey trotted etext editor's bookmarks all women are the same know one know all exceeding
