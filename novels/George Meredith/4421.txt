chapter i remains of our good yeomanry blood will be found in kent developing stiff solid unobtrusive men and very personable women the distinction survives there between kentish women and women of kent as a true south eastern dame will let you know if it is her fortune to belong to that favoured portion of the county where the great battle was fought in which the gentler sex performed manful work but on what luckless heads we hear not and when garrulous tradition is discreet the severe historic muse declines to hazard a guess saxon one would presume since it is thought something to have broken them my plain story is of two kentish damsels and runs from a home of flowers into regions where flowers are few and sickly on to where the flowers which breathe sweet breath have been proved in mortal fire mrs fleming of queen anne's farm was the wife of a yeoman farmer of the county both were of sound kentish extraction albeit varieties of the breed the farm had its name from a tradition common to many other farmhouses within a circuit of the metropolis that the ante hanoverian lady had used the place in her day as a nursery hospital for the royal little ones it was a square three storied building of red brick much beaten and stained by the weather with an ivied side up which the ivy grew stoutly topping the roof in triumphant lumps the house could hardly be termed picturesque its aspect had struck many eyes as being very much that of a red coat sentinel grenadier battered with service and standing firmly enough though not at ease surrounding it was a high wall built partly of flint and partly of brick and ringed all over with grey lichen and brown spots of bearded moss that bore witness to the touch of many winds and rains tufts of pale grass and gilliflowers and travelling stone crop hung from the wall and driblets of ivy ran broadening to the outer ground the royal arms were said to have surmounted the great iron gateway but they had vanished either with the family or at the indications of an approaching rust rust defiled its bars but when you looked through them the splendour of an unrivalled garden gave vivid signs of youth and of the taste of an orderly laborious and cunning hand the garden was under mrs fleming's charge the joy of her love for it was written on its lustrous beds as poets write she had the poetic passion for flowers perhaps her taste may now seem questionable she cherished the old fashioned delight in tulips the house was reached on a gravel path between rows of tulips rich with one natural blush or freaked by art she liked a bulk of colour and when the dahlia dawned upon our gardens she gave her heart to dahlias by good desert the fervent woman gained a prize at a flower show for one of her dahlias and dahlia' was the name uttered at the christening of her eldest daughter at which all wrexby parish laughed as long as the joke could last there was laughter also when mrs fleming's second daughter received the name of 'rhoda' but it did not endure for so long a space as it was known that she had taken more to the solitary and reflective reading of her bible and to thoughts upon flowers eternal country people are not inclined to tolerate the display of a passion for anything they find it as intrusive and exasperating as is in the midst of larger congregations what we call genius for some years mrs fleming's proceedings were simply a theme for gossips and her vanity was openly pardoned until that delusively prosperous appearance which her labour lent to the house was worn through by the enforced confession of there being poverty in the household the ragged elbow was then projected in the face of wrexby in a manner to preclude it from a sober appreciation of the fairness of the face critically moreover her admission of great poppy heads into her garden was objected to she would squander her care on poppies and she had been heard to say that while she lived her children should be fully fed the encouragement of flaunting weeds in a decent garden was indicative of a moral twist that the expressed resolution to supply her table with plentiful nourishment no matter whence it came or how provided sufficiently confirmed the reason with which she was stated to have fortified her stern resolve was of the irritating order right in the abstract and utterly unprincipled in the application she said good bread and good beef and enough of both make good blood and my children shall be stout' this is such a thing as maybe announced by foreign princesses and rulers over serfs but english wrexby in cogitative mood demanded an equivalent for its beef and divers economies consumed by the hungry children of the authoritative woman practically it was obedient for it had got the habit of supplying her though payment was long in arrear the arrears were not treated as lost ones by mrs fleming who without knowing it possessed one main secret for mastering the custodians of credit she had a considerate remembrance and regard for the most distant of her debts so that she seemed to be only always a little late and exceptionally wrongheaded in theory wrexby therefore acquiesced in helping to build up her children to stoutness and but for the blindness of all people save artists poets novelists to the grandeur of their own creations the inhabitants of this kentish village might have had an enjoyable pride in the beauty and robust grace of the young girls fair haired black haired girls a kindred contrast like fire and smoke to look upon in stature in bearing and in expression they were if i may adopt the eloquent modern manner of eulogy strikingly above their class they carried erect shoulders like creatures not ashamed of showing a merely animal pride which is never quite apart from the pride of developed beauty they were as upright as oriental girls whose heads are nobly poised from carrying the pitcher to the well dark rhoda might have passed for rachel and dahlia called her rachel they tossed one another their mutual compliments drawn from the chief book of their reading queen of sheba was dahlia's title no master of callisthenics could have set them up better than their mother's receipt for making good blood combined with a certain harmony of their systems had done nor could a schoolmistress have taught them correcter speaking the characteristic of girls having a disposition to rise is to be cravingly mimetic and they remembered and crooned over till by degrees they adopted the phrases and manner of speech of highly grammatical people such as the rector and his lady and of people in story books especially of the courtly french fairy books wherein the princes talk in periods as sweetly rounded as are their silken calves nothing less than angelically so as to be a model to ordinary men the idea of love upon the lips of ordinary men provoked dahlia's irony and the youths of wrexby and fenhurst had no chance against her secret prince florizels them she endowed with no pastoral qualities on the contrary she conceived that such pure young gentlemen were only to be seen and perhaps met in the great and mystic city of london naturally the girls dreamed of london to educate themselves they copied out whole pages of a book called the field of mars' which was next to the family bible in size among the volumes of the farmer's small library the deeds of the heroes of this book and the talk of the fairy princes were assimilated in their minds and as they looked around them upon millers' farmers' maltsters' and tradesmen's sons the thought of what manner of youth would propose to marry them became a precocious tribulation rhoda at the age of fifteen was distracted by it owing to her sister's habit of masking her own dismal internal forebodings on the subject under the guise of a settled anxiety concerning her sad chance in dress the wife of the rector of wrexby was their model there came once to squire blancove's unoccupied pew a dazzling vision of a fair lady they heard that she was a cousin of his third wife and a widow mrs lovell by name they looked at her all through the service and the lady certainly looked at them in return nor could they with any distinctness imagine why but the look dwelt long in their hearts and often afterward when dahlia upon taking her seat in church shut her eyes according to custom she strove to conjure up the image of herself as she had appeared to the beautiful woman in the dress of grey shot silk with violet mantle and green bonnet rose trimmed and the picture she conceived was the one she knew herself by for many ensuing years mrs fleming fought her battle with a heart worthy of her countrywomen and with as much success as the burden of a despondent husband would allow to her william john fleming was simply a poor farmer for whom the wheels of the world went too fast a big man appearing to be difficult to kill though deeply smitten his cheeks bloomed in spite of lines and stains and his large quietly dilated brown ox eyes that never gave out a meaning seldom showed as if they had taken one from what they saw until his wife was lost to him he believed that he had a mighty grievance against her but as he was not wordy and was by nature kind it was her comfort to die and not to know it this grievance was rooted in the idea that she was ruinously extravagant the sight of the plentiful table was sore to him the hungry mouths though he grudged to his offspring nothing that he could pay for were an afflicting prospect plump 'em up and make 'em dainty he advanced in contravention of his wife's talk of bread and beef but he did not complain if it came to an argument the farmer sidled into a secure corner of prophecy and bade his wife to see what would come of having dainty children he could not deny that bread and beef made blood and were cheaper than the port wine which doctors were in the habit of ordering for this and that delicate person in the neighbourhood so he was compelled to have recourse to secret discontent the attention the time and the trifles of money shed upon the flower garden were hardships easier to bear he liked flowers and he liked to hear the praise of his wife's horticultural skill the garden was a distinguishing thing to the farm and when on a sunday he walked home from church among full june roses he felt the odour of them to be so like his imagined sensations of prosperity that the deception was worth its cost yet the garden in its bloom revived a cruel blow his wife had once wounded his vanity the massed vanity of a silent man when it does take a wound desires a giant's vengeance but as one can scarcely seek to enjoy that monstrous gratification when one's wife is the offender the farmer escaped from his dilemma by going apart into a turnip field and swearing with his fist outstretched never to forget it his wife had asked him seeing that the garden flourished and the farm decayed to yield the labour of the farm to the garden in fact to turn nurseryman under his wife's direction the woman could not see that her garden drained the farm already distracted the farm and most evidently impoverished him she could not understand that in permitting her while he sweated fruitlessly to give herself up to the occupation of a lady he had followed the promptings of his native kindness and certainly not of his native wisdom that she should deem herself best man' of the two and suggest his stamping his name to such an opinion before the world was an outrage mrs fleming was failing in health on that plea with the solemnity suited to the autumn of her allotted days she persuaded her husband to advertise for an assistant who would pay a small sum of money to learn sound farming and hear arguments in favour of the corn laws to please her he threw seven shillings away upon an advertisement and laughed when the advertisement was answered remarking that he doubted much whether good would come of dealings with strangers a young man calling himself robert armstrong underwent a presentation to the family he paid the stipulated sum and was soon enrolled as one of them he was of a guardsman's height and a cricketer's suppleness a drinker of water and apparently the victim of a dislike of his species for he spoke of the great night lighted city with a horror that did not seem to be an estimable point in him as judged by a pair of damsels for whom the mysterious metropolis flew with fiery fringes through dark space in their dreams in other respects the stranger was well thought of as being handsome and sedate he talked fondly of one friend that he had an officer in the army which was considered pardonably vain he did not reach to the ideal of his sex which had been formed by the sisters but mrs fleming trusting to her divination of his sex's character whispered a mother's word about him to her husband a little while before her death it was her prayer to heaven that she might save a doctor's bill she died without lingering illness in her own beloved month of june the roses of her tending at the open window and a soft breath floating up to her from the garden on the foregoing may day she had sat on the green that fronted the iron gateway when dahlia and rhoda dressed the children of the village in garlands and crowned the fairest little one queen of may a sight that revived in mrs fleming's recollection the time of her own eldest and fairest taking homage shy in her white smock and light thick curls the gathering was large and the day was of the old nature of may before tyrannous eastwinds had captured it and spoiled its consecration the mill stream of the neighbouring mill ran blue among the broad green pastures the air smelt of cream bowls and wheaten loaves the firs on the beacon ridge far southward over fenhurst and helm villages were transported nearer to see the show and stood like friends anxious to renew acquaintance dahlia and rhoda taught the children to perceive how they resembled bent old beggar men the two stone pines in the miller's grounds were likened by them to adam and eve turning away from the blaze of paradise and the saying of one receptive child that they had nothing but hair on made the illustration undying both to dahlia and rhoda the magic of the weather brought numerous butterflies afield and one fiddler to whose tuning the little women danced others closer upon womanhood would have danced likewise if the sisters had taken partners but dahlia was restrained by the sudden consciousness that she was under the immediate observation of two manifestly london gentlemen and she declined to be led forth by robert armstrong the intruders were youths of good countenance known to be the son and the nephew of squire blancove of wrexby hall they remained for some time watching the scene and destroyed dahlia's single mindedness like many days of gaiety the gods consenting this one had its human shadow there appeared on the borders of the festivity a young woman the daughter of a wrexby cottager who had left her home and but lately returned to it with a spotted name no one addressed her and she stood humbly apart dahlia seeing that every one moved away from her whispering with satisfied noddings wished to draw her in among the groups she mentioned the name of mary burt to her father supposing that so kind a man would not fail to sanction her going up to the neglected young woman to her surprise her father became violently enraged and uttered a stern prohibition speaking a word that stained her cheeks rhoda was by her side and she wilfully without asking leave went straight over to mary and stood with her under the shadow of the adam and eve until the farmer sent a messenger to say that he was about to enter the house her punishment for the act of sinfulness was a week of severe silence and the farmer would have kept her to it longer but for her mother's ominously growing weakness the sisters were strangely overclouded by this incident they could not fathom the meaning of their father's unkindness coarseness and indignation why and why they asked one another blankly the scriptures were harsh in one part but was the teaching to continue so after the atonement by degrees they came to reflect and not in a mild spirit that the kindest of men can be cruel and will forget their christianity toward offending and repentant women chapter ii mrs fleming had a brother in london who had run away from his kentish home when a small boy and found refuge at a bank the position of anthony hackbut in that celebrated establishment and the degree of influence exercised by him there were things unknown but he had stuck to the bank for a great number of years and he had once confessed to his sister that he was not a beggar upon these joint facts the farmer speculated deducing from them that a man in a london bank holding money of his own must have learnt the ways of turning it over farming golden ground as it were consequently that amount must now have increased to a very considerable sum you ask what amount but one who sits brooding upon a pair of facts for years with the imperturbable gravity of creation upon chaos will be as successful in evoking the concrete from the abstract the farmer saw round figures among the possessions of the family and he assisted mentally in this money turning of anthony's counted his gains for him disposed his risks and eyed the pile of visionary gold with an interest so remote that he was almost correct in calling it disinterested the brothers in law had a mutual plea of expense that kept them separate when anthony refused on petition to advance one hundred pounds to the farmer there was ill blood to divide them queen anne's farm missed the flourishing point by one hundred pounds exactly with that addition to its exchequer it would have made head against its old enemy taxation and started rejuvenescent but the radicals were in power to legislate and crush agriculture and i've got a miser for my brother in law said the farmer alas the hundred pounds to back him he could have sowed what he pleased and when it pleased him partially defying the capricious clouds and their treasures and playing tunefully upon his land his own land instead of which and while too keenly aware that the one hundred would have made excesses in any direction tributary to his pocket the poor man groaned at continuous falls of moisture and when rain was prayed for in church he had to be down on his knees praying heartily with the rest of the congregation it was done and bitter reproaches were cast upon anthony for the enforced necessity to do it on the occasion of his sister's death anthony informed his bereaved brother in law that he could not come down to follow the hearse as a mourner my place is one of great trust he said and i cannot be spared he offered however voluntarily to pay half the expenses of the funeral stating the limit of the cost it is unfair to sound any man's springs of action critically while he is being tried by a sorrow and the farmer's angry rejection of anthony's offer of aid must pass he remarked in his letter of reply that his wife's funeral should cost no less than he chose to expend on it he breathed indignant fumes against interferences he desired anthony to know that he also was not a beggar and that he would not be treated as one the letter showed a solid yeoman's fist farmer fleming told his chums and the shopkeeper of wrexby with whom he came into converse that he would honour his dead wife up to his last penny some month or so afterward it was generally conjectured that he had kept his word anthony's rejoinder was characterized by a marked humility he expressed contrition for the farmer's misunderstanding of his motives his fathomless conscience had plainly been reached he wrote again without waiting for an answer speaking of the funds indeed but only to pronounce them worldly things and hoping that they all might meet in heaven where brotherly love as well as money was ready made and not always in the next street a hint occurred that it would be a gratification to him to be invited down whether he could come or no for holidays were expensive and journeys by rail had to be thought over before they were undertaken and when you are away from your post you never knew who maybe supplanting you he did not promise that he could come but frankly stated his susceptibility to the friendliness of an invitation the feeling indulged by farmer fleming in refusing to notice anthony's advance toward a reconciliation was on the whole not creditable to him spite is more often fattened than propitiated by penitence he may have thought besides policy not being always a vacant space in revengeful acts that anthony was capable of something stronger and warmer now that his humanity had been aroused the speculation is commonly perilous but farmer fleming had the desperation of a man who has run slightly into debt and has heard the first din of dunning which to the unaccustomed imagination is fearful as bankruptcy shorn of the horror of the word and moreover it was so wonderful to find anthony displaying humanity at all that anything might be expected of him let's see what he will do thought the farmer in an interval of his wrath and the wrath is very new which has none of these cool intervals the passions do but watch them are all more or less intermittent as it chanced he acted sagaciously for anthony at last wrote to say that his home in london was cheerless and that he intended to move into fresh and airier lodgings where the presence of a discreet young housekeeper who might wish to see london and make acquaintance with the world would be agreeable to him his project was that one of his nieces should fill this office and he requested his brother in law to reflect on it and to think of him as of a friend of the family now and in the time to come anthony spoke of the seductions of london quite unctuously who could imagine this to be the letter of an old crabbed miser tell her he said there's fruit at stalls at every street corner all the year through oysters and whelks if she likes winkles lots of pictures in shops a sight of muslin and silks and rides on omnibuses bands of all sorts and now and then we can take a walk to see the military on horseback if she's for soldiers indeed he joked quite comically in speaking of the famous horse guards warriors who sit on their horses to be looked at and do not mind it because they are trained so thoroughly horse guards blue and horse guards red he wrote the blue only want boiling there is reason to suppose that his disrespectful joke was not original in him but it displayed his character in a fresh light of course if either of the girls was to go dahlia was the person the farmer commenced his usual process of sitting upon the idea that it would be policy to attach one of the family to this chirping old miser he thought incontestable on the other hand he had a dread of london and dahlia was surpassingly fair he put the case to robert in remembrance of what his wife had spoken hoping that robert would amorously stop his painful efforts to think fast enough for the occasion robert however had nothing to say and seemed willing to let dahlia depart the only opponents to the plan were mrs sumfit a kindly humble relative of the farmer's widowed out of sussex very loving and fat the cook to the household whose waist was dimly indicated by her apron string and to aid her outcries the silently protesting master gammon an old man with the cast of eye of an antediluvian lizard the slowest old man of his time a sort of foreman of the farm before robert had come to take matters in hand and thrust both him and his master into the background master gammon remarked emphatically once and for all that he never had much opinion of london as he had never visited london his opinion was considered the less weighty but as he advanced no further speech the sins and backslidings of the metropolis were strongly brought to mind by his condemnatory utterance policy and dahlia's entreaties at last prevailed with the farmer and so the fair girl went up to the great city after months of a division that was like the division of her living veins and when the comfort of letters was getting cold rhoda having previously pledged herself to secresy though she could not guess why it was commanded received a miniature portrait of dahlia so beautiful that her envy of london for holding her sister away from her melted in gratitude she had permission to keep the portrait a week it was impossible to forbear from showing it to mrs sumfit who peeped in awe and that emotion subsiding shed tears abundantly why it was to be kept secret they failed to inquire the mystery was possibly not without its delights to them tears were shed again when the portrait had to be packed up and despatched rhoda lived on abashed by the adorable new refinement of dahlia's features and her heart yearned to her uncle for so caring to decorate the lovely face one day rhoda was at her bed room window on the point of descending to encounter the daily dumpling which was the principal and the unvarying item of the midday meal of the house when she beheld a stranger trying to turn the handle of the iron gate her heart thumped she divined correctly that it was her uncle dahlia had now been absent for very many months and rhoda's growing fretfulness sprang the conviction in her mind that something closer than letters must soon be coming she ran downstairs and along the gravel path he was a little man square built and looking as if he had worn to toughness with an evident sunday suit on black and black gloves though the day was only antecedent to sunday let me help you sir she said and her hands came in contact with his and were squeezed how is my sister she had no longer any fear in asking now you let me through first he replied imitating an arbitrary juvenile you're as tight locked in as if you was in dread of all the thieves of london you ain't afraid o' me miss i'm not the party generally outside of a fortification i ain't i can assure you i'm a defence party and a reg'lar lion when i've got the law backing me he spoke in a queer wheezy voice like a cracked flute combined with the effect of an ill resined fiddle bow you are in the garden of queen anne's farm said rhoda and you're my pretty little niece are you 'the darkie lass' as your father says little says i why you needn't be ashamed to stand beside a grenadier trust the country for growing fine gals you are my uncle then said rhoda tell me how my sister is is she well is she quite happy dahly returned old anthony slowly yes yes my sister rhoda looked at him with distressful eagerness now don't you be uneasy about your sister dahly old anthony as he spoke fixed his small brown eyes on the girl and seemed immediately to have departed far away in speculation a question recalled him is her health good ay stomach's good head's good lungs brain what not all good she's a bit giddy that's all in her head ay and on her pins never you mind you look a steady one my dear i shall take to you i think but my sister rhoda was saying when the farmer came out and sent a greeting from the threshold brother tony here he is brother william john surely and so he is at last the farmer walked up to him with his hand out and it ain't too late i hope eh it's never too late to mend said the farmer eh not my manners eh anthony struggled to keep up the ball and in this way they got over the confusion of the meeting after many years and some differences made acquaintance with rhoda i see said the farmer as they turned to go in the 'darkie lass' you write of she's like a coal nigh a candle she looks as you'd say 't' other side of her sister' yes we've had a talk just in time for dinner brother tony we ain't got much to offer but what there is is at your service step aside with me the farmer got anthony out of hearing a moment questioned and was answered after which he looked less anxious but a trifle perplexed and nodded his head as anthony occasionally lifted his to enforce certain points in some halting explanation you would have said that a debtor was humbly putting his case in his creditor's ear and could only now and then summon courage to meet the censorious eyes they went in to mrs sumfit's shout that the dumplings were out of the pot old anthony bowed upon the announcement of his name and all took seats but it was not the same sort of dinner hour as that which the inhabitants of the house were accustomed to there was conversation the farmer asked anthony by what conveyance he had come anthony shyly but not without evident self approbation related how having come by the train he got into conversation with the driver of a fly at a station who advised him of a cart that would be passing near wrexby for threepennyworth of beer he had got a friendly introduction to the carman who took him within two miles of the farm for one shilling a distance of fifteen miles that was pretty good home pork brother tony said the farmer approvingly and home made bread too brother william john said anthony becoming brisk ay and the beer such as it is the farmer drank and sighed anthony tried the beer remarking that's good beer it don't cost much it ain't adulterated by what i read of your london beer this stuff's not so bad if you bear in mind it's pure pure's my motto 'pure though poor' up there you pay for rank poison said anthony so what do i do i drink water and thank 'em that's wise saves stomach and purse the farmer put a little stress on 'purse' yes i calculate i save threepence a day in beer alone said anthony three times seven's twenty one ain't it mr fleming said this and let out his elbow in a small perplexity as anthony took him up and fifty two times twenty one well that's that's how much is that mas' gammon the farmer asked in a bellow master gammon was laboriously and steadily engaged in tightening himself with dumpling he relaxed his exertions sufficiently to take this new burden on his brain and immediately cast it off ah never thinks when i feeds ah was al'ays a bad hand at 'counts gi'es it up why you're like a horse that never was rode try again old man said the farmer if i drags a cart master gammon replied that ain't no reason why i should leap a gate the farmer felt that he was worsted as regarded the illustration and with a bit of the boy's fear of the pedagogue he fought anthony off by still pressing the arithmetical problem upon master gammon until the old man goaded to exasperation rolled out thunderingly if i works fer ye that ain't no reason why i should think fer ye which caused him to be left in peace eh robert the farmer transferred the question come what is it robert begged a minute's delay while anthony watched him with hawk eyes i tell you what it is it's pounds said robert this tickled anthony who let him escape crying capital pounds it is in your pocket sir and you hit that neatly i will say let it be five you out with your five at interest compound interest soon comes another five treat it the same in ten years eh and then you get into figures you swim in figures i should think you did said the farmer winking slyly anthony caught the smile hesitated and looked shrewd and then covered his confusion by holding his plate to mrs sumfit for a help the manifest evasion and mute declaration that dumpling said mum on that head gave the farmer a quiet glow when you are ready to tell me all about my darlin' sir mrs sumfit suggested coaxingly after dinner mother after dinner said the farmer and we're waitin' are we till them dumplings is finished she exclaimed piteously with a glance at master gammon's plate after dinner we'll have a talk mother mrs sumfit feared from this delay that there was queer news to be told of dahlia's temper but she longed for the narrative no whit the less and again cast a sad eye on the leisurely proceedings of master gammon the veteran was still calmly tightening his fork was on end with a vast mouthful impaled on the prongs master gammon a thoughtful eater was always last at the meal and a latent deep lying irritation at mrs sumfit for her fidgetiness day after day toward the finish of the dish added a relish to his engulfing of the monstrous morsel he looked at her steadily like an ox of the fields and consumed it and then holding his plate out in a remorseless way said you make 'em so good marm mrs sumfit fretted as she was was not impervious to the sound sense of the remark as well as to the compliment i don't want to hurry you mas' gammon she said lord knows i like to see you and everybody eat his full and be thankful but all about my dahly waitin' i feel pricked wi' a pin all over i do and there's my blessed in london she answered and we knowin' nothin' of her and one close by to tell me i never did feel what slow things dumplin's was afore now the kettle simmered gently on the hob every other knife and fork was silent so was every tongue master gammon ate and the kettle hummed twice mrs sumfit sounded a despairing oh deary me but it was useless no human power had ever yet driven master gammon to a demonstration of haste or to any acceleration of the pace he had chosen for himself at last she was not to be restrained from crying out almost tearfully when do you think you'll have done mas' gammon thus pointedly addressed master gammon laid down his knife and fork he half raised his ponderous curtaining eyelids and replied when i feels my buttons marm after which he deliberately fell to work again mrs sumfit dropped back in her chair as from a blow but even dumplings though they resist so doggedly for a space do ultimately submit to the majestic march of time and move master gammon cleared his plate there stood in the dish still half a dumpling the farmer and rhoda deeming that there had been a show of inhospitality pressed him to make away with this forlorn remainder the vindictive old man who was as tight as dumpling and buttons could make him refused it in a drooping tone and went forth looking at none mrs sumfit turned to all parties and begged them to say what more to please master gammon she could have done when anthony was ready to speak of her dahlia she obtruded this question in utter dolefulness robert was kindly asked by the farmer to take a pipe among them rhoda put a chair for him but he thanked them both and said he could not neglect some work to be done in the fields she thought that he feared pain from hearing dahlia's name and followed him with her eyes commiseratingly does that young fellow attend to business said anthony the farmer praised robert as a rare hand but one affected with bees in his nightcap who had ideas of his own about farming and was obstinate with them pays you due respect but's got a notion as how his way of thinking's better 'n his seniors it's the style now with all young folks makes a butt of old mas' gammon laughs at the old man it ain't respectful t' age i say gammon don't understand nothing about new feeds for sheep and dam nonsense about growing such things as melons fiddle faddle for 'em robert's a beginner what he knows i taught the young fellow then my question is where's his ideas come from if they're contrary to mine if they're contrary to mine they're contrary to my teaching well then what are they worth he can't see that he's a good one at work i'll say so much for him old anthony gave rhoda a pat on the shoulder chapter iii pipes in the middle of the day's regular revelry ejaculated anthony whose way of holding the curved pipe stem displayed a mind bent on reckless enjoyment and said as much as a label issuing from his mouth like a figure in a comic woodcut of the old style that's he pursued that's if you haven't got to look up at the clock every two minutes as if the devil was after you but sitting here you know the afternoon's a long evening nobody's your master you can on wi' your slippers up wi' your legs talk or go for'ard counting twicing and three timesing by george i should take to drinking beer if i had my afternoons to myself in the city just for the sake of sitting and doing sums in a tap room if it's a big tap room with pew sort o' places and dark red curtains a fire and a smell of sawdust ale and tobacco and a boy going by outside whistling a tune of the day somebody comes in ah there's an idle old chap he says to himself meaning me and where i should like to ask him 'd his head be if he sat there dividing two hundred and fifty thousand by forty five and a half the farmer nodded encouragingly he thought it not improbable that a short operation with these numbers would give the sum in anthony's possession the exact calculation of his secret hoard and he set to work to stamp them on his brain which rendered him absent in manner while mrs sumfit mixed liquor with hot water and pushed at his knee doubling in her enduring lips and lengthening her eyes to aim a side glance of reprehension at anthony's wandering loquacity rhoda could bear it no more now let me hear of my sister uncle she said i'll tell you what anthony responded she hasn't got such a pretty sort of a sweet blackbirdy voice as you've got the girl blushed scarlet oh she can mount them colours too said anthony his way of speaking of dahlia indicated that he and she had enough of one another but of the peculiar object of his extraordinary visit not even the farmer had received a hint mrs sumfit ventured to think aloud that his grog was not stiff enough but he took a gulp under her eyes and smacked his lips after it in a most convincing manner ah that stuff wouldn't do for me in london half holiday or no half holiday said anthony why not the farmer asked i should be speculating deep couldn't hold myself in mexicans peroovians venzeshoolians spaniards at 'em i should go i see bonds in all sorts of colours spaniards in black and white peruvians orange mexicans red as the british army well it's just my whim if i like red i go at red i ain't a bit of reason what's more i never speculate why that's safest brother tony said the farmer and safe's my game always was always will be do you think anthony sucked his grog to the sugar dregs till the spoon settled on his nose do you think i should hold the position i do hold be trusted as i am trusted ah you don't know much about that should i have money placed in my hands do you think and it's thousands at a time gold and notes and cheques if i was a risky chap i'm known to be thoroughly respectable five and forty years i've been in boyne's bank and thank ye ma'am grog don't do no harm down here and i will take another glass 'when the heart of a man' but i'm no singer mrs sumfit simpered hem it's the heart of a woman too and she have one and it's dying to hear of her darlin' blessed in town and of who cuts her hair and where she gets her gownds and whose pills the farmer interrupted her irritably divide a couple o' hundred thousand and more by forty five and a half he said do wait mother all in good time forty five and a half brother tony that was your sum ah you mentioned it some time back half of what is that half a fraction as they call it i haven't forgot fractions and logareems and practice and so on to algebrae where it always seems to me to blow hard for whizz goes my head in a jiffy as soon as i've mounted the ladder to look into that country how 'bout that forty five and a half brother tony if you don't mind condescending to explain forty five and a half muttered anthony mystified oh never mind you know if you don't like to say brother tony the farmer touched him up with his pipe stem five and a half anthony speculated that's a fraction you got hold of brother william john i remember the parson calling out those names at your wedding 'i william john take thee susan' yes that's a fraction but what's the good of it what i mean is it ain't forty five and half of forty five half of one eh that's identical with a fraction one a stroke and two under it you've got it correct anthony assented how many thousand divide it by divide what by brother william john i'm beat ah out comes the keys lockup everything it's time the farmer laughed rather proud of his brother in law's perfect wakefulness after two stiff tumblers he saw that anthony was determined with all due friendly feeling to let no one know the sum in his possession if it's four o'clock it is time to lock up said anthony and bang to go the doors and there's the money for thieves to dream of they can't get a nigh it let them dream as they like what's the hour ma'am not three it ain't returned mrs sumfit and do be good creatures and begin about my dahly and where she got that bumptious gownd and the bonnet with blue flowers lyin' by on the table now do rhoda coughed and she wears lavender gloves like a lady mrs sumfit was continuing rhoda stamped on her foot oh cruel the comfortable old woman snapped in pain as she applied her hand to the inconsolable fat foot and nursed it what's roused ye you tiger girl i shan't be able to get about i shan't and then who's to cook for ye all for you're as ignorant as a raw kitchen wench and knows nothing come dody you're careless the farmer spoke chidingly through mrs sumfit's lamentations she stops uncle anthony when he's just ready father said rhoda do you want to know anthony set his small eyes on her do you want to know my dear he paused fingering his glass and went on i susan take thee william john and you've come of it says i to myself when i hung sheepish by your mother and by your father my dear says i to myself i ain't a marrying man and if these two says i if any progeny comes to 'em to bless them some people'd say but i know what life is and what young ones are if where was i liquor makes you talk brother william john but where's your ideas gone like hard cash what i meant was i felt i might some day come for'ard and help the issue of your wife's weddin' and wasn't such a shady object among you after all my pipe's out rhoda stood up and filled the pipe and lit it in silence she divined that the old man must be allowed to run on in his own way and for a long time he rambled gave a picture of the wedding and of a robbery of boyne's bank the firm of boyne burt hamble and company at last he touched on dahlia what she wants i can't make out he said and what that good lady there or somebody made mention of how she manages to dress as she do i can understand a little goin' a great way if you're clever in any way but i'm at my tea anthony laid his hand out as to exhibit a picture i ain't a complaining man and be young if you can i say and walk about and look at shops but i'm at my tea i come home rather tired there's the tea things sure enough and tea's made and maybe there's a shrimp or two she attends to your creature comforts when everything's locked up and tight and right i'm gay and ask for a bit of society well i'm at my tea i hear her foot thumping up and down her bed room overhead i know the meaning of that i'd rather hear nothing down she runs i'm at my tea and in she bursts here followed a dramatic account of dahlia's manner of provocation which was closed by the extinction of his pipe the farmer while his mind still hung about thousands of pounds and a certain incomprehensible division of them to produce a distinct intelligible total and set before him the sum of anthony's riches could see that his elder daughter was behaving flightily and neglecting the true interests of the family and he was chagrined but anthony before he entered the house had assured him that dahlia was well and that nothing was wrong with her so he looked at mrs sumfit who now took upon herself to plead for dahlia a young thing and such a handsome creature and we were all young some time or other and would heaven have mercy on us if we were hard upon the young do you think the motto of a truly religious man said try 'em again and maybe people had been a little hard upon dahlia and the girl was apt to take offence in conclusion she appealed to rhoda to speak up for her sister rhoda sat in quiet reserve she was sure her sister must be justified in all she did but the picture of the old man coming from his work every night to take his tea quite alone made her sad she found herself unable to speak and as she did not mrs sumfit had an acute twinge from her recently trodden foot and called her some bitter names which was not an unusual case for the kind old woman could be querulous and belonged to the list of those whose hearts are as scales so that they love not one person devotedly without a corresponding spirit of opposition to another rhoda merely smiled by and by the women left the two men alone anthony turned and struck the farmer's knee you've got a jewel in that gal brother william john eh she's a good enough lass not much of a manager brother tony too much of a thinker i reckon she's got a temper of her own too i'm a bit hurt brother tony about that other girl she must leave london if she don't alter it's flightiness that's all you mustn't think ill of poor dahly she was always the pretty one and when they know it they act up to it she was her mother's favourite ah poor susan an upright woman before the lord she was said the farmer bowing his head and a good wife anthony interjected none better never a better and i wish she was living to look after her girls i came through the churchyard hard by said anthony and i read that writing on her tombstone it went like a choke in my throat the first person i saw next was her child this young gal you call rhoda and thinks i to myself you might ask me i'd do anything for ye that i could of course the farmer's eye had lit up but became overshadowed by the characteristic reservation nobody'd ask you to do more than you could he remarked rather coldly it'll never be much sighed anthony well the world's nothing if you come to look at it close the farmer adopted a similar tone what's money said anthony the farmer immediately resumed his this worldliness well it's fine to go about asking us poor devils to answer ye that he said and chuckled conceiving that he had nailed anthony down to a partial confession of his ownership of some worldly goods what do you call having money observed the latter clearly in the trap fifty thousand whew went the farmer as at a big draught of powerful stuff ten thousand mr fleming took this second gulp almost contemptuously but still kindly come quoth anthony ten thousand's not so mean you know you're a gentleman on ten thousand so on five i'll tell ye many a gentleman'd be glad to own it lor' bless you but you know nothing of the world brother william john some of 'em haven't one ain't so rich as you or you brother tony the farmer made a grasp at his will o' the wisp oh me anthony sniggered i'm a scraper of odds and ends i pick up things in the gutter mind you those jews ain't such fools though a curse is on 'em to wander forth they know the meaning of the multiplication table they can turn fractions into whole numbers no i'm not to be compared to gentlemen my property's my respectability i said that at the beginning and i say it now but i'll tell you what brother william john it's an emotion when you've got bags of thousands of pounds in your arms ordinarily the farmer was a sensible man as straight on the level of dull intelligence as other men but so credulous was he in regard to the riches possessed by his wife's brother that a very little tempted him to childish exaggeration of the probable amount now that anthony himself furnished the incitement he was quite lifted from the earth he had besides taken more of the strong mixture than he was ever accustomed to take in the middle of the day and as it seemed to him that anthony was really about to be seduced into a particular statement of the extent of the property which formed his respectability as anthony had chosen to put it he got up a little game in his head by guessing how much the amount might positively be so that he could subsequently compare his shrewd reckoning with the avowed fact he tamed his wild ideas as much as possible thought over what his wife used to say of anthony's saving ways from boyhood thought of the dark hints of the funds of many bold strokes for money made by sagacious persons of anthony's close style of living and of the lives of celebrated misers this done he resolved to make a sure guess and therefore aimed below the mark money when the imagination deals with it thus has no substantial relation to mortal affairs it is a tricksy thing distending and contracting as it dances in the mind like sunlight on the ceiling cast from a morning tea cup if a forced simile will aid the conception the farmer struck on thirty thousand and some odd hundred pounds outlying debts or so excluded as what anthony's will in all likelihood would be sworn under say thirty thousand or safer say twenty thousand bequeathed how to him and to his children but to the children in reversion after his decease or how in any case they might make capital marriages and the farm estate should go to whichever of the two young husbands he liked the best farmer fleming asked not for any life of ease and splendour though thirty thousand pounds was a fortune or even twenty thousand noblemen have stooped to marry heiresses owning no more than that the idea of their having done so actually shot across him and his heart sent up a warm spring of tenderness toward the patient good grubbing old fellow sitting beside him who had lived and died to enrich and elevate the family at the same time he could not refrain from thinking that anthony broad shouldered as he was though bent sound on his legs and well coloured for a londoner would be accepted by any life insurance office at a moderate rate considering his age the farmer thought of his own health and it was with a pang that he fancied himself being probed by the civil speaking life insurance doctor a gentleman who seems to issue upon us applicants from out the muffled folding doors of hades taps us on the chest once twice and forthwith writes down our fateful dates probably anthony would not have to pay a higher rate of interest than he are you insured brother tony the question escaped him no i ain't brother william john anthony went on nodding like an automaton set in motion there's two sides to that i'm a long lived man long lived men don't insure that is unless they're fools that's how the offices thrive case of accident the farmer suggested oh nothing happens to me replied anthony the farmer jumped on his legs and yawned shall we take a turn in the garden brother tony with all my heart brother william john the farmer had conscience to be ashamed of the fit of irritable vexation which had seized on him and it was not till anthony being asked the date of his birth had declared himself twelve years his senior that the farmer felt his speculations to be justified anthony was nearly a generation ahead they walked about and were seen from the windows touching one another on the shoulder in a brotherly way when they came back to the women and tea the farmer's mind was cooler and all his reckonings had gone to mist he was dejected over his tea what is the matter father said rhoda i'll tell you my dear anthony replied for him he's envying me some one i want to ask me that question when i'm at my tea in london chapter iv mr fleming kept his forehead from his daughter's good night kiss until the room was cleared after supper and then embracing her very heartily he informed her that her uncle had offered to pay her expenses on a visit to london by which he contrived to hint that a golden path had opened to his girl and at the same time entreated her to think nothing of it to dismiss all expectations and dreams of impossible sums from her mind and simply to endeavour to please her uncle who had a right to his own and a right to do what he liked with his own though it were forty fifty times as much as he possessed and what that might amount to no one knew in fact as is the way with many experienced persons in his attempt to give advice to another he was very impressive in lecturing himself and warned that other not to succumb to a temptation principally by indicating the natural basis of the allurement happily for young and for old the intense insight of the young has much to distract or soften it rhoda thanked her father and chose to think that she had listened to good and wise things your sister he said but we won't speak of her if i could part with you my lass i'd rather she was the one to come back dahlia would be killed by our quiet life now said rhoda ay the farmer mused if she'd got to pay six men every saturday night she wouldn't complain o' the quiet but there you neither of you ever took to farming or to housekeeping but any gentleman might be proud to have one of you for a wife i said so when you was girls and if you've been dull my dear what's the good o' society tea cakes mayn't seem to cost money nor a glass o' grog to neighbours but once open the door to that sort o' thing and your reckoning goes and what i said to your poor mother's true i said our girls they're mayhap not equals of the hollands the nashaws the perrets and the others about here no they're not equals because the others are not equals o' them maybe the yeoman's pride struggled out in this obscure way to vindicate his unneighbourliness and the seclusion of his daughters from the society of girls of their age and condition nor was it hard for rhoda to assure him as she earnestly did that he had acted rightly rhoda assisted by mrs sumfit was late in the night looking up what poor decorations she possessed wherewith to enter london and be worthy of her sister's embrace so that she might not shock the lady dahlia had become depend you on it my dear said mrs sumfit my dahly's grown above him that's nettles to your uncle my dear he can't abide it don't you see he can't some men's like that others 'd see you dressed like a princess and not be satisfied they vary so the teasin' creatures but one and all whether they likes it or not owns a woman's the better for bein' dressed in the fashion what do grieve me to my insidest heart it is your bonnet what a bonnet that was lying beside her dear round arm in the po'trait and her finger up making a dimple in her cheek as if she was thinking of us in a sorrowful way that's the arts o' being lady like look sad like how could we get a bonnet for you my own must do said rhoda yes and you to look like lady and servant gal a goin' out for an airin' and she to feel it pretty that'd be she won't be ashamed of me rhoda faltered and then hummed a little tune and said firmly it's no use my trying to look like what i'm not no truly mrs sumfit assented but it's your bein' behind the fashions what hurt me as well you might be an old thing like me for any pleasant looks you'll git now the country you're like in a coalhole for the matter o' that while london my dear its pavement and gutter and omnibus traffic and if you're not in the fashion the little wicked boys of the streets themselves 'll let you know it they've got such eyes for fashions they have and i don't want my dahly's sister to be laughed at and called 'coal scuttle' as happened to me my dear believe it or not and shoved aside and said to 'who are you' for she reely is nice looking your uncle anthony and mr robert agreed upon that rhoda coloured and said after a time it would please me if people didn't speak about my looks the looking glass probably told her no more than that she was nice to the eye but a young man who sees anything should not see like a mirror and a girl's instinct whispers to her that her image has not been taken to heart when she is accurately and impartially described by him the key to rhoda at this period was a desire to be made warm with praise of her person she beheld her face at times and shivered the face was so strange with its dark thick eyebrows and peculiarly straight gazing brown eyes the level long red under lip and curved upper and the chin and nose so unlike dahlia's whose nose was after a little dip from the forehead one soft line to its extremity and whose chin seemed shaped to a cup rhoda's outlines were harder there was a suspicion of a heavenward turn to her nose and of squareness to her chin her face when studied inspired in its owner's mind a doubt of her being even nice to the eye though she knew that in exercise and when smitten by a blush brightness and colour aided her claims she knew also that her head was easily poised on her neck and that her figure was reasonably good but all this was unconfirmed knowledge quickly shadowed by the doubt as the sun is wanted to glorify the right features of a landscape this girl thirsted for a dose of golden flattery she felt without envy of her sister that dahlia eclipsed her and all she prayed for was that she might not be quite so much in the background and obscure but great powerful london the new universe to her spirit was opening its arms to her in her half sleep that night she heard the mighty thunder of the city crashing tumults of disordered harmonies and the splendour of the lamp lighted city appeared to hang up under a dark blue heaven removed from earth like a fresh planet to which she was being beckoned at breakfast on the sunday morning her departure was necessarily spoken of in public robert talked to her exactly as he had talked to dahlia on the like occasion he mentioned as she remembered in one or two instances the names of the same streets and professed a similar anxiety as regarded driving her to the station and catching the train that's a thing which makes a man feel his strength's nothing he said you can't stop it i fancy i could stop a four in hand at full gallop mind i only fancy i could but when you come to do with iron and steam i feel like a baby you can't stop trains you can trip 'em said anthony a remark that called forth general laughter and increased the impression that he was a man of resources rhoda was vexed by robert's devotion to his strength she was going and wished to go but she wished to be regretted as well and she looked at him more he on the contrary scarcely looked at her at all he threw verbal turnips oats oxen poultry and every possible melancholy matter of fact thing about the table described the farm and his fondness for it and the neighbourhood said a farmer's life was best and gave rhoda a week in which to be tired of london she sneered in her soul thinking how little he knows of the constancy in the nature of women adding when they form attachments anthony was shown at church in spite of a feeble intimation he expressed that it would be agreeable to him to walk about in the march sunshine and see the grounds and the wild flowers which never gave trouble nor cost a penny and were always pretty and worth twenty of your artificial contrivances same as i say to miss dahly he took occasion to remark but no no good i don't believe women hear ye when you talk sense of that kind 'look' says i 'at a violet' 'look' says she 'at a rose' well what can ye say after that she swears the rose looks best you swear the violet costs least then there you have a battle between what it costs and how it looks robert pronounced a conventional affirmative when called on for it by a look from anthony whereupon rhoda cried out dahlia was right she was right uncle she was right my dear if she was a ten thousander she wasn't right as a farmer's daughter with poor expectations i'd say humble if humble she were as a farmer's daughter she should choose the violet side that's clear as day one thing's good i admit she tells me she makes her own bonnets and they're as good as milliners' and that's a proud matter to say of your own niece and to buy dresses for herself i suppose she's sat down and she made dresses for fine ladies i've found her at it save the money for the work says i what does she reply she always has a reply 'uncle i know the value of money better 'you mean you spend it' i says to her 'i buy more than it's worth' says she and i'll tell you what mr robert armstrong as i find your name to be sir if you beat women at talking my lord you're a clever chap robert laughed i give in at the first mile don't think much of women is that it sir i'm glad to say i don't think of them at all do you think of one woman now mr robert armstrong i'd much rather think of two and why may i ask it's safer now i don't exactly see that said anthony you set one to tear the other robert explained you're a grand turk mogul in your reasonings of women mr robert armstrong i hope as your morals are sound sir they were on the road to church but robert could not restrain a swinging outburst he observed that he hoped likewise that his morals were sound because said anthony do you see sir two wives no no one wife interposed robert you said 'think about' i'd 'think about' any number of women if i was idle but the woman you mean to make your wife you go to at once and don't 'think about' her or the question either you make sure of her do you sir no i try my luck that is all suppose she won't have ye then i wait for her suppose she gets married to somebody else well you know i shouldn't cast eye on a woman who was a fool well upon my anthony checked his exclamation returning to the charge with just suppose for the sake of supposing supposing she was a fool and gone and got married and you thrown back'ard on one leg starin' at the other stupified like i don't mind supposing it said robert say she's a fool her being a fool argues that i was one in making a fool's choice so she jilts me and i get a pistol or i get a neat bit of rope or i take a clean header with a cannon ball at my heels or i go to the chemist's and ask for stuff to poison rats anything a fool'd do under the circumstances it don't matter what old anthony waited for rhoda to jump over a stile and said to her he laughs at the whole lot of ye who she asked with betraying cheeks this mr robert armstrong of yours of mine uncle he don't seem to care a snap o' the finger for any of ye then none of us must care for him uncle now just the contrary that always shows a young fellow who's attending to his business if he'd seen you boil potatoes make dumplings beds tea all that you'd have had a chance he'd have marched up to ye before you was off to london saying 'you are the woman' rhoda was too desperately tickled by the idea to refrain from uttering it though she was angry and suffering internal discontent or else 'you are the cook' she muttered and shut with the word steel bars across her heart calling him mentally names not justified by anything he had said or done such as mercenary tyrannical and such like robert was attentive to her in church once she caught him with his eyes on her face but he betrayed no confusion and looked away at the clergyman when the text was given out he found the place in his bible and handed it to her pointedly there shall be snares and traps unto you a line from joshua she received the act as a polite pawing civility but when she was coming out of church robert saw that a blush swept over her face and wondered what thoughts could be rising within her unaware that girls catch certain meanings late and suffer a fiery torture when these meanings are clear to them rhoda called up the pride of her womanhood that she might despise the man who had dared to distrust her she kept her poppy colour throughout the day so sensitive was this pride but most she was angered after reflection by the doubts which robert appeared to cast on dahlia in setting his finger upon that burning line of scripture it opened a whole black kingdom to her imagination and first touched her visionary life with shade she was sincere in her ignorance that the doubts were her own but they lay deep in unawakened recesses of the soul it was by a natural action of her reason that she transferred and forced them upon him who had chanced to make them visible chapter v when young minds are set upon a distant object they scarcely live for anything about them the drive to the station and the parting with robert the journey to london which had latterly seemed to her secretly distressed anticipation like a sunken city a place of wonder with the waters over it all passed by smoothly and then it became necessary to call a cabman for whom as he did her the service to lift her box rhoda felt a gracious respect until a quarrel ensued between him and her uncle concerning sixpence a poor sum as she thought but representing as anthony impressed upon her understanding during the conflict of hard words a principle those who can persuade themselves that they are fighting for a principle fight strenuously and maybe reckoned upon to overmatch combatants on behalf of a miserable small coin so the cabman went away discomfited he used such bad language that rhoda had no pity for him and hearing her uncle style it the london tongue she thought dispiritedly of dahlia's having had to listen to it through so long a season dahlia was not at home but mrs wicklow anthony's landlady undertook to make rhoda comfortable which operation she began by praising dark young ladies over fair ones at the same time shaking rhoda's arm that she might not fail to see a compliment was intended this is our london way she said but rhoda was most disconcerted when she heard mrs wicklow relate that her daughter and dahlia were out together and say that she had no doubt they had found some pleasant and attentive gentleman for a companion if they had not gone purposely to meet one her thoughts of her sister were perplexed and london seemed a gigantic net around them both yes that's the habit with the girls up here said anthony that's what fine bonnets mean rhoda dropped into a bitter depth of brooding the savage nature of her virgin pride was such that it gave her great suffering even to suppose that a strange gentleman would dare to address her sister she half fashioned the words on her lips that she had dreamed of a false zion and was being righteously punished by and by the landlady's daughter returned home alone saying with a dreadful laugh that dahlia had sent her for her bible but she would give no explanation of the singular mission which had been entrusted to her and she showed no willingness to attempt to fulfil it merely repeating her bible with a vulgar exhibition of simulated scorn that caused rhoda to shrink from her though she would gladly have poured out a multitude of questions in the ear of one who had last been with her beloved after a while mrs wicklow looked at the clock and instantly became overclouded with an extreme gravity eleven and she sent mary ann home for her bible this looks bad i call it hypocritical the idea of mentioning the bible now if she had said to mary ann go and fetch any other book but a bible it was mother's bible interposed rhoda mrs wicklow replied and i wish all young women to be as innocent as you my dear you'll get you to bed you're a dear mild sweet good young woman i'm never deceived in character vaunting her penetration she accompanied rhoda to dahlia's chamber bidding her sleep speedily or that when her sister came they would be talking till the cock crowed hoarse there's a poultry yard close to us said rhoda feeling less at home when she heard that there was not the night was quiet and clear she leaned her head out of the window and heard the mellow sunday evening roar of the city as of a sea at ebb and dahlia was out on the sea rhoda thought of it as she looked at the row of lamps and listened to the noise remote until the sight of stars was pleasant as the faces of friends people are kind here she reflected for her short experience of the landlady was good and a young gentleman who had hailed a cab for her at the station had a nice voice he was fair i am dark came a spontaneous reflection she undressed and half dozing over her beating heart in bed heard the street door open and leaped to think that her sister approached jumping up in her bed to give ear to the door and the stairs that were conducting her joy to her but she quickly recomposed herself and feigned sleep for the delight of revelling in her sister's first wonderment the door was flung wide and rhoda heard her name called by dahlia's voice and then there was a delicious silence and she felt that dahlia was coming up to her on tiptoe and waited for her head to be stooped near that she might fling out her arms and draw the dear head to her bosom but dahlia came only to the bedside without leaning over and spoke of her looks which held the girl quiet how she sleeps it's a country sleep dahlia murmured she's changed but it's all for the better she's quite a woman she's a perfect brunette and the nose i used to laugh at suits her face and those black thick eyebrows of hers my pet oh why is she here what's meant by it i knew nothing of her coming is she sent on purpose rhoda did not stir the tone of dahlia's speaking low and almost awful to her laid a flat hand on her and kept her still i came for my bible she heard dahlia say i promised mother oh my poor darling mother and dody lying in my bed who would have thought of such things perhaps heaven does look after us and interfere what will become of me oh you pretty innocent in your sleep i lie for hours and can't sleep she binds her hair in a knot on the pillow just as she used to in the old farm days rhoda knew that her sister was bending over her now but she was almost frigid and could not move dahlia went to the looking glass how flushed i am she murmured no i'm pale quite white i've lost my strength what can i do how could i take mother's bible and run from my pretty one who expects me and dreams she'll wake with me beside her in the morning i can't i can't if you love me edward you won't wish it she fell into a chair crying wildly and muffling her sobs rhoda's eyelids grew moist but wonder and the cold anguish of senseless sympathy held her still frost bound all at once she heard the window open some one spoke in the street below some one uttered dahlia's name a deep bell swung a note of midnight go cried dahlia the window was instantly shut the vibration of dahlia's voice went through rhoda like the heavy shaking of the bell after it had struck and the room seemed to spin and hum it was to her but another minute before her sister slid softly into the bed and they were locked together chapter vi boyne's bank was of the order of those old and firmly fixed establishments which have taken root with the fortunes of the country are honourable as england's name solid as her prosperity and even as the flourishing green tree to shareholders a granite house boyne himself had been disembodied for more than a century burt and hamble were still of the flesh but a greater than burt or hamble was blancove the sir william blancove baronet of city feasts and charities who besides being a wealthy merchant possessed of a very acute head for banking was a scholarly gentleman worthy of riches his brother was squire blancove of wrexby but between these two close relatives there existed no stronger feeling than what was expressed by open contempt of a mind dedicated to business on the one side and quiet contempt of a life devoted to indolence on the other nevertheless squire blancove though everybody knew how deeply he despised his junior for his city gained title and commercial occupation sent him his son algernon to get the youth into sound discipline if possible this was after the elastic algernon had on the paternal intimation of his colonel relinquished his cornetcy and military service sir william received the hopeful young fellow much in the spirit with which he listened to the tales of his brother's comments on his own line of conduct that is to say as homage to his intellectual superiority mr algernon was installed in the bank and sat down for a long career of groaning at the desk with more complacency than was expected from him sir william forwarded excellent accounts to his brother of the behaviour of the heir to his estates it was his way of rebuking the squire and in return for it the squire though somewhat comforted despised his clerkly son and lived to learn how very unjustly he did so adolescents who have the taste for running into excesses enjoy the breath of change as another form of excitement change is a sort of debauch to them they will delight infinitely in a simple country round of existence in propriety and church going in the sensation of feeling innocent there is little that does not enrapture them if you tie them down to nothing and let them try all sir william was deceived by his nephew he would have taken him into his town house but his own son edward who was studying for the law had chambers in the temple and algernon receiving an invitation from edward declared a gentle preference for the abode of his cousin his allowance from his father was properly contracted to keep him from excesses as the genius of his senior devised and sir william saw no objection to the scheme and made none the two dined with him about twice in the month edward blancove was three and twenty years old a student by fits and a young man given to be moody he had powers of gaiety far eclipsing algernon's but he was not the same easy tripping sinner and flippant soul he was in that yeasty condition of his years when action and reflection alternately usurp the mind remorse succeeded dissipation and indulgences offered the soporific to remorse the friends of the two imagined that algernon was or would become his evil genius in reality edward was the perilous companion he was composed of better stuff algernon was but an airy animal nature the soul within him being an effervescence lightly let loose edward had a fatally serious spirit and one of some strength what he gave himself up to he could believe to be correct in the teeth of an opposing world until he tired of it when he sided as heartily with the world against his quondam self algernon might mislead or point his cousin's passions for a time yet if they continued their courses together there was danger that algernon would degenerate into a reckless subordinate a minister a valet and be tempted unknowingly to do things in earnest which is nothing less than perdition to this sort of creature but the key to young men is the ambition or in the place of it the romantic sentiment nourished by them edward aspired to become attorney general of these realms not a judge you observe for a judge is to the imagination of youthful minds a stationary being venerable but not active whereas your attorney general is always in the fray and fights commonly on the winning side a point that renders his position attractive to sagacious youth algernon had other views civilization had tried him and found him wanting so he condemned it moreover sitting now all day at a desk he was civilization's drudge no wonder then that his dream was of prairies and primeval forests and australian wilds he believed in his heart that he would be a man new made over there and always looked forward to savage life as to a bath that would cleanse him so that it did not much matter his being unclean for the present the young men had a fair cousin by marriage a mrs margaret lovell a widow at seventeen she had gone with her husband to india where harry lovell encountered the sword of a sikh sirdar and tried the last of his much vaunted swordsmanship which with his skill at the pistols had served him better in two antecedent duels for the vindication of his lovely and terrible young wife he perished on the field critically admiring the stroke to which he owed his death a week after harry's burial his widow was asked in marriage by his colonel captains and a giddy subaltern likewise disputed claims to possess her she however decided to arrest further bloodshed by quitting the regiment she always said that she left india to save her complexion and people don't know how very candid i am she added for the colonel above mentioned was wealthy a man expectant of a title and a good match and she was laughed at when she thus assigned trivial reasons for momentous resolutions it is a luxury to be candid and perfect candour can do more for us than a dark disguise mrs lovell's complexion was worth saving from the ravages of an indian climate and the persecution of claimants to her hand she was golden and white like an autumnal birch tree yellow hair with warm toned streaks in it shading a fabulously fair skin then too she was tall of a nervous build supple and proud in motion a brilliant horsewoman and a most distinguished sitter in an easy drawing room chair which is let me impress upon you no mean quality after riding out for hours with a sweet comrade who has thrown the mantle of dignity half way off her shoulders it is perplexing and mixed strangely of humiliation and ecstasy to come upon her clouded majesty where she reclines as upon rose hued clouds in a mystic circle of restriction she who laughed at your jokes and capped them two hours ago a queen between margaret lovell and edward there was a misunderstanding of which no one knew the nature for they spoke in public very respectfully one of the other it had been supposed that they were lovers once but when lovers quarrel they snarl they bite they worry their eyes are indeed unveiled and their mouths unmuzzled now margaret said of edward he is sure to rise he has such good principles edward said of margaret she only wants a husband who will keep her well in hand these sentences scarcely carried actual compliments when you knew the speakers but outraged lovers cannot talk in that style after they have broken apart it is possible that margaret and edward conveyed to one another as sharp a sting as envenomed lovers attempt gossip had once betrothed them but was now at fault the lady had a small jointure and lived partly with her uncle lord elling partly with squire blancove her aunt's husband and a little by herself which was when she counted money in her purse and chose to assert her independence she had a name in the world there is a fate attached to some women from helen of troy downward that blood is to be shed for them one duel on behalf of a woman is a reputation to her for life two are notoriety if she is very young can they be attributable to her we charge them naturally to her overpowering beauty it happened that mrs lovell was beautiful under the light of the two duels her beauty shone as from an illumination of black flame boys adored mrs lovell these are moths but more the birds of air nay grave owls who stand in this metaphor for whiskered experience thronged dashing at the apparition of terrible splendour was it her fault that she had a name in the world mrs margaret lovell's portrait hung in edward's room it was a photograph exquisitely coloured and was on the left of a dark judith dark with a serenity of sternness on the right hung another coloured photograph of a young lady also fair and it was a point of taste to choose between them do you like the hollowed lily's cheeks or the plump rose's do you like a thinnish fall of golden hair or an abundant cluster of nut brown do you like your blonde with limpid blue eyes or prefer an endowment of sunny hazel finally are you taken by an air of artistic innocence winding serpentine about your heart's fibres or is blushing simplicity sweeter to you mrs lovell's eyebrows were the faintly marked trace of a perfect arch the other young person's were thickish more level a full brown colour she looked as if she had not yet attained to any sense of her being a professed beauty but the fair widow was clearly bent upon winning you and had a shy playful intentness of aspect her pure white skin was flat on the bone the lips came forward in a soft curve and if they were not artistically stained were triumphantly fresh here in any case she beat her rival whose mouth had the plebeian beauty's fault of being too straight in a line and was not trained apparently to tricks of dainty pouting it was morning and the cousins having sponged in pleasant cold water arranged themselves for exercise and came out simultaneously into the sitting room slippered and in flannels they nodded and went through certain curt greetings and then algernon stepped to a cupboard and tossed out the leather gloves the room was large and they had a tolerable space for the work when the breakfast table had been drawn a little on one side you saw at a glance which was the likelier man of the two when they stood opposed algernon's rounded features full lips and falling chin were not a match though he was quick on his feet for the wary prompt eyes set mouth and hardness of edward both had stout muscle but in edward there was vigour of brain as well which seemed to knit and inform his shape without which in fact a man is as a ship under no command both looked their best as when sparring men always do look now then said algernon squaring up to his cousin in good style now's the time for that unwholesome old boy underneath to commence groaning step as light as you can replied edward meeting him with the pretty motion of the gloves i'll step as light as a french dancing master let's go to paris and learn the savate ned it must be a new sensation to stand on one leg and knock a fellow's hat off with the other stick to your fists hang it i wish your fists wouldn't stick to me so you talk too much gad i don't get puffy half so soon as you i want country air you said you were going out old ned i changed my mind saying which edward shut his teeth and talked for two or three hot minutes wholly with his fists the room shook under algernon's boundings to right and left till a blow sent him back on the breakfast table shattered a cup on the floor and bespattered his close flannel shirt with a funereal coffee tinge what the deuce i said to bring that on myself i don't know algernon remarked as he rose anything connected with the country disagreeable to you ned come a bout of quiet scientific boxing and none of these beastly rushes as if you were singling me out of a crowd of magsmen did you go to church yesterday ned confound it you're on me again are you and algernon went on spouting unintelligible talk under a torrent of blows he lost his temper and fought out at them but as it speedily became evident to him that the loss laid him open to punishment he prudently recovered it sparred danced about and contrived to shake the room in a manner that caused edward to drop his arms in consideration for the distracted occupant of the chambers below algernon accepted the truce and made it peace by casting off one glove there that's a pleasant morning breather he said and sauntered to the window to look at the river i always feel the want of it when i don't get it i could take a thrashing rather than not on with the gloves to begin the day look at those boats fancy my having to go down to the city it makes me feel like my blood circulating the wrong way my father'll suffer some day for keeping me at this low ebb of cash by jingo he uttered this with a prophetic fierceness i cannot even scrape together enough for entrance money to a club it's sickening i wonder whether i shall ever get used to banking work there's an old clerk in our office who says he should feel ill if he missed a day and the old porter beats him bangs him to fits i believe he'd die off if he didn't see the house open to the minute they say that old boy's got a pretty niece but he don't bring her to the office now reward of merit mr anthony hackbut is going to receive ten pounds a year extra that's for his honesty i wonder whether i could earn a reputation for the sake of a prospect of ten extra pounds to my salary i've got a salary hurrah but if they keep me to my hundred and fifty per annum don't let them trust me every day with the bags as they do that old fellow some of the men say he's good to lend fifty pounds at a pinch are the chops coming ned the chops are coming said edward who had thrown on a boating coat and plunged into a book and spoke echoing here's little peggy lovell algernon faced this portrait it don't do her justice she's got more life more change in her more fire she's starting for town i hear she is starting for town said edward how do you know that algernon swung about to ask edward looked round to him by the fact of your not having fished for a holiday this week how did you leave her yesterday algy quite well i hope the ingenuous face of the young gentleman crimsoned oh she was well he said ha i see there can be some attraction in your dark women you mean that judith yes she's a good diversion edward gave a two edged response what train did you come up by last night the last from wrexby that reminds me i saw a young judith just as i got out she wanted a cab i called it for her she belongs to old hackbut of the bank the old porter you know if it wasn't that there's always something about dark women which makes me think they're going to have a moustache i should take to that girl's face edward launched forth an invective against fair women what have they done to you what have they done said algernon my good fellow they're nothing but colour they've no conscience if they swear a thing to you one moment they break it the next they can't help doing it you don't ask a gilt weathercock to keep faith with anything but the wind do you it's an ass that trusts a fair woman at all or has anything to do with the confounded set cleopatra was fair so was delilah so is the devil's wife reach me that book of reports by jingo cried algernon my stomach reports that if provision doesn't soon approach why don't you keep a french cook here ned let's give up the women and take to a french cook edward yawned horribly all in good time it's what we come to it's philosophy your french cook i wish i had it or him i'm afraid a fellow can't anticipate his years not so lucky by jove we shall have to be philosophers before we breakfast algernon exclaimed it's nine i've to be tied to the stake at ten chained and muzzled a leetle a dawg i wish i hadn't had to leave the service it was a vile conspiracy against me there ned hang all tradesmen i sit on a stool and add up figures i work harder than a nigger in the office that's my life but i must feed it's no use going to the office in a rage will you try on the gloves again was edward's mild suggestion algernon thanked him and replied that he knew him edward hit hard when he was empty they now affected patience as far as silence went to make up an element of that sublime quality the chops arriving they disdained the mask algernon fired his glove just over the waiter's head and edward put the ease to the man's conscience after which they sat and ate talking little the difference between them was that edward knew the state of algernon's mind and what was working within it while the latter stared at a blank wall as regarded edward's going out after breakfast ned said algernon we'll walk to the city together if you like edward fixed one of his intent looks upon his cousin you're not going to the city to day the deuce i'm not you're going to dance attendance on mrs lovell whom it's your pleasure to call peggy when you're some leagues out of her hearing algernon failed to command his countenance he glanced at one of the portraits and said who is that girl up there tell us her name talking of mrs lovell has she ever seen it if you'll put on your coat my dear algy i will talk to you about mrs lovell edward kept his penetrative eyes on algernon listen to me you'll get into a mess there if i must listen ned i'll listen in my shirt sleeves with all respect to the lady very well the shirt sleeves help the air of bravado now you know that i've what they call 'knelt at her feet' she's handsome don't cry out she's dashing and as near being a devil as any woman i ever met do you know why we broke i'll tell you plainly because i refused to believe that one of her men had insulted her you understand what that means i declined to be a chief party in a scandal declined to fight the fellow interposed algernon more shame to you i think you're a year younger than i am algy you have the privilege of speaking with that year's simplicity mrs lovell will play you as she played me i acknowledge her power and i keep out of her way i don't bet i don't care to waltz i can't keep horses so i don't lose much by the privation to which i subject myself i bet i waltz and i ride so said algernon i should lose tremendously you will lose mark my words is the lecture of my year's senior concluded said algernon yes i've done edward answered then i'll put on my coat ned and i'll smoke in it that'll give you assurance i'm not going near mrs lovell if anything will that gives me assurance that mrs lovell tolerates in you what she detests said edward relentless in his insight and consequently gives me assurance that she finds you of particular service to her at present algernon had a lighted match in his hand he flung it into the fire i'm hanged if i don't think you have the confounded vanity to suppose she sets me as a spy upon you a smile ran along edward's lips i don't think you'd know it if she did oh you're ten years older you're twenty bawled algernon in an extremity of disgust don't i know what game you're following up isn't it clear as day you've got another woman in your eye it's as clear as day my good algy that you see a portrait hanging in my chambers and you have heard mrs lovell's opinion of the fact so much is perfectly clear there's my hand i don't blame you she's a clever woman and like many of the sort shrewd at guessing the worst come take my hand i tell you i don't blame you i've been little dog to her myself and fetched and carried and wagged my tail it's charming while it lasts will you shake it your tail man algernon roared in pretended amazement edward eased him back to friendliness by laughing no my hand they shook hands all right said algernon you mean well it's very well for you to preach virtue to a poor devil you've got loose or you're regularly in love virtue by heaven edward cried i wish i were entitled to preach it to any man on earth his face flushed there good bye old fellow he added go to the city i'll dine with you to night if you like come and dine with me at my club i shall be disengaged algernon mumbled a flexible assent to an appointment at edward's club dressed himself with care borrowed a sovereign for which he nodded his acceptance and left him edward set his brain upon a book of law it may have been two hours after he had sat thus in his cistercian stillness when a letter was delivered to him by one of the inn porters edward read the superscription and asked the porter who it was that brought it two young ladies the porter said these were the contents i am not sure that you will ever forgive me i cannot forgive myself when i think of that one word i was obliged to speak to you in the cold street and nothing to explain why and how much i love you oh how i love you i cry while i write i cannot help it i was a sop of tears all night long and oh if you had seen my face in the morning i am thankful you did not mother's bible brought me home it must have been guidance for in my bed there lay my sister and i could not leave her i love her so i could not have got down stairs again after seeing her there and i had to say that cold word and shut the window on you may i call you edward still oh dear edward do make allowance for me write kindly to me say you forgive me i feel like a ghost to day my life seems quite behind me somewhere and i hardly feel anything i touch i declare to you dearest one i had no idea my sister was here i was surprised when i heard her name mentioned by my landlady and looked on the bed suddenly my strength was gone and it changed all that i was thinking i never knew before that women were so weak but now i see they are and i only know i am at my edward's mercy and am stupid oh so wretched and stupid i shall not touch food till i hear from you oh if you are angry write so but do write my suspense would make you pity me i know i deserve your anger it was not that i do not trust you edward my mother in heaven sees my heart and that i trust i trust my heart and everything i am and have to you i would almost wish and wait to see you to day in the gardens but my crying has made me such a streaked thing to look at if i had rubbed my face with a scrubbing brush i could not look worse and i cannot risk your seeing me it would excuse you for hating me do you does he hate her she loves you she would die for you dear edward oh i feel that if i was told to day that i should die for you to morrow it would be happiness i am dying yes i am dying till i hear from you believe me your tender loving broken hearted dahlia there was a postscript may i still go to lessons edward finished the letter with a calmly perusing eye he had winced triflingly at one or two expressions contained in it forcible perhaps but not such as mrs lovell smiling from the wall yonder would have used the poor child threatens to eat no dinner if i don't write to her he said and replied in a kind and magnanimous spirit concluding go to lessons by all means having accomplished this he stood up and by hazard fell to comparing the rival portraits a melancholy and a comic thing to do as you will find if you put two painted heads side by side and set their merits contesting and reflect on the contest and to what advantages personal or of the artist's the winner owes the victory dahlia had been admirably dealt with by the artist the charm of pure ingenuousness without rusticity was visible in her face and figure hanging there on the wall she was a match for mrs lovell chapter vii rhoda returned home the heavier for a secret that she bore with her all through the first night of her sleeping in london dahlia's sobs and tender hugs and self reproaches had penetrated her dreams and when the morning came she had scarcely to learn that dahlia loved some one the confession was made but his name was reserved dahlia spoke of him with such sacredness of respect that she seemed lost in him and like a creature kissing his feet with tears rolling down her cheeks and with moans of anguish she spoke of the deliciousness of loving of knowing one to whom she abandoned her will and her destiny until seeing how beautiful a bloom love threw upon the tearful worn face of her sister rhoda was impressed by a mystical veneration for this man and readily believed him to be above all other men if not superhuman for she was of an age and an imagination to conceive a spiritual pre eminence over the weakness of mortality she thought that one who could so transform her sister touch her with awe and give her gracefulness and humility must be what dahlia said he was she asked shyly for his christian name but even so little dahlia withheld it was his wish that dahlia should keep silence concerning him have you sworn an oath said rhoda wonderingly no dear love dahlia replied he only mentioned what he desired rhoda was ashamed of herself for thinking it strange and she surrendered her judgement to be stamped by the one who knew him well as regarded her uncle dahlia admitted that she had behaved forgetfully and unkindly and promised amendment she talked of the farm as of an old ruin with nothing but a thin shade of memory threading its walls and appeared to marvel vaguely that it stood yet father shall not always want money she said she was particular in prescribing books for rhoda to read good authors she emphasized and named books of history and poets and quoted their verses for my darling will some day have a dear husband and he must not look down on her rhoda shook her head full sure that she could never be brought to utter such musical words naturally yes dearest when you know what love is said dahlia in an underbreath could robert inspire her with the power rhoda looked upon that poor homely young man half curiously when she returned and quite dismissed the notion besides she had no feeling for herself her passion was fixed upon her sister whose record of emotions in the letters from london placed her beyond dull days and nights the letters struck many chords a less subservient reader would have set them down as variations of the language of infatuation but rhoda was responsive to every word and change of mood from the i am unworthy degraded wretched to i am blest above the angels if one letter said we met yesterday rhoda's heart beat on to the question shall i see him again to morrow and will she see him has she seen him agitated her and absorbed her thoughts so humbly did she follow her sister without daring to forecast a prospect for her or dream of an issue that when on a summer morning a letter was brought in at the breakfast table marked urgent and private she opened it and the first line dazzled her eyes the surprise was a shock to her brain she rose from her unfinished meal and walked out into the wide air feeling as if she walked on thunder the letter ran thus my own innocent i am married we leave england to day i must not love you too much for i have all my love to give to my edward my own now and i am his trustingly for ever but he will let me give you some of it and rhoda is never jealous she shall have a great deal only i am frightened when i think how immense my love is for him so that anything everything he thinks right is right to me i am not afraid to think so if i were to try a cloud would come over me it does if only i fancy for half a moment i am rash and a straw i cannot exist except through him so i must belong to him and his will is my law my prayer at my bedside every night is that i may die for him we used to think the idea of death so terrible do you remember how we used to shudder together at night when we thought of people lying in the grave and now when i think that perhaps i may some day die for him i feel like a crying in my heart with joy i have left a letter sent it i mean enclosed to uncle for father he will see edward by and by oh may heaven spare him from any grief rhoda will comfort him tell him how devoted i am i am like drowned to everybody but one we are looking on the sea in half an hour i shall have forgotten the tread of english earth i do not know that i breathe all i know is a fear that i am flying and my strength will not continue that is when i am not touching his hand there is france opposite i shut my eyes and see the whole country but it is like what i feel for edward all in dark moonlight oh i trust him so i bleed for him i could make all my veins bleed out at a sad thought about him and from france to switzerland and italy the sea sparkles just as if it said come to the sun and i am going edward calls shall i be punished for so much happiness i am too happy i am too happy god bless my beloved at home that is my chief prayer now i shall think of her when i am in the cathedrals oh my father in heaven bless them all bless rhoda forgive me i can hear the steam of the steamer at the pier here is edward he says i may send his love to you address mrs edward ayrton poste restante lausanne switzerland ps lausanne is where but another time and i will always tell you the history of the places to instruct you poor heart in dull england adieu good bye and god bless my innocent at home my dear sister i love her i never can forget her the day is so lovely it seems on purpose for us be sure you write on thin paper to lausanne it is on a blue lake you see snow mountains and now there is a bell ringing kisses from me we start i must sign dahlia by the reading of this letter rhoda was caught vividly to the shore and saw her sister borne away in the boat to the strange countries she travelled with her following her with gliding speed through a multiplicity of shifting scenes opal landscapes full of fire and dreams and in all of them a great bell towered oh my sweet my own beauty she cried in dahlia's language meeting mrs sumfit she called her mother dumpling as dahlia did of old affectionately and kissed her and ran on to master gammon who was tramping leisurely on to the oatfield lying on toward the millholms my sister sends you her love she said brightly to the old man master gammon responded with no remarkable flash of his eyes and merely opened his mouth and shut it as when a duck divides its bill but fails to emit the customary quack and to you little pigs and to you mulberry and you dapple and you and you and you rhoda nodded round to all the citizens of the farmyard and so eased her heart of its laughing bubbles after which she fell to a meditative walk of demurer joy and had a regret it was simply that dahlia's hurry in signing the letter had robbed her of the delight of seeing dahlia ayrton written proudly out with its wonderful signification of the change in her life that was a trifling matter yet rhoda felt the letter was not complete in the absence of the bridal name she fancied dahlia to have meant perhaps that she was dahlia to her as of old and not a stranger dahlia ever dahlia nothing else for you she heard her sister say but how delicious and mournful how terrible and sweet with meaning would dahlia ayrton the new name in the dear handwriting have looked and i have a brother in law she thought and her cheeks tingled the banks of fern and foxglove and the green young oaks fringing the copse grew rich in colour as she reflected that this beloved unknown husband of her sister embraced her and her father as well even the old bent beggarman on the sandy ridge though he had a starved frame and carried pitiless faggots stood illumined in a soft warmth rhoda could not go back to the house it chanced that the farmer that morning had been smitten with the virtue of his wife's opinion of robert and her parting recommendation concerning him have you a mind to either one of my two girls he put the question bluntly finding himself alone with robert robert took a quick breath and replied i have then make your choice said the farmer and tried to go about his business but hung near robert in the fields till he had asked which one is it my boy robert turned a blade of wheat in his mouth i think i shall leave her to tell that was his answer why don't ye know which one you prefer to choose man quoth mr fleming i mayn't know whether she prefers to choose me said robert the farmer smiled you never can exactly reckon about them that's true he was led to think dahlia's the lass seeing that robert had not had many opportunities of speaking with her when my girls are wives they'll do their work in the house he pursued they may have a little bit o' property in land ye know and they may have a share in in gold that's not to be reckoned on we're an old family robert and i suppose we've our pride somewhere down anyhow you can't look on my girls and not own they're superior girls i've no notion of forcing them to clean and dish up and do dairying if it's not to their turn they're handy with th' needle they dress conformably and do the millinery themselves and i know they say their prayers of a night that i know if that's a comfort to ye and it should be robert for pray and you can't go far wrong and it's particularly good for girls i'll say no more at the dinner table rhoda was not present mr fleming fidgeted blamed her and excused her but as robert appeared indifferent about her absence he was confirmed in his idea that dahlia attracted his fancy they had finished dinner and master gammon had risen when a voice immediately recognized as the voice of anthony hackbut was heard in the front part of the house mr fleming went round to him with a dismayed face lord said mrs sumfit how i tremble robert too looked grave and got away from the house the dread of evil news of dahlia was common to them all yet none had mentioned it robert conceiving that it would be impertinence on his part to do so the farmer that the policy of permitting dahlia's continued residence in london concealed the peril while mrs sumfit flatly defied the threatening of a mischance to one so sweet and fair and her favourite it is the insincerity of persons of their class but one need not lay stress on the wilfulness of uneducated minds robert walked across the fields walking like a man with an object in view as he dropped into one of the close lanes which led up to wrexby hall he saw rhoda standing under an oak her white morning dress covered with sun spots his impulse was to turn back the problem how to speak to her not being settled within him but the next moment his blood chilled for he had perceived though he had not felt simultaneously that two gentlemen were standing near her addressing her and it was likewise manifest that she listened to them these presently raised their hats and disappeared rhoda came on toward robert you have forgotten your dinner he said with a queer sense of shame at dragging in the mention of that meal i have been too happy to eat rhoda replied robert glanced up the lane but she gave no heed to this indication and asked has uncle come did you expect him i thought he would come what has made you happy you will hear from uncle shall i go and hear what those robert checked himself but it would have been better had he spoken out rhoda's face from a light of interrogation lowered its look to contempt she did not affect the feminine simplicity which can so prettily misunderstand and put by an implied accusation of that nature doubtless her sharp instinct served her by telling her that her contempt would hurt him shrewdly now the foolishness of a man having much to say to a woman and not knowing how or where the beginning of it might be was perceptible about him a shout from her father at the open garden gate hurried on rhoda to meet him old anthony was at mr fleming's elbow you know it you have her letter father said rhoda gaily beneath the shadow of his forehead and a queen of the egyptians is what you might have been said anthony with a speculating eye upon rhoda's dark bright face rhoda put out her hand to him but kept her gaze on her father william fleeting relaxed the knot of his brows and lifted the letter listen all this is from a daughter to her father and he read oddly accentuating the first syllables of the sentences dear father my husband will bring me to see you when i return to dear england i ought to have concealed nothing i know try to forgive me i hope you will i shall always think of you god bless you i am ever with respect your dearly loving daughter dahlia dahlia blank said the farmer turning his look from face to face a deep fire of emotion was evidently agitating him for the letter rustled in his hand and his voice was uneven of this no sign was given by his inexpressive features the round brown eyes and the ruddy varnish on his cheeks were a mask upon grief if not also upon joy dahlia what what's her name he resumed here 'my husband will bring me to see you' who's her husband has he got a name and a blank envelope to her uncle here who's kept her in comfort for so long and this is all she writes to me will any one spell out the meaning of it dahlia was in great haste father said rhoda oh ay you you're the one i know returned the farmer it's sister and sister with you but she was very very hurried father i have a letter from her and i have only 'dahlia' written at the end no other name and you suspect no harm of your sister father how can i imagine any kind of harm that letter my girl sticks to my skull as though it meant to say 'you've not understood me yet' i've read it a matter of twenty times and i'm no nearer to the truth of it but if she's lying here in this letter what's she walking on how long are we to wait for to hear i give you my word robert i'm feeling for you as i am for myself or wasn't it that one is it this one he levelled his finger at rhoda in any case robert you'll feel for me as a father i'm shut in a dark room with the candle blown out i've heard of a sort of fear you have in that dilemmer lest you should lay your fingers on edges of sharp knives and if i think a step if i go thinking a step and feel my way i do cut myself and i bleed i do robert just take and say it wasn't that one such a statement would carry with it the confession that it was this one for whom he cared this scornful one this jilt this brazen girl who could make appointments with gentlemen or suffer them to speak to her and subsequently look at him with innocence and with anger believe me mr fleming i feel for you as much as a man can he said uneasily swaying half round as he spoke do you suspect anything bad the farmer repeated the question like one who only wanted a confirmation of his own suspicions to see the fact built up robert does this look like the letter of a married woman is it daughter like eh man help another i can't think for myself she ties my hands speak out robert set his eyes on rhoda he would have given much to have been able to utter i do her face was like an eager flower straining for light the very beauty of it swelled his jealous passion and he flattered himself with his incapacity to speak an abject lie to propitiate her she says she is married we're bound to accept what she says that was his answer is she married thundered the farmer has she been and disgraced her mother in her grave what am i to think she's my flesh and blood is she oh hush father rhoda laid her hand on his arm what doubt can there be of dahlia you have forgotten that she is always truthful come away it is shameful to stand here and listen to unmanly things she turned a face of ashes upon robert come away father she is our own she is my sister a doubt of her is an insult to us but robert don't doubt her eh the farmer was already half distracted from his suspicions have you any real doubt about the girl robert i don't trust myself to doubt anybody said robert you don't cast us off my boy i'm a labourer on the farm said robert and walked away he's got reason to feel this more 'n the rest of us poor lad it's a blow to him with which the farmer struck his hand on rhoda's shoulder i wish he'd set his heart on a safer young woman rhoda's shudder of revulsion was visible as she put her mouth up to kiss her father's cheek chapter viii that is wrexby hall upon the hill between fenhurst and wrexby the white square mansion with the lower drawing room windows one full bow of glass against the sunlight and great single trees spotting the distant green slopes from queen anne's farm you could read the hour by the stretching of their shadows squire blancove who lived there was an irascible gouty man out of humour with his time and beginning alas for him to lose all true faith in his port though to do him justice he wrestled hard with this great heresy his friends perceived the decay in his belief sooner than he did himself he was sour in the evening as in the morning there was no chirp in him when the bottle went round he had never one hour of a humane mood to be reckoned on now the day indeed is sad when we see the skeleton of the mistress by whom we suffer but cannot abandon her the squire drank knowing that the issue would be the terrific curse begetting twinge in his foot but as he said he was a man who stuck to his habits it was over his port that he had quarrelled with his rector on the subject of hopeful algernon and the system he adopted with that young man this incident has something to do with rhoda's story for it was the reason why mrs lovell went to wrexby church the spirit of that lady leading her to follow her own impulses which were mostly in opposition so when perchance she visited the hall she chose not to accompany the squire and his subservient guests to fenhurst but made a point of going down to the unoccupied wrexby pew she was a beauty and therefore powerful otherwise her act of nonconformity would have produced bad blood between her and the squire it was enough to have done so in any case for now instead of sitting at home comfortably and reading off the week's chronicle of sport while he nursed his leg the unfortunate gentleman had to be up and away to fenhurst every sunday morning or who would have known that the old cause of his general abstention from sabbath services lay in the detestable doctrine of wrexby's rector mrs lovell was now at the hall and it was sunday morning after breakfast the lady stood like a rival head among the other guests listening gloved and bonneted to the bells of wrexby west of the hills and of fenhurst northeast the squire came in to them groaning over his boots cross with his fragile wife and in every mood for satire except to receive it how difficult it is to be gouty and good murmured mrs lovell to the person next her well said the squire singling out his enemy you're going to that fellow i suppose as usual eh not 'as usual' replied mrs lovell sweetly i wish it were wish it were do you you find him so entertaining has he got to talking of the fashions he talks properly i don't ask for more mrs lovell assumed an air of meekness under persecution i thought you were low church lowly of the church i trust you thought she corrected him but for that matter any discourse plainly delivered will suit me his elocution's perfect said the squire that is before dinner i have only to do with him before dinner you know well i've ordered a carriage out for you that is very honourable and kind it would be kinder if i contrived to keep you away from the fellow would it not be kinder to yourself mrs lovell swam forward to him in all tenderness taking his hands and fixing the swimming blue of her soft eyes upon him pathetically if you took your paper and your slippers and awaited our return the squire felt the circulating smile about the room he rebuked the woman's audacity with a frown tis my duty to set an example he said his gouty foot and irritable temper now meeting in a common fire since you are setting an example rejoined the exquisite widow i have nothing more to say the squire looked what he dared not speak a woman has half a beauty has all the world with her when she is self contained and holds her place and it was evident that mrs lovell was not one to abandon her advantages he snapped round for a victim trying his wife first then his eyes rested upon algernon well here we are which of us will you take he asked mrs lovell in blank irony i have engaged my cavalier who is waiting and will be as devout as possible mrs lovell gave algernon a smile i thought i hit upon the man growled the squire you're going in to wrexby sir oh go by all means and i shan't be astonished at what comes of it like teacher like pupil there mrs lovell gave algernon another smile you have to bear the sins of your rector as well as your own can you support it the flimsy fine dialogue was a little above algernon's level in the society of ladies but he muttered bowing that he would endeavour to support it with mrs lovell's help and this did well enough after which the slight strain on the intellects of the assemblage relaxed and ordinary topics were discussed the carriages came round to the door gloves parasols and scent bottles were securely grasped whereupon the squire standing bare headed on the steps insisted upon seeing the party of the opposition off first and waited to hand mrs lovell into her carriage an ironic gallantry accepted by the lady with serenity befitting the sacred hour ah my pencil to mark the text for you squire she said taking her seat and algernon turned back at her bidding to get a pencil and she presenting a most harmonious aspect in the lovely landscape reclined in the carriage as if like the sweet summer air she too were quieted by those holy bells while the squire stood fuming bareheaded and with boiling blood just within the bounds of decorum on the steps she was more than his match she was more than a match for most and it was not a secret algernon knew it as well as edward or any one she was a terror to the soul of the youth and an attraction her smile was the richest flattery he could feel the richer perhaps from his feeling it to be a thing impossible to fix he had heard tales of her he remembered edward's warning but he was very humbly sitting with her now and very happy i'm in for it he said to his fair companion no cheque for me next quarter and no chance of an increase he'll tell me i've got a salary a salary good lord what a man comes to i've done for myself with the squire for a year you must think whether you have compensation said the lady and he received it in a cousinly squeeze of his hand he was about to raise the lank white hand to his lips ah she said there would be no compensation to me if that were seen and her dainty hand was withdrawn now tell me she changed her tone how do the loves prosper algernon begged her not to call them 'loves' she nodded and smiled your artistic admirations she observed i am to see her in church am i not only my dear algy don't go too far rustic beauties are as dangerous as court princesses where was it you saw her first at the bank said algernon really at the bank so your time there is not absolutely wasted what brought her to london i wonder well she has an old uncle a queer old fellow and he's a sort of porter money porter in the bank awfully honest or he might half break it some fine day if he chose to cut and run she's got a sister prettier than this girl the fellows say i've never seen her i expect i've seen a portrait of her though ah mrs lovell musically drew him on was she dark too no she's fair at least she is in her portrait brown hair hazel eyes oh oh you guess do you i guess nothing though it seems profitable that yankee betting man 'guesses' and what heaps of money he makes by it i wish i did algernon sighed all my guessing and reckoning goes wrong i'm safe for next spring that's one comfort i shall make twenty thousand next spring on templemore that's the horse i've got a little on tenpenny nail as well but i'm quite safe on templemore unless the evil principle comes into the field is he so sure to be against you if he does appear said mrs lovell certain ejaculated algernon in honest indignation well algy i don't like to have him on my side perhaps i will take a share in your luck to make it to make it she played prettily as a mistress teasing her lap dog to jump for a morsel adding oh algy you are not a frenchman to make it divine sir you have missed your chance there's one chance i shouldn't like to miss said the youth then do not mention it she counselled him and seriously i will take a part of your risk i fear i am lucky which is ruinous we will settle that by and by do you know algy the most expensive position in the world is a widow's you needn't be one very long growled he i'm so wretchedly fastidious don't you see and it's best not to sigh when we're talking of business if you'll take me for a guide so the old man brought this pretty rustic miss rhoda to the bank once said algernon just as he did with her sister he's proud of his nieces shows them and then hides them the fellows at the bank never saw her again her name is dahlia ah yes dahlia extremely pretty there are brown dahlias dahlias of all colours and the portrait of this fair creature hangs up in your chambers in town don't call them my chambers algernon protested your cousin's if you like probably edward happened to be at the bank when fair dahlia paid her visit once seems to have been enough for both of you algernon was unread in the hearts of women and imagined that edward's defection from mrs lovell's sway had deprived him of the lady's sympathy and interest in his fortunes poor old ned's in some scrape i think he said where is he the lady asked languidly paris paris how very odd and out of the season in this hot weather it's enough to lead me to dream that he has gone over one cannot realize why upon my honour algernon thumped on his knee by jingo he adopted a less compromising interjection ned's fool enough my idea is he's gone and got married mrs lovell was lying back with the neglectful grace of incontestable beauty not a line to wrinkle her smooth soft features for one sharp instant her face was all edged and puckered like the face of a fair witch she sat upright married but how can that be when we none of us have heard a word of it i daresay you haven't said algernon and not likely to ned's the closest fellow of my acquaintance he hasn't taken me into his confidence you maybe sure he knows i'm too leaky there's no bore like a secret i've come to my conclusion in this affair by putting together a lot of little incidents and adding them up first i believe he was at the bank when that fair girl was seen there secondly from the description the fellows give of her i should take her to be the original of the portrait next i know that rhoda has a fair sister who has run for it and last rhoda has had a letter from her sister to say she's away to the continent and is married ned's in paris those are my facts and i give you my reckoning of them mrs lovell gazed at algernon for one long meditative moment impossible she exclaimed edward has more brains than heart and now the lady's face was scarlet how did this rhoda with her absurd name think of meeting you to tell you such stuff indeed there's a simplicity in some of these young women she said the remainder to herself she's really very innocent and good algernon defended rhoda she is there isn't a particle of nonsense in her i first met her in town as i stated at the bank just on the steps and we remembered i had called a cab for her a little before and i met her again by accident yesterday you are only a boy in their hands my cousin algy said mrs lovell algernon nodded with a self defensive knowingness i fancy there's no doubt her sister has written to her that she's married it's certain she has she's a blunt sort of girl not one to lie not even for a sister or a lover unless she had previously made up her mind to it in that case she wouldn't stick at much but do you know said mrs lovell do you know that edward's father would be worse than yours over such an act of folly he would call it an offence against common sense and have no mercy for it he would be vindictive on principle this story of yours cannot be true nothing reconciles it oh sir billy will be rusty that stands to reason algernon assented it mayn't be true i hope it isn't but ned has a madness for fair women he'd do anything on earth for them he loses his head entirely that he may have been imprudent mrs lovell thus blushingly hinted at the lesser sin of his deceiving and ruining the girl oh it needn't be true said algernon and with meaning who's to blame if it is mrs lovell again reddened she touched algernon's fingers his friends mustn't forsake him in any case by jove you are the right sort of woman cried algernon it was beyond his faculties to divine that her not forsaking of edward might haply come to mean something disastrous to him the touch of mrs lovell's hand made him forget rhoda in a twinkling he detained it audaciously even until she frowned with petulance and stamped her foot there was over her bosom a large cameo brooch representing a tomb under a palm tree and the figure of a veiled woman with her head bowed upon the tomb this brooch was falling when algernon caught it the pin tore his finger and in the energy of pain he dashed the brooch to her feet with immediate outcries of violent disgust at himself and exclamations for pardon he picked up the brooch it was open a strange discoloured folded substance lay on the floor of the carriage mrs lovell gazed down at it and then at him ghastly pale he lifted it by one corner and the diminutive folded squares came out revealing a strip of red stained handkerchief mrs lovell grasped it and thrust it out of sight she spoke as they approached the church door mention nothing of this to a soul or you forfeit my friendship for ever when they alighted she was smiling in her old affable manner chapter ix some consideration for robert after all as being the man who loved her sufficed to give him rank as a more elevated kind of criminal in rhoda's sight and exquisite torture of the highest form was administered to him her faith in her sister was so sure that she could half pardon him for the momentary harm he had done to dahlia with her father but judging him by the lofty standard of one who craved to be her husband she could not pardon his unmanly hesitation and manner of speech the old and deep grievance in her heart as to what men thought of women and as to the harshness of men was stirred constantly by the remembrance of his irresolute looks and his not having dared to speak nobly for dahlia even though he might have had the knavery to think evil as the case stood there was still mischief to counteract her father had willingly swallowed a drug but his suspicions only slumbered and she could not instil her own vivid hopefulness and trust into him letters from dahlia came regularly the first from lausanne favoured rhoda's conception of her as of a happy spirit resting at celestial stages of her ascent upward through spheres of ecstacy dahlia could see the snow mountains in a flying glimpse and again peacefully seated she could see the snow mountains reflected in clear blue waters from her window which rhoda thought must be like heaven on these inspired occasions robert presented the form of a malignant serpent in her ideas then dahlia made excursions upon glaciers with her beloved her helpmate and had slippings and tumblings little earthly casualties which gave a charming sense of reality to her otherwise miraculous flight the alps were crossed italy was beheld a profusion of oh's described dahlia's impressions of italy and oh the heat showed her to be mortal notwithstanding the sublime exclamations como received the blissful couple dahlia wrote from como tell father that gentlemen in my edward's position cannot always immediately proclaim their marriage to the world there are reasons i hope he has been very angry with me then it will be soon over and we shall be but i cannot look back i shall not look back till we reach venice at venice i know i shall see you all as clear as day but i cannot even remember the features of my darling here her christian name was still her only signature the thin blue and pink paper and the foreign postmarks testifications to dahlia's journey not being a fictitious event had a singular deliciousness for the solitary girl at the farm at times as she turned them over she was startled by the intoxication of her sentiments for the wild thought would come that many many whose passionate hearts she could feel as her own were ready to abandon principle and the bondage to the hereafter for such a long delicious gulp of divine life rhoda found herself more than once brooding on the possible case that dahlia had done this thing the fit of languor came on her unawares probing at her weakness and blinding her to the laws and duties of earth until her conscious womanhood checked it and she sprang from the vision in a spasm of terror not knowing how far she had fallen after such personal experiences she suffered great longings to be with her sister that the touch of her hand the gaze of her eyes the tone of dahlia's voice might make her sure of her sister's safety rhoda's devotions in church were frequently distracted by the occupants of the blancove pew mrs lovell had the habit of looking at her with an extraordinary directness an expressionless dissecting scrutiny that was bewildering and confusing to the country damsel algernon likewise bestowed marked attention on her some curious hints had been thrown out to her by this young gentleman on the day when he ventured to speak to her in the lane which led her to fancy distantly that he had some acquaintance with dahlia's husband or that he had heard of dahlia it was clear to rhoda that algernon sought another interview he appeared in the neighbourhood of the farm on saturdays and on sundays he was present in the church sometimes with mrs lovell and sometimes without a companion his appearance sent her quick wits travelling through many scales of possible conduct and they struck one ringing note she thought that by the aid of this gentleman a lesson might be given to robert's mean nature it was part of robert's punishment to see that she was not unconscious of algernon's admiration the first letter from venice consisted of a series of interjections in praise of the poetry of gondolas varied by allusions to the sad smell of the low tide water and the amazing quality of the heat and then dahlia wrote more composedly titian the painter lived here and painted ladies who sat to him without a bit of garment on and indeed my darling i often think it was more comfortable for the model than for the artist even modesty seems too hot a covering for human creatures here the sun strikes me down i am ceasing to have a complexion it is pleasant to know that my edward is still proud of me he has made acquaintance with some of the officers here and seems pleased at the compliments they pay me they have nice manners and white uniforms that fit them like a kid glove i am edward's 'resplendent wife' a colonel of one of the regiments invited him to dinner speaking english 'with your resplendent wife' edward has no mercy for errors of language and he would not take me ah who knows how strange men are never think of being happy unless you can always be blind i see you all at home mother dumpling and all as i thought i should when i was to come to venice persuade do persuade father that everything will be well some persons are to be trusted make him feel it i know that i am life itself to edward he has lived as men do and he can judge and he knows that there never was a wife who brought a heart to her husband like mine to him he wants to think or he wants to smoke and he leaves me but oh when he returns he can scarcely believe that he has me his joy is so great he looks like a glad thankful child and he has the manliest of faces it is generally thoughtful you might think it hard at first sight but you must be beautiful to please some men you will laugh i have really got the habit of talking to my face and all myself in the glass rhoda would think me cracked and it is really true that i was never so humble about my good looks you used to spoil me at home you and that wicked old mother dumpling and our own dear mother rhoda oh mother mother i wish i had always thought of you looking down on me you made me so vain much more vain than i let you see i was there were times when it is quite true i thought myself a princess i am not worse looking now but i suppose i desire to be so beautiful that nothing satisfies me a spot on my neck gives me a dreadful fright if my hair comes out much when i comb it it sets my heart beating and it is a daily misery to me that my hands are larger than they should be belonging to edward's 'resplendent wife' i thank heaven that you and i always saw the necessity of being careful of our fingernails my feet are of moderate size though they are not french feet as edward says no i shall never dance he sent me to the dancing master in london but it was too late but i have been complimented on my walking and that seems to please edward he does not dance or mind dancing himself only he does not like me to miss one perfection it is his love oh if i have seemed to let you suppose he does not love me as ever do not think it he is most tender and true to me addio i am signora you are signorina they have such pretty manners to us over here edward says they think less of women i say they think more but i feel he must be right oh my dear cold loving innocent sister put out your arms i shall feel them round me and kiss you kiss you for ever onward from city to city like a radiation of light from the old farm house where so little of it was dahlia continued her journey and then without a warning with only a word to say that she neared rome the letters ceased a chord snapped in rhoda's bosom while she was hearing from her sister almost weekly her confidence was buoyed on a summer sea in the silence it fell upon a dread she had no answer in her mind for her father's unspoken dissatisfaction and she had to conceal her cruel anxiety there was an interval of two months a blank fell charged with apprehension that was like the humming of a toneless wind before storm worse than the storm for any human thing to bear rhoda was unaware that robert who rarely looked at her and never sought to speak a word to her when by chance they met and were alone studied each change in her face and read its signs he was left to his own interpretation of them but the signs he knew accurately he knew that her pride had sunk and that her heart was desolate he believed that she had discovered her sister's misery one day a letter arrived that gave her no joyful colouring though it sent colour to her cheeks she opened it evidently not knowing the handwriting her eyes ran down the lines hurriedly after a time she went upstairs for her bonnet at the stile leading into that lane where robert had previously seen her she was stopped by him no farther was all that he said and he was one who could have interdicted men from advancing why may i not go by you said rhoda with a woman's affected humbleness robert joined his hands you go no farther miss rhoda unless you take me with you i shall not do that mr robert then you had better return home will you let me know what reasons you have for behaving in this manner to me i'll let you know by and by said robert at present you'll let the stronger of the two have his way he had always been so meek and gentle and inoffensive that her contempt had enjoyed free play and had never risen to anger but violent anger now surged against him and she cried do you dare to touch me trying to force her passage by robert caught her softly by the wrist there stood at the same time a full statured strength of will in his eyes under which her own fainted go back he said and she turned that he might not see her tears of irritation and shame he was treating her as a child but it was to herself alone that she could defend herself she marvelled that when she thought of an outspoken complaint against him her conscience gave her no support is there no freedom for a woman at all in this world rhoda framed the bitter question rhoda went back as she had come algernon blancove did the same between them stood robert thinking now i have made that girl hate me for life it was in november that a letter dated from london reached the farm quickening rhoda's blood anew i am alive said dahlia and she said little more except that she was waiting to see her sister and bade her urgently to travel up alone her father consented to her doing so after a consultation with robert however he determined to accompany her she can't object to see me too said the farmer and rhoda answered no but her face was bronze to robert when they took their departure chapter x old anthony was expecting them in london it was now winter and the season for theatres so to show his brother in law the fun of a theatre was one part of his projected hospitality if mr fleming should haply take the hint that he must pay for himself anthony had laid out money to welcome the farmer and was shy and fidgety as a girl who anticipates the visit of a promising youth over his fat goose for next day's dinner and his shrimps for this day's tea and his red slice of strong cheese called of cheshire by the reckless butter man for supper he knew that both dahlia and rhoda must have told the farmer that he was not high up in boyne's bank and it fretted him to think that the mysterious respect entertained for his wealth by the farmer which delighted him with a novel emotion might be dashed by what the farmer would behold during his last visit to the farm anthony had talked of the funds more suggestively than usual he had alluded to his own dealings in them and to what he would do and would not do under certain contingencies thus shadowing out dimly luminous and immense what he could do if his sagacity prompted the adventure the farmer had listened through the buzzing of his uncertain grief only sighing for answer if ever you come up to london brother william john said anthony you mind you go about arm in arm with me or you'll be judging by appearances and says you 'lor' what a thousander fellow this is' and 'what a millioner fellow that is' you'll be giving your millions and your thousands to the wrong people when they haven't got a penny all london 'll be topsy turvy to you unless you've got a guide and he'll show you a shabby coated head in the gutter old man 'll buy up the lot everybody that doesn't know him says look at him but they that knows him hats off i can tell you and talk about lords we don't mind their coming into the city but they know the scent of cash i've had a lord take off his hat to me it's a fact i have in spite of the caution anthony had impressed upon his country relative that he should not judge by appearances he was nevertheless under an apprehension that the farmer's opinion of him and the luxurious almost voluptuous enjoyment he had of it were in peril when he had purchased the well probed fat goose the shrimps and the cheese he was only half satisfied his ideas shot boldly at a bottle of wine and he employed a summer lighted evening in going a round of wine merchants' placards and looking out for the cheapest bottle he could buy and he would have bought one he had sealing wax of his own and could have stamped it with the office stamp of boyne's bank for that matter to make it as dignified and costly as the vaunted red seals and green seals of the placards he would have bought one had he not by one of his lucky mental illuminations recollected that it was within his power to procure an order to taste wine at the docks where you may get as much wine as you like out of big sixpenny glasses and try cask after cask walking down gas lit paths between the huge bellies of wine which groan to be tapped and tried that men may know them the idea of paying two shillings and sixpence for one miserable bottle vanished at the richly coloured prospect that'll show him something of what london is thought anthony and a companion thought told him in addition that the farmer with a skinful of wine would emerge into the open air imagining no small things of the man who could gain admittance into those marvellous caverns by george it's like a boy's story book cried anthony in his soul and he chuckled over the vision of the farmer's amazement acted it with his arms extended and his hat unseated and plunged into wheezy fits of laughter he met his guests at the station mr fleming was soberly attired in what to anthony's london eye was a curiosity costume but the broad brim of the hat the square cut of the brown coat and the leggings struck him as being very respectable and worthy of a presentation at any bank in london you stick to a leather purse brother william john he inquired with an artistic sentiment for things in keeping i do said the farmer feeling seriously at the button over it all right i shan't ask ye to show it in the street anthony rejoined and smote rhoda's hand as it hung glad to see your old uncle are ye rhoda replied quietly that she was but had come with the principal object of seeing her sister there cried anthony you never get a compliment out of this gal she gives ye the nut and you're to crack it and there maybe or there mayn't be a kernel inside she don't care but there ain't much in it the farmer ejaculated withdrawing his fingers from the button they had been teasing for security since anthony's question about the purse not much eh brother william john anthony threw up a puzzled look not much baggage i see that he exclaimed and lord be thanked no trunks aha my dear he turned to rhoda you remember your lesson do ye now mark me i'll remember you for it do you know my dear he said to rhoda confidentially that sixpenn'orth of chaff which i made the cabman pay for there was the cream of it that was better than peruvian bark to my constitution it was as good to me as a sniff of sea breeze and no excursion expenses i'd like another just to feel young again when i'd have backed myself to beat cabmen ah i've stood up when i was a young 'un and shut up a cheap jack at a fair circulation's the soul o' chaff that's why i don't mind tackling cabmen they sit all day and all they've got to say is 'rat tat' and they've done but i let the boys roar i know what i was when a boy myself i've got devil in me never you fear but it's all on the side of the law now let's off for the gentlemen are starin' at you which won't hurt ye ye know but makes me jealous before the party moved away from the platform a sharp tussle took place between anthony and the farmer as to the porterage of the bulky bag but it being only half earnest the farmer did not put out his strength and anthony had his way i rather astonished you brother william john he said when they were in the street the farmer admitted that he was stronger than he looked don't you judge by appearances that's all anthony remarked setting down the bag to lay his finger on one side of his nose for impressiveness now there we leave london bridge to the right and we should away to the left and quiet parts he seized the bag anew just listen that's the roaring of cataracts of gold you hear brother william john it's a good notion ain't it hark i got that notion from one of your penny papers you can buy any amount for a penny now a days poetry up in a corner stories tales o' temptation one fellow cut his lucky with his master's cash dashed away to australia made millions fit to be a lord and there he was liable to the law and everybody bowing their hats and their heads off to him and his knees knocking at the sight of a policeman a man of a red complexion full habit of body enjoyed his dinner and his wine and on account of his turning white so often they called him 'sealing wax and parchment' was one name 'carrots and turnips' was another 'blumonge and something' and so on fancy his having to pay half his income in pensions to chaps who could have had him out of his town or country mansion and popped into gaol in a jiffy and found out at last them tales set you thinking once i was an idle young scaramouch but you can buy every idea that's useful to you for a penny i tried the halfpenny journals cheapness ain't always profitable the moral is make your money and you may buy all the rest discoursing thus by the way and resisting the farmer's occasional efforts to relieve him of the bag with the observation that appearances were deceiving and that he intended please his maker to live and turn over a little more interest yet anthony brought them to mrs wicklow's house mrs wicklow promised to put them into the track of the omnibuses running toward dahlia's abode in the southwest and mary ann wicklow who had a burning desire in her bosom to behold even the outside shell of her friend's new grandeur undertook very disinterestedly to accompany them anthony's strict injunction held them due at a lamp post outside boyne's bank at half past three o'clock in the afternoon my love to dahly he said she was always a head and shoulders over my size tell her when she rolls by in her carriage not to mind me i got my own notions of value and if that mr ayrton of hers 'll bank at boyne's i'll behave to him like a customer this here's the girl for my money he touched rhoda's arm and so disappeared the farmer chided her for her cold manner to her uncle murmuring aside to her you heard what he said rhoda was frozen with her heart's expectation and insensible to hints or reproof the people who entered the omnibus seemed to her stale phantoms bearing a likeness to every one she had known save to her beloved whom she was about to meet after long separation she marvelled pityingly at the sort of madness which kept the streets so lively for no reasonable purpose when she was on her feet again she felt for the first time that she was nearing the sister for whom she hungered and the sensation beset her that she had landed in a foreign country mary ann wicklow chattered all the while to the general ear it was her pride to be the discoverer of dahlia's terrace not for worlds would she enter the house she said in a general tone she knowing better than to present herself where downright entreaty did not invite her rhoda left her to count the numbers along the terrace walk and stood out in the road that her heart might select dahlia's habitation from the other hueless residences she fixed upon one but she was wrong and her heart sank the fair mary ann fought her and beat her by means of a careful reckoning as she remarked i keep my eyes open number is the corner house the bow window to a certainty gardens were in front of the houses or to speak more correctly strips of garden walks a cab was drawn up close by the shrub covered iron gate leading up to no mary ann hurried them on declaring that they might be too late even now at a couple of dozen paces distant seeing that london cabs crawlers as they usually were could when required and paid for it do their business like lightning her observation was illustrated the moment after they had left her in the rear for a gentleman suddenly sprang across the pavement jumped into a cab and was whirled away with as much apparent magic to provincial eyes as if a pantomimic trick had been performed rhoda pressed forward a step in advance of her father it may have been her husband she thought and trembled the curtains up in the drawing room were moved as by a hand but where was dahlia's face dahlia knew that they were coming and she was not on the look out for them a strange conflict of facts over which rhoda knitted her black brows so that she looked menacing to the maid opening the door whose oh if you please miss came in contact with my sister mrs she expects me i mean mrs but no other name than dahlia would fit itself to rhoda's mouth ayrton said the maid and recommenced oh if you please miss and you are the young lady mrs ayrton is very sorry and have left word would you call again to morrow as she have made a pressing appointment and was sure you would excuse her but her husband was very anxious for her to go and could not put it off and was very sorry but would you call again to morrow at twelve o'clock and punctually she would be here the maid smiled as one who had fairly accomplished the recital of her lesson rhoda was stunned is mrs ayrton at home not at home she said no don't ye hear quoth the farmer sternly she had my letter do you know rhoda appealed to the maid oh yes miss a letter from the country this morning yes miss this morning and she has gone out what time did she go out when will she be in her father plucked at her dress best not go making the young woman repeat herself she says nobody's at home to ask us in there's no more then to trouble her for at twelve o'clock to morrow rhoda faltered would you if you please call again at twelve o'clock to morrow and punctually she would be here said the maid the farmer hung his head and turned rhoda followed him from the garden she was immediately plied with queries and interjections of wonderment by miss wicklow and it was not until she said you saw him go out didn't you into the cab that rhoda awakened to a meaning in her gabble was it dahlia's husband whom they had seen and if so why was dahlia away from her husband she questioned in her heart but not for an answer for she allowed no suspicions to live the farmer led on with his plodding country step burdened shoulders and ruddy fowled serious face not speaking to rhoda who had no desire to hear a word from him and let him be mary ann steered him and called from behind the turnings he was to take while she speculated aloud to rhoda upon the nature of the business that had torn dahlia from the house so inopportunely at last she announced that she knew what it was but rhoda failed to express curiosity mary ann was driven to whisper something about strange things in the way of purchases at that moment the farmer threw up his umbrella shouting for a cab and rhoda ran up to him oh father why do we want to ride yes i tell ye said the farmer chafing against his coat collar it is an expense when we can walk father what do i care for th' expense i shall ride he roared again for a cab and one came that took them in after which the farmer not being spoken to became gravely placid as before they were put down at boyne's bank anthony was on the look out and signalled them to stand away some paces from the door they were kept about a quarter of an hour waiting between two tides of wayfarers which hustled them one way and another when out at last came the old broad bent figure with little finicking steps and hurried past them head foremost his arms narrowed across a bulgy breast he stopped to make sure that they were following beckoned with his chin and proceeded at a mighty rate marvellous was his rounding of corners his threading of obstructions his skilful diplomacy with passengers presently they lost sight of him and stood bewildered but while they were deliberating they heard his voice he was above them having issued from two swinging bright doors and he laughed and nodded as he ran down the steps and made signs by which they were to understand that he was relieved of a weight i've done that twenty year of my life brother william john he said eh perhaps you didn't guess i was worth some thousands when i got away from you just now let any chap try to stop me they may just as well try to stop a railway train steam's up and i'm off he laughed and wiped his forehead slightly vexed at the small amount of discoverable astonishment on the farmer's face he continued you don't think much of it why there ain't another man but myself boyne's bank would trust they've trusted me thirty year why shouldn't they go on trusting me another thirty year a good character brother william john goes on compound interesting just like good coin didn't you feel a sort of heat as i brushed by you eh that was a matter of one two three four anthony watched the farmer as his voice swelled up on the heightening numbers five six six thousand pounds brother william john people must think something of a man to trust him with that sum pretty near every day of their lives sundays excepted eh don't you think so he dwelt upon the immense confidence reposed in him and the terrible temptation it would be to some men and how they ought to thank their stars that they were never thrown in the way of such a temptation of which he really thought nothing at all nothing until the farmer's countenance was lightened of its air of oppression for a puzzle was dissolved in his brain it was now manifest to him that anthony was trusted in this extraordinary manner because the heads and managers of boyne's bank knew the old man to be possessed of a certain very respectable sum in all probability they held it in their coffers for safety and credited him with the amount nay more it was fair to imagine that the guileless old fellow who conceived himself to be so deep had let them get it all into their hands without any suspicion of their prominent object in doing so mr fleming said ah yes surely he almost looked shrewd as he smiled over anthony's hat the healthy exercise of his wits relieved his apprehensive paternal heart and when he mentioned that dahlia had not been at home when he called he at the same time sounded his hearer for excuses to be raised on her behalf himself clumsily suggesting one or two as to show that he was willing to swallow a very little for comfort oh of course said anthony jeeringly out if you catch her in these next three or four days you'll be lucky ah brother william john the farmer half frightened by anthony's dolorous shake of his head exclaimed what's the matter man how proud i should be if only you was in a way to bank at boyne's ah went the farmer in his turn and he plunged his chin deep in his neckerchief perhaps some of your family will some day brother william john happen some of my family do brother anthony will is what i said brother william john if good gals and civil and marry decently eh and he faced about to rhoda who was walking with miss wicklow what does she look so down about my dear never be down i don't mind you telling your young man whoever he is and i'd like him to be a strapping young six footer i've got in my eye who farms what does he farm with to make farming answer now a days why he farms with brains you'll find that in my last week's journal brother william john and thinks i as i conned it the farmer ought to read that you may tell any young man you like my dear that your old uncle's fond of ye on their arrival home mrs wicklow met them with a letter in her hand it was for rhoda from dahlia saying that dahlia was grieved to the heart to have missed her dear father and her darling sister but her husband had insisted upon her going out to make particular purchases and do a dozen things and he was extremely sorry to have been obliged to take her away but she hoped to see her dear sister and her father very very soon she wished she were her own mistress that she might run to them but men when they are husbands require so much waiting on that she could never call five minutes her own she would entreat them to call tomorrow only she would then be moving to her new lodgings but oh my dear my blessed rhoda the letter concluded do keep fast in your heart that i do love you so and pray that we may meet soon as i pray it every night and all day long beg father to stop till we meet things will soon be arranged they must oh oh my rhoda love how handsome you have grown it is very well to be fair for a time but the brunettes have the happiest lot they last and when we blonde ones cry or grow thin oh what objects we become there were some final affectionate words but no further explanations the wrinkles again settled on the farmer's mild uncomplaining forehead rhoda said let us wait father when alone she locked the letter against her heart as to suck the secret meaning out of it thinking over it was useless except for this one thought how did her sister know she had grown very handsome perhaps the housemaid had prattled chapter xi dahlia the perplexity to her sister's heart lay stretched at full length upon the sofa of a pleasantly furnished london drawing room sobbing to herself with her handkerchief across her eyes she had cried passion out and sobbed now for comfort she lay in her rich silken dress like the wreck of a joyful creature while the large red winter sun rounded to evening and threw deep coloured beams against the wall above her head they touched the nut brown hair to vivid threads of fire but she lay faceless utter languor and the dread of looking at her eyelids in the glass kept her prostrate so the darkness closed her about the sickly gas lamps of the street showing her as a shrouded body a girl came in to spread the cloth for dinner and went through her duties with the stolidity of the london lodging house maidservant poking a clogged fire to perdition and repressing a songful spirit dahlia knew well what was being done she would have given much to have saved her nostrils from the smell of dinner it was a great immediate evil to her sickened senses but she had no energy to call out nor will of any kind the odours floated to her and passively she combated them at first she was nearly vanquished the meat smelt so acrid the potatoes so sour each afflicting vegetable asserted itself peculiarly and the bread the salt even on the wings of her morbid fancy came steaming about her subtle penetrating thick and hateful like the pressure of a cloud out of which disease is shot such it seemed to her till she could have shrieked but only a few fresh tears started down her cheeks and she lay enduring it dead silence and stillness hung over the dinner service when the outer door below was opened and a light foot sprang up the stairs there entered a young gentleman in evening dress with a loose black wrapper drooping from his shoulders he looked on the table and then glancing at the sofa said oh there she is and went to the window and whistled after a minute of great patience he turned his face back to the room again and commenced tapping his foot on the carpet well he said finding these indications of exemplary self command unheeded his voice was equally powerless to provoke a sign of animation he now displaced his hat and said dahlia she did not move i am here to very little purpose then he remarked a guttering fall of her bosom was perceptible for heaven's sake take away that handkerchief my good child why have you let your dinner get cold here he lifted a cover here's roast beef you like it why don't you eat it that's only a small piece of the general inconsistency i know and why haven't they put champagne on the table for you you lose your spirits without it if you took it when these moody fits came on but there's no advising a woman to do anything for her own good dahlia will you do me the favour to speak two or three words with me before i go i would have dined here but i have a man to meet me at the club of what mortal service is it shamming the insensible you've produced the required effect i am as uncomfortable as i need be absolutely well seeing that words were of no avail he summed up expostulation and reproach in this sigh of resigned philosophy i am going let me see i have my temple keys yes i am afraid that even when you are inclined to be gracious and look at me i shall not be visible to you for some days i start for lord elling's to morrow morning at five i meet my father there by appointment i'm afraid we shall have to stay over christmas good bye he paused good bye my dear two or three steps nearer the door he said by the way do you want anything money do you happen to want any money i will send a blank cheque tomorrow i have sufficient for both of us i shall tell the landlady to order your christmas dinner how about wine there is champagne i know and bottled ale sherry i'll drop a letter to my wine merchant i think the sherry's running dry her sense of hearing was now afflicted in as gross a manner as had been her sense of smell she could not have spoken though her vitality had pressed for speech it would have astonished him to hear that his solicitude concerning provender for her during his absence was not esteemed a kindness for surely it is a kindly thing to think of it and for whom but for one for whom he cared would he be counting the bottles to be left at her disposal insomuch that the paucity of the bottles of sherry in the establishment distressed his mental faculties well good bye he said finally the door closed had dahlia's misery been in any degree simulated her eyes now as well as her ears would have taken positive assurance of his departure but with the removal of her handkerchief the loathsome sight of the dinner table would have saluted her and it had already caused her suffering enough she chose to remain as she was saying to herself i am dead and softly revelling in that corpse like sentiment she scarcely knew that the door had opened again dahlia she heard her name pronounced and more entreatingly and closer to her dahlia my poor girl her hand was pressed it gave her no shudders i am dead she mentally repeated for the touch did not run up to her heart and stir it dahlia do be reasonable i can't leave you like this we shall be separated for some time and what a miserable fire you've got here you have agreed with me that we are acting for the best it's very hard on me i try what i can to make you comf happy and really to see you leaving your dinner to get cold your hands are like ice the meat won't be eatable you know i'm not my own master come dahly my darling he gently put his hand to her chin and then drew away the handkerchief dahlia moaned at the exposure of her tear stained face she turned it languidly to the wall are you ill my dear he asked men are so considerately practical he begged urgently to be allowed to send for a doctor but women when they choose to be unhappy will not accept of practical consolations she moaned a refusal to see the doctor then what can i do for her he naturally thought and he naturally uttered it say good bye to me he whispered and my pretty one will write to me i shall reply so punctually i don't like to leave her at christmas and she will give me a line of italian and a little french mind her accents though and she needn't attempt any of the nasty german kshrra kouzzra kratz which her pretty lips can't do and won't do but only french and italian why she learnt to speak italian la dolcezza ancor dentro me suona don't you remember and made such fun of it at first 'amo zoo' 'no amo me' my sweet this was a specimen of the baby lover talk which is charming in its season and maybe pleasantly cajoling to a loving woman at all times save when she is in dahlia's condition it will serve even then or she will pass it forgivingly as not the food she for a moment requires but it must be purely simple in its utterance otherwise she detects the poor chicanery and resents the meanness of it she resents it with unutterable sickness of soul for it is the language of what were to her the holiest hours of her existence which is thus hypocritically used to blind and rock her in a cradle of deception if corrupt she maybe brought to answer to it all the same and she will do her part of the play and babble words and fret and pout deliciously and the old days will seem to be revived when both know they are dead and she will thereby gain any advantage she is seeking but dahlia's sorrow was deep her heart was sound she did not even perceive the opportunity offered to her for a wily performance she felt the hollowness of his speech and no more and she said good bye edward he had been on one knee springing cheerfully to his feet good bye darling he said but i must see her sit to table first such a wretched dinner for her and he mumbled by jove i suppose i shan't get any at all myself his watch confirmed it to him that any dinner which had been provided for him at the club would be spoilt never mind he said aloud and examined the roast beef ruefully thinking that doubtless it being more than an hour behind the appointed dinner time at the club his guest must now be gone for a minute or so he gazed at the mournful spectacle the potatoes looked as if they had committed suicide in their own steam there were mashed turnips with a glazed surface like the bright bottom of a tin pan one block of bread was by the lonely plate neither hot nor cold the whole aspect of the dinner table resisted and repelled the gaze and made no pretensions to allure it the thought of partaking of this repast endowed him with a critical appreciation of its character and a gush of charitable emotion for the poor girl who had such miserable dishes awaiting her arrested the philosophic reproof which he could have administered to one that knew so little how a dinner of any sort should be treated he strode to the windows pulled down the blind he had previously raised rang the bell and said dahlia there i'm going to dine with you my love i've rung the bell for more candles the room shivers that girl will see you if you don't take care where is the key of the cupboard we must have some wine out the champagne at all events won't be flat he commenced humming the song of complacent resignation dahlia was still inanimate but as the door was about to open she rose quickly and sat in a tremble on the sofa concealing her face an order was given for additional candles coals and wood when the maid had disappeared dahlia got on her feet and steadied herself by the wall tottering away to her chamber ah poor thing ejaculated the young man not without an idea that the demonstration was unnecessary for what is decidedly disagreeable is in a young man's calculation concerning women not necessary at all quite the reverse are not women the flowers which decorate sublunary life it is really irritating to discover them to be pieces of machinery that for want of proper oiling creak stick threaten convulsions and are tragic and stir us the wrong way however champagne does them good an admirable wine a sure specific for the sex he searched around for the keys to get at a bottle and uncork it forthwith the keys were on the mantelpiece a bad comment on dahlia's housekeeping qualities but in the hurry of action let it pass he welcomed the candles gladly and soon had all the cupboards in the room royally open bustle is instinctively adopted by the human race as the substitute of comfort he called for more lights more plates more knives and forks he sent for ice the maid observed that it was not to be had save at a distant street jump into a cab champagne's nothing without ice even in winter he said and rang for her as she was leaving the house to name a famous fishmonger who was sure to supply the ice the establishment soon understood that mr ayrton intended dining within those walls fresh potatoes were put on to boil the landlady came up herself to arouse the fire the maid was for a quarter of an hour hovering between the order to get ice and the execution of immediate commands one was that she should take a glass of champagne to mrs ayrton in her room he drank off one himself mrs ayrton's glass being brought back untouched he drank that off likewise and as he became more exhilarated was more considerate for her to such a degree that when she appeared he seized her hands and only jestingly scolded her for her contempt of sound medicine declaring in spite of her protestations that she was looking lovely and so they sat down to their dinner she with an anguished glance at the looking glass as she sank in her chair it's not bad after all said he drenching his tasteless mouthful of half cold meat with champagne the truth is that clubs spoil us this is spartan fare come drink with me my dearest one sip she was coaxed by degrees to empty a glass she had a gentle heart and could not hold out long against a visible lively kindliness it pleased him that she should bow to him over fresh bubbles and they went formally through the ceremony and she smiled he joked and laughed and talked and she eyed him a faint sweetness he perceived now that she required nothing more than the restoration of her personal pride and setting bright eyes on her hazarded a bold compliment dahlia drooped like a yacht with idle sails struck by a sudden blast that dips them in the salt but she raised her face with the full bloom of a blush and all was plain sailing afterward has my darling seen her sister he asked softly dahlia answered no in the same tone both looked away she won't leave town without seeing you i hope i don't know she she has called at our last lodgings twice alone yes i think so dahlia kept her head down replying and his observation of her wavered uneasily why not write to her then she will bring father the sob thickened in her throat but alas for him who had at first while she was on the sofa affected to try all measures to revive her that i must declare him to know well how certain was his mastery over her when his manner was thoroughly kind he had not much fear of her relapsing at present you can't see your father no but do it's best i can't why not not she hesitated and clasped her hands in her lap yes yes i know said he but still you could surely see him you rouse suspicions that need not exist try another glass my dear no more well as i was saying you force him to think and there is no necessity for it he maybe as hard on this point as you say but now and then a little innocent deception maybe practised we only require to gain time you place me in a very hard position i have a father too he has his own idea of things he's a proud man as i've told you tremendously ambitious and he wants to push me not only at the bar but in the money market matrimonial all these notions i have to contend against things can't be done at once if i give him a shock well we'll drop any consideration of the consequences write to your sister to tell her to bring your father if they make particular inquiries very unlikely i think but if they do put them at their ease she sighed why was my poor darling so upset when i came in said he there was a difficulty in her speaking he waited with much patient twiddling of bread crumbs and at last she said my sister called twice at my our old lodgings the second time she burst into tears the girl told me so but women cry so often and for almost anything dahlia rhoda cries with her hands closed hard and her eyelids too well that maybe her way i have only seen her cry once and that was when mother was dying and asked her to fetch a rose from the garden i met her on the stairs she was like wood she hates crying she loves me so the sympathetic tears rolled down dahlia's cheeks so you quite refuse to see your father he asked not yet not yet he repeated at the touch of scorn in his voice she exclaimed oh edward not yet i cannot i know i am weak i can't meet him now if my rhoda had come alone as i hoped but he is with her don't blame me edward i can't explain i only know that i really have not the power to see him edward nodded the sentiment some women put into things is inexplicable he said your sister and father will return home they will have formed their ideas you know how unjust they will be since however the taste is for being a victim eh london lodging house rooms in winter when the blinds are down and a cheerless fire is in the grate or when blinds are up and street lamps salute the inhabitants with uncordial rays are not entertaining places of residence for restless spirits edward paced about the room he lit a cigar and puffed at it fretfully will you come and try one of the theatres for an hour he asked she rose submissively afraid to say that she thought she should look ill in the staring lights but he with great quickness of perception rendered her task easier by naming the dress she was to wear the jewels and the colour of the opera cloak thus prompted dahlia went to her chamber and passively attired herself thankful to have been spared the pathetic troubles of a selection of garments from her wardrobe when she came forth edward thought her marvellously beautiful pity that she had no strength of character whatever nor any pointed liveliness of mind to match and wrestle with his own and cheer the domestic hearth but she was certainly beautiful edward kissed her hand in commendation though it was practically annoying that she should be sad the hue and spirit of sadness came home to her aspect sorrow visited her tenderly falling eyelids like a sister etext editor's bookmarks but great powerful london the new universe to her spirit but the key to young men is the ambition or in the place of it but you must be beautiful to please some men dahlia the perplexity to her sister's heart lay stretched developing stiff solid unobtrusive men and very personable women it was her prayer to heaven that she might save a doctor's bill mrs fleming of queen anne's farm was the wife of a yeoman my plain story is of two kentish damsels the idea of love upon the lips of ordinary men provoked dahlia's irony the kindest of men can be cruel william john fleming was simply a poor farmer
