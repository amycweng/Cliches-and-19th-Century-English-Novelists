ormont and his aminta book i love at a school ii lady charlotte iii the tutor iv recognition chapter i love at a school a procession of schoolboys having to meet a procession of schoolgirls on the sundays dead march called a walk round the park could hardly go by without dropping to a hum in its chatter and the shot of incurious halfeyes the petticoated creaturesall so much of a swarm unless you stare at them like lanterns the boys cast glance because it relieved their heaviness things were lumpish and gloomy that day of the week the girls who sped their peep of inquisition before the moment of transit let it be seen that they had minds occupied with thoughts of their own our gallant fellows forgot the intrusion of the foreign as soon as it had passed a sarcastic discharge was jerked by chance at the usher and the governessat the old game it seemed or why did they keep steering columns to meet there was no fun in meeting it would never be happening every other sunday and oftener by sheer tosspenny accident they were moved like pieces for the pleasure of these two sometimes the meeting occurred twice during the stupid marchout when it became so nearly vexatious to boys almost biliously oppressed by the tedium of a day merely allowing them to shove the legs along ironically naming it animal excise that some among them pronounced the sham variation of monotony to be a bothering nuisance if it was going to happen every sunday though sunday required diversions they hated the absurdity in this meeting and meeting for they were obliged to anticipate it as a part of their ignominious weekly performance and they could not avoid reflecting on it as a thing done over again it had them in front and in rear and it was a kind of broadside mirror flashing at them the exact opposite of themselves in an identically similar situation that forced a resemblance touching the old game cupers fold was a healthy school owing to the good lead of the head boy matey weyburn a lad with a heart for games to bring renown and no thought about girls his emulation the fellows fancied was for getting the school into a journal of the sports he used to read one sent him by a sporting officer of his name and talk enviously of public schools printed whatever they dida privilege and dignity of which they had unrivalled enjoyment in the past days when wealth was more jealously exclusive and he was always prompting for challenges and saving up to pay expenses and the fellows were to laugh at kicks and learn the art of selfdefencetrain to rejoice in whipcord muscles the son of a tradesman if a boy fell under the imputation was worthy of honour with him let the fellow but show grip and toughness he loathed a skulker and his face was known for any boy who would own to fatigue or confess himself beaten go to bed was one of his terrible stings matey was good at lessons tooliked them liked latin and greek would help a poor stumbler where he did such good work was in sharpening the fellows to excel he kept them to the grindstone so that they had no time for rusty brooding and it was fit done by exhortations off a pedestal like st paul at the athenians it breathed out of him every day of the week he carried a light for followers whatever he demanded of them he himself did it easily he would say to boys youre going to be men meaning something better than women there was a notion that matey despised girls consequently never much esteemed they were in disfavour the old game was mentioned only because of a tradition of an usher and governess leering sick eyes until they slunk away round a corner and married and set up a school for themselvesan emasculate ending comment on it came of a design to show that the whole game had been examined dismissed as uninteresting and profitless one of the boys alluded in mateys presence to their general view upon the part played by womankind on the stage confident of a backing and he had it in a way their noble chief whisked the subject as not worth a discussion but he turned to a younger chap who said he detested girls and asked him how about a sister at home and the youngster coloured and matey took him and spun him round with a friendly tap on the shoulder odd remarks at intervals caused it to be suspected that he had ideas concerning girls they were high as his head above the school and there they were left with algebra and homer for they were not of a sort to inflame until the boys noticed how he gave up speaking and fell to hard looking though she was dark enough to get herself named browny in the absence of a fair girl of equal height to set beside her browny shone she had a nice mouth ready for a smile at the corners or so it was before matey let her see that she was his mark now she kept her mouth asleep and her eyes half down up to the moment of her nearing to pass when the girl opened on him as if lifting her eyelids from sleep to the window a full sidelook like a throb and no disguiseno slyness or boldness either not a bit of languishing you might think her heart came quietly out the look was like the fall of light on the hills from the first of morning it lasted half a minute and left a ruffle for a good half hour even the younger fellows without knowing what affected them were moved by the new picture of a girl as if it had been a frontispiece of a romantic story some day to be read she looked compelled to look but consenting and unashamed at home in submission just the look that wins observant boys shrewd as dogs to read by signs if they are interested in the persons they read brownys meaning that matey had only to come and snatch her he was her master and she was a brave girl ready to go all over the world with him had taken to him as he to her shot for shot her taking to the pick of the school was a capital proof that she was of the right sort to be sure she could not much help herself some of the boys regretted her not being fair but as they felt and sought to explain in the manner of the wag of a tail with elbows and eyebrows to one anothers understanding fair girls could never have let fly such look fair girls are softer woollier and when they mean to look serious overdo it by craping solemn or they pinafore a jigging eagerness or hoist propriety on a chubby flaxen grin or else they dart an eye or they mince and prim and pout and are sighaway and dying ducky given to girls tricks browny after all was the girl for matey she won a victory right away and out of hand on behalf of her cloudand moon sisters as against the sunnymeadowy for slanting intermediates are not espied of boys in anything conquered by browny they went over to her colour equal to arguing that venus at her mightiest must have been dark or she would not have stood a comparison with the forest goddess of the crescent swanning it through a lakeon the leap for run of the chasewatching the dart with her humming bow at breast the fair are simple sugary things prone to fat like broadsops in milk but the others are milky nuts good to bite lacedaemonian virgins hard to beat putting us on our mettle and they are for heroes and they can be brave so these boys felt conquered by browny a sneaking native taste for the forsaken side known to renegades hauled at them if her image waned during the week and it waned a little but sunday restored and stamped it by a sudden turn the whole upperschool had fallen to thinking of girls and the meeting on the sunday was a prospect one of the dayboarders had a sister in the seminary of miss vincent he was plied to obtain information concerning brownys name and her parents he had it pat to hand in answer no parents came to see her an aunt came now and then her aunts name was not wanted brownys name was aminta farrell farrell might pass aminta was debated this female christian name had a foreign twang it gave dissatisfaction boy after boy had a try at it with the same effect you could not speak the name without a pursing of the month and a puckering of the nose beastly to see as one little fellow reminded them on a day when matey was in more than common favour topping a pitch of rapture for clean bowling first ball middle stump on the kick the best bat of the other eleven in a match and says this youngster drawling soon after the cheers and claps had subsided to business aminta he made it funny by saying it as if to himself and the ground in a subdued way while he swung his leg on a halfcircle like a skater hands in pockets he was a sly young rascal innocently precocious enough and he meant no disrespect either to browny or to matey but he had to run for it his delivery of the name being so like what was in the breasts of the senior fellows as to the inferiority of any aminta to old matey that he set them laughing and browny was on the field to reprove them left of the teabooth with her schoolmates part of her head under a scarlet parasol a girl with such a name as aminta might not be exactly up to the standard of old matey still if he thought her so and she had spirit the school was bound to subscribe and that look of hers warranted her for taking her share in the story like the brigands wife loading gnus for him while he knocks over the foremost carabineer on the mountainledge below who drops on his back with a hellish expression browny was then clearly seen all round instead of only frontface as on the sunday in the park when fellows could not spy backward after passing the pleasure they had in seeing her all round involved no fresh stores of observation for none could tell how she tied her backhair which was the question put to them by a cynic of a boy said to be queasy with excess of sisters they could tell that she was tall for a girl or tallishnot a maypole she drank a cup of tea and ate a slice of breadandbutter no cake she appeared undisturbed when matey wearing his holiday white ducks and all aglow entered the booth she was not expected to faint only she stood for the foreign aminta more than for their familiar browny in his presence not a sign of the look which had fired the school did she throw at him change the colour and you might compare her to a lobster fixed on end with a chin and no eyes matey talked to miss vincent up to the instant of his running to bat she would have liked to guess how he knew she had a brother on the medical staff of one of the regiments in india she asked him twice and his cheeks were redder than cricket in the sun he said he read all the reports from india and asked her whether she did not admire lord ormont our general of cavalry whose charge at the head of fifteen hundred horse in the last great battle shattered the enemys right wing and gave us the victoryrolled him up and stretched him out like a carpet for dusting miss vincent exclaimed that it was really strange now he should speak of lord ormont for she had been speaking of him herself in morning to one of her young ladies whose mind was bent on his heroic deeds matey turned his face to the group of young ladies quite pleased that one of them loved his hero and he met a smile here and therenot from miss aminta farrell she was a complete disappointment to the boys that day aminta was mouthed at any allusions to her so she not being a match for matey they let her drop the flush that had swept across the school withered to a dry recollection except when on one of their sunday afternoons she fanned the desert lord ormont became the subject of inquiry and conversation and for his own sakenot altogether to gratify matey the saturday autumn evenings walk home after the race out to tea at a distant village too late in the year for cricket too early for regular football suited matey going at long strides for the story of his heros adventures and it was nicer than talk about girls and puzzling here lay a clear field for he had the right to speak of a cavalry officer his father died of wounds in the service and matey naturally intended to join the dragoons if he could get enough money to pay for mess he said laughing lord ormont was his pattern of a warrior we had in him a lord who cast off luxury to live like a spartan when under arms with a passion to serve his country and sustain the glory of our military annals he revived respect for the noble class in the hearts of englishmen he was as good an authority on horseflesh as any englishman alive the best for the management of cavalry there never was a better cavalry leader the boys had come to know that browny admired lord ormont so they saw a double reason why matey should and walking home at his grand swing in the october dusk their school hero drew their national hero closer to them every fellow present was dead against the usher mr shalders when he took advantage of a pause to strike in with his murat he harped on murat whenever he had a chance now he did it for the purpose of casting eclipse upon majorgeneral lord ormont the son and grandson of english earls for he was an earl by his title and murat was the son of an innkeeper shalders had to admit that murat might have served in the stables when a boy honour to murat of course for climbing the peaks shalders too might interest him in military affairs and murat he did no harm and could be amusing it rather added to his amount of dignity it was rather absurd at the same time for an english usher to be spouting and glowing about a french general who had been a stableboy and became a king with his murat this murat that and hurrah murat in red and white and green uniform tunic and breeches and a chimneyafire of feathers and how the giant he was charged at the head of ten thousand horse all going like a cataract under a rainbow over the rocks right into the middle of the enemy and through and he a spark ahead and the enemy streaming on all sides flat away as you see puffed smoke and flame of a bonfire that was fun to set boys jigging no wonder how in russia the cossacks feared him and scampered from the shadow of his plumeswere clouds flying off his breath that was a fine warm picture for the boys on late autumn or early winter evenings shalders warming his back at the grate describing bivouacs in the snow they liked well enough to hear him when he was not opposing matey and lord ormont he perked on his toes and fetched his hand from behind him to flourish it when his murat came out the speaking of his name clapped him on horsebackthe only horseback he ever knew he was as fond of giving out the name murat as you see in old engravings of tobaccoshops men enjoying the emission of their whiff of smoke matey was not inclined to class lord ormont alongside murat a firstrate horseman and an eagleeye as shalders rightly said and matey agreed that forty thousand cavalry under your orders is a toss above fifteen hundred but the claim for a frenchman of a superlative merit to swallow and make nothing of the mention of our best cavalry generals irritated him to call murat a mountebank shalders retorted that lord ormont was a reprobate matey hoped he would some day write us an essay on the morale of illustrious generals of cavalry and shalders told him he did not advance his case by talking nonsense each then repeated to the boys a famous exploit of his hero their verdict was favourable to lord ormont our english general learnt riding before he was ten years old on the pampas where you ride all day and cook your steak for your dinner between your seat and your saddle he rode with his father and his uncle muncastle the famous traveller into paraguay he saw fighting before he was twelve before he was twenty he was learning outpost duty in the austrian frontier cavalry he served in the peninsula served in canada served in india volunteered for any chance of distinction no need to say much of his mastering the picked indian swordsmen in single combat he knew their trick and was quick to save his reins when they made a dash threatening the headstrokeabout the same as disabling sails in old naval engagements that was the part for the officer we are speaking of the general for that matter he had as keen an eye for the field and the moment for his arm to strike as any murat one world have liked to see murat matched against the sabre of a wily rajpoot as to campaigns and strategy lord ormonts head was a map what of murat and lord ormont horse to horse and sword to sword come imagine that if you are for comparisons and if lord ormont never headed a lot of thousands it does not prove he was unable lord ormont was as big as murat more he was a christian to his horses how about murat in that respect lord ormont cared for his men did murat so particularly much and he was as cunning fronting odds and a thunderbolt at the charge why speak of him in the past he is an english lord a lord by birth and he is alive things may be expected of him tomorrow or next day shalders here cut matey short by meanly objecting to that men are mortal he said with a lot of pretended stuff deploring our human condition in the elegy strain and he fell to reckoning the english heros ageas that he lord ormont had been a name in the world for the last twentyfive years or more the noble lord could be no chicken we are justified in calculating by the course of nature that his term of activity is approaching or has approached or in fact has drawn to its close if your estimate sir approaches to correctness rejoined matey tellingly his comrades thought sixty as you may learn some day is a serious age matthew weyburn matey said he should be happy to reach it with half the honours lord ormont had won excepting the duels shalders had the impudence to say if the cause is a good one cried matey the cause or lord ormont has been maligned was reprehensible in the extremest degree shalders cockhorsed on his heels to his toes and back with a bang what was the cause if you please sir a boy probably naughty inquired and as shalders did not vouchsafe a reply the bigger boys knew they revelled in the devilish halo of skirts on the whirl encircling lord ormonts laurelled head that was a spark in their blood struck from a dislike of the tone assumed by mr shalders to sustain his argument with his men are mortal and talk of a true living champion as no chicken and the wordy drawl over justification for calculating the approach of a close to a term of activityin the case of a proved hero guardians of boys should make sure that the boys are on their side before they raise the standard of virtue nor ought they to summon morality for support of a polemic matey weyburns object of worship rode superior to a morality puffing its phrasy trumpet and somehow the sacrifice of an enormous number of women to lord ormonts glory seemed natural the very thing that should be in the case of a firstrate military hero and commanderscipio notwithstanding it brightens his flame and it is agreeable to them that is how they come to distinction they have no other chance they are only women they are mad to be singed and they rush pelfmall all for the honour of the candle shortly after this discussion matey was heard informing some of the bigger fellows he could tell them positively that lord ormonts age was under fiftyfourthe prime of manhood and a jolly long way off death the greater credit to him therefore if he bad been a name in the world for anything like the period shalders insinuated to get himself out of a sad quandary matey sounded the queer word so as to fix it sticking to the usher calling him mr peter bell shalders at which the boys roared and there was a question or two about names which belonged to verses for people caring to read poems to the joy of the school he displayed a greater knowledge of murat than shalders had named the different places in europe where lord ormont and murat were both springing to the saddle at the same timeone a marshal the other a lieutenant one a king to be off his throne any day the other a born english nobleman seated firm as fate and he accused murat of carelessness of his horses ingratitude to his benefactor circussy style shalders went so far as to defend murat for attending to the affairs of his kingdom instead of galloping over hedges and ditches to swell napoleons ranks in distress matey listened to him there he became grave he nodded like a man saying i suppose we must examine it in earnest the school was damped to hear him calling it a nice question still he said he thought he should have gone and that settled it the boys inclined to speak contemptuously of shalders matey world not let them he contrasted shalders with the other ushers who had no enthusiasms he said enthusiasms were salt to a man and he liked shalders for spelling at his battles and thinking he understood them and admiring murat and leading virgil and parts of lucan for his recreation he said he liked the french because they could be splendidly enthusiastic he almost lost his english flavour when he spoke in downright approval of a small french fellow coming from orthez near the pyrenees for senselessly dashing and kicking at a couple of english who jeered to hear orthez nameda place trampled under wellingtons heels on his march across conquered france the foreign little cockerel was a clever lad learning english fast and anxious to show he had got hold of the english trick of not knowing when he was beaten his french vanity insisted on his engaging the two though one of them stood aside and the other let him drive his nose all the compass round at a poker fist what was worse matey examined these two in the interests of fair play as if he doubted little emile grenat set matters right with his boast to vindicate his country against double the number and matey praised him though he knew emile had been floored without effort by the extension of a single fist he would not hear the french abused he said they were chivalrous they were fine fellows topping the world in some things his father had fought them and learnt to respect them perhaps his father had learnt to respect jews for there was a boy named abner he protected who smelt jewish he said they ran us gentiles hard and carried big guns only a reputation like mateys could have kept his leadership from a challenge joseph masner formerly a rival went about hinting and shrugging all to no purpose you find boys born to be chiefs on the day of the snowfight matey won the toss and chose j masner first pick and masner aged seventeen and some months big as a navvy lumbered across to him and took his directions proud to stand in the front centre at the head of the attack and bear the bruntjust what he was fit for matey gave no offence by choosing halfway down the list his little french friend whom he stationed beside himself rather off his battlefront as at point at cricket not quite so far removed two boys at his heels piled ammunition the sides met midway of a marshy ground where a couple of flat and shelving banks formed for a broad new road good for ten abreastcounting a step of the slopesran transverse and the order of the game was to clear the bank and drive the enemy on to the frozen ditchwater miss vincent heard in the morning from the sister of little collett of the great engagement coming off she was moved by curiosity and so the young ladies of her establishment beheld the young gentlemen of mr cupers in furious division and mateys sore aim and hard fling equal to a slingers relieving j masner of a foremost assailant with a spanker on the nob they may have fancied him clever for selecting a position rather comfortable as things went until they had sight of him with his little french ally and two others ammunition boys to rear descending one bank and scaling another right into the flank of the enemy when his old tower of a masner was being heavily pressed by numbers then came a fight hand to hand but the enemy stood in a clamp not to split like a nut between crackers they gave way and rolled backing in lumps from bank to ditch the battle was over before the young ladies knew they wondered to see matey shuffling on his coat and hopping along at easy bounds to pay his respects to miss vincent near whom was browny and this time he and browny talked together he then introduced little emile to her she spoke of napoleon at brienne and complimented matey he said he was cavalry not artillery that day they talked to hear one anothers voices by constantly appealing to miss vincent he made their conversation together seem as under her conduct and she took a slide on some french phrases with little emile her young ladies looked shrinking and envious to see the fellows wet to the skin laughing wrestling linking arms and some who were clownfaced with a wipe of scarlet getting friends to rub their cheeks with snow all of them happy as larks in air a big tea steaming for them at the school those girls had a leap and a fail of the heart glad to hug themselves in their dry clothes and not so warm as the dripping boys were nor so madly fond of their dresscircle seats to look on at a play they were not allowed even to desire to share they looked on at blows given and taken in good temper hardship sharpening jollity the thought of the difference between themselves and the boys must have been something like the tight bandcall it corsetover the chest trying to lift and stretch for draughts of air but brownys feeling naturally was that all this advantage for the boys came of matey weyburns lead miss vincent with her young ladies walked off in couples orderly chicks the usual sunday march of their every day the school was coolish to them one of the fellows hummed bars of some hymn tune rather faster than church and next day there was a murmur of letters passing between matey and browny regularly little collett for postman anybody might have guessed it but the report spread a feeling that girls are not the entirely artificial beings or flat targets we suppose the school began to brood like air deadening on ovenheat winter is henmother to the idea of love in schools if the idea has fairly entered various girls of different colours were selected by boys for animated correspondence that never existed and was vigorously prosecuted with efforts to repress contempt of them in courtship for their affections they found their part of it by no means difficult when they imagined the lines without the words or better still the letter without the lines a holy satisfaction belonged to the sealed thing the breaking of the seal and inspection of the contents imposed perplexity on that sentiment they thought of certain possible sentences matey and browny would exchange but the plain conceivable almost visible outside of the letter had a stronger spell for them than the visionary inside this fancied contemplation of the loveletter was reversed in them at once by the startling news of miss vincents discovery and seizure of the sealed thing and her examination of the burden it contained then their thirst was for dramato see to drink every wonderful syllable those lovers had written miss vincents hand was upon one of mateys letters she had come across the sister of little collett selina her name was carrying it she saw nothing of the others aminta was not the girl to let her nor did mr cuper dare demand from matey a sight or restitution of the young ladys half of the correspondence he preached heavily at matey deplored that the boy he most trusted etcthe school could have repeated it without hearing we know the masters lecture in tonesit sings up to sing down and touches nobody as soon as he dropped to natural talk and spoke of his responsibility and miss vincents matey gave the word of a man of honour that he would not seek to communicate farther with miss farrell at the school now there was a regular thunderhash among the boys on the rare occasions when they met the girls all that matey and browny were forbidden to write they lookedmuch like what it had been before the discovery and they dragged the boys back from promised instant events it was nevertheless a heaving picture like the sea in the background of a marine piece at the theatre which rouses anticipations of storm and shows readiness brownys full eyebrow sat on her dark eye like a cloud of winter noons over the vanishing sun matey was the prisoner gazing at light of a barred window and measuring the strength of the bars she looked unhappy but looked unbeaten more her look at him fed the school on thoughts of what love really is when it is not fished out of books and poetry for though she was pale starved and pale they could see she was never the one to be sighing and as for him he looked ground dower all to edge however much they puzzled over things she made them feel they were sure as to her that she drove straight and meant blood the life or death of it all her own if need be and confidence in the captain she had chosen she could have been imagined saying there is a storm but i am ready to embark with you this minute that sign of courage in real danger ennobled her among girls the name browny was put aside for a respectful aminta big and bright events to come out in the world were hinted from the love of such a couple the boys were not ashamed to speak the very word love how he does love that girl well and how she loves him she did but the boys had to be seeing her look at matey if they were to put the girl on some balanced equality with a fellow she was compelled to love it seemed to them that he gave and that she was a creature carried to him like driftwood along the current of the flood given in spite of herself when they saw those eyes of hers they were impressed with an idea of her as a voluntary giver too pretty well the half to the bargain and it confused their notion of feminine inferiority they resolved to think her an exceptional girl which in truth they could easily do for none but an exceptional girl could win matey to love her since nothing appeared likely to happen at the school they speculated upon what would occur out in the world and were assisted to conjecture by a rumour telling of aminta farrells aunt as a resident at dover those were days when the benevolently international m de porquet had begun to act as interpreter to english schools in the portico of the french language and under his guidance it was asked in contempt of the answer combien de postes dici a douvres but accepting the rumour as a piece of information the answer became important ici was twenty miles to the northwest of london how long would it take matey to reach donvres or at which of the combien did he intend to waylay and away with aminta the boys went about pounding at the interrogative french phrase in due sincerity behind the burlesque of traveller bothering coachman mateys designs could be finessed only by a knowledge of his character that he was not the fellow to give up the girl he had taken to and impediments might multiply but he would bear them down three days before the breakup of the school another rumour came tearing through it amintas aunt had withdrawn her from miss vincents and now rose the question twodozenmouthed did matey know her address at douvres his face grew stringy and his voice harder and his eyes ready to burst from a smother of fire all the same he did his work he was the good old fellow at games considerate in school affairs kind to the youngsters he was heard to laugh he liked best the company of his little french friend from orthez over whose shoulder his hand was laid sometimes as they strolled and chatted in two languages he really went a long way to make french fellows popular and the boys were sorry that little emile was off to finish his foreign education in germany his english was pretty good thanks to matey he went away promising to remember old england saying he was french first and a briton next he had lots of plunk which accounted for mateys choice of him as a friend among the juniors chapter ii lady charlotte lovepassages at a school must produce a ringing crisis if they are to leave the rosy impression which spans the gap of holidays neither matey nor browny returned to their yoke and cupers boys recollected the couple chiefly on sundays they remembered several of mateys doings and sayings his running and high leaping his bowling a maxim or two of his and the tight strong fellow he was also that the damsels colour distinctly counted for dark she became nearly black in their minds well and englishmen have been known to marry indian princesses some have a liking for negresses there are nubians rather pretty in pictures if you can stand thick lips her colour does not matter provided the girl is of the right sort the exchange of letters between the lovers was mentioned the discovery by miss vincent of their cool habit of corresponding passed for an incident and there it remained stiff as a poet not being heated by a story to run so the foregone excitement lost warmth and went out like a winter sun at noon or a match lighted before the candle is handy lord ormont continued to be a subject of discussion from time to time for he was a name in the newspapers and mr shalders had been worked by matey weyburn into a state of raw antagonism at the mention of the gallant general he could not avoid sitting in judgement on him according to mr shalders the opinion of all thoughtful people in england was with john company and the better part of the press to condemn lord ormont in his quarrel with the commissioner of one of the indian provinces who had the support of the governor of his presidency and of the viceroy the latter not unreservedly yet ostensibly inclined to condemn a too prompt military hand the gordian knot of a difficulty cut is agreeable in the contemplation of an official chief hesitating to use the sword and benefiting by having it done for him lord ormont certainly cut the knot mr shalders was cornered by the boys coming at him one after another without a stop vowing it was the exercise of a military judgement upon a military question at a period of urgency which had brought about the quarrel with the commissioner and the reproof of the governor he betrayed the man completely cornered by generalizing he said we are a civilian people we pride ourselves on having civilian methods how can that be if we have won india with guns and swords but that splendid jewel for englands tiara won said he and he might as well have said crown we are bound to sheathe the sword and govern by the book of the law but if they wont have the book of the law they knew the power behind it not if we knock nothing harder than the book of the law upon their skulls happily for the country englands councils are not directed by boys ah but were speaking of india mr shalders you are presuming to speak of an act of insubordination committed by a military officer under civilian command what if we find an influential prince engaged in conspiracy we look for proof suppose we have good proof we summon him to exonerate himself no we mount and ride straight away into his territory spot the treason deport him and rule in his place it was all very well for mr shalders to say he talked to boys he was cornered again as his shrug confessed the boys asked among themselves whether he would have taken the same view if his murat had done it these illogical boys fought for matey weyburn in their defence of lord ormont somewhere they wee sure old matey was hammering to the same endthey could hear him thought of him inspired them to unwonted argumentative energy that they might support his cause and scatter the gloomy prediction of the school as going to the dogs now matey had left the subject provoked everywhere in great britain a division similar to that between master and boys at cupers establishment one party for our modern english magisterial methods with indians the other for the decisive oriental at the early time to suit their native tastes and the book of the law is to be conciliatingly addressed to their sentiments by a benign civilizing power or the sword is out smartly at the hint of a warning to protect the swords conquests under one aspect we appear potteringly european under another drunk of the east lord ormonts ride at the head of two hundred horsemen across a stretch of country including hill and forest to fall like a bolt from the blue on the suspected prince in the midst of his gathering warriors was a handsome piece of daring and the highhanded treatment of the prince was held by his advocates to be justified by the provocation and the result he scattered an unprepared body of many hundreds who might have enveloped him and who would presumptively have stood their ground had they not taken his handful to be the advance of regiments these are the deeds that win empires the argument in his favour ran are they of a character to maintain empires the counterquestion was urged men of a deliberative aspect were not wanting in approval of the sharp and summary of the sword in air when we have to deal with indians they chose to regard it as a matter of the dealing with indians and put aside the question of the contempt of civil authority counting the cries lord ormont won his case festival aldermen smoking clubmen buckskin squires obsequious yet privately excitable tradesmen sedentary coachmen and cabmen of viking descent were set to think like boys about him and the boys the women and the poets formed a tipsy chorea journalists on the whole were fairly halved as regarded numbers in relation to weight they were with the burgess and the presbyter they preponderated heavily in the direction of englands burgess view of all cases disputed between civilian and soldier but that was when the peril was over admirers of lord ormont enjoyed a perusal of a letter addressed by him to the burgesss journal and so did his detractors the printing of it was an act of editorial ruthlessness the noble soldier had no mould in his intellectual or educational foundry for the casting of sentences and the editors leading type to the letter without further notice of the writerwho was given a prominent place or scaffolding for the execution of himself publicly if it pleased him to do that thingtickled the critical mind lord ormont wrote intemperately his titanic hurling of blocks against critics did no harm to an enemy skilled in the use of trimmer weapons notably the fine one of letting big missiles rebound he wrote from india with indian heatcurry and capsicums it was remarked he dared to claim the countenance of the commanderinchief of the army of india for an act disapproved by the india house other letters might be on their way curryer than the preceding his friends feared and might also be malevolently printed similarly commissioning the reverberation of them to belabour his name before the public admirers were still prepared to admire but aldermen not at the feast squirearchs not in the saddle or at the bottle some few of the juvenile and female fervent were becoming susceptible to a frosty critical tone in the public pronunciation of lord ormonts name since the printing of his letter and the letters it called forth none of them doubted that his case was good the doubt concerned the effect on it of his manner of pleading it and if he damaged his case he compromised his admirers why the case of a man who has cleverly won a bold stroke for his country must be good as long as he holds his tongue a grateful country will right him in the end he has only to wait and not so very long this i did now examine it nothing more needed to be said by him if that true he has a temper it is owned that he is a hero we take him with his qualities impetuosity being one and not unsuited to his arm of the service as be has shown if his temper is high it is an element of a character proved heroical so has the sun his blotches and we believe that they go to nourish the luminary rather than that they are a disease of the photosphere lord ormonts apologists had to contend with anecdotes and dicta now pouring in from offended britons for illustration of an impetuosity fit to make another charley xii of swedena gratuitous coriolanus haughtiness as well new among a people accustomed socially to bow the head to their nobles and not of late expecting a kick for their pains newspapers wrote of him that a martinet to subordinates he was known for the most unruly of lieutenants they alluded to current sayings as that he habitually took counsel of his horse on the field when a movement was entrusted to his discretion numerous were the journalistic sentences running under an air of eulogy of the lordly warrior purposely to be tripped and producing their damnable effect despite the obvious artifice the writer of the letter from bombay signed ormont was a born subject for the antithetical craftsmens tricky springes he was additionally of infamous repute for morale in burgess estimation from his having a keen appreciation of female beauty and a prickly sense of masculine honour the stir to his name roused pestilential domestic stories in those days the aristocrat still claimed licence and eminent soldiernobles comporting themselves as imitative servants of their god mars on the fields of love and war stood necessarily prepared to vindicate their conduct as the field of the measured paces without deeming themselves bounden to defend the course they took our burgess who bowed head to his aristocrat and hired the soldier to fight for him could not see that such misbehaviour necessarily ensued lord ormont had fought duels at home and abroad his readiness to fight again and against odds and with a totally unused weapon was exhibited by his attack on the press in the columns of the press it wore the comical face to the friends deploring it which belongs to things we do that are so very like us they agreed with his devoted sister lady charlotte eglett as to the prudence of keeping him out of england for a time if possible at the first perusal of the letter lady charlotte quitted her place in leicestershire husband horses guests the hunt to scour across a vacant london and pick up acquaintances under stress to be spots there in the hunting season with them to gossip for counsel on the subject of ormonts handgrenade and how to stop and extinguish a second she was a person given to plain speech stinkpot she called it when acknowledging foul elements in the composition and the harm it did to the unskilful balist her view of the burgess english imaged a mighty monster behind bars to whom we offer anything but our hand as soon as he gets held of that he has you he wont let it loose with flesh on the bones we must offend himwe cant be man or woman without offending his tastes and his worships but while we keep from contact ie intercommunication he may growl he is harmless witness the many occasions when her brother offended worse and had been unworried only growled at and distantly not in a way to rouse concern and at the neat review or procession into the city or public display of any sort ormont had but to show himself he was the popular favourite immediately he had not committed the folly of writing a letter to a newspaper then lady charlotte paid an early visit to the office of the great london solicitor arthur abner who wielded the law as an instrument of protection for countless illustrious people afflicted by what they stir or attract in a wealthy metropolis she went simply to gossip of her brothers affairs with a refreshing man of the world not given to circumlocutions and not afraid of her she had no deeper object but fancying she heard the clerk on his jump from the stool inform her that mr abner was out out she cried and rattled the room thumping under knitted brows out of town for a man of business taking holidays when a lady craves for gossip disappointed her faith in him as cruelly as the shutup empty inn the broken hunter knocking at a hollow door miles off home mr abner hatted and gloved and smiling came forth going out the man meant lady charlotte at your service for five minutes she complimented his acuteness in the remark you see ive only come to chat and entered his room he led her to her theme the excitement is pretty well over my brothers my chief carealways was im afraid hell be pitchforking at it again and we shall have another blast that letter ought never to have been printed that editor deserves the horsewhip for letting it appear if he prints a second one i shall treat him as a personal enemy better make a friend of him how meet him at my table she jumped an illumined halfabout on her chair so i will then what are the creatures tastes hunts does he the editor rose in her mind from the state of neuter to something of a man i recollect an article in that paper on the ormont duel i hate duelling but i side with my brother i had to laugh though luckily theres no woman on hand at present as far as i know ormonts not likely to be hooked by garrison women or blacks those coloured womensome of ours toosend the nose to the clouds not a bad sign for health and there are men like that old cardinal guicciardini tells ofhum ormonts not one of them i hope hell stay in india till this blows over or i shall be hearing of provocations you have seen the duke she nodded her reserve was a summary of the interview kind as he always is she said ormont has no chance of employment unless theres a european war they cant overlook him in case of war hell have to pray for that let us hope we shant get it my wish but i have to think of my brother if hes in england with no employment hes in a mess with women and men both he kicks if hes laid aside to rust he has a big heart thats what i said all he wants is to serve his country if you wont have war give him gibraltar or malta or command of one of our military districts the southeastern ll be vacant soon hed like to be constable of the castle and have an eye on france i think hes fond of the french loves the french expects to have to fight them all the same he loves his country best heres the man everybodys abusing i demur my lady i was dining the other day with a client of mine and a youngster was present who spoke of lord ormont in a way i should like you to have heard he seemed to know the whole of lord ormonts career from the time of the ride to paraguay up to the capture of the plotting rajah he carried the table good boy we must turn to the boys for justice then name your day for this man this editor i will see him you shall have the day tonight lady charlotte and the editor met she was racy he anecdotal stag fox and hare ran before them over fields and through drawingrooms the scent was rich they found that they could talk to one another as they thought that he was not the islebound burgess nor she the postured english great lady and they exchanged salt without which your current scandal is of exhausted savour they enjoyed the peculiar novel relish of it coming from a social pressman and a dame of high society the different hemispheres became known as one sphere to these birds of broad wing convening in the upper blue above a quartered carcase earth a week later a letter the envelope of a bulky letter in lord ormonts handwriting reached lady charlotte there was a line from the editor would it please your ladyship to have this printed she read the letter and replied come to me for six days you shall have the best mount in the county an editor devoid of malice might probably have forborne to print a letter that appealed to lady charlotte or touched her sensations as if a glimpse of the moon on the homeward ride in winter on a nodding horse had suddenly bared to view a precipitous quarry within two steps there is no knowing few men can forbear to tell a spicy story of their friends and an editor to whom an exhibition of the immensely preposterous on the part of one writing arrogantly must be provocative would feel the interests of his journal not to speak of the claims of readers pluck at him when he meditated the consignment of such a precious composition to extinction lady charlotte withheld a sight of the letter from mr eglett she laid it in her desk understanding well that it was a laugh lost to the world poets could reasonably feign it to shake the desk inclosing it she had a strong sense of humour her mind reverted to the desk in a way to make her lips shut grimly she sided with her brother only pen in hand did he lay himself open to the enemy in his personal intercourse he was the last of men to be taken at a disadvantage lady charlotte was brought round to the distasteful idea of some help coming from a legitimate adjunct at his elbow a restraining womanwife it had to be said and to name the word wife for thomas rowsley earl of ormont put up the porcupine quills she bristled with at the survey of a sex thirsting and likely to continue thirsting for such honour what woman had she known fit to bear the name she had assumed the judicial seat upon the pretensions of several and dismissed them to their limbo after testifying against them who is to know the fit one in these mines of deception women of the class offering wives decline to be taken on trial they are boxes of puzzlesoften dire surprises her brother knew them well enough to shy at the box her brother rowsley had a funny pride like a boy at a game at the never having been caught by one among the many he made captive she let him have it all to himself he boasted it to a sister sharing the pride exultant in the cry of the hawk scornful of ambitions poultry a passed fingerpost to the plucked and really regretful that no woman had been created fit for him when she was not aiding with her brother women however contemptible for their weakness appeared to her as better than barndoor fowl or vermin in their multitudes gnawing to get at the cheesetrap she could be humane even sisterly with women whose conduct or prattle did not outrage plain sense just as the stickler for the privileges of her class was largeheartedly charitable to the classes flowing in oily orderliness round about below itif they did so flow unable to read womans character except upon the broadest lines as it were the spiders main threads of its web she read men minutely from the fact that they were neither mysteries nor terrors to her but creatures of importunate appetites humorous objects very manageable if we leave the road to their muscles dress their wounds smoothe their creases plume their vanity and she had an unerring eye for the man to be used when a blow was needed methods for setting him in action likewise she knew how much stronger than ordinary men the woman who can put them in motion they can be set to serve as pieces of cannon under compliments on their superior powers which were not all undervalued by her on their own merits for she worshipped strength but the said with a certain amount of truth that the women unaware of the advantage society gave them as to mastering men were fools tender is not a word coming near to lady charlotte thoughtful on behalf of the poor foolish victims of men she was she had saved some avenged others it should be stated that her notion of saving was the saving of them from the public she had thrown up a screen the saving of them from themselves was another matterhopeless to her thinking how preach at a creature on the bend of passions rapids one might as well read a chapter from the bible to delirious patients when once a woman is taken with the lovepassion we must treat her as bitten hide her antics from the public that is the principal business if she recovers she resumes her place and horrid old nature who drove her to the frenzy is unlikely to bother or at least overthrow her again unless she is one of the detestable wantons past compassion or consideration in the case reviewed the woman has gone through fire and is none the worse for her experiences worth ten times what she was to an honest man if men could be got to see it some do of those men who do not lady charlotte spoke with the old familynurse humour which is familiar with the tricks and frailties of the infants and it is a knife to probe the male while seemingly it does the part of the napkin pities and pats they expect a return of much for the little that is next to nothing they are fall of expectations and of what else they are hard bargainers she thought this of men and she liked men by choice she had old nurses preference for the lustier male child the others are puling things easier to rear because they bend better and less esteemed though they give less trouble rouse less care but when it came to the duel between the man and the woman her sense of justice was moved to join her with the party of her unfairly handled sistersa strong party if it were not so cowardly she had to think mr eglett her husband accepted heraccepted the position into which he naturally fell beside her and the ideas she imposed on him for she never went counter to his principles these were the fixed principles of a very wealthy man who abhorred debt and was punctilious in veracity scrupulous in cleanliness of mind and body devoted to the honour of his country the interests of his class she respected the high landmark possessing such principles and she was therefore enabled to lead without the wish to rule as it had been between them at the beginning so it was now when they were grandparents running on three lines of progeny from two daughters and a son they were excellent friends few couples can say more the union was good english greythat of a prolonged november to which we are reconciled by occasions for the hunt and the gun she was nevertheless an impassioned woman the feeling for her brother helped to satisfy her hearts fires though as little with her brother as with her husband was she demonstrative lord ormont disrelished the caresses of relatives she for her part had so strong a sympathy on behalf of poor gentlemen reduced to submit to any but a young womans hug that when bronzed from india he quitted the carriage and mounted her steps at olmer the desire to fling herself on his neck and breast took form in the words here you are home again rowsley glad to have you they shook hands firmly he remained three days at olmer his temper was mild his frame of mind bad as could be angry evaporations had left a residuum of solid scorn for these english who rewarded soldierly services as though it were a question of damaged packages of calico he threatened to take the first offer of a foreign state not in insurrection but clear sky was overhead he was the rowsley of the old boyish delight in field sports reminiscences of prowlings and trappings in the woods gropings along waterbanks enjoyment of racy gossip he spoke wrathfully of one of their newspapers which steadily persisted in withholding from publication every letter he wrote to it after printing the first and if it printed one why not the others lady charlotte put it on the quaintness of editors he had found in london perhaps reason for saying that he should do well to be out of this country as early as he could adding presently that he meant to go though it broke his heart to keep away from a six months rest at steignton his wiltshire estate no woman was in the field lady charlotte could have submitted to the intrusion of one of those at times wholesome victims for the sake of the mollification the unhappy proud thing might bring to a hero smarting under injustice at the hands of chiefs and authorities he passed on to steignton returned to london and left england for spain as he wrote word saying he hoped to settle at steignton neat year he was absent the next year and longer lady charlotte had the surprising news that steignton was let shooting and all for five years and he had no appointment out of england or at home when he came to olmer again he was under one of his fits of reserve best undisturbed her sympathy with a great soldier snubbed an active man rusting kept her from remonstrance three years later she was made meditative by the discovery of a womans being absolutely in the field mistress of the field and having been there for a considerable period dating from about the time when he turned his back on england to visit a comradeinarms condemned by the doctors to pass the winter in malaga and it was a young woman a girl in her teens a handsome girl handsome was to be expected ormont bargained for beauty but report said the girl was very handsome and showed breeding she seemed a foreigner walked like a goddess sat her horse the perfect amazon rumour called her a spaniard not if she rides lady charlotte cut that short rumour had subsequently more to say the reporter in her ear did not confirm it and she was resolutely deaf to a story incredible of her brotherthe man of all men living proudest of his name blood station so proud was he by nature too that he disdained to complain of rank injustice he maintained a cheerful front against adversity and obloquy and this man of complete selfcommand who has every form of noble pride gets cajoled like a twentyyearold yahoo at college do you imagine it to suppose of a man cherishing the name of ormont that he would bestow it legally on a woman a stranger and imperil his race by mixing blood with a creature of unknown lineage waswhy of course it was to suppose him struck mad and there never had been madness among the ormonts they were too careful of the purity of the strain lady charlotte talked she was excited and ran her sentences to blanks a cunning way for ministering consolation to her hearing where the sentence intended a question and the blank ending caught up the query tone and carried it dwindling away to the most distant of throttled interrogatives she had in this manner only to askher hearing received the comforting answer it desired for she could take that thin far sound as a travelling laughter of incredulity triumphant derision this meant to herthough she scarcely knew it though the most wilful of women declined to know ita state of alarm she had said of her brother in past days that he would have his time of danger after striking sixty the dangerous person was to be young but then ormont had high principles with regard to the dues to his family his principles could always be trusted the dangerous young person would have to be a person of lineage of a certain station at least no need for a titled woman only for warranted good blood is that to be found certificated out of the rolls of society it may just possibly be found without certificate however in those muddled caverns where the excluded intermingle here and there in a peasant family or a small country tradesmans just raised above a peasant honest regenerating blood will be found nobles wanting refreshment from the soil might do worse than try a slip of one of those juicy weeds ill fated sickly royalties would be setup striding through another half century with such invigoration if it could be done for them there are tales the tales are honourably discredited by the crazy constitutions of the heirs to the diadem yes but we are speculating on the matter seriously as though it were one of intimate concern to the family what is there to make us think that ormont would marry impossible to imagine him intimidated unlikely that he a practised reader of women having so little of the woman in him would be melted by a wily girl as women in the twilight situation have often played the trick to come into the bright beams how they do a desperate thing and call it generosity and then they appeal from it to my lords generosity and so the two generosities drive off in a close carriage with a friend and a professional landlady for the blessing of the parson and are legitimately united women have won round fools to give way in that way and quite right too thought lady charlotte siding with nature and justice as she reflected that no woman created would win round her brother to give way in that way he was too acute the moment the woman showed sign of becoming an actress her doom was written poor idiot was not uncharitably inscribed by the sisterly lady on the tombstone of hopes aimed with scarce pardonable ambition at her brother she blew away the rumour ormont she vowed had not entitled any woman to share and bear his title and this was her interpretation of the report he permitted if he did permit the woman to take his name that he might have a scornful fling at the world maltreating him besides the name was not published it was not to be seen in the papers it passed merely among male friends tradesmen servants no great harm in that listen further here is an unknown girl why should he marry her a girl consenting to the place beside a man of his handsome ripe age is either bought or she is madly enamoured she does not dictate terms ormont is not of the brute buyers in that market one sees it is the girl who leads the dance a girl is rarely so madly enamoured as when she falls in love with her grandfather she pitches herself at his head this had not happened for the first time in ormonts case and he had never proposed marriage why should he do it now but again if the girl has breeding to some extent he might think it her due that she should pass under the safeguard of his name out of sight then so far the report is trustworthy we blow the rumour out of belief a young woman there is she is not a wife lady charlotte allowed her the fairly respectable post of hecate of the shades as long as the girl was no pretender to the place and name in the upper sphere her deductions were plausible convincing to friends shaken by her vehement manner of coming at them she convinced herself by means of her multitude of reasons for not pursuing inquiry her brother said nothing there was no need for him to speak he seemed on one or two occasions in the act of getting himself together for the communication of a secret and she made ready to listen hard with ears eyebrows shut month and a gleam at the back of her eyes for a signification of something she would refer him to after he had spoken he looked at her and held his peace or virtually held itthat is he said not one word on the subject she was to have told him she had anticipated lady charlotte ascribed it to his recollection of the quick blusher the pained blusher she was in her girlhood at mention or print of the story of men and women who not having known her could conceive it but who could conceive that behind the positive plaindealing downright woman of the world there was at times when a nerve was touched or an old blocked path of imagination thrown open a sensitive youthfulness still quick to blush as far as the skin of a grandmother matron might show it chapter iii the tutor there was no counting now on lord ormonts presence in the british gathering seasons when wheatears wing across our fields or swallows return to their eaves he forsook the hunt to roam the continent one of the vulgar band of tourists honouring town only when mayflies had flown and londons indiscriminate people went about without their volatile heads lady charlotte put these changed conditions upon the behaviour of the military authorities to her brother saying that the wonder was he did not shake the dust of his country from his feet in her wise head she rejoiced to think he was not the donkey she sketched for admiration and she was partly consoled or played at the taking of a comfort needed in her perpetual struggle with a phantom of a fact by the reflection that a young woman on his arm would tense him to feel himself more at home abroad her minds habit of living warmly beside him in separation was vexed by the fixed intrusion of a female third person who checked the run of intimate chatter especially damped the fancied talk over early daysof which the creature was ignorant and her propinquity to him arrested or broke the dialogue lady charlotte invented and pressed to renew but a wife while letting him be seen would have insisted on appropriating the thought of himall his days past as well as present an impassioned sisters jealousy preferred that it should not be a wife reigning to dispute her share of her brother in imagination then came a rumour telling of him as engaged upon the composition of his memoirs lady charlottes impulsive outcry writing them signified her grounds for alarm happily memoirs are not among the silly deeds done in a moment they were somewhere ahead and over the hills a band of brigands rather than a homely shining mansion it was true but distant and a principal question shrieked to know whether he was composing them for publication she could look forward with a girls pleasure to the perusal of them in manuscript in a woody nook in a fervour of partizanship easily avoiding sight of errors grammatical or moral she chafed at the possible printing and publishing of them that would be equivalent to an exhibition of him cleanstripped for a run across londonbrilliant in himself spotty in the offence published memoirs indicate the end of a mans activity and that he acknowledges the end and at a period of lord ormonts life when the denial of it should thunder they are his final chapter making mummy of the grand figure they wrap in the printed stuff they are virtually his apology can those knowing lord ormont hear him apologize but it is a craven apology if we stoop to expound we are seen as pleading our case before the public call it by any name you please and under any attitude it is that and set aside the writing it may be perfect the act is the degradation it is a rousing of swarms his friends and the public will see the proudest nobleman of his day pleading his case in mangled english in the headlong of an out poured undrilled rabble vocabulary doubling the ridicule by his imperturbability over the ridicule he excites he who is no more ridiculous cried the partizan sister conjuring up the scene not an ace more ridiculous than a judge of assize calling himself miserable sinner on sunday before the parson after he has very properly condemned half a score of weekday miserable sinners to penal servitude or the rope nobody laughs at the judge everybody will be laughing at the scornful man down halfway to his kneecape with a stutter of an apology for having done his duty to his country after stigmatizing numbers for inability or illwill to do it but ormonts weapon is the sword not a pen lady charlotte hunted her simile till the dogs had it or it ran to earth she struck at the conclusion that the young woman had been persuading him an adoring young woman is the person to imagine and induce to the commission of such folly what do you think you have seen her you say she asked of a man she welcomed for his flavour of the worldlings fine bile lord adderwood made answer she may be having a hand in it she worships and that is your way of pulling gods to the ground does she understand good english speaks it can she write i have never had a letter from her you tell me morsfield admires the womanwould marry her tomorrow if he could get her he would go through the ceremony ormont has performed i do not doubt i dont doubt all of you are ready she doesnt encourage one on the contrary all shes clever this has been going on for now seven years and as far as i know she has my brother fast she may have done the clever trick of having him fast from the beginning shed like people to think it she has an aunt to advertise it ormont cant swallow the woman im told trying if one is bound to get her down boasts of the connection everywhere shes admitted randeller says randeller procures the admission to various particoloured places she must be a blinking mollowl and i ask any sane christian or pagan proof enoughwould my brother rowsley let his wife visit those places those people monstrous to have the suspicion that he would you know him mrs lawrence finchley for example i say nothing to hurt the poor woman i back her against her imbecile of a husband he brings a charge he cant support she punishes him by taking three years lease of independence and kicks up the grass all over the paddock and then comes cuckoo barking his name abroad to have her home again you can win the shyest filly to corn at last she goes and he digests ruefully the hotchpotch of a dish the woman brings him only the world spies a side head at her husbanded or not though the main fault was his and she had a right to insist that he should be sure of his charge before he smacked her in the face with it before the world in dealing with a woman a man commonly prudentput aside chivalry justice and the restshould bind himself to disbelieve what he cant prove otherwise let him expect his whipping with or without ornament my opinion is lawrence finchley had no solid foundation for his charge except his being an imbecile she wasnt one of the adventurous women to jump the barsthe gate had to be pushed open and he did it there she is and i ask you would my brother rowsley let his wife be intimate with her and there are others and sauf votre respect the menmorsfield for one randeller another they have a wholesome dread of the lion if they smell a chance with the lions boneits the sweeter for being the lions these metaphors carry us off our ground i must let these ormont memoirs run and upset him if they get to print ive only to oppose printed theyll be the same if i say a word of this woman he marries her tomorrow morning you speak of my driving men why cant i drive ormont because im too fond of him there you have the secret of the subjection of women they can hold their own and a bit more when theyve no enemy beating inside heartsah well its possible i dont say no ive not discovered them lord adderwood observed they are rarely discovered in the haunts he frequented her allusion to mrs lawrence finchley rapped him smartly and she admired his impassiveness under the stroke such a spectacle was one of her pleasures lady charlotte mentioned incidentally her want of a tutor for her grandson leo during the winter holidays he suggested an application to the clergyman of her parish she was at feud with the rev stephen hamptonevey and would not take she said a man to be a bootblack in her backyard or a woman a scullerywench in her kitchen upon his recommendation she described the person of mr hamptonevey his manner of speech general opinions professional doctrines rolled him into a ball and bowled him with a shrug for lamentation over the decay of the good old order of manly english protestant clergymen who drank their port bothered nobody about belief abstained from preaching their sermon if requested were capital fellows in the huntingfield too for if they came they had the spur to hunt in the devils despite now we are going to have a kind of bitter clawed forked female in vestments over breeches how do you like that bundling of the sexes lord adderwood liked the lines of division to be strictly and invitingly definite he was thinking as he reviewed the frittered appearance of the rev stephen hamptonevey in lady charlottes hinds of the possibility that lord ormont who was reputed to fear nobody feared her in which case the handsome young woman passing among his associates as the pseudo lady ormont might be the real one after all and isabella lawrence finchley prove right in the warning she gave to dogs of chase the tutor required by lady charlotte was found for her by mr abner their correspondence on the subject filled the space of a week and then the gentleman hired to drive a creaky wheel came down from london to olmer arriving late in the evening lady charlottes blunt oh when he entered her room and bowed upon the announcement of his name was caused by an instantaneous perception and refection that it would be prudent to keep her granddaughter philippa aged between seventeen and eighteen out of his way you are friend of mr abners are you he was not disconcerted he replied in an assured and pleasant voice i have hardly the pretension to be called a friend madam are you a jew her abruptness knocked something like a laugh almost out of him but he restrained the signs of it i am not you wouldnt be ashamed to tell me you were one if you were not at all you like the jews those i know i like not many christians have the good sense and the good heart of arthur abner now go and eat come back to me when youve done i hope you are hungry ask the butler for the wine you prefer she had not anticipated the enrolment in her household of a man so young and goodlooking these were qualifications for cupids business which his unstrained selfpossession accentuated to a note of danger to her chicks because she liked the taste of him her granddaughter philippa was in the girls waxen age another beatrice was coming to it both were under her care and she was a vigilant woman with an intuition and a knowledge of sex she did not blame arthur abner for sending her a goodlooking young man she had only a general idea that tutors in a house and even visiting tutors should smell of dust and wear a snuffy appearance the conditions will not always insure the tutors from foolishness as her girls experience reminded her but they protect the girl your name is weyburn your father was an officer in the army killed on the battlefield arthur abner tells me was her somewhat severelytoned greeting to the young tutor on his presenting himself the second time it had the sound of the preliminary of an indictment read in a court of law my father died of his wounds in hospital he said why did you not enter the service want of an income my lady bad lookout army or navy for gentlemen if they stick to the school of honour the sedentary professions corrupt men bad for the blood those monastery monks found that out they had to birch the devil out of them three times a day and half the night howling like fullmoon dogs all through their lives till the flesh was off them that was their exercise if they were for holiness my brother lord ormont has never been still in his youth or his manhood see him now he counts his years by scores and be has about as many wrinkles as you when youre smiling his cheeks are as red as yours now youre blushing you ought to have left off that trick by this time its well enough in a boy against her will she was drawn to the young man and her consciousness of it plucked her back to caution with occasional jerksquaint alternations of the familiar and the harshly formal in the strangers experience if i have your permission lady charlotte said he the reason why i mount red a littleif i do itis you mention lord ormont and i have followed his career since i was the youngest of boys good to begin with the worship of a hero he cant sham cant deceive not even a woman and youre old enough to understand the temptation theyre so silly all the more its a point of honour with a man of honour to shield her from herself when its a girl the young mans eyebrows bent chapters of stories if you want to hear them she resumed and i can vouch some of them true lord ormont was never one of the wolves in a hood whatever you hear of him you may be sure he laid no trap hes just the opposite to the hypocrite so hypocrites date him ive heard them called highpriests of decency then we choose to be indecent and honest if theres a god to worship fear theyre in the habit of sayingwe are to fear god a man here a rev hamptonevey youll hear him harp on fear god hypocrites may honest sinners have no fear and see the cause they dont deceive themselvesthat is why do you think we call love what we fear they love god or they disbelieve and if they believe in him they know they cant conceal anything from him honesty means piety we cant be one without the other and here are peopleparsonswho talk of dying as going into the presence of our maker as if he had been all the while outside the world he created those parsons i told the rev hamptonevey here make infidelsthey make a puzzle of their god im for a rational deity they preach up a supernatural eccentric i dont say all ive heard good sermons and met soundheaded clergymennot like that gaping hamptonevey when a woman tells him she thinks for herself we have him sitting on our pariah a freethinker startles him as a kind of demon but a female freethinker is one of satans concubines he took it upon himself to reproach meflung his glove at my feet because i sent a cheque to a poor man punished for blasphemy the man had the right to his opinions and he had the courage of his opinions i doubt whether the rev hamptonevey would go with a willing heart to prison for his all the better for him if he comes headup out of a trial but now see all these parsons and judges and mobcaps insist upon conformity a man with common manly courage comes before them and hes cast in penalties yet we know from history in england france germany that the time of nonconformity brought out the manhood of the nation now i say a nation to be a nation must have meni mean brave men thats what those hosts of female men combine to try to stifle they wont succeed but we shall want a war to teach the country the value of courage you catch what i am driving at they accuse my brother of immorality because he makes no pretence to be better than the men of his class weyburns eyelids fluttered her kitelike ascent into the general with the sudden drop on her choice morsel switched his humour at the moment when he was respectfully considering that her dartings and gyrations had motive as mach as the flight of the swallow for food they had meaning and here was one of the great ladies of the land who thought for herself and was thoughtful for the country if she came down like a bird winged it was her love of her brother that did it his look at lady charlotte glistened she raised her defences against the basilisk fascinating philippa and with a vow to keep them apart and deprive him of his chance she relapsed upon the stiff frigidity which was not natural to her it lasted long enough to put him on his guard under the seductions of a noble dames condescension to a familiar tone but as he was too well bred to show the change in his mind for her change of manner and as she was the sister of his boyhoods hero and could be full of flavour his eyes retained something of their sparkle they were ready to lighten again in the way peculiar to him when she quite forgetting her defence of philippa disburdened herself of her antagonisms and enthusiasms her hates and her loves all round the neighbourhood and over the world won to confidential communication by this young mans face she confessed as much had he been guided to perceive it she said arthur abners a reader of men i can trust his word about them presently it is true she added no mans to be relied upon where theres a woman she refused her implicit trust to saintsif ever a man really was a saint before he was canonized her penetrative instinct of sex kindled the scepticism sex she saw at play everywhere dogging the conduct of affairs directing them at times she saw it as the animation of nature senselessly stigmatized hypocritically concealed active in our thoughts where not in our deeds and the declining of the decorous to see it or admit the sight got them abhorred bad names from her after a touch at the deadly poison coming of that blindness or blindfoldedness and a grimly melancholy shrug over the cruelties resultingcruelties chiefly affecting women youre too young to have thought upon such matters she said for a finish to them that was hardly true i have thought said weyburn and his head fell to reckoning of the small sum of his thoughts upon them he was pulled up instantly for close inspection by the judge what is your age i am in my twentysixth year you have been among men have you studied women not largely lady charlotte opportunity has been wanting at french and german colleges its only a large and a close and a pretty long study of them that can teach you anything and you must get rid of the poetry about them and be sure you havent lost it altogether thats what is called the golden mean im not for the golden mean in every instance its a way of exhorting to brutal selfishness i grant its the right way in those questions youll learn in time her scanning gaze at the young mans face drove him along an avenue of his very possible chances of learning certain to but dont tell me that at your age you have thought about women you may say you have felt a young mans feelings about women are better reading for him six or a dozen chapters farther on then he can sift and strain it wont be perfectly clear but it will do mr eglett hereupon threw the door open and ushered in master leo lady charlotte noticed that the tutor shook the boys hand offhandedly with not a whit of the usual obtrusive geniality and merely dropped him a word soon after he was talking to mr eglett of games at home and games abroad poor fun over there we head the world in field games at all events he drew a picture of a foreigner of his acquaintance looking on at football on the other hand french boys and german having passed a year or two at an english school get the liking for our games and do a lot of good when they go home the things we learn from them are to dance to sing and to studythey are more in earnest than we about study they teach us at fencing too the tutor praised fencing as an exercise and an accomplishment he had large reserves of eulogy for boxing he knew the qualities of the famous bruisers of the time cited fisty names whose owners were then to be seen all over an admiring land in prints in the glorious defensiveoffensive attitude englands own touch me if you dare with bullish or bulldog or oakbole fronts for the blow handsome to pugilistic eyes the young tutor had lighted on a pet theme of mr eglettsthe excelling virtues of the practice of pugilism in old england and the school of honour that it is to our lower population fifty times better for them than cockfighting he exclaimed admitting that he could be an interested spectator at a ring or the pit cockfighting or ratting ratting seems to have more excuse the tutor said and made no sign of a liking for either of those popular pastimes as he disapproved without squeamishness the impulsive but sharply critical woman close by nodded and she gave him his dues for being no courtier leo had to be off to bed the tutor spared him any struggle over the shaking of hands and saying goodnight leo continued the conversation the boy went away visibly relieved of the cramp that seizes on a youngster at the formalities pertaining to these chilly and fateful introductions what do you think of the look of him mr eglett asked the tutor had not appeared to inspect the boy big head he remarked yes leo wont want pushing at books when hes once in harness he will have six weeks of me its more than the yeomanry get for drill per annum and theyre expected to know something of a soldiers duties theres a chance of putting him on the right road in certain matters well walk or ride or skate if the frost holds tomorrow no lessons the first day do as you think fit said lady charlotte the one defect she saw in the tutor did not concern his pupil and a girl if hit would be unable to see that this tutor judged as a man was to some extent despicable for accepting tutorships and one might say dishonouring the family of a soldier of rank and distinction by coming into houses at the back way with footing enough to air his graces when once established there he ought to have knocked at every door in the kingdom for help rather than accept tutorships and disturb households or providentlyminded mistresses of them with all sorts of probably groundless apprehensions founded naturally enough on the good looks he intrudes this tutor committed the offence next day of showing he had a firm and easy seat in the saddle which increased lady charlottes liking for him and irritated her watchful forecasts she rode with the young man after lunch to show him the country and gave him a taste of what he took for her variable moods he misjudged her like a swimmer going through warm and cold springs of certain lake waters he thought her a capricious ladyship dangerous for intimacy alluring to the deeps and gripping with cramps she pushed him to defend his choice of the tutors profession think you understand boys she caught up his words you cant you can humour them as you humour women theyre just as hard to read and dont tell me a young man can read women boys and women go on their instincts egyptologists can spell you hieroglyphs theyd be stumped as leo would say to read a spider out of an inkpot over a sheet of paper one gets to interpret by degrees by observing their habits the tutor said and vexed her with a towering complacency under provocation that went some way further to melt the woman she was while her knowledge of the softness warned her still more of the duty of playing dragon round such a young man in her house the despot is alert at every issue to every chance and she was one the wakefuller for being benevolent her mind had no sleep by day for a month she subjected mr matthew weyburn to the microscope of her observation and the probe of her instinct he proved that he could manage without cajoling a boy the practical fact established by agreement between herself and the unobservant gentleman who was her husband lady charlotte allowed her meditations to drop an indifferent glance at the speculative views upon education entertained by this young tutor to her mind they were flighty but she liked him and as her feelings dictated to her mind when she had not to think for others she spoke of his views toleratingly almost with an implied approval after passing them through the form of burlesque to which she customarily treated things failing to waft her enthusiasm in regard to philippa he behaved well he bestowed more of his attention on beatrice nearer leos age in talk about games and storybooks and battles nothing that he did when the girls were present betrayed the strutting plumed cock bent to attract or the sickly reptile thirsty for a prize above him and meaning to have it like satan in eden still of course he could not help his being a handsome fellow having a vivid face and eyes transparent whether blue or green to flame of the brain exciting them and that becomes a picture in the dream of girlsa picture creating the dream often and philippa had asked her grandmother very ingenuously indeed with a most natural candour why they saw so little of leos hero simple female child however there was no harm done and lady charlotte liked him she liked few forthwith in the manner of her particular head a restless head she fell to work at combinations thushe is a nice young fellow well bred no cringing courtier accomplished good at classics fairish at mathematics a scholar in french german italian with a shrewd knowledge of the different races and with sound english sentiment too and the capacity for writing good english although in those views of his the ideas are unusual therefore unenglish profoundly so but his intentions are patriotic they would not displease lord ormont he has a worship of lord ormont all we can say on behalf of an untried inferior is in thatonly the valiant admire devotedly well he can write grammatical readable english what if lord ormont were to take him as a secretary while the memoirs are in hand he might help to chasten the sentences laughed at by those newspapers or he might being a terrible critic of writing and funny about styles put it in an absurd light that would cause the memoirs to be tossed into the fire he was made for the post of secretary the young mans good looks would be out of harms way then if any sprig of womankind come across him there it will at any rate not be a girl women must take care of themselves only the fools among them run to mischief in the case of a handsome young fellow supposing a certain woman to be one of the fools lady charlotte merely suggested it in the dashing current of her meditationsdid not strike it out interrogatively the woman would be a fine specimen among her class that was all for the favourite of lord ormont to stoop from her place beside himay but women do heroes have had the woeful experience of that fact first we see them aiming themselves at their hero next they are shooting an eye at the handsome man the thirst of nature comes after that of their fancy in conventional women sick of the hero tried tired of their place in the market no longer ashamed to acknowledge it they begin to consult their own taste for beautythey have it quite as much as the men have it and when their worshipped figure of manliness in a romantic sombrero is a threadbare giant showing bruises they sink on their inherent desire for a dance with the handsome man and the really handsome man is the most extraordinary of the rarities no wonder that when he appears he slays them walks over them like a pestilence this young weyburn would touch the fancy of a woman of a romantic turn supposing her enthusiastic in her worship of the hero after a number of yearsfor anything may be imagined where a woman is concernedwhy another enthusiasm for the same object and on the part of a stranger a stranger with effective eyes rapidly leads to sympathy suppose the reversethe enthusiasm gone to dust or become a wheezy old bellows as it does where theres disparity of age or it frequently doesthen the sympathy with a goodlooking stranger comes more rapidly still these were lady charlottes glances right and leftidle flights of the eye of a mounted amazon across hedges at the canter along the main road of her scheme which was to do a service to the young man she liked and to the brother she loved for the marked advantage of both equally perhaps for the chance of a little gossip to follow about that tenacious woman by whom her brother was held hard and fast kept away from friends and relatives isolated insomuch as to have given up living on his estatethe old homebecause he would not disgrace it or incur odium by taking her there in consequence of lord ormonts resistance to pressure from her on two or three occasions she chose to nurse and be governed by the maxim for herself never propose a plan to him if you want it adopted that was her way of harmlessly solacing loves vindictiveness for an injury she sent arthur abner a letter thanking him for his recommendation of young mr weyburn stating her benevolent wishes as regarded the young man and those hateful memoirs requesting that her name should not be mentioned in the affair because she was anxious on all grounds to have the proposal accepted by her brother she could have vowed to herself that she wrote sincerely he must want a secretary he would be shy at an offer of one from me do you hint it if you get a chance you gave us mr weyburn and mr eglett and i like him ormont would too i am certain you have obliged him before this will be better than anything you have done for us it will stop the memoirs or else give them a polish your young friend has made me laugh over stuff taken for literature until we put on our spectacles leo jogs along in harness now and may do some work at school yet having posted her letter she left the issue to chance as we may when conscience is easy an answer came the day before weyburns departure arthur abner had met lord ormont in the street had spoken of the rumour of memoirs promised to the world hinted at the possible need for a secretary lord ormont would appoint a day to see mr weyburn lady charlotte considered that to be as good as the engagement so we keep you in the family she said and now look here you ought to know my brothers ways if youre going to serve him youll have to guess at half of everything he tells you hell expect you to know the whole theres no man so secret why he fears nothing i cant tell why and what his mouth shuts on he exposes as if in his hand of course hes proud and good reason youll see when you mustnt offend a ladys in the housei hear of it she takes his name they say she may be a respectable womanive heard no scandal we have to hear of a lady ormont out of society we have to suppose it means theres not to be a real one he cant marry if he has allowed her to go about bearing his name she has a fool of an aunt im told as often in the house as not good proof of his fondness for the woman if he swallows half a year of the aunt well you wont unless youve mere mans eyes be able to help seeing him trying to hide what he suffers from that aunt he bears it like the man he is but woe to another betraying it she has a tongue that goes like the reel of a rod with a pike bolting out of the shallows to the snag he knowsto wind round it and defy you to pull often my brother rowsley and i have fished the day long and in hard weather and brought home a basket and he boasted of it more than of anything he has ever done since that woman holds him away from me now i say no harm of her she may be right enough from her point of view or it maynt be owing to her i wouldnt blame a woman well but my point with you is you swallow the womans auntthe ladys auntwithout betraying you suffer at all lord ormont has eyes of an eagle for a speck above the surface all the more because the aunt is a gabbling idiot does hei say it seeing itfire up to defend her from the sneer of the lip or half a sign of it no you would be an your guard i can trust you of course youd behave like the gentleman you are where any kind of womans concerned but you mustnt let a shadow be seen think what you may the womanladycalling herself lady ormontpoor woman i should do the same in her placeshe has a hard game to play i have to be for my family she has manners im told holds herself properly she fancies she brings him up to the altar in the end by decent behaviour thats a delusion its creditable to her only she cant understand the claims of the family upon a man like my brother when you have spare timekickups he need to call it writing to me from schoolcome here youre welcome after three days notice i shall be glad to see you again youve gone some way to make a man of leo he liked her well he promised to come she was a sinewy bite of the gentle sex but she had much flavour and she gave nourishment let me have three days notice she repeated not less lady charlotte said he weyburn received intimation from arthur abner of the likely day lord ormont would appoint and he left olmer for london to hold himself in readiness lady charlotte and leo drove him to meet the coach philippa so strangely baffled in her natural curiosity begged for a seat she begged to be allowed to ride petitions were rejected she stood at the window seeing grandmamas tutor as she named him carried off by grandmama her nature was avenged on her tyrant grandmama it brought up almost to her tongue thoughts which would have remained subterranean under control of her habit of mind or the nurserys modesty if she had been less tyrannically treated they were subterranean thoughts natures original such as the sense of injustice will rouse in young women and they are better unstirred for they ripen girls overrapidly when they are made to revolve near the surface it flashed on the girl why she had been treated tyrannically grandmama has good taste in tutors was all that she said while the thoughts rolled over chapter iv recognition our applicant for the post of secretary entered the street of lord ormonts london house to present himself to his boyhoods hero by appointment he was to see perhaps to serve the great soldier things had come to this and he thought it singular but for the previous introduction to lady charlotte he would have thought it passing wonderful he ascribed it to the whirligig the young man was not yet of an age to gather knowledge of himself and of life from his present experience of the fact that passionate devotion to an object strikes a vein through circumstances as a travelling run of flame darts the seeming haphazard zigzags to catch at the dry of dead wood amid the damp and when passion has become quiescent in the admirer there is often the unsubsided first impulsion carrying it on he will almost sorely embrace his idol with one or other of the senses weyburn still read the world as it came to him by bite marvelling at this and that after the fashion of most of us he had not deserted his adolescents hero or fallen upon analysis of a past season but he was now a young man stoutly and cognizantly on the climb with a good aim overhead axed green youths enthusiasms a step below his heels one of the lovers of life beautiful to behold when we spy into them generally their aspect is an enlivenment whatever may be the carving of their features for the sake of holy unity this lover of life whose gaze was to the front in hungry animation held fast to his young dreams perceiving a soul of meaning in them though the fire might have gone out and he confessed to a past pursuit of delusions young men of this kind will have for the like reason a similar rational sentiment on behalf of our worlds historic forward march while admitting that history has to be taken from far backward if we would gain assurance of mans advance it nerves an admonished ambition he was ushered into a london houses library looking over a niggard enclosure of gravel and dull grass against a wall where ivy dribbled an armchair was beside the fireplace to right and left of it a floreate company of books in high cases paraded shoulder to shoulder without a gap grenadiers on the line weyburn read the titles on their scarlet andblue facings they were approved english classics honoured veterans who have emerged from the conflict with contemporary opinion stamped excellent or have been pushed by the roar of contemporaneous applauses to wear the leatherandgilt uniform of our immortals until a more qualmish posterity disgorges them the books had costly bindings lord ormonts treatment of literature appeared to resemble lady charlottes in being reverential and uninquiring the books she bought to read were memoirs of her time by dead men and women once known to her these did fatigue duty in cloth or undress it was high drill with all of lord ormonts books and there was not a modern or a minor name among the regiments they smelt strongly of the booksellers lump lots by order but if a show soldiery they were not a sham like a certain row of venerablytitled backs that lady charlotte without scruple left standing to blow an ecclesiastical trumpet of empty contents any one might have his battle of brains with them for the twining of an absent key the door opened weyburn bowed to his old star in human shape a grey head on square shoulders filling the doorway he had seen at olmer lady charlottes treasured miniature portrait of her brother a perfect likeness she saidcomplaining the neat instant of injustice done to the fire of his look fire was low down behind the eyes at present they were quick to scan and take summary of their object as the young man felt while observing for himself height and build of body were such as might be expected in the brother of lady charlotte and from the tales of his prowess weyburn had a glance back at cupers boys listening to the tales the soldierlords manner was courteously militarythat of an established superior indifferent to the deferential attitude he must needs enact his curt nick of the head for a response to the visitors formal salutation signified the requisite acknowledgment like a city creditors busy stroke of the typestamp receipt upon payment the ceremony over he pitched a bugle voice to fit the contracted area i hear from mr abner that you have made acquaintance with olmer good hunting country there lady charlotte kindly gave me a mount my lord i knew your father by namecolonel sidney weyburn you lost him at toulouse we were in the peninsula i was at talavera with him bad day for our cavalry our officers were young at their work then they taught the emperors troops to respect a charge of english horse it was teaching their fox to set traps for them lord ormont indicated a chair he stood the french had good cavalry leaders weyburn said for cover to a continued study of the face montbrun yes murat lassalle bessieres under the emperor they had you think them not at home in the saddle my lord frenchmen have nerves horses are nerves they pile excitement too high when cool theyre among the best none of them had head for command of all the arms one might say the same of seidlitz and ziethen of ziethen seidlitz had a wider grasp i suppose he pursed his month pondering no and in the austrian service too generals of cavalry are left to whistle for an independent command theres a jealousy of our branch the injured warrior frowned and hummed he spoke his thought mildly jealousy of the name of soldier in this country out of the service is the place to recommend id have advised a son of mine to train for a jockey rather than enter it we deal with that tomorrow in my papers you come to me mr abner has arranged the terms so i see you at ten in the morning i am glad to meet a young manenglishmanwho takes an interest in the service weyburn fancied the hearing of a step he heard the whispering dress it passed him a lady went to the armchair she took her seat as she had moved with sedateness the exchange of a toneless word with my lord she was a brune he saw that when he rose to do homage lord ormont resumed some are born to it must be soldiers and in peace they are snubbed by the heads in war they are abused by the country they dont understand in england how to treat an army how to make one either the gentlemanmr weyburn mr arthur abners recommendation he added hurriedly with a light wave of his hand and a murmur that might be the ladys title continuing a young man of military tastes should take service abroad theyre in earnest about it over there here they play at it and an armys shipped to land without commissariat ambulances medical stores and march against the odds as usualif it can march albuera my lord our men can spurt for a flick o the whip theyre expected to be constantly ready for doing prodigiesto repair the countrys omissions all the country cares for is to hope dick turpin may get to york our men are good beasts they give the best in em and drop mores the scandal to a country that has grand material and overtasks it a blazing disaster ends the chapter this was talk of an injured veteran it did not deepen the hue of his ruddied skin he spoke in the tone of matter of fact weyburn had been prepared for something of the sort by his friend arthur abner he noted the speakers heightened likeness under excitement to lady charlotte excitement came at an early call of their voices to both and both had handsome open features bluntly cut nothing of aquiline or the supercilious eyes bluishgrey in arched recesses horny between the thick lids lively to shoot their meaning when the trapmouth was active effectively expressing promptitute for combat pleasure in attack wrestle tag whatever pertained to strife an absolute sense of their right as there was a third person present at this dissuasion of military topics the silence of the lady drew weyburn to consult her opinion in her look it was on him strange are the womans eyes which can unoffendingly assume the privilege to dwell on such a living object as a man without become gateways for his return look and can seem in pursuit of thoughts while they enfold they were large dark eyes eyes of southern night they sped no shot they rolled forth an envelopment a child among toys caught to think of other toys may gaze in that way but these were a womans eyes he gave lord ormont his whole face as an auditor should he was interested besides as he told a ruffled conscience he fell upon the study of his old hero determinedly the pain of a memory waking under pillows unable to do more than strain for breath distracted his attention there was a memory that was all he knew or else he would have lashed himself for hanging on the beautiful eyes of a woman to be seeing and hearing his old hero was wonder enough recollections of lady charlottes plain hints regarding the lady present resolved to the gross retort that her eyes were beautiful and be knew themthere lay the strangeness they were known beautiful eyes in a foreign land of night and mist lord ormont was discoursing with racy eloquence of our hold on india his views in which respect were those of cupers boys weyburn ventured a dotrunning description of the famous ride and out flew an english soldiers grievance but was not the unjustlytreated great soldier well rewarded whatever the snubs and the bitterness with these large dark eyes in his house for his own eyes like these are the beginning of a young mans world they nerve inspire arm him colour his life he would labour fight die for them it seemed to weyburn a blessedness even to behold them so it had been with him at the early stage and his heart went swifter memory fetched a breath memory quivered eyelids when the thought returnedof his having known eyes as lustrous first lights of his world they had more volume warmth mysterywere sweeter still these in the room were sisters to them they quickened throbs they seemed a throb of the heart made visible that was their endowment of light and lustre simply and the mystical curve of the lids for so they could look only because the heart was disengaged from them they were but heavenly orbs the ladys elbow was on an arm of her chair her forefinger at her left temple her mind was away one might guess she could hardly be interested in talk of soldiering and of foreign army systems jealous english authorities and officials games fieldsports she had personal matters to think of adieu until tomorrow to the homes she inhabited the street was a banishment and a relief when weyburns first interview with lord ormont was over he rejoiced to tell his previous anticipations that he had not been disappointed and he bade heroworshippers expect no gilded figure we gather heroes as we go if we are among the growing our constancy is shown in the not discarding of our old ones he held to his earlier hero though he had seen him and though he could fancy he saw round him another too had been a herolover how did that lady of nights eyes come to fall into her subjection he put no question as to the name she bore it hung in a black suspense vividly at its blackest illuminated her possessor a man is a hero to some effect who wins a woman like this and if his glory bespells her so that she flings all to the winds for him burns the world if for solely the desperate rapture of belonging to him she consents of her free will to be one of the nameless and discoloured he shines in a way to make the marrow of men thrill with a burning envy for that must be the idolatrous devotion desired by them all weyburn struck down upon his mans naturethe bad in us when beauty of woman is viewed or say the old original revolutionary best kept untouched for a touch or a meditative pause above him fetches him up to roam the civilized world devouringly and lawlessly it is the special peril of the young lover of life that an inflammability to beauty in women is in a breath intense with him he is in truth a thinlysealed volcano of our imperishable ancient father and has it in him to be the multitudinouslyamorous of the mythologic jove give him head he can be civilizations devil is she fair and under a shadethen is she doubly fair the shadow about her secretes mystery just as the forest breeds romance and mystery is a measureless realm if we conceive it we have a mysterious claim on her who is the heart of it he marched on that road to the music of sonorous brass for some drunken minutes the question came what of the man who takes advantage of her self sacrifice it soon righted him and he did lord ormont justice and argued the case against lady charlottes naked hints this darkeyed heroines bearing was assured beyond an air of dependency her deliberate short nod to him at his leavetaking and the toneless few words she threw to my lord signified sufficiently that she did not stand defying the world or dreading it she had by miracle the eyes which had once charmed himcould again would always charm she reminded him of aminta farrells very eyes under the couchantdove browssomething of her mouth the dimple running from a corner she had as aminta had the selfcollected and selfcancelled look a realm in a look that was neither depth nor fervour nor a bestowal nor an allurement nor was it an exposure though there seemed no reserve one would be near the meaning in declaring it to bewilder men with the riddle of openhandedness we read itall may read itas we read inexplicable plain life in which let us have a confiding mind despite the blows at our heart and some understanding will enter us he shut the door upon picture and speculations returning to them by another door the lady had not amintas freshness she might be taken for an elder sister of aminta but weyburn wanted to have her position defined before he set her beside aminta he writhed under lady charlottes tolerating scorn of the young woman it roused an uneasy sentiment of semihostility in the direction of my lord and he had no personal complaint to make lord ormont was cordial on the day of the secretarys installation as ifif one might dare to guess itsome one had helped him to a friendly judgement the lady of amintas eyes was absent at the luncheon table she came into the room a step to speak to lord ormont dressed for a drive to pay a visit the secretary was unnoticed lord ormont put inquiries to him at table for the why of his having avoided the profession of arms and apparently considered that the secretary had made a mistake and that he would have committed a greater error in becoming a soldierin this country a man with a grievance is illogical under his burden he mentioned the name lady ormont distinctly during some remarks on travel lady ormont preferred the continent two days later she came to the armchair as before met weyburns eyes when he raised them gave him no home in hersnot a temporary shelter from the pelting of interrogations she hardly spoke why did she come but how was it that he was drawn to think of her absent or present she was round him like the hills of a valley she was round his thoughts caged them however high however far they flew they were conscious of her she took her place at the midday meal she had amintas voice in some tones a mellower than amintasthe voice of one of amintas family she had the trick of amintas upper lip in speaking her look on him was foreign a civil smile as they conversed she was very much at home with my lord whom she rallied for his addiction to his club at a particular hour of the afternoon she conversed readily she reminded him incidentally that her aunt would arrive early next day he informed her some time after of an engagement to tiffin with a brother officer and she nodded they drove away together while the secretary was at his labour of sorting the heap of autobiographical scraps in a worn dispatchbox pen and pencil jottings tossed to swell the mess when they had relieved an angry reminiscence he noticed heedlessly at the moment feminine handwriting on some few clear sheets among them next day he was alone in the library he sat before the box opened it and searched merely to quiet his annoyance for having left those sheets of the fair amanuensis unexamined they were not discoverable they had gone he stood up at the stir of the door it was she and she acknowledged his bow she took her steps to her chair he was informed that lord ormont had an engagement and he remarked i can do the work very well she sat quite silent he read first lines of the scraps laid them in various places as in a preparation for conjurers tricks at cards refraining from a glance lest he should disconcert the eyes he felt to be on him fitfully at last she spoke and he knew aminta in his hearing and sight is emile grenat still anglomane an instant before her voice was heard he had been persuading himself that the points of unlikeness between his young aminta and this tall and stately lady of the proud reserve in her bearing flouted the resemblance chapter v in which the shades of browny and matey advance and retire emile is as anglomane as ever and not a bit less a frenchman weyburn said in a tone of one who muffles a shock at the heart it would be the poorer compliment to us she rejoined they looked at one another she dropped her eyelids he looked away she had the grand manner by nature she was the woman of the girl once known a soldier is he emiles profession and mine are much alike or will be a secretary her deadness of accent was not designed to carry her opinion of the post of secretary it brought the reply we hope to be schoolmasters she drew in a breath there was a thin short voice hardly voice as when one of the unschooled minor feelings has been bruised after a while she said does he think it a career not brilliant he was formed for a soldier he had to go as the road led a young man renouncing ambition considering what we can do best it signifies the taste for what he does certainly that weyburn had senses to read the word schoolmaster in repetition behind her shut mouth he was sharply sensible of a fall the task with his papers occupied him if he had a wish it was to sink so low in her esteem as to be spurned a kick would have been a refreshment yet he was unashamed of the cause invoking it we are instruments to the touch of certain women and made to play strange tunes mr cuper flourishes the school exists i have not been down there i met mr shalders yesterday he has left the school you come up from olmer i was at olmer last week lady ormont an involuntary beam from her eyes thanked him for her title at that juncture of the dialogue she grew more spirited mr shalders has joined the dragoons has he the worthy man has a happy imagination he goes through a campaign daily it seems to one to dignify his calling i like his enthusiasm the lady withdrew into her thoughts weyburn fell upon his work mention of the military cloak of enthusiasm covering shalders brought the scarce credible old time to smite at his breast in the presence of these eyes a ringing of her title of lady ormont rendered the present time the incredible i can hardly understand a young frenchmans not entering the army she said the napoleonic legend is weaker now said he the son of an officer grandson it was his choice to behe gave it up without reluctance emile obeyed the command of his parents weyburn answered and he was obedient to the veiled direction of her remark in speaking of himself i had a reason too one wonders it would have impoverished my mothers income to put aside a small allowance for me for years she would not have hesitated i then set my mind on the profession of schoolmaster emile grenat was a brave boy has he no regrets neither of us has a regret he began ambitiously its the way at the beginning it is not usually abjured im afraid we neither of us dignify our calling by discontent with it a dusky flash worth seeing came on her cheeks i respect enthusiasms she said and it was as good to him to hear as the begging pardon though clearly she could not understand enthusiasm for the schoolmasters career light of evidence was before him that she had a friendly curiosity to know what things had led to their new meeting under these conditions he sketched them cursorily there was little to telllittle that is appealing to a romantic mind for interest aware of it by sympathy he degraded the narrative to a flatness about as cheering as a suburban london sundays promenade sympathy caused the perverseness he felt her disillusionment felt with it and spread a feast of it she had to hear of studies at caen and at a paris lycee french fairly mastered german the same italian the same after studies at heidelberg asti and florence between four and five months at athens he was needlessly precise in tutorship with a young nobleman no events nor a spot of colour thus did he wilfully with pain to himself put an extinguisher on the youth painted brilliant and eminent in a maidens imagination so there can no longer be thought of the army she remarked and the remark had a sort of sigh though her breathing was equable unless a big war knocks over all rules and the country comes praying us to serve he said you would not refuse then not in case of need one may imagine a crisis when they would give commissions to men of my age or older for the cavalryheavy losses of officers she spoke as if urged by a sting to revert to the distasteful that professionmust you not takeenter into orders if you aim at any distinction and a member of the anglican church would not be allowed to exchange his frock for a cavalry sabre said he that is true i do not propose to settle as a schoolmaster in england where on the continent would not america be better it would not so well suit the purpose in view for us there are others besides besides emile there is a german and an italian and a swiss it is a company a company of schoolmasters companies of all kinds are forming colleges are companies and they have their collegians our aim is at pupils we have no ambition for any title higher than school and schoolmaster it is not a company so like nature parading her skeleton to youthful adorers of her face he insisted on reducing to hideous material wreck the fair illusion which had once arrayed him in alluring promise she explained i said america you would be among protestants in america catholics and protestants are both welcome to us according to our scheme and germans french english americans italians if they will come spaniards and portuguese and scandinavians russians as well and jews mahommedans too if only they will come the more mixed the more it hits our object you have not stated where on the continent it is to be the spot fixed on is in switzerland you will have scenery i hold to that as an influence a cool vision of the bernese alps encircled the young schoolmaster and she said it would influence girls i dare say a harder matter with boys of courseat first we think we may make it serve and where is the spot is that fixed on fifteen miles from berne on elevated land neighbouring a water not quite to be called a lake unless in an auctioneers advertisement i am glad of the lake i could not look on a country home where there was no swimming you will be head of the school there must be a head is the school likely to be established soon he fell into her dead tone money is required for establishments i have a reversion coming some day i dont dabble in post obits he waited for farther questions they were at an end you have your work to do mr weyburn saying that she bowed an implied apology for having kept him from it and rose she bowed again as she passed through the doorway in acknowledgment of his politeness here then was the end of the story of browny and matey such was his thought under the truncheonstroke of their colloquy lines of brownys letters were fiery waving ribands about him while the coldly gracious bow of the lady wrote finis the gulf between the two writings remained unsounded it gave a heave to the old passion but stirred no new one he had himself in hand now and he shut himself up when the questions bred of amazement buzzed and threatened to storm after all what is not curious in this world the curious thing would be if curious things should fail to happen men have been saying it since they began to count and turn corners and let us hold off from speculating when there is or but seems a shadow of unholiness over that molelike business there shall be no questions and as to feelings the same they if petted for a moment beneath the shadow corrupt our blood weyburn was a man to have them by the throat at the birth still they thronged heavy work of strangling had to be done her tone of disappointment with the schoolmaster bit him and it flattered him the feelings leapt alive equally venomous from the wound and the caress they pushed to see had to be repelled from seeing the girl browny in the splendid woman they had lightning memories not the pain of his grip could check their voice on the theme touching her happiness or the reverse and this was an infernal cunning he paused perforce to inquire giving them space for the breeding of their multitudes was she happy did she not seem too meditative enclosed toneless at her age vainly the persecuted fellow said to himself but what is it to me nowthe browny days were over the passion for the younger aminta was overburied and a dream of power belonging to those days was not yet more than visionary it had moved her once when it was a young soldiers she treated the schoolmasters dream as vapour and the old days as dead and ghostless she did rightly how could they or she or he be other than they were with that sage exclamation he headed into the browny days and breasted them and he had about him the living foamy sparkle of the very time until the countess of ormont breathed the word schoolmaster when at once it was dusty land where buoyant waters had been and the armies of the facts in uniform drab with some feathers and laces and a significant surpliced figure decorously covering the wildest of cupids marched the standard of the winking goldpiece which is their nourishing sun and eclipser of all suns that foster dreams as you perceive he was drawing swiftly to the vortex of the fools and round and round he went lucky to float his view of the business of the schoolmaster plucked him from the whirl she despised it he upheld it he stuck to his view finding their antagonism on the subject wholesome for him all that she succeeded in doing was to rob it of the aurora colour clothing everything on which matey weyburn set his aim her contempt of it whether as a profession in itself or as one suitable to the former young enthusiast for arms dwarfed it to appear like the starved plants under greenland skies but those are of a sturdy genus they mean to live they live perforce of the right to live they will prove their right in a coming season when some one steps near and wonders at them and from more closely observing gets to understand learning that the significance and the charm of earth will be as well shown by them as by her tropical fair flaunters or the tenderlynurtured exotics an unopened coffer of things to be said in defence ofno on behalf of no in honour of the profession of schoolmaster perhaps to the convincing of aminta lady ormont was glanced at a sentence or two leapt out and stepped forward and had to retire he preferred to the fathering of tricky windy phrases the being undervaluedeven by her he was taught to see again how rhetoric haunts and rhetoric bedevils the vindication of the clouded especially in the case of a disesteemed profession requiring one to raise it and impose it upon the antagonistic senses for the bewildering of the mind one has to sound it loudly there is no treating it as in the advocacy of the cases of flesh and blood with the masterly pathos of designed simplicity and weyburn was cupers matey weyburn still in his loathing of artifice to raise emotion loathing of the affected the stilted the trumpet of speechalways excepting schoolexercises in the tongues the unmasking of a catiline the address of a general athenian or other to troops he kept his coffer shut and for a consequence he saw the contents as an avenue of blossom leading to vistas of infinite harvest she was lady ormont aminta shared the title of his old hero he refused to speculate upon how it had come to pass and let the curtain hang though dramas and romances with the miracles involved in them were agitated by a transient glimpse at the curtain well and he hoped to be a member of the profession she despised hoped it with all his heart and one good effect of his giving his heart to the hope was that he could hold from speculating and from feeling even from pausing to wonder at the most wonderful turn of events blessed antagonism drove him to be braced by thoughts upon the hardest of the schoolmasters tasksbright winter thoughts prescribing to him satisfaction with a faith in the sowing which may be his only reaping away fly the boys in sheaves after his toil with them to instruct restrain animate point their minds they leave him they plunge into the world and are gone will he see them again it is a flickering perhaps to sustain his belief that he has done serviceable work he must be sore of his having charged them with good matter how can the man do it if during his term of apprenticeship he has allowed himself to dally here and there down to moony dreamings over inscrutable beautiful eyes of a married lady for the sole reason that he meets her unexpectedly after an exchange of letters with her in longpast days at school when she was an inexperienced girl who knew not what she vowed and he a flightyheaded youngster crying out to be the arrow of any bow that was handy yea she was once that girl named browny by the boys temptation threw warm light on the memory and very artfully by conjuring up the faces cries characters all the fun of the boys there was no possibility of forgetting her image in those days he had therefore to live with it and to live near the grown womantimes present answer to the old riddle it seemed to him that instead of sorting lord ormonts papers he ought to be at sharp exercise according to his prescript sharp exercise of lungs and limbs is a mans moral aid against temptation he knew it as the one trusty antidote for him who was otherwise the vessel of a temperament pushing to mutiny certainly it is the best philosophy youth can pretend to practise and lord ormont kept him from it worse than that the slips and sheets of paper in the dispatchbox were not an exercise of the mind even there was nothing to grapple withno diversion criticism passed by them indulgently if not benevolently quite apart from the subject inscribed on them weyburn had now and again a blow at the breast of untraceable origin for he was well enough aware that the old days when browny imagined him a hero in drinking his praises of a brighter were drowned they were dead but here was she the bride of the proved hero his praises might have helped in causing her willingnessdevotional readiness he could fancyto yield her hand perhaps at the moment when the hero was penning some of the indian slips here the boy at school was preparing aminta but he could not be responsible for a sacrifice of the kind suggested by lady charlotte and no there had been no such sacrifice although lord ormonts inexplicable treatment of his young countess under cover of his notorious reputation with women conduced to the suspicion while the vagrant in weyburn was thus engaged his criticism of the soldierlords fieldenglish on paper let the stuff go tolerantly unexamined but with a degree of literary contempt at heart for the writer who had that womanscented reputation and expressed himself so poorly the sentiment was outside of reason we do nevertheless expect our don juans to deliver their minds a trifle elegantly if not in classic english on paper and when we find one of them inflicting cruelty as it appears and the victim is a young woman a beautiful young woman she pleads to us poetically against the bearish sentences of his composition we acknowledge however that a mere sentiment entertained possibly by us alone should not be permitted to condemn him unheard lady ormont was not seen again after luncheon at a solitary table the secretary worked till winters lamps were lit and then shone freedom with assurance to him that he would escape from the miry mental ditch he had been floundering in since aminta revealed herself sunday was the glorious day to follow with a cleansing bath of a walk along the southern hills homely english scenery to show to a german friend one of his company half a dozen good lads were pledged to the walk bearing which in view it could be felt that this nonsensical puzzlement over his relations to the moods and tenses of a married woman would be bounced out of recollection before nightfall the landscape given off any of the airy hills of surrey would suffice to do it a lady stood among her boxes below as he descended the stairs to cross the hall he knew her for the person lady charlotte called the womans aunt whom lord ormont could not endurea forgiven old enemy mrs nargett pagnell he saluted she stared and corrected her incivility with ah yes and a formal smile if not accidentally delayed on her journey she had been needlessly the cause why lord ormont hugged his club during the morning and afternoon weyburn was pushed to think of the matter by remembrance of his foregone resentment at her having withdrawn aminta from miss vincents three days earlier than the holiday time the resentment was over but a germ of it must have sprang from the dust to prompt the kindling leap his memory took out of all due connection like a lightning among the crags it struck aminta smartly he called to mind the conversation at table yesterday had she played on lord ormonts dislike of the aunt to drive him forth for some purpose of her own if so the little trick had been done with deplorable spontaneity or adeptness of usage what was the purposeto converse with an old acquaintance undisturbed by lord ormont and her aunt neatly done supposing the surmise correct but what was there in the purpose he sifted rapidly for the gist of the conversation reviewed the manner of it the words the sound they had the feelings they touched then owned that the question could not be answered owning further that the recurrence of these idiotic speculations feelings questions wrote him down as both dull fellow and impertinent he was unabled to restore aminta to the queenly place she took above the schoolmaster who was very soon laughing at his fever or flash of the afternoon the day had brought a great surprise nothing more twenty minutes of fencing in the a salle darmes of an italian captain braced him to health and shifted scenes of other loves lighter loves following the browny daysnot to be called loves in fact hardly beyond inclinations nevertheless inclinations are an infidelity to meet a married woman and be mooning over her because she gave him her eyes and her handwriting when a girl was enough to rouse an honest fellows laugh at himself in the contemplation of his intermediate amorous vagabondage had he ever known the veritable passion after browny sank from his ken let it be confessed never his first love was his only true love despite one shuddering episode oddly humiliating to recollect though he had not behaved badly so then by right of his passion thus did eternal justice rule it that browny belonged to matey weyburn aminta to lord ormont aminta was a lady blooming in the flesh browny was the pasts pale phantom for which reason he could call her his own without harm done to any one and with his usual appetite for dinner breakfast lunch whatever the meal supplied by the hour it would somewhat alarmingly have got to mr weyburns conscience through a disturbance of his balance telling him that he was on a perilous road if his relish for food had been blunted he had his axiom on the subject and he was wrong in the general instance for the appetites of rogues and ogres are not known to fail as regarded himself he was eminently right and he could apply it to boys also to all young people the unlaunched he called them he counted himself among the launched no doubt and had breasted seas but the boy was alive a trencherman lad in the coming schoolmaster and told him profitable facts concerning his condition besides throwing a luminous ray on the arcane of our elusive youthful if they have no stout zest for eating put query against them his customary enjoyment of dinner convinced mr weyburn that he had not brooded morbidly over his phantom browny and could meet aminta countess of ormont on the next occasion with the sentiments proper to a common official did she not set him a commendable example he admired her for not concealing her disdain of the aspirant schoolmaster quite comprehending by sympathy why the woman should reproach the girl who had worshipped heroes if this was a fullgrown specimen and the reply of the shamed girl that in her ignorance she could not know better he spared the girl but he laughed at the woman he commended laughed at himself amintas humour was being stirred about the same time she and her aunt were at the dinnertable in the absence of my lord the dinner had passed with the stiff dialogue peculiar to couples under supervision of their inferiors and as soon as the room was clear she had asked her aunt touching the secretary have you seen him mrs nargett pagnells answer could have been amusing only to one whose intimate knowledge of her found it characteristically salt for she was a lady of speech addressed ever directly or roundabout to the chief point of business between herself and her hearer and the more she was brief oblique farshooting the more comically intelligible she was to her niece she bent her head to signify that she had seen the secretary and struck the table with both hands exclaiming well to be sure lord ormont their discussion before they descended the stairs to dinner concerned his lordships extraordinary indifference to the thronging of handsome young men around his young countess here the implication ran is one established in the house amintas thoughts could be phrased yes that is true for one part of it as for the other part the ascent of a phoebus apollo with his golden bow and quiver off the fairest of eastern horizon skies followed suddenly by the sight of him toppling over in mr cupers longskirted brown coat with spectacles and cane is an image that hardly exceeds the degradation she conceived it was past ludicrous yet admitted of no woefulness nothing soothingly pathetic it smothered and barked at the dreams of her blooming spring of life to which her mind had
