barto rizzo viii the letter chapter i from monte motterone you survey the lombard plain it is a towering dome of green among a hundred pinnacles of grey and rust red crags at dawn the summit of the mountain has an eagle eye for the far venetian boundary and the barrier of the apennines but with sunrise come the mists the vast brown level is seen narrowing in the ticino and the sesia waters nearest quiver on the air like sleepy lakes the plain is engulphed up to the high ridges of the distant southern mountain range which lie stretched to a faint cloud like line in shape like a solitary monster of old seas crossing the deluge long arms of vapour stretch across the urn like valleys and gradually thickening and swelling upward enwrap the scored bodies of the ashen faced peaks and the pastures of the green mountain till the heights become islands over a forgotten earth bells of herds down the hidden run of the sweet grasses and a continuous leaping of its rivulets give the motterone a voice of youth and homeliness amid that stern company of titan heads for whom the hawk and the vulture cry the storm has beaten at them until they have got the aspect of the storm they take colour from sunlight and are joyless in colour as in shade when the lower world is under pushing steam they wear the look of the revolted sons of time fast chained before scornful heaven in an iron peace day at last brings vigorous fire arrows of light pierce the mist wreaths the dancing draperies the floors of vapour and the mountain of piled pasturages is seen with its foot on the shore of lago maggiore down an extreme gulf the full sunlight as if darting on a jewel in the deeps seizes the blue green lake with its isles the villages along the darkly wooded borders of the lake show white as clustered swans here and there a tented boat is visible shooting from terraces of vines or hanging on its shadow monte boscero is unveiled the semicircle of the piedmontese and the swiss peaks covering lake orta behind on along the ticinese and the grisons leftward toward and beyond the lugano hills stand bare in black and grey and rust red and purple you behold a burnished realm of mountain and plain beneath the royal sun of italy in the foreground it shines hard as the lines of an irradiated cellini shield farther away over middle ranges that are soft and clear it melts confusing the waters with hot rays and the forests with darkness to where wavering in and out of view like flying wings and shadowed like wings of archangels with rose and with orange and with violet silverwhite alps are seen you might take them for mystical streaming torches on the border ground between vision and fancy they lean as in a great flight forward upon lombardy the curtain of an early autumnal morning was everywhere lifted around the motterone save for one milky strip of cloud that lay lizard like across the throat of monte boscero facing it when a party of five footfarers who had met from different points of ascent some way below and were climbing the mountain together stood upon the cropped herbage of the second plateau and stopped to eye the landscape possibly also to get their breath they were italians two were fair haired muscular men bronzed by the sun and roughly bearded bearing the stamp of breed of one or other of the hill cities under the alps a third looked a sturdy soldier squareset and hard of feature for whom beauties of scenery had few awakening charms the remaining couple were an old man and a youth upon whose shoulder the veteran leaned and with a whimsical turn of head and eye indicative of some playful cast of mind poured out his remarks upon the objects in sight and chuckled to himself like one who has learnt the necessity to appreciate his own humour if he is disposed to indulge it he was carelessly wrapped about in long loose woollen stuff but the youth was dressed like a milanese cavalier of the first quality and was evidently one who would have been at home in the fashionable corso his face was of the sweetest virile italian beauty the head was long like a hawk's not too lean and not sharply ridged from a rapacious beak but enough to show characteristics of eagerness and promptitude his eyes were darkest blue the eyebrows and long disjoining eyelashes being very dark over them which made their colour precious the nose was straight and forward from the brows a fluent black moustache ran with the curve of the upper lip and lost its line upon a smooth olive cheek the upper lip was firmly supported by the under and the chin stood freely out from a fine neck and throat after a space an austrian war steamer was discerned puffing out of the harbour of laveno that will do said the old man carlo thou son of paolo we will stump upward once more tell me hulloa sir are the best peaches doomed to entertain vile domiciliary parasitical insects i ask you does nature exhibit motherly regard or none for the regions of the picturesque none i say it is an arbitrary distinction of our day to complain of the intrusion of that black yellow flag and foul smoke line on the lake underneath us is preposterous since as you behold the heavens make no protestation let us up there is comfort in exercise even for an ancient creature such as i am this mountain is my brother and flatters me not i am old take my arm dear agostino said the youth never my lad until i need it on ahead of me goat chamois and teach me how the thing used to be done in my time old legs must be the pupils of young ones mark that piece of humility and listen with respectfulness to an old head by and by it was the autumn antecedent to that memorable spring of the great italian uprising when though for a tragic issue the people of italy first felt and acted as a nation and charles albert called the sword of italy aspired without comprehension of the passion of patriotism by which it was animated to lead it quietly into the fold of his piedmontese kingship there is not an easier or a pleasanter height to climb than the motterone if in italian heat you can endure the disappointment of seeing the summit as you ascend constantly flit away to a farther station it seems to throw its head back like a laughing senior when children struggle up for kissings the party of five had come through the vines from stresa and from baveno the mountain was strange to them and they had already reckoned twice on having the topmost eminence in view when reaching it they found themselves on a fresh plateau traversed by wild water courses and browsed by alpine herds and again the green dome was distant they came to the highest chalet where a hearty wiry young fellow busily employed in making cheese invited them to the enjoyment of shade and fresh milk for the sake of these adolescents who lose much and require much let it be so said agostino gravely and not without some belief that he consented to rest on behalf of his companions they allowed the young mountaineer to close the door and sat about his fire like sagacious men when cooled and refreshed agostino gave the signal for departure and returned thanks for hospitality money was not offered and not expected as they were going forth the mountaineer accompanied them to the step on the threshold and with a mysterious eagerness in his eyes addressed agostino signore is it true the king marches who is the king my friend returned agostino if he marches out of his dominions the king confers a blessing on his people perchance our king signore the mountaineer waved his finger as from novara toward milan agostino seemed to awaken swiftly from his disguise of an absolute gravity a red light stood in his eyeballs as if upon a fiery answer the intemperate fit subsided smoothing dawn his mottled grey beard with quieting hands he took refuge in his habitual sententious irony my friend i am not a hare in front of the king nor am i a ram in the rear of him i fly him not neither do i propel him so therefore i cannot predict the movements of the king will the wind blow from the north to morrow think you the mountaineer sent a quick gaze up the air as to descry signs who knows agostino continued though not playing into the smiles of his companions the wind will blow straight thither where there is a vacuum and all that we can state of the king is that there is a positive vacuum here it would be difficult to predict the king's movements save by such weighty indications he laid two fingers hard against the rib which shields the heart it had become apparently necessary for the speaker to relieve a mind surcharged with bile at the mention of the king for having done he rebuked with an amazed frown the indiscretion of carlo who had shouted the carbonaro king carlo my son i will lean on your arm on your mouth were better agostino added under his voice as they moved on oh but carlo remonstrated let us trust somebody milan has made me sick of late i like the look of that fellow you allow yourself my carlo an immense indulgence in permitting yourself to like the look of anything now listen viva carlo alberto the old man rang out the loyal salutation spiritedly and awoke a prompt response from the mountaineer who sounded his voice wide in the keen upper air there's the heart of that fellow said agostino he has but one idea his king if you confound it he takes you for an enemy these free mountain breezes intoxicate you you would embrace the king himself if you met him here i swear i would never be guilty of the bad joke of crying a 'viva' to him anywhere upon earth carlo replied i offend you he said quickly the old man was smiling agostino balderini is too notoriously a bad joker to be offended by the comments of the perfectly sensible boy of mine my limbs were stiff and the first three steps from a place of rest reminded me acutely of the king's five years of hospitality he has saved me from all fatigue so long that the necessity to exercise these old joints of mine touched me with a grateful sense of his royal bounty i had from him a chair a bed and a table shelter from sun and from all silly chatter now i want a chair or a bed i should like to sit at a table the sun burns me my ears are afflicted i cry viva to him that i may be in harmony with the coming chorus of italy which i prophetically hear that young fellow in whom you confide so much speaks for his country we poor units must not be discordant no individual opinion my carlo is discord when there is a general delirium the tide arriving let us make the best of the tide my voice is wisdom we shall have to follow this king shall we uttered one behind them gruffly when i see this king swallow one ounce of austrian lead i shall not be sorry to follow him right my dear ugo said agostino turning round to him and i will then compose his hymn of praise he has swallowed enough of austrian bread he took an austrian wife to his bed who knows he may some day declare a preference for austrian lead but we shall have to follow him or stay at home drivelling agostino raised his eyes that were glazed with the great heat of his frame oh that like our dante i had lived in the days when souls were damned then would i uplift another shout believe me as things go now we must allow the traitor to hope for his own future and we simply shrug we cannot plant him neck deep for everlasting in a burning marl and hear him howling we have no weapons in these times none our curses come back to roost this is one of the serious facts of the century and controls violent language what are you all gathered about me oracles must be moving too there's no rest even for them when they have got a mountain to scale a cry he is there and do you see him burst from the throats of men surrounding agostino looking up to the mountain's top they had perceived the figure of one who stood with folded arms sufficiently near for the person of an expected friend to be descried they waved their hats and carlo shot ahead the others trod after him more deliberately but in glad excitement speculating on the time which this sixth member of the party who were engaged to assemble at a certain hour of the morning upon yonder height had taken to reach the spot from omegna or orta or pella and rejoicing that his health should be so stout in despite of his wasting labours under city smoke yes health said agostino is it health do you think it's the heart of the man and a heart with a mill stone about it a heart to breed a country from there stands the man who has faith in italy though she has been lying like a corpse for centuries god bless him he has no other comfort viva l'italia the exclamation went up and was acknowledged by him on the eminence overhanging them but at a repetition of it his hand smote the air sideways they understood the motion and were silent while he until carlo breathed his name in his hearing eyed the great scene stedfastly with the absorbing simple passion of one who has endured long exile and finds his clustered visions of it confronting the strange beloved visible life the lake in the arms of giant mountains the far spreading hazy plain the hanging forests the pointed crags the gleam of the distant rose shadowed snows that stretch for ever like an airy host mystically clad and baffling the eye as with the motions of a flight toward the underlying purple land chapter ii he was a man of middle stature thin and even frail as he stood defined against the sky with the complexion of the student and the student's aspect the attentive droop of his shoulders and head the straining of the buttoned coat across his chest the air as of one who waited and listened which distinguished his figure detracted from the promise of other than contemplative energy until his eyes were fairly seen and felt that is until the observer became aware that those soft and large dark meditative eyes had taken hold of him in them lay no abstracted student's languor no reflex burning of a solitary lamp but a quiet grappling force engaged the penetrating look gazing upon them you were drawn in suddenly among the thousand whirring wheels of a capacious and a vigorous mind that was both reasoning and prompt keen of intellect acting throughout all its machinery and having all under full command an orbed mind supplying its own philosophy and arriving at the sword stroke by logical steps a mind much less supple than a soldier's anything but the mind of a hamlet the eyes were dark as the forest's border is dark not as night is dark under favourable lights their colour was seen to be a deep rich brown like the chestnut or more like the hazeledged sunset brown which lies upon our western rivers in the winter floods when night begins to shadow them the side view of his face was an expression of classic beauty rarely now to be beheld either in classic lands or elsewhere it was severe the tender serenity of the full bow of the eyes relieved it in profile they showed little of their intellectual quality but what some might have thought a playful luminousness and some a quick pulse of feeling the chin was firm on it and on the upper lip there was a clipped growth of black hair the whole visage widened upward from the chin though not very markedly before it reached the broad lying brows the temples were strongly indented by the swelling of the forehead above them and on both sides of the head there ran a pregnant ridge such as will sometimes lift men a deplorable half inch above the earth we tread if this man was a problem to others he was none to himself and when others called him an idealist he accepted the title reading himself notwithstanding as one who was less flighty than many philosophers and professedly practical teachers of his generation he saw far and he grasped ends beyond obstacles he was nourished by sovereign principles he despised material present interests and as i have said he was less supple than a soldier if the title of idealist belonged to him we will not immediately decide that it was opprobrious the idealized conception of stern truths played about his head certainly for those who knew and who loved it such a man perceiving a devout end to be reached might prove less scrupulous in his course possibly and less remorseful than revolutionary generals his smile was quite unclouded and came softly as a curve in water it seemed to flow with and to pass in and out of his thoughts to be a part of his emotion and his meaning when it shone transiently full for as he had an orbed mind so had he an orbed nature the passions were absolutely in harmony with the intelligence he had the english manner a remarkable simplicity contrasting with the demonstrative outcries and gesticulations of his friends when they joined him on the height calling them each by name he received their caresses and took their hands after which he touched the old man's shoulder agostino this has breathed you it has it has my dear and best one agostino replied but here is a good market place for air down below we have to scramble for it in the mire the spies are stifling down below i don't know my own shadow i begin to think that i am important footing up a mountain corrects the notion somewhat yonder i believe i see the grisons where freedom sits and there's the monte della disgrazia carlo alberto should be on the top of it but he is invisible i do not see that unfortunate no said carlo ammiani who chimed to his humour more readily than the rest and affected to inspect the grisons' peak through a diminutive opera glass no he is not there perhaps my son he is like a squirrel and is careful to run up t'other side of the stem for he is on that mountain no doubt of it can exist even in the boeotian mind of one of his subjects myself for example it will be an effulgent fact when he gains the summit the others meantime had thrown themselves on the grass at the feet of their manifestly acknowledged leader and looked up for agostino to explode the last of his train of conceits he became aware that the moment for serious talk had arrived and bent his body groaning loudly and uttering imprecations against him whom he accused of being the promoter of its excruciating stiffness until the ground relieved him of its weight carlo continued standing while his eyes examined restlessly the slopes just surmounted by them and occasionally the deep descent over the green glowing orta lake it was still early morning the heat was tempered by a cool breeze that came with scents of thyme they had no sight of human creature anywhere but companionship of alps and birds of upper air and though not one of them seasoned the converse with an exclamation of joy and of blessings upon a place of free speech and safety the thought was in their hunted bosoms delicious as a woodland rivulet that sings only to the leaves overshadowing it they were men who had sworn to set a nation free free from the foreigner to begin with he who tells this tale is not a partisan he would deal equally toward all of strong devotion of stout nobility of unswerving faith and self sacrifice he must approve and when these qualities are displayed in a contest of forces the wisdom of means employed or of ultimate views entertained may be questioned and condemned but the men themselves may not be these men had sworn their oath knowing the meaning of it and the nature of the fury against whom men who stand voluntarily pledged to any great resolve must thenceforward match themselves many of the original brotherhood had fallen on the battle field on the glacis or in the dungeon all present save the youthfuller carlo had suffered imprisonment and exile marked the chief ugo corte of bergamo had seen his family swept away by the executioner and pecuniary penalties thick scars of wounds covered the body and disfigured the face of giulio bandinelli agostino had crawled but half a year previously out of his piedmontese cell and marco sana the brescian had in such a place tasted of veritable torture but if the calamity of a great oath was upon them they had now in their faithful prosecution of it the support which it gives they were unwearied they had one object the mortal anguish they had gone through had left them no sense for regrets life had become the field of an endless engagement to them and as in battle one sees beloved comrades struck down and casts but a glance at their prostrate forms they heard the mention of a name perchance and with a word or a sign told what was to be said of a passionate glorious heart at rest thanks to austrian or vassal sardinian mercy so they lay there and discussed their plans from what quarter do you apprehend the surprise ugo corte glanced up from the maps and papers spread along the grass to question carlo ironically while the latter appeared to be keeping rigid watch over the safety of the position carlo puffed the smoke of a cigarette rapidly and agostino replied for him from the quarter where the best donkeys are to be had it was supposed that agostino had resumed the habit usually laid aside by him for the discussion of serious matters and had condescended to father a coarse joke but his eyes showed no spark of their well known twinkling solicitation for laughter and carlo spoke in answer gravely from baveno it will be from baveno they might as well think to surprise hawks from baveno keep watch dear ammiani a good start in a race is a kick from the gods with that corte turned to the point of his finger on the map he conceived it possible that carlo ammiani a milanese had reason to anticipate the approach of people by whom he or they might not wish to be seen had he studied carlo's face he would have been reassured the brows of the youth were open and his eyes eager with expectation that showed the flying forward of the mind and nothing of knotted distrust or wary watchfulness now and then he would move to the other side of the mountain and look over upon orta or with the opera glass clasped in one hand beneath an arm he stopped in his sentinel march frowning reflectively at a word put to him as if debating within upon all the bearings of it but the only answer that came was a sharp assent given after the manner of one who dealt conscientiously in definite affirmatives and again the glass was in requisition marco sana was a fighting soldier who stated what he knew listened and took his orders giulio bandinelli was also little better than the lieutenant in an enterprise corte on the other hand had the conspirator's head a head like a walnut bulging above the ears and the man was of a sallying temper he lay there putting bit by bit of his plot before the chief for his approval with a careful construction that upon the expression of any doubt of its working smoothly in the streets of milan caused him to shout a defensive but carlo says yes this uniform character of ammiani's replies and the smile of agostino on hearing them had begun to strike the attention of the soldierly marco sana he ran his hand across his shorn head and puffed his burnt red mole spotted cheeks with a sidelong stare at the abstracted youth said yes he remarked he might say no for a diversion he has yeses enough in his pay to earn a cardinal's hat 'is milan preparing to rise' 'yes' 'is she ready for the work' 'yes' 'is the garrison on its guard' 'yes' 'have you seen barto rizzo' 'yes' 'have the people got the last batch of arms' 'yes' and 'yes' the secret is well kept 'yes' barto rizzo is steadily getting them together we may rely on him carlo is his intimate friend yes yes there's a regiment of them at your service and you may shuffle them as you will this is the help we get from milan a specimen of what we may expect sana had puffed himself hot and now blew for coolness you are agostino addressed him philosophically totally wrong my marco those affirmatives are fat worms for the catching of fish they are the real pretty fruit of the hesperides personally you or i may be irritated by them but i'm not sure they don't please us were carlo a woman of course he should learn to say no as he will now if i ask him is she in sight i won't do it you know but as a man and a diplomatist it strikes me that he can't say yes too often answer me count ammiani and do me the favour to attend to these trifles for the space of two minutes said corte have you seen barto rizzo is he acting for medole as mole as reindeer and as bloody northern raven ejaculated agostino perhaps to be jackal by and by but i do not care to abuse our barto rizzo who is a prodigy of nature and has luckily for himself embraced a good cause for he is certain to be hanged if he is not shot he has the prophetic owl's face i have always a fancy of his hooting his own death scrip i wrong our barto medole would be the jackal if it lay between the two carlo ammiani had corrected corte's manner to him by a complacent readiness to give him distinct replies he then turned and set off at full speed down the mountain she is sighted at last agostino murmured and added rapidly some spirited words under his breath to the chief whose chin was resting on his doubled hand corte marco and giulio were full of denunciations against milan and the milanese who had sent a boy to their councils it was brescia and bergamo speaking in their jealousy but carlo's behaviour was odd and called for reproof he had come as the deputy of milan to meet the chief and he had not spoken a serious word on the great business of the hour though the plot had been unfolded the numbers sworn to and brescia and bergamo and cremona and venice had spoken upon all points through their emissaries the two latter cities being represented by sana and corte we've had enough of this lad said corte his laundress is following him with a change of linen i suppose or it's a scent bottle he's an admirable representative of the lombard metropolis corte drawled out the words in prodigious mimicry if milan has nothing better to send than such a fellow we'll finish without her and shame the beast that she is she has been always a treacherous beast poor milan sighed the chief she lies under the beak of the vulture and has twice been devoured but she has a soul she proves it ammiani too will prove his value i have no doubt of him as to boys or even girls you know my faith is in the young through them italy lives what power can teach devotion to the old i thank you signore agostino gesticulated but tell me when did you learn it my friend in answer agostino lifted his hand a little boy's height from the earth the old man then said i am afraid my dear corte you must accept the fellowship of a girl as well as of a boy upon this occasion see our carlo you recognize that dancing speck below there he has joined himself the poor lad wishes he could i dare swear to another bigger speck which is verily a lady who has joined herself to a donkey a common habit of the sex i am told but i know them not that lady signor ugo is the signorina vittoria you stare but i tell you the game cannot go on without her and that is why i have permitted you to knock the ball about at your own pleasure for these forty minutes corte drew his under lip on his reddish stubble moustache are we to have women in a conference he asked from eye to eye keep to the number ugo and moreover she is not a woman but a noble virgin i discern a distinction though you may not the vestal's fire burns straight who is she it rejoices me that she should be so little known all the greater the illumination when her light shines out the signorina vittoria is a cantatrice who is about to appear upon the boards ah that completes it corte rose to his feet with an air of desperation we require to be refreshed with quavers and crescendos and trillets who ever knew a singer that cared an inch of flesh for her country money flowers flattery vivas but money money and austrian as good as italian i've seen the accursed wenches bow gratefully for austrian bouquets bow ay and more and when the austrian came to them red with our blood i spit upon their polluted cheeks they get us an ill name wherever they go these singers have no country one i knew her betrayed filippo mastalone and sang the night of the day he was shot i heard the white demon myself i could have taken her long neck till she twisted like a serpent and hissed may heaven forgive me for not levelling a pistol at her head if god my friends had put the thought into my brain that night a flush had deadened corte's face to the hue of nightshade you thunder in a clear atmosphere my ugo returned the old man as he fell back calmly at full length and who is this signorina vittoria cried corte a cantatrice who is about to appear upon the boards as i have already remarked of la scala let me add if you hold it necessary and what does she do here her object in coming my friend her object in coming is first to make her reverence to one who happens to be among us this day and secondly but principally to submit a proposition to him and to us what's her age corte sneered according to what calendar would you have it reckoned wisdom would say sixty father chronos might divide that by three and would get scarce a month in addition hungry as he is for her and all of us but minerva's handmaiden has no age and now dear ugo you have your opportunity to denounce her as a convicted screecher by night do so corte turned his face to the chief and they spoke together for some minutes after which having had names of noble devoted women dead and living cited to him in answer to brutal bellowings against that sex and hearing of the damsel under debate as one who was expected and was welcome he flung himself upon the ground again inviting calamity by premature resignation giulio bandinelli stretched his hand for carlo's glass and spied the approach of the signorina dark he said a jewel of that complexion added agostino by way of comment she has scorching eyes she may do mischief she may do mischief let it be only on the right side she looks fat she sits doubled up and forward don't you see to relieve the poor donkey you my giulio would call a swan fat if the neck were not always on the stretch by bacchus what a throat she has and well interjected giulio it runs down like wine like wine to the little ebbing and flowing wave away with the glass my boy you must trust to all that's best about you to spy what's within she makes me young young agostino waved his hand in the form of a salute to her on the last short ascent she acknowledged it gracefully and talking at intervals to carlo ammiani who footed briskly by her side she drew by degrees among the eyes fixed on her some of which were not gentle but hers were for the chief at whose feet when dismounted by ammiani's solicitous aid she would have knelt had he not seized her by her elbows and put his lips to her cheek the signorina vittoria gentlemen said agostino chapter iii the old man had introduced her with much of the pride of a father displaying some noble child of his for the first time to admiring friends she is one of us he pursued a daughter of italy my daughter also is it not so he turned to her as for a confirmation the signorina pressed his fingers she was a little intimidated and for the moment seemed shy and girlish the shade of her broad straw hat partly concealed her vivid features now gentlemen if you please the number is complete and we may proceed to business said agostino formally but as he conducted the signorina to place her at the feet of the chief she beckoned to her servant who was holding the animal she had ridden he came up to her and presented himself in something of a military posture of attention to her commands these were that he should take the poor brute to water and then lead him back to baveno and do duty in waiting upon her mother the first injunction was received in a decidedly acquiescent manner on hearing the second which directed his abandonment of his post of immediate watchfulness over her safety the man flatly objected with a signorina no he was a handsome bright eyed fellow with a soldier's frame and a smile as broad and beaming as laughter indicating much of that mixture of acuteness and simplicity which is a characteristic of the south and means no more than that the extreme vivacity of the blood exceeds at times that of the brain a curious frown of half amused astonishment hung on the signorina's face when i tell you to go beppo at once the man threw out his fingers accompanied by an amazingly voluble delivery of his reasons for this revolt against her authority among other things he spoke of an oath sworn by him to a foreign gentleman his patron for whom and for whomsoever he loved he was ready to pour forth his heart's blood to the effect that he would never quit her side when she left the roof of her house you see beppo she remonstrated i am among friends beppo gave a sweeping bow but remained firm where he stood ammiani cast a sharp hard look at the man do you hear the signorina's orders i hear them signore will you obey them she interposed he must not hear quick words beppo is only showing his love for his master and for me but you are wrong in this case my beppo you shall give me your protection when i require it and now you are sensible and must understand that it is not wanted i tell you to go beppo read the eyes of his young mistress signorina he stooped forward mysteriously signorina that fellow is in baveno i saw him this morning good good and now go my friend the signor agostino he remarked loudly to attract the old man the signor agostino may think proper to advise you the signor agostino will laugh at nothing that you say to day beppo you will obey me go at once she repeated seeing him on tiptoe to gain agostino's attention beppo knew by her eyes that her ears were locked against him and though she spoke softly there was an imperiousness in her voice not to be disregarded he showed plainly by the lost rigidity of his attitude that he was beaten and perplexed further expostulations being disregarded he turned his head to look at the poor panting beast under his charge and went slowly up to him they walked off together a crest fallen pair you have gained the victory signorina said ugo corte she replied smiling my poor beppo it's not difficult to get the best of those who love us ha cried agostino here is one of their secrets carlo take heed of it my boy we shall have queens when kings are fossils mark me ammiani muttered a courtly phrase whereat corte yawned in very grim fashion the signorina had dropped to the grass at a short step from the chief to whom her face was now seriously given in ammiani's sight she looked a dark madonna with the sun shining bright gold through the edges of the summer hat thrown back from her head the full and steady contemplative eyes had taken their fixed expression after a vanishing affectionate gaze of an instant cast upon agostino attentive as they were light played in them like water the countenance was vivid in repose she leaned slightly forward clasping the wrist of one hand about her knee and the sole of one little foot showed from under her dress deliberately but with no attempt at dramatic impressiveness the chief began to speak he touched upon the condition of italy and the new lilt animating her young men and women i have heard many good men jeer he said at our taking women to our counsel accepting their help and putting a great stake upon their devotion you have read history and you know what women can accomplish they may be trained equally as we are to venerate the abstract idea of country and be a sacrifice to it without their aid and the fire of a fresh life being kindled in their bosoms no country that has lain like ours in the death trance can revive in the death trance i say for italy does not die true said other voices we have this belief in the eternal life of our country and the belief is the life itself but let no strong man among us despise the help of women i have seen our cause lie desperate and those who despaired of it were not women women kept the flame alive they worship in the temple of the cause ammiani's eyes dwelt fervidly upon the signorina her look which was fastened upon the chief expressed a mind that listened to strange matter concerning her very little but when the plans for the rising of the bergamascs and brescians the venetians the bolognese the milanese all the principal northern cities were recited with a practical emphasis thrown upon numbers upon the readiness of the organized bands the dispositions of the leaders and the amount of resistance to be expected at the various points indicated for the outbreak her hands disjoined and she stretched her fingers to the grass supporting herself so while her extended chin and animated features told how eagerly her spirit drank at positive springs and thirsted for assurance of the coming storm it is decided that milan gives the signal said the chief and a light like the reflection of a beacon fire upon the night flashed over her he was pursuing when ugo corte smote the air with his nervous fingers crying out passionately bunglers are we again to wait for them and hear that fifteen patriots have stabbed a croat corporal and wrestled hotly with a lieutenant of the guard i say they are bunglers they never mean the thing fifteen there were just three milanese among the last lot the pick of the city and the rest were made up of trentini and our lads from bergamo and brescia and the order from the council was 'go and do the business' which means 'go and earn your ounce of austrian lead' they went and we gave fifteen true men for one poor devil of a curst tight blue leg they can play the game on if we give them odds like that milan burns bad powder and goes off like a drugged pistol it's a nest of bunglers and may it be razed we could do without it and well if it were a family failing should not i too be trusting them my brother was one of the fifteen who marched out as targets to try the skill of those hell plumed tyrolese and they did it thoroughly shot him straight here corte struck his chest he gave a jump and a cry was it a viva for milan they swear that it was and they can't translate from a living mouth much more from a dead one but i know my niccolo better i have kissed his lips a thousand times and i know the poor boy meant 'scorn and eternal distrust of such peddling conspirators as these' i can deal with traitors but these flash in the pan plotters these shaking jelly bodied patriots trust to them again rather draw lots for another fifteen to bare their breasts and bandage their eyes and march out in the grey morning while the stupid croat corporal goes on smoking his lumpy pipe we shall hear that milan is moving we shall rise we shall be hot at it and the news will come that milan has merely yawned and turned over to sleep on the other side twice she has done this trick and the garrison there has sent five regiments to finish us teach us to sleep soundly likewise i say let it be bergamo or be it brescia if you like or venice she is ready you trust to milan and you are fore doomed i would swear it with this hand in the flames she give the signal shut your eyes cross your hands flat on your breasts you are dead men if you move she lead the way spin on your heels and you have followed her corte had spoken in a thick difficult voice that seemed to require the aid of his vehement gestures to pour out as it did like a water pipe in a hurricane of rain he ceased red almost to blackness and knotted his arms that were big as the cable of a vessel not a murmur followed his speech the word was given to the chief and he resumed you have a personal feeling in this case ugo you have not heard me i came through paris a rocket will soon shoot up from paris that will be a signal for christendom the keen french wit is sick of its compromise king all europe is in convulsions in a few months to morrow it may be the elements are in the hearts of the people and nothing will contain them we have sown them to reap them the sowing asks for persistency but the reaping demands skill and absolute truthfulness we have now one of those occasions coming which are the flowers to be plucked by resolute and worthy hands they are the tests of our sincerity this time now rapidly approaching will try us all and we must be ready for it if we have believed in it we stand prepared if we have conceived our plan of action in purity of heart we shall be guided to discern the means which may serve us you will know speedily what it is that has prompted you to move if passion blindfolds you if you are foiled by a prejudice i also shall know my friend the nursing of a single antipathy is a presumption that your motive force is personal whether the thirst for vengeance or some internal union of a hundred indistinct little fits of egoism i have seen brave and even noble men fail at the ordeal of such an hour not fail in courage not fail in the strength of their desire that was the misery for them they failed because midway they lost the vision to select the right instruments put in our way by heaven that vision belongs solely to such as have clean and disciplined hearts the hope in the bosom of a man whose fixed star is humanity becomes a part of his blood and is extinguished when his blood flows no more to conquer him the principle of life must be conquered and he my friend will use all because he serves all i need not touch on milan the signorina drew in her breath quickly as if in this abrupt close she had a revelation of the chief's whole meaning and was startled by the sudden unveiling of his mastery her hands hung loose her figure was tremulous a murmur from corte jarred within her like a furious discord but he had not offended by refusing to disclaim his error and had simply said in a gruff acquiescent way proceed her sensations of surprise at the singular triumph of the chief made her look curiously into the faces of the other men but the pronouncing of her name engaged her attention your first night is the night of the fifteenth of next month it is signore she replied abashed to find herself speaking with him who had so moved her there is no likelihood of a postponement i am certain signore that i shall be ready there are no squabbles of any serious kind among the singers a soft dimple played for a moment on her lips i have heard something among the women yes and the men but the men do not concern you no signore except that the women twist them agostino chuckled audibly the chief resumed you believe notwithstanding that all will go well the opera will be acted and you will appear in it yes signore i know one who has determined on it and can do it good the opera is camilla she was answering with an affirmative when agostino broke in camilla and honour to whom honour is due let caesar claim the writing of the libretto if it be caesar's it has passed the censorship signed agostino balderini a disaffected person out of piedmont rendered tame and fangless by a rigorous imprisonment the sources of the tale o ye grave signori tedeschi the sources are partly to be traced to a neat little french vaudeville very sparkling camille or the husband asserted and again to a certain chronicle that may be mediaeval may be modern and is just as the great shakespeare would say 'as you like it' agostino recited some mock verses burlesquing the ordinary libretti and provoked loud laughter from carlo ammiani who was familiar enough with the run of their nonsense camilla is the bride of camillo i give to her all the brains which is a modern idea quite he does all the mischief which is possibly mediaeval they have both an enemy which is mediaeval and modern none of them know exactly what they are about so there you have the modern the mediaeval and the antique all in one finally my friends camilla is something for you to digest at leisure the censorship swallowed it at a gulp never was bait so handsomely taken at present i have the joy of playing my fish on the night of the fifteenth i land him camilla has a mother do you see that mother is reported is generally conceived as dead do you see further camilla's first song treats of a dream she has had of that mother our signorina shall not be troubled to favour you with a taste of it or by bacchus and his indian nymphs i should speedily behold you jumping like peas in a pan like trout on a bank the earth would be hot under you verily as i was remarking or meant to be camilla and her husband disagree having agreed to 'tis a plot to deceive count orso aha you are acquainted with count orso he is camilla's antenuptial guardian now you warm to it in that condition i leave you perhaps my child here will give you a taste of her voice the poetry does much upon reflection but it has to ripen within you a matter of time wed this voice to the poetry and it finds passage 'twixt your ribs as on the point of a driven blade do i cry the sweetness and the coolness of my melons not i try them the signorina put her hand out for the scroll he was unfolding and cast her eyes along bars of music while agostino called a silenzio tutti she sang one verse and stopped for breath between her dismayed breathings she said to the chief believe me signore i can be trusted to sing when the time comes sing on my blackbird my viola said agostino we all trust you look at colonel corte and take him for count orso take me for pretty camillo take marco for michiela giulio for leonardo carlo for cupid take the chief for the audience take him for a frivolous public ah my pippo agostino laughed aside to him let us lead off with a lighter piece a trifle tra la la and then let the frisky piccolo be drowned in deep organ notes as on some occasions in history the people overrun certain puling characters but that i confess is an illustration altogether out of place and i'll simply jot it down in my notebook agostino had talked on to let her gain confidence when he was silent she sang from memory it was a song of flourishes one of those be flowered arias in which the notes flicker and leap like young flames others might have sung it and though it spoke favourably of her aptitude and musical education and was of a quality to enrapture easy merely critical audiences it won no applause from these men the effect produced by it was exhibited in the placid tolerance shown by the uplifting of ugo corte's eyebrows which said well here's a voice certainly his subsequent look added is this what we have come hither to hear vittoria saw the look am i on my trial before you she thought and the thought nerved her throat she sang in strong and grave contralto tones at first with shut eyes the sense of hostility left her and left her soul free and she raised them the song was of camilla dying she pardons the treacherous hand commending her memory and the strength of her faith to her husband beloved i am quickly out of sight i pray that you will love more than my dust were death defeat much weeping would be right 'tis victory when it leaves surviving trust you will not find me save when you forget earth's feebleness and come to faith my friend for all humanity doth owe a debt to all humanity until the end agostino glanced at the chief to see whether his ear had caught note of his own language the melancholy severity of that song of death changed to a song of prophetic triumph the signorina stood up camilla has thrown off the mask and has sung the name italia at the recurrence of it the men rose likewise italia italia shall be free vittoria gave the inspiration of a dying voice the conquest of death by an eternal truth seemed to radiate from her voice and features were as one expression of a rapture of belief built upon pathetic trustfulness italia italia shall be free she seized the hearts of those hard and serious men as a wind takes the strong oak trees and rocks them on their knotted roots and leaves them with the song of soaring among their branches italy shone about her the lake the plains the peaks and the shouldering flushed snowridges carlo ammiani breathed as one who draws in fire grizzled agostino glittered with suppressed emotion like a frosted thorn bush in the sunlight ugo corte had his thick brows down as a man who is reading iron matter the chief alone showed no sign beyond a half lifting of the hand and a most luminous fixed observation of the fair young woman from whom power was an emanation free of effort the gaze was sad in its thoughtfulness such as our feelings translate of the light of evening she ceased and he said you sing on the night of the fifteenth i do signore it is your first appearance she bent her head and you will be prepared on that night to sing this song yes signore save in the event of your being forbidden unless you shall forbid me i will sing it signore should they imprison you if they shoot me i shall be satisfied to know that i have sung a song that cannot be forgotten the chief took her hand in a gentle grasp such as you will help to give our italy freedom you hold the sacred flame and know you hold it in trust friends he turned to his companions you have heard what will be the signal for milan chapter iv it was a surprise to all of them save to agostino balderini who passed his inspecting glance from face to face marking the effect of the announcement corte gazed at her heavily but not altogether disapprovingly giulio bandinelli and marco sana though evidently astonished and to some extent incredulous listened like the perfectly trusty lieutenants in an enterprise which they were but carlo ammiani stood horror stricken the blood had left his handsome young olive hued face and his eyes were on the signorina large with amazement from which they deepened to piteousness of entreaty signorina you can it be true do you know do you mean it what signor carlo this will you venture to do such a thing oh will i venture what can you think of me it is my own request but signorina in mercy listen and consider carlo turned impetuously to the chief the signorina can't know the danger she is running she will be seized on the boards and shut up between four walls before a man of us will be ready or more than one he added softly the house is sure to be packed for a first night and the polizia have a suspicion of her she has been off her guard in the conservatorio she has talked of a country called italy she has been indiscreet pardon pardon signorina but it is true that she has spoken out from her noble heart and this opera are they fools they must see through it it will never it can't possibly be reckoned on to appear i knew that the signorina was heart and soul with us but who could guess that her object was to sacrifice herself in the front rank to lead a forlorn hope i tell you it's like a pagan rite you are positively slaying a victim i beg you all to look at the case calmly a burst of laughter checked him for his seniors by many years could not hear such veteran's counsel from a hurried boy without being shrewdly touched by the humour of it while one or two threw a particular irony into their tones when we do slay a victim we will come to you as our augur my carlo said agostino corte was less gentle as a milanese and a mere youth ammiani was antipathetic to corte who closed his laughter with a windy rattle of his lips and a pish of some emphasis carlo was quick to give him a challenging frown what is it corte bent his head back as if inquiringly it's i who claim that question by right said carlo you are a boy i have studied war in books with brains colonel corte war is a matter of blows my little lad let me inform you signor colonel that war is not a game between bulls to be played with the horns of the head you are prepared to instruct me the fiery bergamasc lifted his eyebrows nay nay said agostino between us two first and he grasped carlo's arm saying in an underbreath your last retort was too long winded in these conflicts you must be quick sharp as a rifle crack that hits echo on the breast bone and makes her cry out i correct a student in the art of war then aloud my opera young man well it's my libretto and you know we writers always say 'my opera' when we have put the pegs for the voice you are certainly aware that we do how dare you to make calumnious observations upon my opera is it not the ripe and admirable fruit of five years of confinement are not the lines sharp the stanzas solid and the stuff is it not good is not the subject simple pure from offence to sensitive authority constitutionally harmless reply it's transparent to any but asses said carlo but if it has passed the censorship you are guilty my boy of bestowing upon those highly disciplined gentlemen who govern your famous city what title i trust a prophetic one since that it comes from an animal whose custom is to turn its back before it delivers a blow and is they remark fonder of encountering dead lions than live ones still it is you who are indiscreet eminently so i must add if you will look lofty if my opera has passed the censorship eh what have you to say carlo endured this banter till the end of it came and you you encourage her he cried wrathfully you know what the danger is for her if they once lay hands on her they will have her in verona in four and twenty hours through the gates of the adige in a couple of days and at spielberg or some other of their infernal dens of groans within a week where is the chance of a rescue then they torture too they torture it's a woman and insult will be one mode of torturing her they can use rods the excited southern youth was about to cover his face but caught back his hands clenching them all this said agostino is an evasion manifestly of the question concerning my opera on which you have thought proper to cast a slur the phrase 'transparent to any but asses' may not be absolutely objectionable for transparency is as the critics rightly insist meritorious in a composition and according to the other view if we desire our clever opponents to see nothing in something it is notably skilful to let them see through it you perceive my carlo transparency then deserves favourable comment so i do not complain of your phrase but i had the unfortunate privilege of hearing it uttered the method of delivery scarcely conveyed a compliment will you apologize carlo burst from him with a vehement question to the chief is it decided it is my friend was the reply decided she is doomed signorina what can you know of this frightful risk you are going to the slaughter you will be seized before the first verse is out of your lips and once in their clutches you will never breathe free air again it's madness ah forgive me yes madness for you shut your eyes you rush into the trap blindfolded and that is how you serve our italy she sees you an instant and you are caught away and you who might serve her if you would do you think you can move dungeon walls perhaps if i have been once seen i shall not be forgotten said the signorina smoothly and then cast her eyes down as if she felt the burden of a little possible accusation of vanity in this remark she raised them with fire no never exclaimed carlo but now you are ours and surely it is not quite decided he had spoken imploringly to the chief not irrevocably he added irrevocably then she is lost for shame carlo ammiani said old agostino casting his sententious humours aside do you not hear it is decided do you wish to rob her of her courage and see her tremble it's her scheme and mine a case where an old head approves a young one the chief says yes and you bellow still is it a milanese trick be silent be silent echoed carlo do you remember the beast marschatska's bet the allusion was to a black incident concerning a young italian ballet girl who had been carried off by an austrian officer under the pretext of her complicity in one of the antecedent conspiracies he rendered payment for it said agostino he perished yes as we shake dust to the winds but she it's terrible you place women in the front ranks girls what can defenceless creatures do would you let the van regiment in battle be the one without weapons it's slaughter she's like a lamb to them you hold up your jewel to the enemy and cry 'come and take it' think of the insults think of the rough hands and foul mouths she will be seized on the boards not if you keep your tongue from wagging interposed ugo corte fevered by this unseasonable exhibition of what was to him manifestly a lover's frenzied selfishness he moved off indifferent to carlo's retort marco sana and giulio bandinelli were already talking aside with the chief signor carlo not a hand shall touch me said the signorina and i am not a lamb though it is good of you to think me one i passed through the streets of milan in the last rising i was unharmed you must have some confidence in me signorina there's the danger rejoined carlo you trust to your good angels once twice the third time they fail you what are you among a host of armed savages you would be tossed like weed on the sea in pity do not look so scornfully no there is no unjust meaning in it but you despise me for seeing danger can nothing persuade you and besides he addressed the chief who alone betrayed no signs of weariness listen i beg of you milan wants no more than a signal she does not require to be excited i came charged with several proposals for giving the alarm attend you others the night of the fifteenth comes it is passing like an ordinary night at twelve a fire balloon is seen in the sky listen in the name of saints and devils but even the chief was observed to show signs of amusement and the gravity of the rest forsook them altogether at the display of this profound and original conspiratorial notion excellent excellent my carlo said old agostino cheerfully you have thought you must have thought or whence such a conception but you really mistake it is not the garrison whom we desire to put on their guard by no means we are not in the imperial pay probably your balloon is to burst in due time and wind permitting disperse printed papers all over the city what if it is cried carlo fiercely exactly i have divined your idea you have thought or to correct the tense are thinking which is more hopeful though it may chance not to seem so meritorious but if yours are the ideas of full blown jackets bear in mind that our enemies are coated and breeched it may be creditable to you that your cunning is not the cunning of the serpent to us it would be more valuable if it were continue oh there are a thousand ways carlo controlled himself with a sharp screw of all his muscles i simply wish to save the signorina from an annoyance very mildly put agostino murmured assentingly in our journal said carlo holding out the palm of one hand to dot the forefinger of the other across it by way of personal illustration in our journal we might arrange for certain letters to recur at distinct intervals in roman capitals which might spell out 'this night at twelve' or 'at once' quite as ingenious but on the present occasion erring on the side of intricacy aha you want to increase the sale of your journal do you my boy the rogue with which and a light slap over carlo's shoulder agostino left him the aspect of his own futile proposals stared the young man in the face too forcibly for him to nurse the spark of resentment which was struck out in the turmoil of his bosom he veered as if to follow agostino and remained midway his chest heaving and his eyelids shut signor carlo i have not thanked you he heard vittoria speak i know that a woman should never attempt to do men's work the chief will tell you that we must all serve now and all do our best if we fail and they put me to great indignity i promise you that i will not live i would give this up to be done by anyone else who could do it better it is in my hands and my friends must encourage me ah signorina the young man sighed bitterly the knowledge that he had already betrayed himself in the presence of others too far and the sob in his throat labouring to escape kept him still a warning call from ugo corte drew their attention close by the chalet where the first climbers of the mountain had refreshed themselves beppo was seen struggling to secure the arms of a man in a high crowned green swiss hat who was apparently disposed to give the signorina's faithful servant some trouble after gazing a minute at this singular contention she cried it's the same who follows me everywhere and you will not believe you are suspected murmured carlo in her ear a spy sana queried showing keen joy at the prospect of scotching such a reptile on the lonely height corte went up to the chief they spoke briefly together making use of notes and tracings on paper the chief then said adieu to the signorina it was explained to the rest by corte that he had a meeting to attend near pella about noon and must be in fobello before midnight thence his way would be to genoa so you are resolved to give another trial to our crowned ex carbonaro said agostino without leaving him an initiative this time and the chief embraced the old man you know me upon that point i cannot trust him i do not but if we make such a tide in lombardy that his army must be drawn into it is such an army to be refused first the tide my friend see to that the king is our instrument cried carlo ammiani brightening yes if we were particularly well skilled in the use of that kind of instrument agostino muttered he stood apart while the chief said a few words to carlo which made the blood play vividly across the visage of the youth carlo tried humbly to expostulate once or twice in the end his head was bowed and he signified a dumb acquiescence once more good bye the chief addressed the signorina in english she replied in the same tongue good bye tremulously and passion mounting on it added oh when shall i see you again when rome is purified to be a fit place for such as you in another minute he was hidden on the slope of the mountain lying toward orta chapter v beppo had effected a firm capture of his man some way down the slope but it was a case of check that entirely precluded his own free movements they hung together intertwisted in the characters of specious pacificator and appealing citizen both breathless there you want to hand me up neatly i know your vanity my beppo and you don't even know my name said the prisoner i know your ferret of a face well enough said beppo you dog the signorina come up and don't give trouble am i not a sheep you worry me let me go you're a wriggling eel catch me fast by the tail then and don't hold me by the middle you want frightening my pretty fellow if that's true my beppo somebody made a mistake in sending you to do it stop a moment you're blown i think you gulp down your minestra too hot you drink beer you dog the signorina i swore to scotch you at last i left milan for the purpose don't you see act fairly my beppo and let us go up to the signorina together decently ay ay my little reptile you'll find no austrians here cry out to them to come to you from baveno if the motterone grew just one tree saints one would serve why don't you fool that you are my beppo pray to the saints earlier trees don't grow from heaven you'll be going there soon and you'll know better about it thanks to the virgin then we shall part at some time or other the struggles between them continued sharply during this exchange of intellectual shots but hearing ugo corte's voice the prisoner's confident audacity forsook him and he drew a long tight face like the mask of an admonitory exclamation addressed to himself from within stand up straight the soldier's command was uttered even beppo was amazed to see that the man had lost the power to obey or to speak corte grasped him under the arm pit with the force of his huge fist he swung him round and stretched him out at arm's length all collar and shanks the man hung like a mole from the twig yet while beppo poured out the tale of his iniquities his eyes gave the turn of a twinkle showing that he could have answered one whom he did not fear the charge brought against him was that for the last six months he had been untiringly spying on the signorina corte stamped his loose feet to earth shook him and told him to walk aloft the flexible voluble fellow had evidently become miserably disconcerted he walked in trepidation speechless and when interrogated on the height his eyes flew across the angry visages with dismal uncertainty agostino perceived that he had undoubtedly not expected to come among them and forthwith began to excite giulio and marco to the worst suspicions in order to indulge his royal poetic soul with a study of a timorous wretch pushed to anticipations of extremity the execution of a spy he preluded is the signal for the ringing of joy bells on this earth not only because he is one of a pestiferous excess in point of numbers but that he is no true son of earth he escaped out of hell's doors on a windy day and all that we do is to puff out a bad light and send him back look at this fellow in whom conscience is operating so that he appears like a corked volcano you can see that he takes austrian money his skin has got to be the exact colour of munz he has the greenish yellow eyes of those elective thrice abhorred vampyres who feed on patriot blood he is condemned without trial by his villanous countenance like an ungrammatical preface to a book his tongue refuses to confess but nature is stronger observe his knees now this is guilt it is execrable guilt he is a nasty object nature has in her wisdom shortened his stature to indicate that it is left to us to shorten the growth of his offending years now you dangling soul answer me what name hailed you when on earth the fan with no clearly serviceable tongue articulated luigi luigi the name christian and distinctive the name historic luigi porco luigi saracco signore saracco saracco very possibly a strip of the posterity of cut throat moors to judge by your face a moor undoubtedly glib slippery with a body that slides and a soul that jumps taken altogether more serpent than eagle i misdoubt that little quick cornering eye of yours do you ever remember to have blushed no signore said luigi you spy upon the signorina do you you have beppo's word for that interposed marco sana growling and you are found spying on the mountain this particular day luigi saracco you are a fellow of a tremendous composition a goose walking into a den of foxes is alone to be compared to you if ever such goose was how many of us did you count now when you were say a quarter of a mile below marco interposed again he has already seen enough up here to make a rope of florins the fellow's eye takes likenesses said giulio agostino's question was repeated by corte and so sternly that luigi beholding kindness upon no other face save vittoria's watched her and muttering six blinked his keen black eyes piteously to get her sign of assent to his hesitated naming of that number her mouth and the turn of her head were expressive to him and he cried seven so first six and next seven said corte six i meant without the signorina luigi explained you saw six of us without the signorina you see we are six here including the signorina where is the seventh luigi tried to penetrate vittoria's eyes for a proper response but she understood the grave necessity for getting the full extent of his observations out of him and she looked as remorseless as the men he feigned stupidity and sullenness rage and cunning in quick succession who was the seventh said carlo was it the king luigi asked this was by just a little too clever and its cleverness being seen magnified the intended evasion so as to make it appear to them that luigi knew well the name of the seventh marco thumped a hand on his shoulder shouting here speak out you saw seven of us where has the seventh one gone luigi's wits made a dash at honesty down orta signore and down orta i think you will go deeper down than you may like corte now requested vittoria to stand aside he motioned to her with his hand to stand farther and still farther off and finally told carlo to escort her to baveno she now began to think that the man luigi was in some perceptible danger nor did ammiani disperse the idea if he is a spy and if he has seen the chief we shall have to detain him for at least four and twenty hours he said or do worse but signor carlo vittoria made appeal to his humanity do they mean if they decide that he is guilty to hurt him tell me signorina what punishment do you imagine a spy deserves to be called one carlo smiled at her lofty method of dealing with the animal then you presume him to have a conscience i am sure signor carlo that i could make him loathe to be called a spy they were slowly pacing from the group and were on the edge of the descent when the signorina's name was shrieked by luigi the man came running to her for protection beppo and the rest at his heels she allowed him to grasp her hand after all he is my spy he does belong to me she said still speaking on to carlo i must beg your permission colonel corte and signor marco to try an experiment the signor carlo will not believe that a spy can be ashamed of his name luigi signorina he shook his body over her hand with a most plaintive utterance you are my countryman luigi yes signorina you are an italian certainly signorina a spy vittoria had not always to lift her voice in music for it to sway the hearts of men she spoke the word very simply in a mellow soft tone luigi's blood shot purple he thrust his fists against his ears see signor carlo she said i was right luigi you will be a spy no more carlo ammiani happened to be rolling a cigarette paper she put out her fingers for it and then reached it to luigi who accepted it with singular contortions of his frame declaring that he would confess everything to her yes signorina it is true i am a spy on you i know the houses you visit i know you eat too much chocolate for your voice i know you are the friend of the signora laura the widow of giacomo piaveni shot shot on annunciation day the virgin bless him i know the turning of every street from your house near the duomo to the signora's you go nowhere else except to the maestro's and it's something to spy upon you but think of your beppo who spies upon me and your little mother the lady most excellent is down in baveno and she is always near you when you make an expedition signorina i know you would not pay your beppo for spying upon me why does he do it i do not sing 'italia italia shall be free' i have heard you when i was under the maestro's windows and once you sang it to the signor agostino balderini indeed signorina i am a sort of guardian of your voice it is not gold of the tedeschi i get from the signor antonio pericles at the mention of this name agostino and vittoria laughed out you are in the pay of the signor antonio pericles said agostino without being in our pay you have done us the service to come up here among us bravo in return for your disinterestedness we kick you down either upon baveno or upon stresa or across the lake if you prefer it the man is harmless he is hired by a particular worshipper of the signorina's voice who affects to have first discovered it when she was in england and is a connoisseur a millionaire a greek a rich scoundrel with one indubitable passion for which i praise him we will let his paid eavesdropper depart i think he is harmless neither ugo nor marco was disposed to allow any description of spy to escape unscotched vittoria saw that luigi's looks were against him and whispered why do you show such cunning eyes luigi he replied signorina take me out of their hearing and i will tell you everything she walked aside he seemed immediately to be inspired with confidence and stretched his fingers in the form of a grasshopper at which sight they cried he knows barto rizzo this rascal they plied him with signs and countersigns and speedily let him go there ensued a sharp snapping of altercation between luigi and beppo vittoria had to order beppo to stand back it is a poor dog not of a good breed signorina luigi said casting a tolerant glance over his shoulder faithful but a poor nose ah you gave me this cigarette not the virgin could have touched my marrow as you did that's to be remembered by and by now you are going to sing on the night of the fifteenth of september change that night the signor antonio pericles watches you and he is a friend of the government and the government is snoring for you to think it asleep the signor antonio pericles pacifies the tedeschi but he will know all that you are doing and how easy it will be and how simple for you to let me know what you think he ought to know and just enough to keep him comfortable so we work like a machine signorina only not through that beppo for he is vain of his legs and his looks and his service and because he has carried a gun and heard it go off yes i am a spy but i am honest i too have visited england one can be honest and a spy signorina i have two arms but only one heart if you will be gracious and consider say here are two hands one hand does this thing one hand does that thing and that thing wipes out this thing it amounts to clear reasoning here are two eyes were they meant to see nothing but one side here is a tongue with a line down the middle almost to the tip of it which is for service that beppo couldn't deal double if he would for he is imperfectly designed a mere dog's pattern but only one heart signorina mind that i will never forget the cigarette i shall smoke it before i leave the mountain and think oh having illustrated the philosophy of his system luigi continued i am going to tell you everything pray do not look on beppo this is important the signor antonio pericles sent me to spy on you because he expects some people to come up the mountain and you know them and one is an austrian officer and he is an englishman by birth and he is coming to meet some english friends who enter italy from switzerland over the moro and easily up here on mules or donkeys from pella the signor antonio pericles has gold ears for everything that concerns the signorina a patriot is she he says and he is jealous of your english friends he thinks they will distract you from your studies and perhaps luigi nodded sagaciously before he permitted himself to say perhaps he is jealous in another way i have heard him speak like a sonnet of the signorina's beauty the signor antonio pericles thinks that you have come here to day to meet them when he heard that you were going to leave milan for baveno he was mad and with two fists up against all english persons the englishman who is an austrian officer is quartered at verona and the signor antonio pericles said that the englishman should not meet you yet if he could help it victoria stood brooding who can it be who is an englishman and an austrian officer and knows me signorina i don't know names behold that beppo is approaching like the snow what i entreat is that the signorina will wait a little for the english party if they come so that i may have something to tell my patron to invent upon nothing is most unpleasant and the signor antonio can soon perceive whether one swims with corks signorina i can dance on one rope i am a man i am not a midge i cannot dance upon nothing the days of vittoria's youth had been passed in england it was not unknown to her that old english friends were on the way to italy the recollection of a quiet and a buried time put a veil across her features she was perplexed by the mention of the austrian officer by luigi as one may be who divines the truth too surely but will not accept it for its loathsomeness there were englishmen in the army of austria could one of them be this one whom she had cared for when she was a girl it seemed hatefully cruel to him to believe it she spoke to agostino begging him to remain with her on the height awhile to see whether the signor antonio pericles was right to see whether luigi was a truth teller to see whether these english persons were really coming because she said if they do come it will at once dissolve any suspicions you may have of this luigi and i always long so much to know if the signor antonio is correct i have never yet known him to be wrong and you want to see these english said agostino he frowned only to hear them they shall not recognize me i have now another name and i am changed my hat is enough to hide me let me hear them talk a little you and the signor carlo will stay with me and when they come if they do come i will remain no longer than just sufficient to make sure i would refuse to know any of them before the night of the fifteenth i want my strength too much i shall have to hear a misery from them i know it i feel it it turns my blood but let me hear their voices england is half my country though i am so willing to forget her and give all my life to italy stay with me dear friend my best father humour me for you know that i am always charming when i am humoured agostino pressed his finger on a dimple in her cheeks you can afford to make such a confession as that to a greybeard the day is your own bear in mind that you are so situated that it will be prudent for you to have no fresh relations either with foreigners or others until your work is done in which my dear child may god bless you i pray to him with all my might vittoria said in reply after a consultation with agostino ugo corte and marco and giulio bade their adieux to her the task of keeping luigi from their clutches was difficult but agostino helped her in that also to assure them after his fashion of the harmlessness of luigi he seconded him in a contest of wit against beppo and the little fellow now that he had shaken off his fears displayed a quickness of retort and a liveliness unknown to professional spies and impossible to the race said agostino so absolutely is the mind of man blunted by austrian gold we know that for a fact beppo is no match for him beppo is sententious ponderously illustrative he can't turn he is long winded he i am afraid my carlo studies the journals he has got your journalistic style wherein words of six syllables form the relief to words of eight and hardly one dares to stand by itself they are like huge boulders across a brook the meaning do you see would run of itself but you give us these impedimenting big stones to help us over it while we profess to understand you by implication for my part i own that to me your parliamentary illegitimate academic modern crocodile phraseology which is formidable in the jaws impenetrable on the back can't circumvent a corner and is enabled to enter a common understanding solely by having a special highway prepared for it in short the writing in your journals is too much for me beppo here is an example that the style is useless for controversy this luigi baffles him at every step some rejoined carlo say that beppo has had the virtue to make you his study agostino threw himself on his back and closed his eyes that then is more than you have done signor tuquoque look on the bernina yonder and fancy you behold a rout of phantom goths a sleepy rout new risen with the blood of old battles on their shroud shirts and a north east wind blowing them upon our fat land or take a turn at the other side toward orta and look out for another invasion by no means so picturesque but preferable tourists do you hear them carlo ammiani had descried the advanced troop of a procession of gravely heated climbers ladies upon donkeys and pedestrian guards stalking beside them with courier and lacqueys and baskets of provisions all bearing the stamp of pilgrims from the great western island chapter vi a mountain ascended by these children of the forcible isle is a mountain to be captured and colonized and absolutely occupied for a term so that vittoria soon found herself and her small body of adherents observed and even exclaimed against as a sort of intruding aborigines whose presence entirely dispelled the sense of romantic dominion which a mighty eminence should give and which britons expect when they have expended a portion of their energies the exclamations were not complimentary nevertheless vittoria listened with pleased ears as one listens by a brookside near an old home hearing a music of memory rather than common words they talked of heat of appetite of chill of thirst of the splendour of the prospect of the anticipations of good hotel accommodation below of the sadness superinduced by the reflection that in these days people were found everywhere and poetry was thwarted again of heat again of thirst of beauty and of chill there was the enunciation of matronly advice there was the outcry of girlish insubordination there were sighings for english ale and namings of the visible ranges of peaks and indicatings of geographical fingers to show where switzerland and piedmont met and austria held her grasp on lombardy and to this point we go to night yonder to morrow farther the next day was uttered soberly or with excitement as befitted the age of the speaker among these tourists there was one very fair english lady with long auburn curls of the traditionally english pattern and the science of paris displayed in her bonnet and dress which if not as graceful as severe admirers of the antique in statuary or of the mediaeval in drapery demand pleads prettily to be thought so and commonly succeeds in its object when assisted by an artistic feminine manner vittoria heard her answer to the name of mrs sedley she had once known her as a miss adela pole amidst the cluster of assiduous gentlemen surrounding this lady it was difficult for vittoria's stolen glances to discern her husband and the moment she did discern him she became as indifferent to him as was his young wife by every manifestation of her sentiments mrs sedley informed her lord that it was not expected of him to care or to pretend to care for such scenes as the motterone exhibited and having dismissed him to the shade of an umbrella near the provision baskets she took her station within a few steps of vittoria and allowed her attendant gentlemen to talk while she remained plunged in a meditative rapture at the prospect the talk indicated a settled scheme for certain members of the party to reach milan from the como road mrs sedley was asked if she expected her brother to join her here or in milan here if a man's promises mean anything she replied languidly she was told that some one waved a handkerchief to them from below is he alone she said and directing an operaglass upon the slope of the mountain pursued as in a dreamy disregard of circumstances that is captain gambier my brother wilfrid has not kept his appointment perhaps he could not get leave from the general perhaps he is married he is engaged to an austrian countess i have heard captain gambier did me the favour to go round to a place called stresa to meet him he has undertaken the journey for nothing it is the way with all journeys though this the lady had softly reverted to her rapture this is too exquisite nature at least does not deceive vittoria listened to a bubbling of meaningless chatter until captain gambier had joined mrs sedley and at him for she had known him likewise she could not forbear looking up he was speaking to mrs sedley but caught the look and bent his head for a clearer view of the features under the broad straw hat mrs sedley commanded him imperiously to say on have you no letter from wilfrid has the mountain tired you has wilfrid failed to send his sister one word surely mr pericles will have made known our exact route to him and his uncle general pierson could i am certain he did exert his influence to procure him leave for a single week to meet the dearest member of his family captain gambier gathered his wits to give serviceable response to the kindled lady and letting his eyes fall from time to time on the broad straw hat made answer lieutenant pierson or in other words wilfrid pole the lady stamped her foot and flushed you know augustus i detest that name pardon me a thousandfold i had forgotten what has happened to you captain gambier accused the heat i found a letter from wilfrid at the hotel he is apparently kept on constant service between milan and verona and venice his quarters are at verona he informs me that he is to be married in the spring that is if all continues quiet married in the spring he seems to fancy that there may be disturbances not of a serious kind of course he will meet you in milan he has never been permitted to remain at milan longer than a couple of days at a stretch pericles has told him that she is in florence pericles has told me that miss belloni has removed to florence say it a third time the lady indulgently remarked i do not believe that she has gone i dare say not she has changed her name you know oh dear yes she has done something fantastic naturally for my part i should have thought her own good enough emilia alessandra belloni is good enough certainly said captain gambier the shading straw rim had shaken once during the colloquy it was now a fixed defence what is her new name mrs sedley inquired that i cannot tell wilfrid merely mentions that he has not seen her i said mrs sedley when i reach milan shall not trust to mr pericles but shall write to the conservatorio for if she is going to be a great cantatrice really it will be agreeable to renew acquaintance with her nor will it do any mischief to wilfrid now that he is engaged are you very deeply attached to straw hats they are sweet in a landscape mrs sedley threw him a challenge from her blue eyes but his reply to it was that of an unskilled youth who reads a lady by the letters of her speech one minute i will be with you instantly i want to have a look down on the lake i suppose this is one of the most splendid views in italy half a minute captain gambier smiled brilliantly and the lady perceiving that polished shield checked the shot of indignation on her astonished features and laid it by but the astonishment lingered there like the lines of a slackened bow she beheld her ideal of an english gentleman place himself before these recumbent foreign people and turn to talk across them with a pertinacious pursuit of the face under the bent straw hat nor was it singular to her that one of them at last should rise and protest against the continuation of the impertinence carlo ammiani in fact had opened matters with a scrupulously courteous bow monsieur is perhaps unaware that he obscures the outlook totally monsieur said captain gambier and stood fast will monsieur do me the favour to take three steps either to the right or to the left pardon monsieur but the request is put almost in the form of an order simply if it should prove inefficacious in the form of a request what may i ask monsieur is your immediate object to entreat you to behave with civility i am at a loss monsieur to perceive any offence permit me to say it is lamentable you do not know when you insult a lady i have insulted a lady captain gambier looked profoundly incredulous oh then you will not take exception to my assuming the privilege to apologize to her in person ammiani arrested him as he was about to pass stay monsieur you determine to be impudent i perceive you shall not be obtrusive vittoria had tremblingly taken old agostino's hand and had risen to her feet still keeping her face hidden she walked down the slope followed at an interval by her servant and curiously watched by the english officer who said to himself well i suppose i was mistaken and consequently discovered that he was in a hobble a short duologue in their best stilted french ensued between him and ammiani it was pitched too high in a foreign tongue for captain gambier to descend from it as he would fain have done to ask the lady's name they exchanged cards and formal salutes and parted the dignified altercation had been witnessed by the main body of the tourists captain gambier told them that he had merely interchanged amicable commonplaces with the frenchman or italian he added carelessly reading the card in his hand i thought she might be somebody whom we knew he said to mrs sedley not the shadow of a likeness to her the lady returned she had another opinion when later a scrap of paper bearing one pencilled line on it was handed round a damsel of the party had picked it up near the spot where as she remarked the foreigners had been sitting it said let none who look for safety go to milan chapter vii a week following the day of meetings on the motterone luigi the spy was in milan making his way across the piazza de' mercanti he entered a narrow court one of those which were anciently built upon the oriental principle of giving shade at the small cost of excluding common air it was dusky noon there through the hours of light and thrice night when darkness fell the atmosphere during the sun's short passage overhead hung with a glittering heaviness like the twinkling iron dust in a subterranean smithy on the lower window of one of the houses there was a board telling men that barto rizzo made and mended shoes and requesting people who wished to see him to make much noise at the door for he was hard of hearing it speedily became known in the court that a visitor desired to see barto rizzo the noise produced by luigi was like that of a fanatical beater of the tomtom he knocked and banged and danced against the door crying out for his passing amusement an adaptation of a popular ballad oh barto barto my boot is sadly worn the toe is seen that should be veiled from sight the toe that should be veiled like an eastern maid like a sultan's daughter shocking shocking one of a company of ten that were living a secluded life in chaste privacy oh barto barto must i charge it to thy despicable leather or to my incessant pilgrimages one fair toe i fear presently the corruption of the remaining nine then alas what do i go on how shall i come to a perfumed end who walk on ten indecent toes well may the delicate gentlemen sneer at me and scorn me as for the angelic lady who deigns to look so low i may say of her that her graciousness clothes what she looks at to her the foot the leg the back to her the very soul is bared but she is a rarity upon earth oh barto barto she is rarest in milan i might run a day's length and not find her if o barto as my boot hints to me i am about to be stripped of my last covering i must hurry to the inconvenient little chamber of my mother who cannot refuse to acknowledge me as of this pattern barto o shoemaker thou son of artifice and right hand man of necessity preserve me in the fashion of the time cobble me neatly a dozen wax threads and i am remade excellent i thank you now i can plant my foot bravely oh barto my shoemaker between ourselves it is unpleasant in these refined days to be likened at all to that preposterous adam the omission of the apostrophes to barto left it one of the ironical veiled republican semi socialistic ballads of the time which were sung about the streets for the sharpness and pith of the couplets and not from a perception of the double edge down the length of them as luigi was coming to the terminating line the door opened a very handsome sullen young woman of the dark thick browed lombard type asked what was wanted at the same time the deep voice of a man conjecturally rising from a lower floor called and a lock was rattled the woman told luigi to enter he sent a glance behind him he had evidently been drained of his sprightliness in a second he moved in with the slackness of limb of a gibbeted figure the door shut the woman led him downstairs he could not have danced or sung a song now for great pay the smell of mouldiness became so depressing to him that the smell of leather struck his nostrils refreshingly he thought oh virgin it's dark enough to make one believe in every single thing they tell us about the saints up in the light of day luigi had a turn for careless thinking on these holy subjects barto rizzo stood before him in a square of cellarage that was furnished with implements of his craft too dark for a clear discernment of features so here you are was the greeting luigi received it was a tremendous voice that seemed to issue from a vast cavity lead the gentleman to my sitting room said barto luigi felt the wind of a handkerchief and guessed that his eyes were about to be bandaged by the woman behind him he petitioned to be spared it on the plea firstly that it expressed want of confidence secondly that it took him in the stomach the handkerchief was tight across his eyes while he was speaking his hand was touched by the woman and he commenced timidly an ascent of stairs it continued so that he would have sworn he was a shorter time going up the motterone then down and along a passage lower down deep into corpse climate up again up another enormous mountain and once more down as among rats and beetles and down as among faceless horrors and down where all things seemed prostrate and with a taste of brass it was the poor fellow's nervous imagination preternaturally excited when the handkerchief was caught away his jaw was shuddering his eyes were sickly he looked as if impaled on the prongs of fright it required just half a minute to reanimate this mercurial creature when he found himself under the light of two lamps and barto rizzo fronting him in a place so like the square of cellarage which he had been led to with unbandaged eyes that it relieved his dread by touching his humour he cried have i made the journey of the signor capofinale who visited the other end of the world by standing on his head barto rizzo rolled out a burly laugh sit he said you're a poor sweating body and must needs have a dry tongue will you drink dry quoth luigi holy san carlo is a mash in a wine press compared with me barto rizzo handed him a liquor which he drank and after gave thanks to providence barto raised his hand we're too low down here for that kind of machinery he said they say that providence is on the side of the austrians now then what have you to communicate to me this time i let you come to my house trust at all trust entirely i think that's the proverb you are admitted speak like a guest luigi's preference happened to be for categorical interrogations never having an idea of spontaneously telling the whole truth the sense that he was undertaking a narrative gave him such emotions as a bad swimmer upon deep seas may have while on the other hand his being subjected to a series of questions seemed at least to leave him with one leg on shore for then he could lie discreetly and according to the finger posts and only when necessary and he could recover himself if he made a false step his ingenious mind reasoned these images out to his own satisfaction he requested therefore that his host would let him hear what he desired to know barto rizzo's forefinger was pressed from an angle into one temple his head inclined to meet it so that it was like the support to a broad blunt pillar the cropped head was flat as an owl's the chest of immense breadth the bulgy knees and big hands were those of a dwarf athlete strong colour lying full on him from the neck to the forehead made the big veins purple and the eyes fierier than the movements of his mind would have indicated he was simply studying the character of his man luigi feared him he was troubled chiefly because he was unaware of what barto rizzo wanted to know and could not consequently tell what to bring to the market the simplicity of the questions put to him was bewildering he fell into the trap barto's eyes began to get terribly oblique jingling money in his pocket he said you saw colonel corte on the motterone you saw the signor agostino balderini good men both also young count ammiani i served his father the general and jogged the lad on my knee you saw the signorina vittoria the english people came and you heard them talk but did not understand you came home and told all this to the signor antonio your employer number one you have told the same to me your employer number two there's your pay barto summed up thus the information he had received and handed luigi six gold pieces the latter springing with boyish thankfulness and pride at the easy earning of them threw in a few additional facts as that he had been taken for a spy by the conspirators and had heard one of the englishmen mention the signorina vittoria's english name barto rizzo lifted his eyebrows queerly we'll go through another interrogatory in an hour he said stop here till i return luigi was always too full of his own cunning to suspect the same in another until he was left alone to reflect on a scene when it became overwhelmingly transparent but what could i say more than i did say he asked himself as he stared at the one lamp barto had left finding the door unfastened he took the lamp and lighted himself out and along a cavernous passage ending in a blank wall against which his heart knocked and fell for his sensation was immediately the terror of imprisonment and helplessness mad with alarm he tried every spot for an aperture then he sat down on his haunches he remembered hearing word of barto rizzo's rack certain methods peculiar to barto rizzo by which he screwed matters out of his agents and terrified them into fidelity his personal dealings with barto were of recent date but luigi knew him by repute he knew that the shoemaking business was a mask barto had been a soldier a schoolmaster twice an exile a conspirator since the day when the austrians had the two fine apples of pomona lombardy and venice given them as fruits of peace luigi remembered how he had snapped his fingers at the name of barto rizzo there was no despising him now he could only arrive at a peaceful contemplation of barto rizzo's character by determining to tell all and since that seemed little more than he knew he got back to the leather smelling chamber which was either the same or purposely rendered exactly similar to the one he had first been led to at the end of a leaden hour barto rizzo returned now to recommence he said drink before you speak if your tongue is dry luigi thrust aside the mention of liquor it seemed to him that by doing so he propitiated that ill conceived divinity called virtue who lived in the open air and desired men to drink water barto rizzo evidently understood the kind of man he was schooling to his service did that austrian officer who is an englishman acquainted with the signor antonio pericles meet the lady his sister on the motterone luigi answered promptly yes did the signorina vittoria speak to the lady no not a word no not one communication to her no she sat under her straw hat she concealed her face she sat like a naughty angry girl did she speak to the officer not she did she see him of course she did as if a woman's eyes couldn't see through straw plait barto paused calculatingly eye on victim the signorina vittoria he resumed has engaged to sing on the night of the fifteenth has she a twitching of luigi's muscles showed that he apprehended a necessary straining of his invention on another tack on the night of the fifteenth signor barto rizzo that's the night of her first appearance oh yes to sing a particular song lots of them ay ay barto took him by the shoulder and pressed him into his seat till he howled saying now there's a slate and a pencil expect me at the end of two hours this time next time it will be four then eight then sixteen find out how many hours that will be at the sixteenth examination luigi flew at the torturer and stuck at the length of his straightened arm where he wriggled refusing to listen to the explanation of barto's system which was that in cases where every fresh examination taught him more they were continued after regularly lengthening intervals that might extend from the sowing of seed to the ripening of grain when all's delivered said barto then we begin to correct discrepancies i expect he added you and i will have done before a week's out a week luigi shouted here's my stomach already leaping like a fish at the smell of this hole you brute bear it's a smell of bones it turns my inside with a spoon may the devil seize you when you're sleeping you shan't go i'll tell you everything everything i can't tell you anything more than i have told you she gave me a cigarette there now you know gave me a cigarette a cigarette i smoked it there your faithful servant she gave you a cigarette and you smoked it ha said barto rizzo who appeared to see something to weigh even in that small fact the english lady gave you the cigarette luigi nodded yes pertinacious in deception yes he repeated the english lady that was the person what's the use of your skewering me with your eyes i perceive that you have never travelled my luigi said barto i am afraid we shall not part so early as i had supposed i double the dose and return to you in four hours' time luigi threw himself flat on the ground shrieking that he was ready to tell everything anything not even the apparent desperation of his circumstances could teach him that a promise to tell the truth was a more direct way of speaking indeed the hitting of the truth would have seemed to him a sort of artful archery the burden of which should devolve upon the questioner whom he supplied with the relation of everything and anything all through a night luigi's lesson continued in the morning he was still breaking out in small and purposeless lies but barto rizzo had accomplished his two objects that of squeezing him and that of subjecting his imagination luigi confessed owing to a singular recovery of his memory the gift of the cigarette as coming from the signorina vittoria what did it matter if she did give him a cigarette you adore her for it said barto may the virgin sweep the floor of heaven into her lap interjected luigi she is a good patriot are you one barto asked certainly i am then i shall have to suspect you for the good of your country luigi could not see the deduction he was incapable of guessing that it might apply forcibly to vittoria who had undertaken a grave perilous and imminent work nothing but the spontaneous desire to elude the pursuit of a questioner had at first instigated his baffling of barto rizzo until fearing the dark square man himself he feared him dimly for vittoria's sake he could not have said why she was a good patriot wherefore the reason for wishing to know more of her barto rizzo had compelled him at last to furnish a narrative of the events of that day on the motterone and finding himself at sea luigi struck out boldly and swam as well as he could barto disentangled one succinct thread of incidents vittoria had been commissioned by the chief to sing on the night of the fifteenth she had subsequently without speaking to any of the english party or revealing her features keeping them beautifully hidden luigi said with unaccountable enthusiasm written a warning to them that they were to avoid milan the paper on which the warning had been written was found by the english when he was the only italian on the height lying thereto observe and note things in the service of barto rizzo the writing was english but when one of the english ladies who wore her hair like a planed shred of wood like a torn vine like a kite with two tails like luxury at the banquet ready to tumble over marble shoulders an illustration drawn probably from luigi's study of some allegorical picture he was at a loss to describe the foreign female head dress when this lady had read the writing she exclaimed that it was the hand of her emilia and soon after she addressed luigi in english then in french then in barricade italian by which phrase luigi meant that the italian words were there but did not present their proper smooth footing for his understanding and strove to obtain information from him concerning the signorina and also concerning the chances that milan would be an agitated city luigi assured her that milan was the peacefullest of cities a pure babe he admitted his acquaintance with the signorina vittoria campa and denied her being any longer the emilia alessandra belloni of the english lady the latter had partly retained him in her service having given him directions to call at her hotel in milan and help her to communicate with her old friend i present myself to her to morrow friday said luigi that's to day said barto luigi clapped his hand to his cheek crying wofully you've drawn beastly gaoler a night out of my life like an old jaw tooth there's day two or three fathoms above us said barto and hot coffee is coming down i believe i've been stewing in a pot while the moon looked so cool luigi groaned and touched up along the sleeves of his arms that which he fancied he instantaneously felt the coffee was brought by the heavy browed young woman before she quitted the place barto desired her to cast her eyes on luigi and say whether she thought she should know him again she scarcely glanced and gave answer with a shrug of the shoulders as she retired luigi at the time was drinking he rose he was about to speak but yawned instead the woman's carelessly dropped upper eyelids seemed to him to be reading him through a dozen of his contortions and disguises and checked the idea of liberty which he associated with getting to the daylight but it is worth the money shouted barto rizzo with a splendid divination of his thought you skulker are you not paid and fattened to do business which you've only to remember and it'll honey your legs in purgatory you're the shooting dog of that greek and you nose about the bushes for his birds and who cares if any fellow just for exercise shoots a dagger a yard from his wrist and sticks you in the back you serve me and there's pay for you brothers doctors nurses friends a tight blanket if you fall from a housetop and masses for your soul when your hour strikes the treacherous cur lies rotting in a ditch do you conceive that when i employ you i am in your power your intelligence will open gradually do you know that here in this house i can conceal fifty men and leave the door open to the croats to find them i tell you now you are free go forth you go alone no one touches you ten years hence a skeleton is found with an english letter on its ribs oh stop signor barto and be a blessed man interposed luigi doubling and wriggling in a posture that appeared as if he were shaking negatives from the elbows of his crossed arms stop how did you know of a letter i forgot i have seen the english lady at her hotel i was carrying the signorina's answer when i thought barto rizzo calls me and i came like a lamb and what does it matter she is a good patriot you are a good patriot here it is consider my reputation do and be careful with the wax barto drew a long breath the mention of the english letter had been a shot in the dark the result corroborated his devotional belief in the unerringness of his own powerful intuition he had guessed the case or hardly even guessed it merely stated it to horrify luigi the letter was placed in his hands and he sat as strongly thrilled by emotion under the mask of his hard face as a lover hearing music i read english he remarked after he had drawn the seal three or four times slowly over the lamp the green wax bubbled and unsnapped vittoria had written the following lines in reply to her old english friend forgive me and do not ask to see me until we have passed the fifteenth of the month you will see me that night at la scala i wish to embrace you but i am miserable to think of your being in milan i cannot yet tell you where my residence is i have not met your brother if he writes to me it will make me happy but i refuse to see him i will explain to him why let him not try to see me let him send by this messenger i hope he will contrive to be out of milan all this month pray let me influence you to go for a time i write coldly i am tired and forget my english i do not forget my friends i have you close against my heart if it were prudent and it involved me alone i would come to you without a moment's loss of time do know that i am not changed and am your affectionate emilia when barto rizzo had finished reading he went from the chamber and blew his voice into what luigi supposed to be a hollow tube this letter he said coming back is a repetition of the signorina vittoria's warning to her friends on the motterone the english lady's brother who is in the austrian service was there you say luigi considered that having lately been believed in he could not afford to look untruthful and replied with a sprightly assuredly he was there and he read the writing on the paper assuredly right out loud between puff puff of his cigar his name is lieutenant pierson did not antonio pericles tell you his name he will write to her you will be the bearer of his letter to the signorina i must see her reply she is a good patriot so am i so are you good patriots must be prudent i tell you i must see her reply to this lieutenant pierson barto stuck his thumb and finger astride luigi's shoulder and began rocking him gently with a horrible meditative expression you will have to accomplish this my luigi all fair excuses will be made if you fail generally this you must do keep upright while i am speaking to you the excuses will be made but i not you must make them bear that in mind is there any person whom you my luigi like best in the world it was a winning question and though luigi was not the dupe of its insinuating gentleness he answered the little girl who carries flowers every morning to the caffe la scala ah the little girl who carries flowers every morning to the caffe la scala now my luigi you may fail me and i may pardon you listen attentively if you are false if you are guilty of one piece of treachery do you see you can't help slipping but you can help jumping restrain yourself from jumping that's all if you are guilty of treachery hurry at once straight off to the little girl who carries flowers every morning to the caffe la scala go to her take her by the two cheeks kiss her say to her 'addio addio' for by the thunder of heaven you will never see her more luigi was rocked forward and back while barto spoke in level tones till the voice dropped into its vast hollow when barto held him fast a moment and hurled him away by the simple lifting of his hand the woman appeared and bound luigi's eyes barto did not utter another word on his journey back to daylight luigi comforted himself by muttering oaths that he would never again enter into this trap as soon as his eyes were unbandaged he laughed and sang and tossed a compliment from his finger tips to the savage browed beauty pretended that he had got an armful and that his heart was touched by the ecstasy and sang again oh barto barto my boot is sadly worn the toe is seen etc half way down the stanzas without his knowing it and before he had quitted the court he had sunk into songless gloom brooding on the scenes of the night however free he might be in body his imagination was captive to barto rizzo he was no luckier than a bird for whom the cage is open that it may feel the more keenly with its little taste of liberty that it is tied by the leg chapter viii the importance of the matters extracted from luigi does not lie on the surface it will have to be seen through barto rizzo's mind this man regarded himself as the mainspring of the conspiracy specially its guardian its wakeful argus he had conspired sleeplessly for thirty years so long that having no ideal reserve in his nature conspiracy had become his professional occupation the wheel which it was his business to roll he was above jealousy he was above vanity no one outstripping him cast a bad colour on him nor did he object to bow to another as his superior but he was prepared to suspect every one of insincerity and of faithlessness and being the master of the machinery of the plots he was ready upon a whispered justification to despise the orders of his leader and act by his own light in blunt disobedience for it was his belief that while others speculated he knew all he knew where the plots had failed he knew the man who had bent and doubled in the patriotic cause perfect arrangements are crowned with perfect success unless there is an imperfection of the instruments for the cause is blessed by all superior agencies such was his governing idea his arrangements had always been perfect hence the deduction was a denunciation of some one particular person he pointed out the traitor here the traitor there and in one or two cases he did so with a mildness that made those fret at their beards vaguely who understood his character barto rizzo was it was said born in a village near forli in the dominions of the pope according to the rumour he was the child of a veiled woman and a cowled paternity if not an offender against government he was at least a wanderer early in life none could accuse him of personal ambition he boasted that he had served as a common soldier with the italian contingent furnished by eugene to the moscow campaign he showed scars of old wounds brown spots and blue spots and twisted twine of white skin dotting the wrist the neck the calf the ankle and looking up from them he slapped them proudly nor had he personal animosities of any kind one sharp scar which he called his shoulder knot he owed to the knife of a friend by name sarpo who had things ready to betray him and struck him in anticipation of that tremendous moment of surprise and wrath when the awakened victim frequently is nerved with devil's strength but striking like a novice on the bone the stilet stuck there and barto coolly got him to point the outlet of escape and walked off carrying the blade where the terrified assassin had planted it this sarpo had become a tradesman in milan a bookseller and small printer and he was unmolested barto said of him that he was as bad as a few odd persons thought himself to be and had in him the making of a great traitor but that as sarpo hated him and had sought to be rid of him for private reasons only it was a pity to waste on such a fellow steel that should serve the cause while i live said barto my enemies have a tolerably active conscience the absence of personal animosity in him was not due to magnanimity he doubted the patriotism of all booksellers he had been twice betrayed by women he never attempted to be revenged on them but he doubted the patriotism of all women use them keep eye on them he said in venice he had conspired when he was living there as the clerk of a notary in bologna subsequently while earning his bread as a petty schoolmaster his evasions both of papal sbirri and the austrian polizia furnished instances of astonishing audacity that made his name a byword for mastery in the hour of peril his residence in milan now after seven years of exile in england and switzerland was an act of pointed defiance incomprehensible to his own party and only to be explained by the prevalent belief that the authorities feared to provoke a collision with the people by laying hands on him they had only once made a visitation to his house and appeared to be satisfied at not finding him at that period austria was simulating benevolence in her lombardic provinces with the half degree of persuasive earnestness which makes a government lax in its vigilance and leaves it simply open to the charge of effeteness there were contradictory rumours as to whether his house had ever been visited by the polizia but it was a legible fact that his name was on the window and it was understood that he was not without elusive contrivances in the event of the authorities declaring war against him of the nature of these contrivances luigi had just learnt something he had heard barto rizzo called 'the miner' and 'the great cat' and he now comprehended a little of the quality of his employer he had entered a very different service from that of the signor antonio pericles who paid him for nothing more than to keep eye on vittoria and recount her goings in and out for what absolute object he was unaware but that it was not for a political one he was certain cursed be the day when the lust of gold made me open my hand to barto rizzo he thought and could only reflect that life is short and gold is sweet and that he was in the claws of the great cat he had met barto in a wine shop he cursed the habit which led him to call at that shop the thirst which tempted him to drink the ear which had been seduced to listen yet as all his expenses had been paid in advance and his reward at the instant of his application for it and as the signorina and barto were both good patriots and he luigi was a good patriot what harm could be done to her both she and barto had stamped their different impressions on his waxen nature he reconciled his service to them separately by the exclamation that they were both good patriots the plot for the rising in milan city was two months old it comprised some of the nobles of the city and enjoyed the good wishes of the greater part of them whose payment of fifty to sixty per cent to the government on the revenue of their estates was sufficient reason for a desire to change masters positively though they might detest republicanism and dread the shadow of anarchy these looked hopefully to charles albert their motive was to rise or to countenance a rising and summon the ambitious sardinian monarch with such assurances of devotion that a piedmontese army would be at the gates when the banner of austria was in the dust among the most active members of the prospectively insurgent aristocracy of milan was count medole a young nobleman of vast wealth and possessed of a reliance on his powers of mind that induced him to take a prominent part in the opening deliberations and speedily necessitated his hire of the friendly offices of one who could supply him with facts with suggestions with counsel with fortitude with everything to strengthen his pretensions to the leadership excepting money he discovered his man in barto rizzo who quitted the ranks of the republican section to serve him and wield a tool for his own party by the help of agostino balderini carlo ammiani and others the aristocratic and the republican sections of the conspiracy were brought near enough together to permit of a common action between them though the maintaining of such harmony demanded an extreme and tireless delicacy of management the presence of the chief whom we have seen on the motterone was claimed by other cities of italy unto him solely did barto rizzo yield thorough adhesion he being absent from milan barto undertook to represent him and carry out his views how far he was entitled to do so may be guessed when it is stated that on the ground of his general contempt for women he objected to the proposition that vittoria should give the signal the proposition was agostino's count medole barto and agostino discussed it secretly barto held resolutely against it until agostino thrust a sly handed letter into his fingers and let him know that previous to any consultation on the subject he had gained the consent of his chief barto then fell silent he despatched his new spy luigi to the motterone more for the purpose of giving him a schooling on the expedition and on his return from it and so getting hand and brain and soul service out of him he expected no such a report of vittoria's indiscretion as luigi had spiced with his one foolish lie that she should tell the relatives of an austrian officer that milan was soon to be a dangerous place for them and that she should write it on paper and leave it for the officer to read left her according to barto's reading of her open to the alternative charges of imbecility or of treachery her letter to the english lady the austrian officer's sister was an exaggeration of the offence but lent it more the look of heedless folly the point was to obtain sight of her letter to the austrian officer himself barto was baffled during a course of anxious days that led closely up to the fifteenth she had written no letter lieutenant pierson the officer in question had ridden into the city once from verona and had called upon antonio pericles to extract her address from him the greek had denied that she was in milan luigi could tell no more he described the officer's personal appearance by saying that he was a recognizable englishman in austrian dragoon uniform white tunic white helmet brown moustache ay and eh and oh and ah coming frequently from his mouth that he stood square while speaking and seemed to like his own smile an extraordinary touch of portraiture or else a scoff at insular self satisfaction at any rate it commended itself to the memory barto dismissed him telling him to be daily in attendance on the english lady barto rizzo's respect for the chief was at war with his intense conviction that a blow should be struck at vittoria even upon the narrow information which he possessed twice betrayed his dreams and haunting thoughts cried shall a woman betray you thrice in his imagination he stood identified with italy the betrayal of one meant that of both falling into a deep reflection barto counted over his hours of conspiracy he counted the chief's comparing the two sets of figures he discovered that as he had suspected he was the elder in the patriotic work therefore if he bowed his head to the chief it was a voluntary act a form of respect and not the surrendering of his judgement he was on the spot the chief was absent barto reasoned that the chief could have had no experience of women seeing that he was ready to trust in them do i trust to my pigeon my sling stone he said jovially to the thickbrowed splendidly ruddy young woman who was his wife do i trust her not half a morsel of her this young woman a peasant woman of remarkable personal attractions served him with the fidelity of a fascinated animal and the dumbness of a wooden vessel she could have hanged him had it pleased her she had all his secrets but it was not vain speaking on barto rizzo's part he was master of her will and on the occasions when he showed that he did not trust her he was careful at the same time to shock and subdue her senses her report of vittoria was that she went to the house of the signora laura piaveni widow of the latest heroic son of milan and to that of the maestro rocco ricci to no other it was also luigi's report she's true enough the woman said evidently permitting herself to entertain an opinion a sign that she required fresh schooling so are you said barto and eyed her in a way that made her ask now what's for me to do he thought awhile you will see the colonel tell him to come in corporal's uniform what's the little wretch twisting her body for shan't i embrace her presently if she's obedient send to the polizia you believe your husband is in the city and will visit you in disguise at the corporal's hour they seize him they also examine the house up to the point where we seal it your object is to learn whether the austrians are moving men upon milan if they are i learn something when the house has been examined our court here will have rest for a good month ahead and it suits me not to be disturbed do this and we will have a red wine evening in the house shut up alone my snake my pepper flower it happened that luigi was entering the court to keep an appointment with barto when he saw a handful of the polizia burst into the house and drag out a soldier who was in the uniform as he guessed it to be of the prohaska regiment the soldier struggled and offered money to them luigi could not help shouting you fools don't you see he's an officer two of them took their captive aside the rest made a search through the house while they were doing so luigi saw barto rizzo's face at the windows of the house opposite he clamoured at the door but barto was denied to him there when the polizia had gone from the court he was admitted and allowed to look into every room not finding him he said barto rizzo does not keep his appointments then the same words were repeated in his ear when he had left the court and was in the street running parallel with it barto rizzo does not keep his appointments then it was barto who smacked him on the back and spoke out his own name with brown faced laughter in the bustling street luigi was so impressed by his cunning and his recklessness that he at once told him more than he wished to tell the austrian officer was with his sister and had written to the signorina and luigi had delivered the letter but the signorina was at the maestro's rocco ricci's and there was no answer the officer was leaving for verona in the morning after telling so much luigi drew back feeling that he had given barto his full measure and owed to the signorina what remained barto probably read nothing of the mind of his spy but understood that it was a moment for distrust of him vittoria and her mother lodged at the house of one zotti a confectioner dwelling between the duomo and la scala luigi at barto's bidding left word with zotti that he would call for the signorina's answer to a certain letter about sunrise i promised my rosellina my poppyheaded sipper a red wine evening or i would hold this fellow under my eye till the light comes thought barto misgivingly and let him go luigi slouched about the english lady's hotel at nightfall her brother came forth luigi directed him to be in the square of the duomo by sunrise and slipped from his hold the officer ran after him some distance she can't say i was false to her now said luigi dancing with nervous ecstasy at sunrise barto rizzo was standing under the shadow of the duomo luigi passed him and went to zotti's house where the letter was placed in his hand and the door shut in his face barto rushed to him but luigi with a vixenish countenance standing like a humped cat hissed would you destroy my reputation and have it seen that i deliver up letters under the noses of the writers to the wrong persons ha pestilence he ran barto following him they were crossed by the officer on horseback who challenged luigi to give up the letter which was very plainly being thrust from his hand into his breast the officer found it no difficult matter to catch him and pluck the letter from him he opened it reading it on the jog of the saddle as he cantered off luigi turned in a terror of expostulation to ward barto's wrath barto looked at him hard while he noted the matter down on the tablet of an ivory book all he said was i have that letter stamping the assertion with an oath half an hour later luigi saw barto in the saddle tight legged about a rusty beast evidently bound for the south eastern gate his brows set like a black wind blessings on his going thought luigi and sang one of his street songs o lemons lemons what a taste you leave in the mouth i desire you i love you but when i suck you i'm all caught up in a bundle and turn to water like a wry faced fountain why not be satisfied by a sniff at the blossoms there's gratification why did you grow up from the precious little sweet chuck that you were marietta lemons o lemons such a thing as a decent appetite is not known after sucking at you his natural horror of a resolute man more than fear of which he had no recollection in the sunny piazza made him shiver and gave his tongue an acid taste at the prospect of ever meeting barto rizzo again there was the prospect also that he might never meet him again etext editor's bookmarks footing up a mountain corrects the notion that i am important he saw far and he grasped ends beyond obstacles poetry does much upon reflection but it has to ripen within you there is comfort in exercise even for an ancient creature such as i am
