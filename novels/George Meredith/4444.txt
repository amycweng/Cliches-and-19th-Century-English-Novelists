a goose chapter i i am a subject of contention one midnight of a winter month the sleepers in riversley grange were awakened by a ringing of the outer bell and blows upon the great hall doors squire beltham was master there the other members of the household were his daughter dorothy beltham a married daughter mrs richmond benjamin sewis an old halfcaste butler various domestic servants and a little boy christened harry lepel richmond the squires grandson riversley grange lay in a rich watered hollow of the hampshire heathcountry a lonely circle of enclosed brook and pasture within view of some of its dependent farms but out of hail of them or any dwelling except the stables and the headgardeners cottage traditions of audacious highwaymen together with the gloomy surrounding firscenery kept it alive to fears of solitude and the night and there was that in the determined violence of the knocks and repeated bellpeals which assured all those who had ever listened in the servants hall to prognostications of a possible night attack that the robbers had come at last most awfully a crowd of maids gathered along the upper corridor of the main body of the building two or three footmen hung lower down bold in attitude suddenly the noise ended and soon after the voice of old sewis commanded them to scatter away to their beds whereupon the footmen took agile leaps to the post of danger while the women in whose bosoms intense curiosity now supplanted terror proceeded to a vacant room overlooking the front entrance and spied from the window meanwhile sewis stood by his masters bedside the squire was a hunter of the old sort a hard rider deep drinker and heavy slumberer before venturing to shake his arm sewis struck a light and flashed it over the squires eyelids to make the task of rousing him easier at the first touch the squire sprang up swearing by his lord harry he had just dreamed of fire and muttering of buckets sewis youre the man are you where has it broken out no sir no fire said sewis you be cool sir cool sir confound it sewis havent i heard a whole town of steeples at work i dont sleep so thick but i can hear you dog fellow comes here gives me a start tells me to be cool what the deuce nobody hurt then all right the squire had fallen back on his pillow and was relapsing to sleep sewis spoke impressively theres a gentleman downstairs a gentleman downstairs sir he has come rather late gentleman downstairs come rather late the squire recapitulated the intelligence to possess it thoroughly rather late eh oh shove him into a bed and give him hot brandy and water and be hanged to him sewis had the office of tempering a severely distasteful announcement to the squire he resumed the gentleman doesnt talk of staying that is not his business it s rather late for him to arrive rather late roared the squire why whats it oclock reaching a hand to the watch over his head he caught sight of the unearthly hour a quarter to two gentleman downstairs cant be that infernal apothecary who broke s engagement to dine with me last night by george if it is ill souse him ill drench him from head to heel as though the rascal d been drawn through the duckpond two oclock in the morning why the mans drunk tell him im a magistrate and ill commit him deuce take him give him fourteen days for a sot another fourteen for impudence ive given a month fore now comes to me a justice of the peaceman s mad tell him hes in peril of a lunatic asylum and doesnt talk of staying lift him out o the house on the top o your boot sewis and say it s mine you ve my leave sewis withdrew a step from the bedside at a safe distance he fronted his master steadily almost admonishingly it s mr richmond sir he said mr the squire checked his breath that was a name never uttered at the grange the scoundrel he inquired harshly half in a tone of one assuring himself and his rigid dropped jaw shut the fact had to be denied or affirmed instantly and sewis was silent grasping his bedclothes in a lump the squire cried downstairs downstairs sewis youve admitted him into my house no sir you have he is not in the house sir you have how did you speak to him then out of my window sir what place here is the scoundrel soiling now he is on the doorstep outside the house outside is he and the doors locked yes sir let him rot there by this time the midnight visitors patience had become exhausted a renewal of his clamour for immediate attention fell on the squires ear amazing him to stupefaction at such challengeing insolence hand me my breeches he called to sewis i cant think brisk out of my breeches sewis held the garment ready the squire jumped from the bed fuming speechlessly chafing at gaiters and braces cravat and coat and allowed his buttons to be fitted neatly on his calves the hammering at the hall door and plucking at the bell going on without intermission he wore the aspect of one who assumes a forced composure under the infliction of outrages on his character in a court of law where he must of necessity listen and lock his boiling replies within his indignant bosom now sewis now my horsewhip he remarked as if it had been a simple adjunct of his equipment your hat sir my horsewhip i said your hat is in the hall sewis observed gravely i asked you for my horsewhip that is not to be found anywhere said sewis the squire was diverted from his objurgations against this piece of servitorial defiance by his daughter dorothys timid appeal for permission to come in sewis left the room presently the squire descended fully clad and breathing sharply from his nostrils servants were warned off out of hearing none but sewis stood by the squire himself unbolted the door and threw it open to the limit of the chain whos there he demanded a response followed promptly from outside i take you to be mr harry lepel beltham correct me if i err accept my apologies for disturbing you at a late hour of the night i pray your name is plain augustus fitzgeorge roy richmond at this moment mr beltham you will recognize me better by opening your door entirely voices are deceptive you were born a gentleman mr beltham and will not reduce me to request you to behave like one i am now in the position as it were of addressing a badger in his den it is on both sides unsatisfactory it reflects egregious discredit upon you the householder the squire hastily bade sewis see that the passages to the sleeping apartments were barred and flung the great chain loose he was acting under strong control of his temper it was a quiet grey night and as the doors flew open a largelybuilt man dressed in a highcollared greatcoat and fashionable hat of the time stood clearly defined to view he carried a light cane with the point of the silver handle against his under lip there was nothing formidable in his appearance and his manner was affectedly affable he lifted his hat as soon as he found himself face to face with the squire disclosing a partially bald head though his whiskering was luxuriant and a robust condition of manhood was indicated by his erect attitude and the immense swell of his furred greatcoat at the chest his features were exceedingly frank and cheerful from his superior height he was enabled to look down quite royally on the man whose repose he had disturbed the following conversation passed between them you now behold who it is mr beltham that acknowledges to the misfortune of arousing you at an unseemly hourunbetimes as our gossips in mother saxon might sayand with profound regret sir though my habit is to take it lightly have you any accomplices lurking about here i am alone what s your business i have no business you have no business to be here no i ask you what s the object of your visit permit me first to speak of the cause of my protracted arrival sir the ridicule of casting it on the postboys will strike you mr beltham as it does me nevertheless i must do it i have no resource owing to a rascal of the genus incontinent in liquor i have this night walked seven miles from ewling my complaint against him is not on my own account what brought you here at all can you ask me i ask you what brought you to my house at all true i might have slept at ewling why didnt you for the reason mr beltham which brought me here originally i could not waitnot a single minute so far advanced to the neighbourhood i would not be retarded and i came on i crave your excuses for the hour of my arrival the grounds for my coming at all you will very well understand and you will applaud me when i declare to you that i come to her penitent to exculpate myself certainly but despising self justification i love my wife mr beltham yes hear me out sir i can point to my unhappy star and say blame that more than me that star of my birth and most disastrous fortunes should plead on my behalf to you to my wife at least it will youve come to see my daughter marian have you my wife sir you dont cross my threshold while i live you compel her to come out to me she stays where she is poor wretch till the grave takes her youve done your worst be off mr beltham i am not to be restrained from the sight of my wife scamp by no scurrilous epithets from a man i am bound to respect will i be deterred or exasperated damned scamp i say the squire having exploded his wrath gave it free way ive stopped my tongue all this while before a scoundrel d corkscrew the bestbottled temper right or left go where you will one end o the world to the other by god and here s a scoundrel stinks of villany and ive proclaimed him ware my gates as a common trespasser and deserves hanging if ever rook did nailed hard and fast to my barn doors comes here for my daughter when he got her by stealing her scenting his carcase and talking bout his birth singing what not sort o foreign mewin stuff and she found him out a liar and a beast by god and she turned home my doors are open to my flesh and blood and here she halts i say gainst the law if the laws against me shes crazed youve made her mad she knows none of us not even her boy be off youve done your worst the lights gone clean out in her and hear me you richmond or roy or whatever you call yourself i tell you i thank the lord she has lost her senses see her or not you ve no hold on her and see her you shant while i go by the name of a man mr richmond succeeded in preserving an air of serious deliberation under the torrent of this tremendous outburst which was marked by scarce a pause in the delivery he said my wife deranged i might presume it too truly an inherited disease do you trifle with me sir her reason unseated and can you pretend to the right of dividing us if this be as you sayoh ten thousand times the stronger my claim my absolute claim to cherish her make way for me mr beltham i solicit humbly the holiest privilege sorrow can crave of humanity my wife my wife make way for me sir his figure was bent to advance the squire shouted an order to sewis to run round to the stables and slip the dogs loose is it your final decision mr richmond asked damn your fine words yes it is i keep my flock clear of a foul sheep mr beltham i implore you be merciful i submit to any conditions only let me see her i will walk the park till morning but say that an interview shall be granted in the morning frankly sir it is not my intention to employ force i throw myself utterly on your mercy i love the woman i have much to repent of i see her and i go but once i must see her so far i also speak positively speak as positively as you like said the squire by the laws of nature and the laws of man marian richmond is mine to support and comfort and none can hinder me mr beltham none if i resolve to take her to myself cant they said the squire a curse be on him heavens lightnings descend on him who keeps husband from wife in calamity the squire whistled for his dogs as if wounded to the quick by this coldblooded action mr richmond stood to his fullest height nor sir on my application during tomorrows daylight shall i see her nor sir on your applicationthe squire drawled in uncontrollable mimicking contempt of the others florid forms of speech ending in his own styleno you wont you claim a paternal right to refuse me my wife is your child good i wish to see my son on that point the squire was equally decided you cant hes asleep i insist nonsense i tell you hes abed and asleep i repeat i insist when the boys fast asleep man the boy is my flesh and blood you have spoken for your daughter i speak for my son i will see him though i have to batter at your doors till sunrise some minutes later the boy was taken out of his bed by his aunt dorothy who dressed him by the dark windowlight crying bitterly while she said hush hush and fastened on his small garments between tender huggings of his body and kissings of his cheeks he was told that he had nothing to be afraid of a gentleman wanted to see him nothing more whether the gentleman was a good gentleman and not a robber he could not learn but his aunt dorothy having wrapped him warm in shawl and comforter and tremblingly tied his hatstrings under his chin assured him with convulsive caresses that it would soon be over and he would soon be lying again snug and happy in his dear little bed she handed him to sewis on the stairs keeping his fingers for an instant to kiss them after which old sewis the lord of the pantry where all sweet things were stored deposited him on the floor of the hall and he found himself facing the man of the night it appeared to him that the stranger was of enormous size like the giants of fairy books for as he stood a little out of the doorway there was a peep of night sky and trees behind him and the trees looked very much smaller and hardly any sky was to be seen except over his shoulders the squire seized one of the boys hands to present him and retain him at the same time but the stranger plucked him from his grandfathers hold and swinging him high exclaimed here he is this is harry richmond he has grown a grenadier kiss the little chap and back to bed with him growled the squire the boy was heartily kissed and asked if he had forgotten his papa he replied that he had no papa he had a mama and a grandpapa the stranger gave a deep groan you see what you have done you have cut me off from my own he said terribly to the squire but tried immediately to soothe the urchin with nursery talk and the pats on the shoulder which encourage a little boy to grow fast and tall four years of separation he resumed and my son taught to think that he has no father by heavens it is infamous it is a curst piece of inhumanity mr beltham if i do not see my wife i carry off my son you may ask till youre hoarse you shall never see her in this house while i am here to command said the squire very well then harry richmond changes homes i take him the affair is concluded you take him from his mother the squire sang out you swear to me she has lost her wits she cannot suffer i can i shall not expect from you mr beltham the minutest particle of comprehension of a fathers feelings you are earthy you are an animal the squire saw that he was about to lift the boy and said stop never mind that stop look at the case you can call again tomorrow and you can see me and talk it over shall i see my wife no you shant you remain faithful to your word sir do you i do then i do similarly what stop not to take a child like that out of a comfortable house at night in winter man oh the night is temperate and warm he shall not remain in a house where his father is dishonoured stop not a bit of it cried the squire no one speaks of you i give you my word you re never mentioned by man woman or child in the house silence concerning a father insinuates dishonour mr beltham damn your fine speeches and keep your blackguardly hands off that boy the squire thundered mind if you take him he goes for good he doesnt get a penny from me if you have the bringing of him up youve done for him if you decide that way he may stand here a beggar in a stolen coat like you and i wont own him here harry come to me come to your grandad mr richmond caught the boy just when he was turning to run that gentleman he said pointing to the squire is your grandpapa i am your papa you must learn at any cost to know and love your papa if i call for you tomorrow or next day they will have played tricks with harry richmond and hid him mr beltham i request you for the final time to accord me your promise observe i accept your promisethat i shall at my demand tomorrow or the next day obtain an interview with my wife the squire coughed out an emphatic never and fortified it with an oath as he repeated it upon a fuller breath sir i will condescend to entreat you to grant this permission said mr richmond urgently no never i wont rejoined the squire red in the face from a fit of angry coughing i wont but stop put down that boy listen to me you richmond ill tell you what ill do i llif you swear on a bible like a cadger before a bench of magistrates youll never show your face within a circuit o ten miles hereabouts and wont trouble the boy if you meet him or my daughter or me or any one of ushark ye ill do this let go the boy and ill give ye five hundredill give ye a cheque on my banker for a thousand pounds and hark me out you do this you swear as i said on the servants bible in the presence of my butler and me strike you dead as ananias and t other one if you dont keep to it do that now

it a bargain will you swear dont and the boys a beggar hes a stranger here as much as you take him and by the lord you ruin him there now never mind stay down with him hes got a cold already ought to be in his bed let the boy down you offer me money mr richmond answered that is one of the indignities belonging to a connection with a man like you you would have me sell my son to see my afflicted wife i would forfeit my hearts yearnings for my son your money sir i toss to the winds and i am under the necessity of informing you that i despise and loathe you i shrink from the thought of exposing my son to your besotted selfish example the boy is mine i have him and he shall traverse the wilderness with me by heaven his destiny is brilliant he shall be hailed for what he is the rightful claimant of a place among the proudest in the land and mark me mr beltham obstinate sensual old man that you are i take the boy and i consecrate my life to the duty of establishing him in his proper rank and station and there if you live and i live you shall behold him and bow your grovelling pigs head to the earth and bemoan the day by heaven when youa common country squire a man of no origin a creature with whose blood we have mixed oursand he is stoneblind to the honour conferred on himwhen you in your besotted stupidity threatened to disinherit harry richmond the door slammed violently on such further speech as he had in him to utter he seemed at first astonished but finding the terrified boy about to sob he drew a pretty box from one of his pockets and thrust a delicious sweetmeat between the whimpering lips then after some moments of irresolution during which he struck his chest soundingly and gazed down talked alternately to himself and the boy and cast his eyes along the windows of the house he at last dropped on one knee and swaddled the boy in the folds of the shawl raising him in a business like way he settled him on an arm and stepped briskly across gravelwalk and lawn like a horse to whose neck a smart touch of the whip has been applied the soft mild night had a moon behind it somewhere and here and there a lightblue space of sky showed small rayless stars the breeze smelt fresh of roots and heath it was more a maynight than one of february so strange an aspect had all these quiet hilllines and larch and fir tree tops in the halfdark stillness that the boys terrors were overlaid and almost subdued by his wonderment he had never before been out in the night and he must have feared to cry in it for his sobs were not loud on a rise of the parkroad where a firplantation began he heard his name called faintly from the house by a womans voice that he knew to be his aunt dorothys it came after him only once harry richmond but he was soon out of hearing beyond the park among the hollows that run dipping for miles beside the great highroad toward london sometimes his father whistled to him or held him high and nodded a salutation to him as though they had just discovered one another and his perpetual accessibility to the influences of spicy sugarplums notwithstanding his grief caused his father to prognosticate hopefully of his future wisdom so when obedient to command he had given his father a kiss the boy fell asleep on his shoulder ceasing to know that he was a wandering infant and if i remember rightly he dreamed he was in a ship of cinnamonwood upon a sea that rolled mighty but smooth immense broad waves and tore thing from thing without a sound or a hurt chapter ii an adventure on my own account that night stands up without any clear traces about it or near it like the brazen castle of romance round which the seatide flows my father must have borne me miles along the road he must have procured food for me i have an idea of feeling a damp forehead and drinking new milk and byandby hearing a roar of voices or vehicles and seeing a dog that went alone through crowded streets without a master doing as he pleased and stopping every other dog he met he took his turning and my father and i took ours we were in a house that to my senses had the smell of dark corners in a street where all the housedoors were painted black and shut with a bang italian organmen and milkmen paraded the street regularly and made it sound hollow to their music milk and no cows anywhere numbers of people and no acquaintances among them my thoughts were occupied by the singularity of such things my father could soon make me forget that i was transplanted he could act dog tame rabbit fox pony and a whole nursery collection alive but he was sometimes absent for days and i was not of a temper to be on friendly terms with those who were unable to captivate my imagination as he had done when he was at home i rode him all round the room and upstairs to bed i lashed him with a whip till he frightened me so real was his barking if i said menagerie he became a caravan of wild beasts i undid a button of his waistcoat and it was a lion that made a spring roaring at me i pulled his coattails and off i went tugging at an old bear that swung a hind leg as he turned in the queerest way and then sat up and beating his breast sent out a mewmoan our room was richer to me than all the grange while these performances were going forward his monkey was almost as wonderful as his bear only he was too big for it and was obliged to aim at reality in his representation of this animal by means of a number of breakages a defect that brought our landlady on the scene the enchantment of my fathers companionship caused me to suffer proportionately in his absence during that period of solitude my nursemaid had to order me to play and i would stumble about and squat in the middle of the floor struck suddenly by the marvel of the difference between my present and my other home my father entered into arrangements with a punch and judy man for him to pay me regular morning visits opposite our window yet here again his genius defeated his kind intentions for happening once to stand by my side during the progress of the show he made it so vivid to me by what he said and did that i saw no fun in it without him i used to dread the heralding crow of punch if he was away and cared no longer for wooden heads being knocked ever so hard on sundays we walked to the cathedral and this was a day with a delight of its own for me he was never away on the sunday both of us attired in our best we walked along the streets hand in hand my father led me before the cathedral monuments talking in a low tone of british victories and commending the heroes to my undivided attention i understood very early that it was my duty to imitate them while we remained in the cathedral he talked of glory and old england and dropped his voice in the middle of a murmured chant to introduce nelsons name or some other great mans and this recurred regularly what are we for now he would ask me as we left our house i had to decide whether we took a hero or an author which i soon learnt to do with capricious resolution we were one sunday for shakespeare another for nelson or pitt nelson papa was my most frequent rejoinder and he never dissented but turned his steps toward nelsons cathedral dome and uncovered his head there and said nelson then today and we went straight to his monument to perform the act of homage i chose nelson in preference to the others because near bedtime in the evening my father told me stories of our hero of the day and neither pitt nor shakespeare lost an eye or an arm or fought with a huge white bear on the ice to make himself interesting i named them occasionally out of compassion and to please my father who said that they ought to have a turn they were he told me in the habit of paying him a visit whenever i had particularly neglected them to learn the grounds for my disregard of their claims and they urged him to intercede with me and imparted many of their unpublished adventures so that i should be tempted to give them a chance on the following sunday great will my father called shakespeare and slender billy pitt the scene where great will killed the deer dragging falstaff all over the park after it by the light of bardolphs nose upon which they put an extinguisher if they heard any of the keepers and so left everybody groping about and catching the wrong person was the most wonderful mixture of fun and tears great will was extremely youthful but everybody in the park called him father william and when he wanted to know which way the deer had gone king lear or else my memory deceives me punned and lady macbeth waved a handkerchief for it to be steeped in the blood of the deer shylock ordered one pound of the carcase hamlet the fact was impressed on me offered him a threelegged stool and a number of kings and knights and ladies lit their torches from bardolph and away they flew distracting the keepers and leaving will and his troop to the deer that poor thing died from a different weapon at each recital though always with a flow of blood and a successful dash of his antlers into falstaff and to hear falstaff bellow but it was mournful to hear how sorry great will was over the animal he had slain he spoke like music i found it pathetic in spite of my knowing that the whole scene was lighted up by bardolphs nose when i was just bursting out cryingfor the deers tongue was lolling out and quick pantings were at his side he had little ones at homegreat will remembered his engagement to sell shylock a pound of the carcase determined that no jew should eat of it he bethought him that falstaff could well spare a pound and he said the jew would not see the difference falstaff only got off by hard running and roaring out that he knew his unclean life would make him taste like pork and thus let the jew into the trick my father related all this with such a veritable matteroffact air and such livelinesshe sounded the chase and its cries and showed king lear tottering and hamlet standing dark and the vast substance of falstaff that i followed the incidents excitedly and really saw them which was better than understanding them i required some help from him to see that hamlets offer of a threelegged stool at a feverish moment of the chase was laughable he taught me what to think of it by pitching great wills voice high and hamlets very low by degrees i got some unconscious knowledge of the characters of shakespeare there never was so fascinating a father as mine for a boy anything under eight or ten years old he could guess on saturday whether i should name william pitt on the sunday for on those occasions slender billy as i hope i am not irreverent in calling him made up for the dulness of his high career with a raspberryjam tart for which my father told me solemnly the illustrious minister had in his day a passion if i named him my father would say w p otherwise s b was born in the year soandso now and he went to the cupboard in the name of politics take this and meditate upon him the shops being all shut on sunday he certainly bought it anticipating me unerringly on the saturday and as soon as the tart appeared we both shouted i fancy i remember his repeating a couplet billy pitt took a cake and a raspberry jam when he heard they had taken seringapatam at any rate the rumour of his having done so at periods of strong excitement led to the inexplicable display of foresight on my fathers part my meditations upon pitt were under this influence favourable to the post of a prime minister but it was merely appetite that induced me to choose him i never could imagine a grandeur in his office notwithstanding my fathers eloquent talk of ruling a realm shepherding a people hurling british thunderbolts the days discipline was that its selected hero should reign the undisputed monarch of it so when i was for pitt i had my tart as he used to have it and no story for he had none and i think my idea of the ruler of a realm presented him to me as a sort of shadow about a pastrycooks shop but i surprised people by speaking of him i made remarks to our landlady which caused her to throw up her hands and exclaim that i was astonishing she would always add a mysterious word or two in the hearing of my nursemaid or any friend of hers who looked into my room to see me after my father had got me forward with instructions on the piano and exercises in early english history and the book of the peerage i became the wonder of the house i was put up on a stool to play in my cottage near a wood or cherry ripe and then to show the range of my accomplishments i was asked and who married the dowager duchess of dewlap and i answered john gregg wetherall esquire and disgraced the family then they asked me how i accounted for her behaviour it was because the duke married a dairymaid i replied always tossing up my chin at that my father had concocted the questions and prepared me for the responses but the effect was striking both upon his visitors and the landladys gradually my ear grew accustomed to her invariable whisper on these occasions blood rile she said and her friends all said no like the run of a finger down a fiddlestring a gentleman of his acquaintance called on him one evening to take him out for a walk my father happened to be playing with me when this gentleman entered our room and he jumped up from his hands and knees and abused him for intruding on his privacy but afterwards he introduced him to me as shylocks greatgreatgreatgrandson and said that shylock was satisfied with a pound and his descendant wanted two hundred pounds or else all his body and this he said came of the emigration of the family from venice to england my father only seemed angry for he went off with shylocks very great grandson arminarm exclaiming to the rialto when i told mrs waddy about the visitor she said oh dear oh dear then im afraid your sweet papa wont return very soon my pretty pet we waited a number of days until mrs waddy received a letter from him she came fulldressed into my room requesting me to give her twenty kisses for papa and i looked on while she arranged her blue bonnet at the glass the bonnet would not fix in its place at last she sank down crying in a chair and was all brown silk and said that how to appear before a parcel of dreadful men and perhaps a live duke into the bargain was more than she knew and more than could be expected of a lone widow woman not for worlds she answered my petition to accompany her she would not she said have me go to my papa there for anything on earth my papa would perish at the sight of me i was not even to wish to go and then she exclaimed oh the blessed childs poor papa and that people were cruel to him and would never take into account his lovely temper and that everybody was his enemy when he ought to be sitting with the highest in the land i had realized the extremity of my forlorn state on a sunday that passed empty of my father which felt like his having gone for ever my nursemaid came in to assist in settling mrs waddys bonnet above the six crisp curls and while they were about it i sat quiet plucking now and then at the brown silk partly to beg to go with it partly in jealousy and love at the thought of its seeing him from whom i was so awfully separated mrs waddy took fresh kisses off my lips assuring me that my father would have them in twenty minutes and i was to sit and count the time my nursemaid let her out i pretended to be absorbed in counting till i saw mrs waddy pass by the window my heart gave a leap of pain i found the streetdoor open and no one in the passage and i ran out thinking that mrs waddy would be obliged to take me if she discovered me by her side in the street i was by no means disconcerted at not seeing her immediately running on from one street to another i took the turnings with unhesitating boldness as if i had a destination in view i must have been out near an hour before i understood that mrs waddy had eluded me so i resolved to enjoy the shopwindows with the luxurious freedom of one whose speculations on those glorious things all up for show are no longer distracted by the run of time and a nursemaid little more than a glance was enough now that i knew i could stay as long as i liked if i stopped at all it was rather to exhibit the bravado of liberty than to distinguish any particular shop with my preference all were equally beautiful so were the carriages so were the people ladies frequently turned to look at me perhaps because i had no covering on my head but they did not interest me in the least i should have been willing to ask them or any one where the peerage lived only my mind was quite full and i did not care i felt sure that a great deal of walking would ultimately bring me to st pauls or westminster abbey to anything else i was indifferent toward sunset my frame was struck as with an arrow by the sensations of hunger on passing a cooksshop i faltered along hoping to reach a second one without knowing why i had dragged my limbs from the first there was a boy in ragged breeches no taller than myself standing tiptoe by the window of a very large and brilliant pastrycooks he persuaded me to go into the shop and ask for a cake i thought it perfectly natural to do so being hungry but when i reached the counter and felt the size of the shop i was abashed and had to repeat the nature of my petition twice to the young woman presiding there give you a cake little boy she said we dont give cakes we sell them because i am hungry said i pursuing my request another young woman came laughing and shaking lots of ringlets dont you see hes not a common boy he doesnt whine she remarked and handed me a stale bun saying here master charles and you neednt say thank you my name is harry richmond and i thank you very much i replied i heard her say as i went out you can see hes a gentlemans son the ragged boy was awaiting me eagerly gemini youre a lucky one he cried here come along curlypoll i believe that i meant to share the bun with him but of course he could not be aware of my beneficent intentions so he treated me as he thought i was for treating him and making one snatch at the bun ran off cramming it into his mouth i stood looking at any hand i learnt in that instant what thieving was and begging and hunger for i would have perished rather than have asked for another cake and as i yearned for it in absolute want of food the boys ungenerous treatment of me came down in a cloud on my reason i found myself being led through the crush of people by an old gentleman to whom i must have related an extraordinary rigmarole he shook his head saying that i was unintelligible but the questions he put to me why had i no hat on in the open streetwhere did my mother live what was i doing out alone in london were so many incitements to autobiographical composition to an infant mind and i tumbled out my history afresh each time that he spoke he led me into a square stooping his head to listen all the while but when i perceived that we had quitted the region of shops i made myself quite intelligible by stopping short and crying i am so hungry he nodded and said it s no use crossexamining an empty stomach youll do me the favour to dine with me my little man well talk over your affairs byandby my alarm at having left the savoury street of shops was not soothed until i found myself sitting at table with him and a nice young lady and an old one who wore a cap and made loud remarks on my garments and everything i did i was introduced to them as the little boy dropped from the sky the old gentleman would not allow me to be questioned before i had eaten it was a memorable feast i had soup fish meat and pastry and for the first time in my life a glass of wine how they laughed to see me blink and cough after i had swallowed half the glass like water at once my tongue was unloosed i seemed to rise right above the roofs of london beneath which i had been but a wandering atom a few minutes ago i talked of my wonderful father and great will and pitt and the peerage i amazed them with my knowledge when i finished a long recital of great wills chase of the deer by saying that i did not care about politics i meant in my own mind that pitt was dull in comparison they laughed enormously as if i had fired them off do you know what you are sir said the old gentleman he had frowning eyebrows and a merry mouth youre a comical character i felt interested in him and asked him what he was he informed me that he was a lawyer and ready to be pantaloon to my clown if i would engage him are you in the peerage said i not yet he replied well then said i i know nothing about you the young lady screamed with laughter oh you funny little boy you killing little creature she said and coming round to me lifted me out of my chair and wanted to know if i knew how to kiss oh yes ive been taught that said i giving the salute without waiting for the invitation but i added i dont care about it much she was indignant and told me she was going to be offended so i let her understand that i liked being kissed and played with in the morning before i was up and if she would come to my house ever so early she would find me lying next the wall and ready for her and who lies outside she asked thats my papa i was beginning to say but broke the words with a sob for i seemed to be separated from him now by the sea itself they petted me tenderly my story was extracted by alternate leading questions from the old gentleman and timely caresses from the ladies i could tell them everything except the name of the street where i lived my midnight excursion from the house of my grandfather excited them chiefly also my having a mother alive who perpetually fanned her face and wore a balldress and a wreath things that i remembered of my mother the ladies observed that it was clear i was a romantic child i noticed that the old gentleman said humph very often and his eyebrows were like a rooks nest in a tree when i spoke of my father walking away with shylocks descendant and not since returning to me a big book was fetched out of his library in which he read my grandfathers name i heard him mention it aloud i had been placed on a stool beside a teatray near the fire and there i saw the old red house of riversley and my mother dressed in white and my aunt dorothy and they all complained that i had ceased to love them and must go to bed to which i had no objection somebody carried me up and undressed me and promised me a great game of kissing in the morning the next day in the strange house i heard that the old gentleman had sent one of his clerks down to my grandfather at riversley and communicated with the constables in london and byandby mrs waddy arrived having likewise visited those authorities one of whom supported her claims upon me but the old gentleman wished to keep me until his messenger returned from riversley he made all sorts of pretexts in the end he insisted on seeing my father and mrs waddy after much hesitation and even weeping furnished the address upon hearing which spoken aside to him he said i thought so mrs waddy entreated him to be respectful to my father who was she declared his superior and begging everybodys pardon present the superior of us all through no sin of his own that caused him to be so unfortunate and a real christian and pattern in spite of outsides though as true a gentleman as ever walked and by rights should be amongst the highest she repeated amongst the highest reprovingly with the ears of barley in her blue bonnet shaking and her hands clasped tight in her lap old mr bannerbridge that was the old gentlemans name came back very late from his visit to my father so late that he said it would be cruel to let me go out in the street after my bedtime mrs waddy consented to my remaining on the condition of my being surrendered to her at nine oclock and no later the following morning i was assured by mr bannerbridge that my fathers health and appetite were excellent he gave me a number of unsatisfying messages all the rest concerning his interview he whispered to his daughter and his sister miss bannerbridge who said they hoped they would have news from hampshire very early so that the poor child might be taken away by the friends of his infancy i could understand that my father was disapproved of by them and that i was a kind of shuttlecock flying between two battledores but why they pitied me i could not understand there was a great battle about me when mrs waddy appeared punctual to her appointed hour the victory was hers and i her prize passed a whole day in different conveyances the last of which landed us miles away from london at the gates of an old drooping mossed and streaked farmhouse that was like a wallflower in colour chapter iii dipwell farm in rain or in sunshine this old farmhouse had a constant resemblance to a wallflower and it had the same moist earthy smell except in the kitchen where john and martha thresher lived apart from their furniture all the fresh eggs and the butter stamped with three bees and the pots of honey the fowls and the hare lifted out of the hamper by his hind legs and the country loaves smelling heavenly which used to come to mrs waddys address in london and appear on my fathers table were products of dipwell farm and presents from her sister martha thresher on receiving this information i felt at home in a moment and asked right off how long am i to stay heream i going away tomorrow whats going to be done with me the women found these questions of a youthful wanderer touching between kissings and promises of hens to feed and eggs that were to come of it i settled into contentment a strong impression was made on me by mrs waddys saying here master harry your own papa will come for you and you may be sure he will for i have his word he will and hes not one to break it unless his countrys against him and for his darling boy hed march against cannons so here youll sit and wait for him wont you i sat down immediately looking up mrs waddy and mrs thresher raised their hands i had given them some extraordinary proof of my love for my father the impression i received was that sitting was the thing to conjure him to me where his hearts not concerned mrs waddy remarked of me flatteringly hes shrewd as a little schoolmaster heve a birdsnesting eye said mrs thresher whose face i was studying john thresher wagered i would be a man before either of them reached that goal but whenever he spoke he suffered correction on account of his english more than his eating and his drinking that childs father worrits about his learning to speak the language of a british gentleman mrs waddy exclaimed before that child your hs must be like the panting of an engineto please his father he d stop me carrying the dinnertray on meatdish hot and im to repeat what i said to make sure the child havent heard anything ungrammatical the childs nursemaid hed lecture so the poor girl would come down to me ready to bend double like a bundle of nothing his observations so took the pride out of her thats because he s a father who knows his duty to the childchild says he man maam its just as you john when you sow your seed you think of your harvest so dont take it ill of me john i beg of you be careful of your english turn it over as youre about to speak change loads on the road you mean said john thresher na na hes come to settle nigh a weedy field if you like but his crop aint nigh reaping yet hark you mary waddy whore a widde which s as much as say an unoccpied mind theres cockney and theres country and there s school mix the three strain and throw away the sediment now yon s my view his wife and mrs waddy said reflectively in a breath true drink or no thats the trick o brewery he added they assented they began praising him too like meek creatures what john says is worth listening to mary you may be overcareful a stews a stew and not a boiling to shreds and you want a steady fire and not a furnace oh i quite agree with john martha we must take the good and the evil in a world like this then im no scholar and youre at ease said john mrs waddy put her mouth to his ear up went his eyebrows wrinkling arches over a petrified stare in some way she had regained her advantage art sure of it he inquired pray dont offend me by expressing a doubt of it she replied bowing john thresher poised me in the very centre of his gaze he declared he would never have guessed that and was reproved inasmuch as he might have guessed it he then said that i could not associate with any of the children thereabout and my dwelling in the kitchen was not to be thought of the idea of my dwelling in the kitchen seemed to be a serious consideration with mrs martha likewise i was led into the rooms of state the sight of them was enough i stamped my feet for the kitchen and rarely in my life have been happier than there dining and supping with john and martha and the farmlabourers expecting my father across the hills and yet satisfied with the sun to hope and not be impatient is really to believe and this was my feeling in my fathers absence i knew he would come without wishing to hurry him he had the world beyond the hills i this one where a slow full river flowed from the sounding mill under our garden wall through long meadows in winter the wild ducks made letters of the alphabet flying on the other side of the copses bounding our home there was a park containing trees old as the history of england john thresher said and the thought of their venerable age enclosed me comfortably he could not tell me whether he meant as old as the book of english history he fancied he did for the furrowtrack follows the plough close upon but no one exactly could swear when that the book was put together at my suggestion he fixed the trees to the date of the heptarchy a period of heavy ploughing thus begirt by saxon times i regarded riversley as a place of extreme baldness a greenland untrodden by my alfred and my harold these heroes lived in the circle of dipwell confidently awaiting the arrival of my father he sent me once a glorious letter mrs waddy took one of john threshers pigeons to london and in the evening we beheld the bird cut the sky like an arrow bringing round his neck a letter warm from him i loved planet communicating with planet would be not more wonderful to men than words of his to me travelling in such a manner i went to sleep and awoke imagining the bird bursting out of heaven meanwhile there was an attempt to set me moving again a strange young man was noticed in the neighbourhood of the farm and he accosted me at leckham fair i say dont we know one another how about your grandfather the squire and your aunt and mr bannerbridge ive got news for you not unwilling to hear him i took his hand leaving my companion the millers little girl mabel sweetwinter at a toystand while bob her brother and our guardian was shying sticks in a fine attitude yes and your father too said the young man come along and see him you can run i showed him how fast we were pursued by bob who fought for me and won me and my allegiance instantly returned to him he carried me almost the whole of the way back to dipwell women must feel for the lucky heroes who win them something of what i felt for mine i kissed his bloody face refusing to let him wipe it john thresher said to me at night ay now youve got a notion of boxing and will you believe it master harry theres people fools enough to want to tread that ther firstrate pastime under foot i speak truth and my word for t theyd better go in petticoats let clergymen preach as in duty bound you and ill uphold a manful sport we will and a cheer for bob he assured me and he had my entire faith that boxing was englands natural protection from the foe the comfort of having one like bob to defend our country from invasion struck me as inexpressible lighted by john threshers burning patriotism i entered the book of the history of england at about the pace of a carthorse with a huge waggon at my heels in the shape of john there was no moving on until he was filled his process of receiving historical knowledge was to fight over again the personages who did injury to our honour as a nation then shake hands and be proud of them for where we aint quite successful were cunning he said and we not being able to get rid of william the conqueror because hes got a will of his own and he wont budge why we takes and makes him one of ourselves and no disgrace in that i should hope he paid us a compliment dont you see master harry he wanted to be an englishman can you this says we sparrin up to him pretty middlin says he and does it well well then says we then youre one of us and well beat the world and did so john thresher had a laborious mind it cost him beads on his forehead to mount to these heights of meditation he told me once that he thought ones country was like ones wife you were born in the first and married to the second and had to learn all about them afterwards ay and make the best of them he recommended me to mix strain and throw away the sediment for that was the trick o brewery every puzzle that beset him in life resolved to this cheerful precept the value of which he said was shown by clear brown ale the drink of the land even as a child i felt that he was peculiarly an englishman tales of injustice done on the niger river would flush him in a heat of wrath till he cried out for fresh taxes to chastise the villains yet at the sight of the beggars at his gates he groaned at the taxes existing and enjoined me to have pity on the poor taxpayer when i lent a hand to patch the laws i promised him i would unreservedly with a laugh but with a sincere intention to legislate in a direct manner on his behalf he too though he laughed thanked me kindly i was clad in black for my distant mother mrs waddy brought down a young man from london to measure me so that my mourning attire might be in the perfect cut of fashion the childs papa would strip him if he saw him in a country tailors funeral suit she said and seemed to blow a wind of changes on me that made me sure my father had begun to stir up his part of the world he sent me a prayer in his own handwriting to say for my mother in heaven i saw it flying up between black edges whenever i shut my eyes martha thresher dosed me for liver mrs waddy found me pale by the fireside and prescribed iron both agreed upon high feeding and the apothecary agreed with both in everything which reconciled them for both good women loved me so heartily they were near upon disputing over the medicines i was to consume under such affectionate treatment i betrayed the alarming symptom that my imagination was set more on my mother than on my father i could not help thinking that for any one to go to heaven was stranger than to drive to dipwell and i had this idea when my father was clasping me in his arms but he melted it like snow off the fields he came with postillions in advance of him wearing crape rosettes as did the horses we were in the cricketfield where dipwell was playing its first match of the season and a dipwell lad furious to see the elevens commit such a breach of the rules and decency as to troop away while the game was hot and surround my father flung the cricketball into the midst and hit two or three of the men hard my father had to shield him from the consequences he said he liked that boy and he pleaded for him so winningly and funnily that the man who was hurt most laughed loudest standing up in the carriage and holding me by the hand he addressed them by their names sweetwinter i thank you for your attention to my son and you thribble and you my man and you baker rippengale and you and you jupp as if he knew them personally it was true he nodded at random then he delivered a short speech and named himself a regular subscriber to their innocent pleasures he gave them money and scattered silver coin among the boys and girls and praised john thresher and martha his wife for their care of me and pointing to the chimneys of the farm said that the house there was holy to him from henceforth and he should visit it annually if possible but always in the month of may and in the shape of his subscription as certain as the cowslip the men after their fit of cheering appeared unwilling to recommence their play so he alighted and delivered the first ball and then walked away with my hand in his saying yes my son we will return to them tenfold what they have done for you the eleventh day of may shall be a day of pleasure for dipwell while i last and you will keep it in memory of me when i am gone and now to see the bed you have slept in martha thresher showed him the bed showed him flowers i had planted and a spanish chestnut tree just peeping ha said he beaming at every fresh sight of my doings madam i am your lifelong debtor and friend he kissed her on the cheek john thresher cried out why dame you trembles like a maid she spoke very faintly and was red in the face up to the time of our departure john stood like a soldier we drove away from a cheering crowd of cricketers and farmlabourers as if discharged from a great gun a royal salvo said my father and asked me earnestly whether i had forgotten to reward and take a particular farewell of any one of my friends i told him i had forgotten no one and thought it was true until on our way up the sandy lane which offered us a last close view of the old wallflower farm front i saw little mabel sweetwinter often my playfellow and bedfellow a curlyheaded girl who would have danced on sunday for a fairing and eaten gingerbread nuts during a ghoststory she was sitting by a furzebush in flower cherishing in her lap a lamb that had been worried she looked half up at me and kept looking so but would not nod then goodbye thought i and remembered her look when i had forgotten that of all the others chapter iv i have a taste of grandeur though i had not previously seen a postillion in my life i gazed on the pair bobbing regularly on their horses before me without a thought upon the marvel of their sudden apparition and connection with my fortunes i could not tire of hearing the pleasant music of the many feet at the trot and tried to explain to my father that the men going up and down made it like a piano that played of itself he laughed and kissed me he remembered having once shown me the inside of a piano when the keys were knocked my love for him as we drove into london had a recognized footing i perceived that he was my best friend and only true companion besides his being my hero the wicked men who had parted us were no longer able to do harm he said i forgot in my gladness at their defeat to ask what had become of shylocks descendant mrs waddy welcomed us when we alighted do not imagine that it was at the door of her old house it was in a wide street opening on a splendid square and pillars were before the houses and inside there was the enchantment of a little fountain playing thin as whipcord among ferns in a rockbasin under a window that glowed with kings of england copied from boys history books all the servants were drawn up in the hall to do homage to me they seemed less real and living than the wonder of the sweetsmelling chairs the birds and the elegant dogs richest of treats a monkey was introduced to me it s your papas whim mrs waddy said resignedly he says he must have his jester indeed it is no joke to me yet she smiled happily though her voice was melancholy from her i now learnt that my name was richmond roy and not harry richmond i said very well for i was used to change everybody in the house wore a happy expression of countenance except the monkey who was too busy as we mounted the stairs i saw more kings of england painted on the back windows mrs waddy said it is considered to give a monarchical effectshe coughed modestly after the long word and pursued as it should i insisted upon going to the top floor where i expected to find william the conqueror and found him but that strong connecting link between john thresher and me presented himself only to carry my recollections of the dipwell of yesterday as far back into the past as the old norman days and down go all the kings downstairs i said surveying them consecutively yes she replied in a tone that might lead one to think it their lamentable fate and did the people look at you as you drove along through the streets master richmond i said yes in turn and then we left off answering but questioned one another which is a quicker way of getting at facts i know it is with boys and women mrs waddy cared much less to hear of dipwell and its inhabitants than of the sensation created everywhere by our equipage i noticed that when her voice was not melancholy her face was she showed me a beautiful little pink bed having a crown over it in a room opening to my fathers twenty thousand magnificent dreams seemed to flash their golden doors when i knew that the bed was mine i thought it almost as nice as a place by my fathers side dont you like it mrs waddy i said she smiled and sighed like it oh yes my dear to be sure i do i only hope it wont vanish she simpered and looked sad i had too many distractions or i should have asked her whether my amazing and delightful new home had ever shown symptoms of vanishing it appeared to me judging from my experience that nothing moved violently except myself and my principal concern was lest any one should carry me away at a moments notice in the evening i was introduced to a company of gentlemen who were drinking wine after dinner with my father they clapped their hands and laughed immoderately on my telling them that i thought those kings of england who could not find room on the windows must have gone down to the cellars they are going my father said he drank off a glassful of wine and sighed prodigiously they are going gentlemen going there like good wine like old port which they tell us is going also favour me by drinking to the health of richmond roy the younger they drank to me heartily but my father had fallen mournful before i left the room ponyriding and lessons in boxing and wrestling and lessons in french from a french governess at whose appearance my father always seemed to be beginning to dance a minuet so exuberantly courteous was he and lessons in latin from a tutor whom my father invited to dinner once a fortnight but did not distinguish otherwise than occasionally to take down latin sentences in a notebook from his dictation occupied my mornings my father told the man who instructed me in the art of self defence that our family had always patronized his profession i wrestled ten minutes every day with this mans son and was regularly thrown on fine afternoons i was dressed in black velvet for a drive in the park where my father uncovered his head to numbers of people and was much looked at it is our duty my son never to forget names and persons i beg you to bear that in mind my dearest richie he said we used to go to his operabox and we visited the house of lords and the house of commons and my father though he complained of the decay of british eloquence and mourned for the days of chatham and william pitt our old friend of the cake and the raspberry jam and burke and sheridan encouraged the orators with approving murmurs my father no longer laid stress on my studies of the peerage now i have you in the very atmosphere that will come of itself he said i wished to know whether i was likely to be transported suddenly to some other place he assured me that nothing save a convulsion of the earth would do it which comforted me for i took the firmness of the earth in perfect trust we spoke of our old sunday walks to st pauls and westminster abbey as of a day that had its charm our pew among a fashionable congregation pleased him better the pewopener curtseyed to none as she did to him for my part i missed the monuments and the chants and something besides that had gonei knew not what at the first indication of gloom in me my father became alarmed and after making me stand with my tongue out before himself and mrs waddy like a dragon in a piece of tapestry would resume his old playfulness and try to be the same that he had been in mrs waddys lodgings then we read the arabian nights together or rather he read them to me often acting out the incidents as we rode or drove abroad an omission to perform a duty was the fatal forgetfulness to sprinkle pepper on the creamtarts if my father subjected me to an interrogation concerning my lessons he was the dread african magician to whom must be surrendered my acquisition of the ring and the musty old lamp we were quite in the habit of meeting fair persians he would frequently ejaculate that he resembled the three calendars in more respects than one to divert me during my recovery from measles he one day hired an actor in a theatre and put a cloth round his neck and seated him in a chair rubbed his chin with soap and played the part of the barber over him and i have never laughed so much in my life poor mrs waddy got her hands at her sides and kept on gasping oh sir oh while the barber hurried away from the halfshaved young man to consult his pretended astrolabe in the next room where we heard him shouting the suns altitude and consulting its willingness for the impatient young man to be further shaved and back he came seeming refreshed to have learnt the suns favourable opinion and gabbling at an immense rate full of barbers business the servants were allowed to be spectators but as soon as the young man was shaved my father dismissed them with the tone of a master no wonder they loved him mrs waddy asked who could help it i remember a pang i had when she spoke of his exposure to the risk of marrying again it added a curious romantic tenderness to my adoration of him and made me feel that he and i stood against the world to have his hand in mine was my delight then it was that i could think earnestly of prince ahmed and the kind and beautiful peribanou whom i would not have minded his marrying my favourite dream was to see him shooting an arrow in a match for a prize and losing the prize because of not finding his arrow and wondering where the arrow had flown to and wandering after it till he passed out of green fields to grassy rocks and to a stony desert where at last he found his arrow at an enormous distance from the shooting line and there was the desert all about him and the sweetest fairy ever imagined going to show herself to him in the ground under his feet in his absence i really hungered for him and was jealous during this arabian life we sat on a carpet that flew to the continent where i fell sick and was cured by smelling at an apple and my father directed our movements through the aid of a telescope which told us the titles of the hotels ready to receive us as for the cities and cathedrals the hot meadows under mountains the rivers and the castles they were little more to me than an animated book of geography opening and shutting at random and travelling from place to place must have seemed to me so much like the life i had led that i was generally as quick to cry as to laugh and was never at peace between any two emotions byandby i lay in a gondola with a young lady my father made friends fast on our travels her parents were among the number and she fell in love with me and enjoyed having the name of peribanou which i bestowed on her for her delicious talk of the blue and redstriped posts that would spout up fountains of pearls if they were plucked from their beds and the palaces that had flown out of the farthest corners of the world and the city that would some night or other vanish suddenly leaving bare searipple to say where where as they rolled over i would have seen her marry my father happily she was like rest and dreams to me soft sea and pearls we entered into an arrangement to correspond for life her name was clara goodwin she requested me to go always to the horse guards to discover in what part of the world colonel goodwin might be serving when i wanted to write to her i in return could give no permanent address so i related my history from the beginning to write to you would be the same as writing to a river she said and insisted that i should drop the odious name of roy when i grew a man my father quarrelled with colonel goodwin months after i felt as if i had only just been torn from clara but she stood in a mist irrecoverably distant i had no other friend twelve dozen of splendid burgundy were the fruit of our tour to be laid down at dipwell farm for my arrival at my majority when i should be a legal man embarked in my own ship as my father said i did not taste the wine porter for me that day please god cried mrs waddy who did my father eyed her with pity and ordered her to send the wine down to dipwell which was done he took me between his knees and said impressively now richie twelve dozen of the best that man can drink await you at the gates of manhood few fathers can say that to their sons my boy if we drink it together blessings on the day if im gone richie shut up in the long box his voice shook and he added gone to peribanou underneath you know remember that your dada saw that the wine was a good vintage and bought it and had it bottled in his own presence while you were asleep in the emperors room in the fine old burgundy city and swore that whatever came to them both his son should drink the wine of princes on the day of his majority here my fathers tone was highly exalted and he sat in a great flush i promised him i would bend my steps toward dipwell to be there on my twentyfirst birthday and he pledged himself to be there in spirit at least bodily if possible we sealed the subject with some tears he often talked of commissioning a poet to compose verses about that wonderful coming day at dipwell the thought of the day in store for us sent me strutting as though i had been in the presence of my drill master mrs waddy however grew extremely melancholy at the mention of it lord only knows where we shall all be by that time she sighed she is a dewy woman said my father disdainfully they appeared always to be at variance notwithstanding her absolute devotion to him my father threatened to have her married to somebody immediately if she afflicted him with what he called her waddyism she had got the habit of exclaiming at the end of her remarks no matter our clock strikes soon in a way that communicated to me an obscure idea of a door going to open unexpectedly in one of the walls and conduct us by subterranean passages into a new country my fathers method of rebuking her anxious nature was to summon his cook the funniest of frenchmen monsieur alphonse and issue orders for a succession of six dinnerparties and now maam you have occupation for your mind he would say to judge by the instantaneous composure of her whole appearance he did produce a temporary abatement of her malady the good soul bustled out of the room in attendance upon m alphonse and never complained while the dinners lasted but it was whispered that she had fits in the upper part of the house no sooner did my father hear the rumour than he accused her to her face of this enormity telling her that he was determined to effect a permanent cure even though she should drive him to unlimited expense we had a ball party and an aladdin supper and for a fortnight my father hired postillions we flashed through london my father backed a horse to run in the races on epsom downs named prince royal only for the reason that his name was prince royal and the horse won which was he said a proof to me that in our country it was common prudence to stick to royalty and he bade me note that if he went in a carriage and two he was comparatively unnoticed whereas when he was beheld in a carriage and four with postillions at a glance from him the country people tugged their forelocks and would like if he would let them to kiss his hand we will try the scarlet livery on one of our drives richie said he mrs waddy heard him it is unlawful sir she said for whom maam asked my father none but royal she was explaining but stopped for he showed her an awful frown and she cried so that my heart ached for her my father went out to order the livery on the spot he was very excited then it was that mrs waddy embracing me said my dear my own master richmond my little harry prepare your poor childs heart for evil days i construed her unintelligible speech as an attack upon my father and abused her violently while i was in this state of wrathful championship the halldoor was opened i ran out and caught sight of my aunt dorothy in company with old mr bannerbridge i was kissed and hugged for i know not how long until the smell of riversley took entire possession of me and my old home seemed nearer than the one i lived in but my aunt seeing tears on my cheeks asked me what was my cause of sorrow in a moment i poured out a flood of complaints against mrs waddy for vexing my father when she heard of the scarlet livery my aunt lifted her hands the man is near the end of his wits and his money together said mr bannerbridge and she said to me my darling harry will come back to his own nice little room and see his grandpapa soon wont you my pet all is ready for him there as it used to be except poor mama kiss my boy my harryharry richmond those were her last words on her deathbed before she went to god harry my own there is sampson the pony and harrys dog prince and his lamb daisy grown a sheep and the ploughboy dick with the big boots much more sweet talk of the same current that made my face cloudy and bright and filled me with desire for riversley to see my mothers grave and my friends aunt dorothy looked at me come now she said come with me harry her trembling seized on me like a fire i said yes though my heart sank as if i had lost my father with the word she caught me in her arms tight murmuring and dry our tears and make our house laugh oh since the night that harry went and i am now harrys mama he has me i looked on her forehead for the wreath of white flowers my mother used to wear and thought of my fathers letter with the prayer written on the blackbordered page i said i would go but my joy in going was gone we were stopped in the doorway by mrs waddy nothing would tempt her to surrender me mr bannerbridge tried reasoning with her and as he said put the case which seemed to have perched on his forefinger he talked of my prospects of my sole chance of being educated morally and virtuously as became the grandson of an english gentleman of a good old family and of my father having spent my mothers estate and of the danger of his doing so with mine and of religious duty and the awfulness of the position mrs waddy stood in he certainly subdued me to very silent breathing but did not affect me as my aunt dorothys picturing of riversley had done and when mrs waddy reduced to an apparent submissiveness addressed me piteously master richmond would you leave papa i cried out no no never leave my papa and twisted away from my aunts keeping my fathers arrival caused me to be withdrawn but i heard his offer of his hospitality and all that was his and subsequently there was loud talking on his part i was kissed by my aunt before she went she whispered come to us when you are free think of us when you pray she was full of tears mr bannerbridge patted my head the door closed on them and i thought it was a vision that had passed but now my father set my heart panting with questions as to the terrible possibility of us two ever being separated in some way he painted my grandfather so black that i declared earnestly i would rather die than go to riversley i would never utter the name of the place where there was evil speaking of the one i loved dearest do not my son he said solemnly or it parts us two i repeated after him i am a roy and not a beltham it was enough to hear that insult and shame had been cast on him at riversley for me to hate the name of the place we cried and then laughed together and i must have delivered myself with amazing eloquence for my father held me at arms length and said richie the notion of training you for a general commandership of the british army is a good one but if you have got the winning tongue the woolsack will do as well for a whisper in the ear of the throne that is our aim my son we sayyou will not acknowledge our birth you shall acknowledge our worth he complained bitterly of my aunt dorothy bringing a lawyer to our house the sins of mrs waddy were forgiven her owing to her noble resistance to the legal gentlemans seductive speech so i walked up and down stairs with the kings of england looking at me out of the coloured windows quietly for a week and then two ugly men entered the house causing me to suffer a fearful oppression though my father was exceedingly kind to them and had beds provided for them saying that they were very old retainers of his but the next day our scarlet livery appeared after exacting particular attention to his commands my father quitted mrs waddy and we mounted the carriage laughing at her deplorable eyes and prim lips which he imitated for my amusement a load is off my head he remarked he asked me if splendour did not fatigue me also i caught the answer from his face and replied that it did and that i should like to go right on to dipwell the burgundy sleeps safe there said my father and thought over it we had an extraordinary day people stood fast to gaze at us in the country some pulled off their hats and set up a cheer the landlords of the inns where we baited remained bareheaded until we started afresh and i according to my fathers example bowed and lifted my cap gravely to persons saluting us along the roads nor did i seek to know the reason for this excess of respectfulness i was beginning to take to it naturally at the end of a dusty highroad where it descends the hill into a town we drew up close by a high red wall behind which i heard boys shouting at play we went among them accompanied by their master my father tipped the head boy for the benefit of the school and following lunch with the master and his daughter to whom i gave a kiss at her request a halfholiday was granted to the boys in my name how they cheered the young lady saw my delight and held me at the window while my father talked with hers and for a long time after i beheld them in imagination talking that is to say my father issuing his instructions and mr rippenger receiving them like a pliant hodman for the result of it was that two days later without seeing my kings of england my home again or london i was julia rippengers intimate friend and the youngest pupil of the school my father told me subsequently that we slept at an hotel those two nights intervening memory transplants me from the coach and scarlet livery straight to my place of imprisonment chapter v i make a dear friend heriot was the name of the head boy of the school boddy was the name of one of the ushers they were both in love with julia rippenger it was my fortune to outrun them in her favour for a considerable period during which time though i had ceased to live in state and was wearing out my suits of velvet and had neither visit nor letter from my father i was in tolerable bliss julias kisses were showered on me for almost anything i said or did but her admiration of heroism and daring was so fervent that i was in no greater danger of becoming effeminate than achilles when he wore girls clothes she was seventeen an age bewitching for boys to look up to and men to look down on the puzzle of the school was how to account for her close relationship to old rippenger such an apple on such a crabtree seemed monstrous heriot said that he hoped boddy would marry old rippengers real daughter and said he thats birchtwigs i related his sparkling speech to julia who laughed accusing him however of impudence she let me see a portrait of her dead mother an irish lady raising dark eyelashes whom she resembled i talked of the portrait to heriot and as i had privileges accorded to none of the other boys and could go to her at any hour of the day after lessons he made me beg for him to have a sight of it she considered awhile but refused on hearing of the unkind refusal heriot stuck his hands into his pockets and gave up cricketing we saw him leaning against a wall in full view of her window while the boys crowded round him trying to get him to practise a schoolmatch of an important character coming off with a rival academy and it was only through fear of our school being beaten if she did not relent that julia handed me the portrait charging me solemnly to bring it back i promised of course heriot went into his favourite corner of the playground and there looked at it and kissed it and then buttoned his jacket over it tight growling when i asked him to return it julia grew frightened she sent me with numbers of petitions to him look here young un said heriot youre a good little fellow and i like you but just tell her i believe in nothing but handwriting and if she writes to me for it humbly and nicely she shall have it back say i only want to get a copy taken by a firstrate painter julia shed tears at his cruelty called him cruel wicked false to his word she wrote but the letter did not please him and his reply was scornful at prayers morning and evening it was pitiful to observe her glance of entreaty and her downfallen eyelashes i guessed that in heriots letters to her he wanted to make her confess something which she would not do now i write to him no more let him know it my darling she said and the consequence of heriots ungrateful obstinacy was that we all beheld her at the ceremony of the consecration of the new church place her hand on mr boddys arm and allow him to lead her about heriot kept his eyes on them his mouth was sharp and his arms stiff by his sides i was the bearer of a long letter to her that evening she tore it to pieces without reading it next day heriot walked slowly past mr boddy holding the portrait in his hands the usher called to him what have you there heriot my hero stared only a family portrait he answered thrusting it safe in his pocket and fixing his gaze on julias window permit me to look at it said mr boddy permit me to decline to let you said heriot look at me sir cried boddy i prefer to look elsewhere sir replied heriot and there was julia visible at her window i asked you sir civilly quoth boddy for permission to look i used the word intentionally i say i asked you for permission no you didnt heriot retorted quite cool inferentially you did but you did not use the word permission and you turned upon me impudently pursued boddy whose colour was thunder you quibbled sir you prevaricated you concealed what you were carrying am carrying heriot corrected his tense and mean to in spite of every boddy he murmured audibly like a rascal detected in an act of felony roared boddy you concealed it sir conceal it sir and i demand in obedience to my duty that you instantly exhibit it for my inspection now here at once no parleying unbutton or i call mr rippenger to compel you i was standing close by my brave heriot rather trembling studious of his manfulness though i was his left foot was firmly in advance as he said just in the manner to start an usher furious i concealed it i conceal it i was carrying it i carry it you demand that i exhibit for your inspection what i mean no boddy to see i have to assure you respectfully sir that family portraits are sacred things with the sons of gentlemen here richie off i found the portrait in my hand and heriot between me and the usher in the attitude of a fellow keeping another out of his home at prisoners base he had spied mr rippengers head at the playground gate i had just time to see heriot and the usher in collision before i ran through the gate and into julias arms in her garden whither the dreadful prospect of an approaching catastrophe had attracted her heriot was merely reported guilty of insolence he took his five hundred lines of virgil with his usual sarcastic dignity all he said to mr rippenger was let it be about dido sir which set several of the boys upon didos history but heriot was condemned to the battles with turnus my share in this event secured heriots friendship to me without costing me the slightest inconvenience papa would never punish you julia said and i felt my rank nor was it wonderful i should when mr rippenger was constantly speaking of my fathers magnificence in my presence before company allowed to draw on him largely for pocket money i maintained my fathers princely reputation in the school at times especially when the holidays arrived and i was left alone with julia i had fits of mournfulness and almost thought the boys happier than i was going home began to seem an unattainable thing to me having a father too a regular father instead of a dazzling angel that appeared at intervals i considered a benefaction in its way some recompense to the boys for their not possessing one like mine my anxiety was relieved by my writing letters to my father addressed to the care of miss julia rippenger and posting them in her workbasket she favoured me with very funny replies signed your own everloving papa about his being engaged killing bengal tigers and capturing white elephants a noble occupation that gave me exciting and consolatory dreams of him we had at last a real letter of his dated from a foreign city but he mentioned nothing of coming to me i understood that mr rippenger was disappointed with it gradually a kind of cloud stole over me i no longer liked to ask for pocketmoney i was clad in a suit of plain cloth i was banished from the parlour and only on sunday was i permitted to go to julia i ceased to live in myself through the whole course of lessons at playtime in my bed and round to morning bell i was hunting my father in an unknown country generally with the sun setting before me i ran out of a wood almost into a brook to see it sink as if i had again lost sight of him and then a sense of darkness brought me back to my natural consciousness without afflicting me much but astonishing me why was i away from him i could repeat my lessons in the midst of these dreams quite fairly it was the awakening among the circle of the boys that made me falter during a recital and ask myself why i was there and he absent they had given over speculating on another holiday and treat from my father yet he had produced such an impression in the school that even when i had descended to the level of a total equality with them they continued to have some consideration for me i was able to talk of foreign cities and could tell stories and i was besides under the immediate protection of heriot but now the shadow of a great calamity fell on me for my dear heriot announced his intention of leaving the school next half i cant stand being prayed at morning and evening by a fellow who hasnt the pluck to strike me like a man he said mr rippenger had the habit of signalizing offenders in his public prayers as boys whose hearts he wished to be turned from callousness he perpetually suspected plots and to hear him allude to some deep longhatched school conspiracy while we knelt motionless on the forms and fetch a big breath to bring out may the heart of walter heriot be turned and he comprehend the multitudinous blessings etc was intensely distressing together with walter heriot andrew saddlebank our best bowler the drollest fellow in the world john salter and little gus temple were oftenest cited they declared that they invariably uttered amen as heriot did but we none of us heard this defiant murmur of assent from their lips heriot pronounced it clearly and cheerfully causing julias figure to shrink as she knelt with her face in the chair hard by her fathers desk pulpit i received the hearty congratulations of my comrades for singing out amen louder than heriot like a chorister though not in so prolonged a note on hearing to my stupefaction mr rippenger implore that the heart of him we know as richmond roy might be turned i did it spontaneously mr rippenger gazed at me in descending from his desk julia too looking grieved for my part i exulted in having done a thing that gave me a likeness to heriot little richmond youre a little hero he said caressing me i saw old rippenger whisper to that beast boddy never mind they wont hurt you as long as im here grow tough thats what youve got to do id like to see you horsed only to see whether youre game to take it without wincingif it didnt hurt you much little lad he hugged me up to him id take anything for you heriot said i all right he answered never meaning me to suffer on his account he had an inimitable manner of sweet speaking that endeared him to younger boys capable of appreciating it with the supernatural power of music it endeared him i suppose to young women also julia repeated his phrases as for instance silly boy silly boy spoken with a wave of his hand when a little fellow thanked him for a kindness she was angry at his approval of what she called my defiance of her father and insisted that i was the catspaw of one of heriots plots to vex him tell heriot you have my command to say you belong to me and must not be misled she said his answer was that he wanted it in writing she requested him to deliver up her previous letters thereupon he charged me with a lengthy epistle which plunged us into boiling water mr boddy sat in the schoolroom while heriots pen was at work on the wet sunday afternoon his keen little eyes were busy in his flat birds head all the time heriot continued writing he saw no more than that heriot gave me a book but as i was marching away to julia he called to know where i was going to miss rippenger i replied what have you there a book sir show me the book i stood fast it s a book i have lent him sir said heriot rising i shall see if its a fit book for a young boy said boddy and before heriot could interpose he had knocked the book on the floor and out fell the letter both sprang down to seize it their heads encountered but heriot had the quicker hand he caught the letter and cried off to me as on another occasion this time however he was not between me and the usher i was seized by the collar and shakes roughly you will now understand that you are on a footing with the rest of the boys you roy said boddy little scoundrelly spoilt urchins upsetting the discipline of the school wont do here heriot here is your book i regret he added sneering that a leaf is torn i regret sir that the poor boy was so savagely handled said heriot he was warned to avoid insolence oh as much virgil as you like heriot retorted i know him by heart it was past the hour of my customary visit to julia and she came to discover the reason of my delay boddy stood up to explain heriot went forward saying i think im the one who ought to speak miss rippenger the fact is i hear from little roy that you are fond of tales of indian adventure and i gave him a book for you to read if you like it mr boddy objected and treated the youngster rather rigorously it must have been quite a misunderstanding on his part here is the book its extremely amusing julia blushed very red she accepted the book with a soft murmur and the sallow usher had not a word stay said heriot i took the liberty to write some notes my father is an indian officer you know and some of the terms in the book are difficult without notes richie hand that paper here they are miss rippenger if youll be so kind as to place them in the book i was hoping with all my might that she would not deny him she did and my heart sank oh i can read it without notes she said cheerfully after that i listened with indifference to her petition to boddy that i might be allowed to accompany her and was not at all chagrined by his refusal she laid down the book saying that i could bring it to her when i was out of disgrace in the evening we walked in the playground where heriot asked me to do a brave thing which he would never forget this was that i should take a sharp run right past boddy who was pacing up and down before the gate leading into julias garden and force her to receive the letter i went bounding like a ball the usher suspecting only that i hurried to speak to him let me see how indignant he was with my behaviour by striding all the faster as i drew near and so he passed the gate and i rushed in i had just time to say to julia hide it or im in such a scrape the next minute she was addressing my enemy surely you would not punish him because he loves me and he though he spoke of insubordination merited chastisement and other usher phrases seemed to melt and i had what i believe was a primary conception of the power of woman she led him to talk in the gentlest way possible of how the rain had refreshed her flowers and of this and that poor rose i could think of nothing but the darling letter which had flashed out of sight as a rabbit pops into burrows boddy departed with a rose ah richie she said i have to pay to have you with me now we walked to the summerhouse where she read heriots letter through but he is a boy how old is heriot he is not so old as i am these were her words and she read the letter anew and read it again after she had placed it in her bosom i meanwhile pouring out praises of heriot you speak of him as if you were in love with him richmond she said and i do love him i answered not with me she asked yes i do love you too if you will not make him angry but do you know what it is he wants of me i guessed yes he wants you to let him sit close to you for half an hour she said that he sat very near her in church ah said i but he mustnt interrupt the sermon she laughed and mouthed me over with laughing kisses theres very little he hasnt daring enough for we talked of his courage is he good as well said julia more to herself than to me but i sang out good oh so kind this appeared to convince her very generous to you and every one is he not she said and from that moment was all questions concerning his kind treatment of the boys and as to their looking up to him i quitted her taking her message to heriot you may tell himtell him that i cant write heriot frowned on hearing me repeat it humph he went and was bright in a twinkling that means shell come he smacked his hands together grew black and asked did she give that beast boddy a rose i had to confess she did and feeling a twinge of my treason to her felt hers to heriot humph he went she shall suffer for that all this was like music going on until the curtain should lift and reveal my father to me there was soon a secret to be read in heriots face for one who loved it as i did julias betrayed nothing i was not taken into their confidence and luckily not otherwise i fear i should have served them ill i was so poor a dissembler and was so hotly plied with interrogations by the suspicious usher i felt sure that heriot and julia met his eyes were on her all through prayertime and hers wandered over the boys heads till they rested on him when they gave a short flutter and dropped like a bird shot dead the boys must have had some knowledge that love was busy in their midst for they spoke of heriot and julia as a jolly couple and of boddy as one meaning to play the part of old nick the first opportunity she was kinder to them than ever it was not a new thing that she should send in cakes of her own making but it was extraordinary that we should get these thoughtful presents as often as once a fortnight and it became usual to hear a boy exclaim either among a knot of fellows or to himself by jingo she is a pretty girl on her passing out of the room and sometimes entirely of his own idea i am persuaded that if she had consented to marry boddy the boys would have been seriously disposed to conspire to jump up in the church and forbid the banns we should have preferred to hand her to the junior usher catman of whom the rumour ran in the school that he once drank a bottle of wine and was sick after it and he was therefore a weak creature to our minds the truth of the rumour being confirmed by his pale complexion that we would have handed our blooming princess to him was full proof of our abhorrence of boddy i might have thought with the other boys that she was growing prettier only i never could imagine her so delicious as when she smiled at my father the consequence of the enlistment of the whole school in heriots interests was that at cricketmatches picnics on the hills and boating on the canal mr boddy was begirt with spies and little temple reported to heriot a conversation that he lying hidden in tall grass had heard between boddy and julia boddy asked her to take private lessons in french from him heriot listened to the monstrous tale as he was on the point of entering julias boat where boddy sat beside her and heriot rowed strokeoar he dipped his blade and said loud enough to be heard by me in catmans boat do you think french useful in a military education sir and boddy said yes of course it is says heriot then i think i shall take lessons boddy told him he was taking lessons in the school oh says heriot i mean private lessons and here he repeated one of temples pieces of communication so much more can be imparted in a private lesson boddy sprang half up from his seat row sir and dont talk he growled sit sir and dont dance in the boat if you please or the lady will be overset said heriot julia requested to be allowed to land and walk home boddy caught the rudder lines and leapt on the bank to hand her out then all the boys in her boat and in catmans shouted miss julia dear miss julia dont leave us and we heard wheedling voices dont go off with him alone julia bade us behave well or she would not be able to come out with us at her entreaty boddy stepped back to his post and the two boats went forward like swans that have done ruffling their feathers the boys were exceedingly disappointed that no catastrophe followed the events of the day heriot they thought might have upset the boat saved julia and drowned boddy and given us a feast of pleasurable excitement instead of which boddy lived to harass us with his tyrannical impositions and spiteful slaps and it was to him not to our heriot that julia was most gracious some of us discussed her conduct shes a coquette said little temple i went off to the french dictionary is julia rippenger a coquette heriot i asked him keep girls out of your heads you little fellows said he dealing me a smart thump is a coquette a nasty girl i persisted no a nice one as it happens was his answer my only feeling was jealousy of the superior knowledge of the sex possessed by temple for i could not fathom the meaning of coquette but he had sisters temple and i walked the grounds together mutually declaring how much we would forfeit for heriots sake by this time my sunday visits to julia had been interdicted i was plunged as it were in the pit of the school and my dreams of my father were losing distinctness a series of boxes on the ears from boddy began to astound and transform me mr rippenger too threatened me with carvings though my offences were slight yes said temple and i in chorus but you darent strike heriot this was our consolation and the sentiment of the school fancy then our amazement to behold him laying the cane on heriots shoulders as fiercely as he could and boddy seconding him the scene was terrible we were all at our desks doing evening tasks for the morrow a great matchday at cricket boddy watching over us and bellowing silence at your work you lazy fellows if you want lessons to be finished at ten in the morning a noise came growing up to us from below up the stairs from the wetweather shed and heriot burst into the room old rippenger after him panting mr boddy you were right he cried i find him a prowler breaking all rules of discipline a perverted impudent rascal an example shall be set to my school sir we have been falling lax what i find the puppy in my garden whistlinghe confessesfor one of my servants here mr boddy if you please my school shall see that none insult me with impunity he laid on heriot like a wind on a bulrush heriot bent his shoulders a trifle not his head hit away sir he said during the storm of blows and i through my tears imagined him or i do now a young eagle forced to bear the thunder but with his face to it then we saw boddy lay hands on him and in a twinkling down pitched the usher and the boys cheeredchirped i should say they exulted so and merely sang out like birds without any wilfulness of delight or defiance after the fall of boddy we had no sense of our hero suffering shame temple and i clutched fingers tight as long as the blows went on we hoped for boddy to make another attempt to touch heriot he held near the master looking ready to spring like a sallow panther we kept hoping he would in our horror of the murderous slashes of the cane and not a syllable did heriot utter temple and i started up unaware of what we were going to do or of anything until we had got a blow apiece and were in the thick of it and boddy had us both by the collars and was knocking our heads together as he dragged us back to our seats but the boys told us we stopped the execution mr rippenger addressed us before he left the schoolroom saddlebank salter and a good many others plugged their ears with their fists that night boddy and catman paced in the bedchambers to prevent plotting and conspiracy they said i longed to get my arms about heriot and thought of him and dreamed of blood and woke in the morning wondering what made me cry and my arms and back very stiff heriot was gay as ever but had fits of reserve the word passed round that we were not to talk of yesterday evening we feared he would refuse to play in the match why not said he staring at us angrily has saddlebank broken his arm and cant bowl no saddlebank was in excellent trim though shamefaced as was salter and most of the big boys were they begged heriot to let them shake his hand wait till we win our match said heriot julia did not appear at morning prayers ah said temple itd make her sick to hear old massacre praying it had nearly made him sick he added and i immediately felt that it had nearly made me sick we supposed we should not see julia at the match she came however and talked to everybody i could not contain myself i wanted so to tell her what had befallen heriot overnight while he was batting and the whole ground cheering his hits i on one side of her whispered i say julia my dear i say do you know and temple on the other miss julia i wish youd let me tell you we longed to arouse her pity for heriot at the moment she was admiring him but she checked us and as she was surrounded by ladies and gentlemen of the town and particular friends of hers we could not speak out heriot brought his bat to the booth for eightynine runs his sleeve happened to be unbuttoned and there on his arm was a mark of the cane look i said to julia but she looked at me richie are you ill she assured me i was very pale and i felt her trembling excessively and her parasol was covering us here roy temple we heard heriot call here come here and bowl to me i went and bowled till i thought my head was flying after the ball and getting knocks it swam and throbbed so horribly temple related that i fell and was carried all the way from the cricket field home by heriot who would not give me up to the usher i was in julias charge three days every time i spoke of her father and heriot she cried oh hush and had tears on her eyelids when i was quite strong again i made her hear me out she held me and rocked over me like a green tree in the wind and rain was any name mentioned she asked with her mouth working and to my no said no she knew there was none and seemed to drink and choke and was one minute calm all but a trembling hanging underlip next smiling on me and next having her face carved in grimaces by the jerking little tugs of her mouth which i disliked to see for she would say nothing of what she thought of heriot and i thought to myself though i forbore to speak unkindly its no use your making yourself look ugly julia if she had talked of heriot i should have thought that crying persons kisses were agreeable on my return into the school i found it in a convulsion of excitement owing to heriots sending boddy a challenge to fight a duel with pistols mr rippenger preached a sermon to the boys concerning the unchristian spirit and hideous moral perversity of one who would even consent to fight a duel how much more reprehensible then was one that could bring himself to defy a fellowcreature to mortal combat we were not of his opinion and as these questions are carried by majorities we decided that boddy was a coward and approved the idea that heriot would have to shoot or scourge him when the holidays came mr rippenger concluded his observations by remarking that the sharpest punishment he could inflict upon heriot was to leave him to his own conscience which he did for three days and then asked him if he was in a fit state of mind to beg mr boddys pardon publicly im quite prepared to tell him what i think of him publicly sir said heriot a murmur of exultation passed through the school mr rippenger seized little temple and flogged him far from dreading the rod now that heriot and temple had tasted it i thought of punishment as a mad pleasure not a bit more awful than the burning furzebush plunged into by our fellows in a followmyleader scamper on the common so i caught temples hand as he went by me and said eagerly shall i sing out hurrah bother it was temples answer for he had taken a stinging dozen and had a tender skin mr rippenger called me up to him to inform me that whoever i was and whatever i was and i might be a little impostor foisted on his benevolence yet he would bring me to a knowledge of myself he gave me warning of it and if my father objected to his method my father must write word to that effect and attend punctually to business duties for surrey house was not an almshouse either for the sons of gentlemen of high connection or for the sons of vagabonds mr rippenger added a spurning shove on my shoulder to his recommendation to me to resume my seat i did not understand him at all i was in fact indebted to a boy named drew a known sneak for the explanation in itself difficult to comprehend it was that mr rippenger was losing patience because he had received no money on account of my boarding and schooling the intelligence filled my head like the buzz of a fly occupying my meditations without leading them anywhere i spoke on the subject to heriot oh the sordid old brute said he of mr rippenger how can he know the habits and feelings of gentlemen your fathers travelling and cant write of course my fathers in india and i get a letter from him about once a year we know one another and i know hes one of the best officers in the british army its just the way with schoolmasters and tradesmen they dont care whether a man is doing his duty to his country he must attend to them settle accounts with themhang them ill send you money dear little lad after ive left he dispersed my brooding fit i was sure my father was a fountain of gold and only happened to be travelling besides heriots love for julia whom none of us saw now was an incessant distraction she did not appear at prayers she sat up in the gallery at church hardly to be spied a letter that heriot flung over the gardenwall for her was returned to him open enclosed by post a letter for walter heriot exclaimed mr boddy lifting it high for heriot to walk and fetch it and his small eyes blinked when heriot said aloud on his way cheerfully a letter from the colonel in india boddy waited a minute and then said is your father in good health heriots face was scarlet at first he stuttered my fatheri hope so what have you in common with him sir you stated that the letter was from your father said boddy what if it is sir oh in that case nothing whatever to me they talked on and the youngest of us could perceive boddy was bursting with devilish glee heriot got a letter posted to julia it was laid on his desk with her name scratched completely out and his put in its place he grew pale and sad but did his work playing his games and only letting his friends speak to him of lessons and play his counsel to me was that in spite of everything i was always to stick to my tasks and my cricket his sadness he could not conceal he looked like an old lamp with a poor light in it not a boy in the school missed seeing how boddys flat head perpetually had a sideeye on him all this came to an end john salters father lived on the other side of the downs and invited three of us to spend a day at his house the selection included heriot saddlebank and me mr rippenger not liking to refuse mr salter consented to our going but pretended that i was too young salter said his mother and sisters very much wished to make my acquaintance we went in his fathers carriage a jolly wind blew clouds and dust and leaves i could have fancied i was going to my own father the sensation of freedom had a magical effect on me so that i was the wildest talker of them all even in the middle of the family i led the conversation and i did not leave salters house without receiving an assurance from his elder sisters that they were in love with me we drove homeback to prison we called itfull of good things talking of salters fathers cellar of wine and of my majority burgundy which i said believing it was true amounted to twelve hundred dozen and an appointment was made for us to meet at dipwell farm to assist in consuming it in my honour and my fathers that matter settled i felt myself rolling over and over at a great rate and clasping a juniper tree the horses had trenched from the chalk road on to the downs i had been shot out heriot and salter had jumped outheriot to look after me but saddlebank and the coachman were driving at a great rate over the dark slope salter felt some anxiety concerning his fathers horses so we left him to pursue them and walked on laughing heriot praising me for my pluck i say goodbye to you tonight richie said he were certain to meet again i shall go to a military school mind you enter a cavalry regiment when youre man enough look in the army list youll find me there my aunt shall make a journey and call on you while youre at rippengers so you shant be quite lonely to my grief i discovered that heriot had resolved he would not return to school youll get thrashed he said i cant help it i hope youve grown tough by this time i cant stay here i feel more like a dog than a man in that house now ill see you back safe no crying young cornet we had lost the sound of the carriage heriot fell to musing he remarked that the accident took away from mr salter the responsibility of delivering him at surrey house but that he heriot was bound for mr salters sake to conduct me to the doors an unintelligible refinement of reasoning to my wits we reached our town between two and three in the morning there was a ladder leaning against one of the houses in repair near the school you are here are you said heriot speaking to the ladder you ll do me a servicethe last i shall want in the neighbourhood he managed to poise the ladder on his shoulder and moved forward are we going in through the window i asked seeing him fix the ladder against the schoolhouse wall he said hush keep a lookout i saw him mount high when he tapped at the window i remembered it was julias i heard her cry out inside the window rose slowly heriot spoke i have come to say goodbye to you julia dear girl dont be afraid of me she answered inaudibly to my ears he begged her to come to him at once only once and hear him and take his hand she was timid he had her fingers first then her whole arm and she leaned over him julia my sweet dear girl he said and she heriot walter dont godont go you do not care for

portrait it is all i have why should you not have it i want to be remembered she sobbed as she said this and disappeared heriot still talked into her room i thought i heard a noise of the gardendoor opening a man came out rushing at the ladder i called in terror mr boddy stop sir he pushed me savagely aside pitching his whole force against the ladder heriot pulled down julias window he fell with a heavy thump on the ground and i heard a shriek above he tried to spring to his feet but dropped supported himself on one of his hands and cried all right no harm done how do you do mr boddy i thought id try one of the attics as we were late not to disturb the house i m not hurt i tell you he cried as loud as he could the ushers words were in a confusion of rage and inquiries he commanded heriot to stand on his legs abused him asked him what he meant by it accused him of depravity of crime of disgraceful conduct and attempted to pluck him from the spot hands off me said heriot i can help myself the youngster ll help me and well go round to the front door i hope sir you will behave like a gentleman make no row here mr boddy if youve any respect for people inside we were upset by mr salters carriage its damaged my leg i believe have the goodness sir to go in by your road and well go round and knock at the front door in the proper way we shall have to disturb the house after all heriot insisted i was astonished to see boddy obey him and leave us after my dear heriot had hopped with his hand on my shoulder to the corner of the house fronting the road while we were standing alone a light cart drove by heriot hailed it and hopped up to the driver take me to london theres a good fellow he said im a gentleman you neednt look fixed ill pay you well and thank you but quick haul me up up heres my hand by jingo this is pain the man said scamped it out of school sir heriot replied mum rely on me when i tell you im a gentleman well if i pick up a gentleman i cant be doing a

never fear for me and well meet somehow well drink the burgundy no crying kiss your hand to me i kissed my hand to him i had no tears to shed my chest kept heaving enormously my friend was gone i stood in the road straining to hear the last of the wheels after they had long been silent chapter vi a tale of a goose from that hour till the day heriots aunt came to see me i lived systematically out of myself in extreme flights of imagination locking my doors up as it were all the faster for the extremest strokes of mr rippengers rod he remarked justly that i grew an impenetrably sullen boy a constitutional rebel a callous lump and assured me that if my father would not pay for me i at least should not escape my debts the title of little impostor transmitted from the masters mouth to the school in designation of one who had come to him as a young prince and for whom he had not received one pennys indemnification naturally caused me to have fights with several of the boys whereupon i was reported i was prayed at to move my spirit and flogged to exercise my flesh the prayers i soon learnt to laugh to scorn the floggings after they were over crowned me with delicious sensations of martyrdom even while the sting lasted i could say its for heriot and julia and it gave me a wonderful penetration intothe mournful ecstasy of love julia was sent away to a relative by the seaside because one of the housemaids told me she could not bear to hear of my being beaten mr rippenger summoned me to his private room to bid me inform him whether i had other relatives besides my father such as grandfather grandmother uncles or aunts or a mother i dare say julia would have led me to break my word to my father by speaking of old riversley a place i half longed for since my father had grown so distant and dim to me but confession to mr rippenger seemed as he said of heriots behaviour to him a gross breach of trust to my father so i refused steadily to answer and suffered the consequences now on my dear fathers behalf heriots aunt brought me a cake and in a letter from him an extraordinary sum of money for a boy of my age he wrote that he knew i should want it to pay my debts for treats to the boys and keep them in good humour he believed also that his people meant to have me for the christmas holidays the sum he sent me was five pounds carefully enclosed i felt myself a prince again the money was like a golden gate through which freedom twinkled a finger forthwith i paid my debts amounting to two pounds twelve shillings and instructed a couple of day boarders commercial fellows whose heavy and mysterious charges for commissions ran up a bill in no time to prepare to bring us materials for a feast on saturday temple abominated the trading propensities of these boys they never get licked and theyve always got money at least i know they always get mine said he but you and i and heriot despise them our position toward them was that of an encumbered aristocracy and really they paid us great respect the fact was that when they had trusted us they were compelled to continue obsequious for heriot had instilled the sentiment in the school that gentlemen never failed to wipe out debts in the long run so it was their interest to make us feel they knew us to be gentlemen who were at some time or other sure to pay and thus also they operated on our consciences from which it followed that one title of superiority among us ranking next in the order of nobility to the dignity conferred by mr rippengers rod was the being down in their books temple and i walked in the halo of unlimited credit like more than mortal twins i gave an order for four bottles of champagne on the friday evening catman walked out with us his studious habits endeared him to us immensely owing to his having his head in his book on all occasions and a walk under his superintendence was first cousin to liberty some boys roamed ahead some lagged behind while catman turned over his pages sounding the return only when it grew dark the rumour of the champagne had already intoxicated the boys there was a companion and most auspicious rumour that boddy was going to be absent on saturday if so we said we may drink our champagne under catmans nose and he be none the wiser saddlebank undertook to manage our feast for us coming home over the downs just upon twilight temple and i saw saddlebank carrying a long withy upright we asked him what it was for he shouted back its for fortune you keep the rear guard then we saw him following a man and a flock of geese and imitating the action of the man with his green wand as we were ready to laugh at anything saddlebank did we laughed at this the man walked like one half asleep and appeared to wake up now and then to find that he was right in the middle of his geese and then he waited and saddlebank waited behind him presently the geese passed a lane leading off the downs we saw saddlebank duck his wand in a coaxing way like an angler dropping his fly for fish he made all sorts of curious easy flourishes against the sky and branched up the lane we struck after him little suspecting that he had a goose in front but he had he had cut one of the loiterers off from the flock and to see him handle his wand on either side his goose encouraging it to go forward and remonstrating and addressing it in bits of latin and the creature pattering stiff and astonished sent us in a dance of laughter what have you done old saddle said temple though it was perfectly clear what saddlebank had done ive carved off a slice of michaelmas said saddlebank and he hewed the air to flick delicately at his gooses head what do you meana slice said we we wanted to be certain the goose was captured booty saddlebank would talk nothing but his fun temple fetched a roaring sigh oh how good this goose d be with our champagne the idea seized and enraptured me saddlebank i ll buy him off you i said chink wont flavour him said saddlebank still at his business here you two cut back by the down and try all your might to get a dozen apples before catman counts heads at the door and you hold your tongues we shot past the man with the geesei pitied himclipped a corner of the down and by dint of hard running reached the main street mad for apples before catman appeared there apples champagne and cakes were now provided all that was left to think of was the goose we glorified saddlebanks cleverness to the boys by jingo what a treat youll have temple said among them bursting with our secret saddlebank pleaded that he had missed his way on presenting himself ten minutes after time to me and temple he breathed of goose but he shunned us he had no fun in him till saturday afternoon when catman called out to hear if we were for cricket or a walk a walk on the downs said saddlebank temple and i echoed him and saddlebank motioned his hand as though he were wheedling his goose along saddlebank spoke a word to my commissioners i was to leave the arrangements for the feast to him he said john salter was at home unwell so saddlebank was chief no sooner did we stand on the downs than he gathered us all in a circle and taking off his cap threw in it some slips of paper we had to draw lots who should keep by catman out of twentyseven fifteen blanks were marked temple dashed his hand into the cap first like my luck he remarked and pocketed both fists as he began strutting away to hide his desperation at drawing a blank i bought a substitute for him at the price of halfacrowndrew a fellow we were glad to get rid of he wanted five shillings the feast was worth fifty but to haggle about prices showed the sneak he begged us to put by a taste for him he was groaned out of hearing the fifteen looked so wretched when they saw themselves divided from us that i gave them a shilling apiece to console them they took their instructions from saddlebank as to how they were to surround catman and make him fancy us to be all in his neighbourhood and then we shook hands they requesting us feebly to drink their healths and we saying ay that we would temple was in distress of spirits because of his having been ignominiously bought off saddlebank however put on such a pace that no one had leisure for melancholy ill get you fellows up to boiling point said he there was a tremendously hot sun overhead on a sudden he halted exclaiming cooks and gridirons what about sage and onions only temple and i jumped at the meaning of this we drew lots for a messenger and it was miserable to behold an unfortunate fellow touch saddlebanks hand containing the notched bit of stick and find himself condemned to go and buy sage and onions somewhere without knowing what it was for how could he guess we were going to cook a raw goose the lot fell to a boy named barnshed a big slow boy half way up every class he was in but utterly stupid out of school which made saddlebank say theyll take it hes the bird that wants stuffing barnshed was directed where to rejoin us the others asked why he was trotted after sage and onions because hes an awful goose said saddlebank temple and i thought the word was out and hurrahed and back came barnshed we had a task in persuading him to resume his expedition as well as saddlebank to forgive us saddlebanks anger was excessive we conciliated him by calling him captain and pretending to swear an oath of allegiance he now led us through a wood on to some fields down to a shady dell where we were to hold the feast in privacy he did not descend it himself vexatious as it was to see a tramps tent there we nevertheless acknowledged the respectful greeting of the women and the man with a few questions about tentpegs pots and tin mugs saddlebank remained aloft keeping a lookout for the dayschool fellows chaunter davis and bystop my commissioners they did not keep us waiting long they had driven to the spot in a cart according to saddlebanks directions our provisions were in three large hampers we praised their forethought loudly at the sight of an extra bottle of champagne with two bottles of gingerwine two of currant two of raisin four pint bottles of ale six of gingerbeer a dutch cheese a heap of tarts three sallylunns and four shillingsworth of toffy temple and i joined our apples to the mass a sight at which some of the boys exulted aloud the trampwomen insisted on spreading things out for us ten yards off their children squatted staring the man smoked and chaffed us at last saddlebank came running over the hillside making as if he meant to bowl down what looked a black body of a baby against the sky and shouting see you fellows heres a find he ran through us swinging his goose up to the hampers saying that he had found the goose under a furzebush while the words were coming out of his mouth he saw the tramps and the male tramps eyes and his met the man had one eyebrow and his lips at one corner screwed in a queer lift he winked slowly odd aint it he said saddlebank shouldered round on us and cried confound you fellows heres a beastly place youve pitched upon his face was the colour of scarlet in patches now i call it a beautiful place said the man and if you finds gooses hereabouts growing ready for the fire all but plucking why its a bountiful place i call it the women tried to keep him silent but for them we should have moved our encampment why of course young gentlemen if you want to eat the goose well pluck it for you and cook it for you all nice they said how can young gentlemen do that for theirselves it was clear to us we must have a fire for the goose certain observations current among us about the necessity to remove the gooses inside and not to lose the giblets which even the boy who named them confessed his inability to recognize inclined the majority to accept the womans proposal saddlebank said it was on our heads then to revive his good humour temple uncorked a bottle of champagne the trampwoman lent us a tin mug and round it went one boy said thats a commencement another said hang old rippenger temple snapped his fingers and bystop a farmers son said well now ive drunk champagne i meant to before i died most of the boys seemed puzzled by it as for me my heart sprang up in me like a colt turned out of stables to graze i determined that the humblest of my retainers should feed from my table and drink to my fathers and heriots honour and i poured out champagne for the women who just sipped and the man who vowed he preferred beer a spoonful of the mashed tarts i sent to each of the children only one the eldest a girl about a year older than me or younger with black eyebrows and rough black hair refused to eat or drink let her bide young gentlemen said a woman shes a regular obstinate once she sets in for it ah said the man ive seen pigs druv and ive seen iron bent double shes harder n both once she takes t into her head by jingo shes pigiron cried temple and sighed oh dear old heriot i flung myself beside him to talk of our lost friend a great commotion stirred the boys they shrieked at beholding their goose vanish in a pot for stewing they wanted roastgoose they exclaimed not boiled who cared for boiled goose but the woman asked them how it was possible to roast a goose on the top of woodflames where there was nothing to hang it by and nothing would come of it except smoked bones the boys groaned in consternation and saddlebank sowed discontent by grumbling now you see what your jolly new acquaintances have done for you so we played at catch with the dutch cheese and afterwards bowled it for longstopping when to the disgust of saddlebank and others down ran the blackhaired girl and caught the ball clean at wicketdistance as soon as she had done it she was ashamed and slunk away the boys called out now then pigiron one fellow enraged me by throwing an apple that hit her in the back we exchanged halfadozen blows whereupon he consented to apologize and roared hulloa pigiron sorry if i hurt you temple urged me to insist on the rascals going on his knees for flinging at a girl why said chaunter you were the first to call her pigiron temple declared he was a blackguard if he said that i made the girl take a piece of toffy aha saddlebank grumbled this comes of the precious company you would keep in spite of my caution the man told us to go it for he liked to observe young gentlemen enjoying themselves temple tossed him a pint bottle of beer with an injunction to him to shut his trap now you talk my mother tongue said the man youre what goes by the name of a learned gentleman thank ye sir youll be a counsellor some day i wont get off thieves i can tell you said temple he was the son of a barrister nor you wont help cook their gooses for them may be said the man well kindness is kindness all over the world the women stormed at him to command him not to anger the young gentlemen for saddlebank was swearing awfully in an undertone he answered them that he was the mildest lamb afloat despairing of the goose we resolved to finish the cold repast awaiting us the dutch cheese had been bowled into bits with a portion of the mashed tarts on it and champagne it tasted excellently toffy to follow those boys who chose gingerwine had it and drank despised the gingerbeer and ale apples and sallylunns were reserved for supper my mind became like a driving sky with glimpses of my father and heriot bursting through if im not a prince im a nobleman i said to temple he replied army or navy i dont much care which were sure of a foreign war some time then youll see fellows rise lieutenant captain colonel generalquick as barrels popping at a bird i should like to be governor of gibraltar ill come and see you temple said i done old richie he said grasping my hand warmly the truth is temple i confided to him ive an unclei mean a grandfatherof enormous property he owns half hampshire i believe and hates my father like poison i wont stand it youve seen my father havent you gentlemen never forget their servants temple lets drink lots more champagne i wish you and i were knights riding across that country there as they used to and you saying i wonder whether your fathers at home in the castle expecting our arrival the baron said temple hes like a baron too his health your health sir its just the wine to drink it in richie hes one of the men i look up to it s odd he never comes to see you because hes fond of you the right sort of father big men cant be always looking after little boys not that were so young though now lots of fellows of our age have done things fellows write about i feel temple sat up swelling his chest to deliver an important sentiment i feel uncommonly thirsty so did i we attributed it to the air of the place temple going so far as to say that it came off the chalk which somehow stuck in the throat saddleback dont look glum said temple lord richie you should hear my father plead in court with his wig on they used to say at home i was a clever boy when i was a baby saddleback youve looked glum all the afternoon treat your superiors respectfully saddlebank retorted the tramp was irritating him that tramp had never left off smoking and leaning on his arm since we first saw him two boys named hackman and montague not bad fellows grew desirous of a whiff from his pipe they had it and lay down silent back to back bystop was led away in a wretched plight two others paynter and ashworth attacked the apples rendered desperate by thirst saddlebank repelled them furiously he harangued those who might care to listen you fellows by george you shall eat the goose i tell you youve spoilt everything and i tell you whether you like it or not you shall have apples with it and sage and onions too i dont ask for thanks and i propose to post outposts in the wood to keep watch he wanted us to draw lots again his fun had entirely departed from him all he thought of was seeing the goose out of the pot i had a feeling next to hatred for one who could talk of goose temple must have shared it we ve no real captain now dear old heriot s gone he said the schools topsyturvy were like a lot of things rattled in a box oh dear how i do like a good commander on he goes you after him never mind what happens a pair of inseparable friends happitt and larkins nicknamed happygo lucky were rolling arminarm declaring they were perfectly sober and for a proof of it trying to direct their feet upon a lump of chalk and marching and missing it up came chaunter to them fat goose he saidno more both the boys rushed straight as far as they could go both sung out im done and they were temple and i contemplated these proceedings as matters belonging to the ordinary phenomena of feasting we agreed that gentlemen were always the last to drop and were assured therefore of our living out the field but i dreaded the moment of the gooses appearance and i think he did also saddlebanks pertinacity in withholding the cool gingerbeer and the apples offended us deeply we should have conspired against him had we reposed confidence in our legs and our tongues twilight was around us the trampchildren lay in little bundles in one tent another was being built by the women and the girl overhead i counted numbers of stars all small and lights in the valleylights of palaces to my imagination stars and tramps seemed to me to go together houses imprisoned us i thought a lost father was never to be discovered by remaining in them plunged among dark green leaves smelling wood smoke at night at morning waking up and the world alight and you standing high and marking the hills where you will see the next morning and the next morning after morning and one morning the dearest person in the world surprising you just before you wake i thought this a heavenly pleasure but observing the narrowness of the tents it struck me there would be snoring companions i felt so intensely sensitive that the very idea of a snore gave me tremours and qualms it was associated with the sense of fat saddlebank had the lid of the pot in his hand we smelt the goose and he cried now for supper now for it halloa you fellows bother it saddlebank youll make catman hear you said temple wiping his forehead i perspired coldly catman hes been at it for the last hour and a half saddlebank replied one boy ran up he was ready and the only one who was presently chaunter rushed by barnshed s in custody im away home he said passing we stared at the black opening of the dell oh its catman we dont mind him saddlebank reassured us but we heard ominous voices and perceived people standing over a prostrate figure then we heard a voice too well known to us it said the explanation of a pupil in your charge mr catman being sent barefaced into the towna scholar of minefor sage and onions old rippenger breathed temple we sat paralyzed now we understood the folly of despatching a donkey like barnshed for sage and onions oh what asses we have been temple continued come alongwe run for it come along richie they re picking up the fellows like windfalls i told him i would not run for it in fact i distrusted my legs and he was staggering answering saddlebanks reproaches for having come among tramps temple i see you sir called mr rippenger poor temple had advanced into the firelight with the instinct to defeat the master i crawled in the line of the shadows to the farther side of a tent where i felt a hand clutch mine hide me said i and the curtain of the tent was raised after squeezing through boxes and straw i lay flat covered by a mat smelling of abominable cheese and felt a head outside it on my chest several times mr rippenger pronounced my name in the way habitual to him in anger rye temples answer was inaudible to me saddlebank spoke and other boys and the man and the woman then a light was thrust in the tent and the man said me deceive you sir see for yourself to satisfy yourself heres our little uns laid warm and a girl there head on the mat going down to join her tribe at lipcombe and one of our women sleeps here and all told but for you to suspect me of combiningthank ye sir youve got my word as a man the light went away my chest was relieved of the weight on it i sat up and the creature who had been kind to me laid mat and straw on the ground and drew my head on her shoulder where i slept fast etext editors bookmarks a stews a stew and not a boiling to shreds i cant think brisk out of my breeches kindness is kindness all over the world learn all about them afterwards ay and make the best of them to hope and not be impatient is really to believe unseemly hourunbetimes
