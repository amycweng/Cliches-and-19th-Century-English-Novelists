speaks xliii again the magian conflict xliv the last scene xlv lady blandish to austin wentworth chapter xxxix at a season when the pleasant south western island has few attractions to other than invalids and hermits enamoured of wind and rain the potent nobleman lord mountfalcon still lingered there to the disgust of his friends and special parasite mount's in for it again they said among themselves hang the women was a natural sequence for don't you see what a shame it was of the women to be always kindling such a very inflammable subject all understood that cupid had twanged his bow and transfixed a peer of britain for the fiftieth time but none would perceive though he vouched for it with his most eloquent oaths that this was a totally different case from the antecedent ones so it had been sworn to them too frequently before he was as a man with mighty tidings and no language intensely communicative but inarticulate good round oaths had formerly compassed and expounded his noble emotions they were now quite beyond the comprehension of blasphemy even when emphasized and by this the poor lord divinely felt the case was different there is something impressive in a great human hulk writhing under the unutterable torments of a mastery he cannot contend with or account for or explain by means of intelligible words at first he took refuge in the depths of his contempt for women cupid gave him line when he had come to vent his worst of them the fair face now stamped on his brain beamed the more triumphantly so the harpooned whale rose to the surface and after a few convulsions surrendered his huge length my lord was in love with richard's young wife he gave proofs of it by burying himself beside her to her could she have seen it he gave further proofs of a real devotion in affecting and in her presence feeling nothing beyond a lively interest in her well being this wonder that when near her he should be cool and composed and when away from her wrapped in a tempest of desires was matter for what powers of cogitation the heavy nobleman possessed the hon peter tired of his journeys to and fro urged him to press the business lord mountfalcon was wiser or more scrupulous than his parasite almost every evening he saw lucy the inexperienced little wife apprehended no harm in his visits moreover richard had commended her to the care of lord mountfalcon and lady judith lady judith had left the island for london lord mountfalcon remained there could be no harm if she had ever thought so she no longer did secretly perhaps she was flattered lord mountfalcon was as well educated as it is the fortune of the run of titled elder sons to be he could talk and instruct he was a lord and he let her understand that he was wicked very wicked and that she improved him the heroine in common with the hero has her ambition to be of use in the world to do some good and the task of reclaiming a bad man is extremely seductive to good women dear to their tender bosoms as old china is a bad man they are mending lord mountfalcon had none of the arts of a libertine his gold his title and his person had hitherto preserved him from having long to sigh in vain or sigh at all possibly the hon peter did his villanies for him no alarm was given to lucy's pure instinct as might have been the case had my lord been over adept it was nice in her martyrdom to have a true friend to support her and really to be able to do something for that friend too simple minded to think much of his lordship's position she was yet a woman he a great nobleman does not scorn to acknowledge me and think something of me may have been one of the half thoughts passing through her now and then as she reflected in self defence on the proud family she had married into january was watering and freezing old earth by turns when the hon peter travelled down to the sun of his purse with great news he had no sooner broached his lordship's immediate weakness than mountfalcon began to plunge like a heavy dragoon in difficulties he swore by this and that he had come across an angel for his sins and would do her no hurt the next moment he swore she must be his though she cursed like a cat his lordship's illustrations were not choice i haven't advanced an inch he groaned brayder upon my soul that little woman could do anything with me by heaven i'd marry her to morrow here i am seeing her every day in the week out or in and what do you think she gets me to talk about history isn't it enough to make a fellow mad and there am i lecturing like a prig and by heaven while i'm at it i feel a pleasure in it and when i leave the house i should feel an immense gratification in shooting somebody what do they say in town not much said brayder significantly when's that fellow her husband coming down i rather hope we've settled him for life mount nobleman and parasite exchanged looks how d'ye mean brayder hummed an air and broke it to say he's in for don juan at a gallop that's all the deuce has bella got him mountfalcon asked with eagerness brayder handed my lord a letter it was dated from the sussex coast signed richard and was worded thus my beautiful devil since we're both devils together and have found each other out come to me at once or i shall be going somewhere in a hurry come my bright hell star i ran away from you and now i ask you to come to me you have taught me how devils love and i can't do without you come an hour after you receive this mountfalcon turned over the letter to see if there was any more complimentary love epistle he remarked and rising from his chair and striding about muttered the dog how infamously he treats his wife very bad said brayder how did you get hold of this strolled into belle's dressing room waiting for her turned over her pincushion hap hazard you know her trick by jove i think that girl does it on purpose thank heaven i haven't written her any letters for an age is she going to him not she but it's odd mount did you ever know her refuse money before she tore up the cheque in style and presented me the fragments with two or three of the delicacies of language she learnt at your academy i rather like to hear a woman swear it embellishes her mountfalcon took counsel of his parasite as to the end the letter could be made to serve both conscientiously agreed that richard's behaviour to his wife was infamous and that he at least deserved no mercy but said his lordship it won't do to show the letter at first she'll be swearing it's false and then she'll stick to him closer i know the sluts the rule of contrary said brayder carelessly she must see the trahison with her eyes they believe their eyes there's your chance mount you step in you give her revenge and consolation two birds at one shot that's what they like you're an ass brayder the nobleman exclaimed you're an infernal blackguard you talk of this little woman as if she and other women were all of a piece i don't see anything i gain by this confounded letter her husband's a brute that's clear will you leave it to me mount be damned before i do muttered my lord thank you now see how this will end you're too soft mount you'll be made a fool of i tell you brayder there's nothing to be done if i carry her off i've been on the point of doing it every day what'll come of that she'll look i can't stand her eyes i shall be a fool worse off with her than i am now mountfalcon yawned despondently and what do you think he pursued isn't it enough to make a fellow gnash his teeth she'she mentioned something in an underbreath and turned red as he said it hm brayder put up his mouth and rapped the handle of his cane on his chin that's disagreeable mount you don't exactly want to act in that character you haven't got a diploma bother do you think i love her a bit less broke out my lord in a frenzy by heaven i'd read to her by her bedside and talk that infernal history to her if it pleased her all day and all night you're evidently graduating for a midwife mount the nobleman appeared silently to accept the imputation what do they say in town he asked again brayder said the sole question was whether it was maid wife or widow i'll go to her this evening mountfalcon resumed after to judge by the cast of his face reflecting deeply i'll go to her this evening she shall know what infernal torment she makes me suffer do you mean to say she don't know it hasn't an idea thinks me a friend and so by heaven i'll be to her a hm went the honourable peter this way to the sign of the green man ladies do you want to be pitched out of the window brayder once was enough mount the salvage man is strong i may have forgotten the trick of alighting on my feet there there i'll be sworn she's excessively innocent and thinks you a disinterested friend i'll go to her this evening mountfalcon repeated she shall know what damned misery it is to see her in such a position i can't hold out any longer deceit's horrible to such a girl as that i'd rather have her cursing me than speaking and looking as she does dear little girl she's only a child you haven't an idea how sensible that little woman is have you inquired the cunning one my belief is brayder that there are angels among women said mountfalcon evading his parasite's eye as he spoke to the world lord mountfalcon was the thoroughly wicked man his parasite simply ingeniously dissipated full many a man of god had thought it the easier task to reclaim the hon peter lucy received her noble friend by firelight that evening and sat much in the shade she offered to have the candles brought in he begged her to allow the room to remain as it was i have something to say to you he observed with a certain solemnity yes to me said lucy quickly lord mountfalcon knew he had a great deal to say but how to say it and what it exactly was he did not know' you conceal it admirably he began but you must be very lonely here i fear unhappy i should have been lonely but for your kindness my lord said lucy i am not unhappy her face was in shade and could not belie her is there any help that one who would really be your friend might give you mrs feverel none indeed that i know of lucy replied who can help us to pay for our sins at least you may permit me to endeavour to pay my debts since you have helped me to wash out some of any sins ah my lord said lucy not displeased it is sweet for a woman to believe she has drawn the serpent's teeth i tell you the truth lord mountfalcon went on what object could i have in deceiving you i know you quite above flattery so different from other women oh pray do not say that interposed lucy according to my experience then but you say you have met such such very bad women i have and now that i meet a good one it is my misfortune your misfortune lord mountfalcon yes and i might say more his lordship held impressively mute how strange men are thought lucy he had some unhappy secret tom bakewell who had a habit of coming into the room on various pretences during the nobleman's visits put a stop to the revelation if his lordship intended to make any when they were alone again lucy said smiling do you know i am always ashamed to ask you to begin to read mountfalcon stared to read oh ha yes he remembered his evening duties very happy i'm sure let me see where were we the life of the emperor julian but indeed i feel quite ashamed to ask you to read my lord it's new to me like a new world hearing about emperors and armies and things that really have been on the earth we walk upon it fills my mind but it must have ceased to interest you and i was thinking that i would not tease you any more your pleasure is mine mrs feverel 'pon my honour i'd read till i was hoarse to hear your remarks are you laughing at me do i look so lord mountfalcon had fine full eyes and by merely dropping the lids he could appear to endow them with mental expression no you are not said lucy i must thank you for your forbearance the nobleman went on his honour loudly now it was an object of lucy's to have him reading for his sake for her sake and for somebody else's sake which somebody else was probably considered first in the matter when he was reading to her he seemed to be legitimizing his presence there and though she had no doubts or suspicions whatever she was easier in her heart while she had him employed in that office so she rose to fetch the book laid it open on the table at his lordship's elbow and quietly waited to ring for candles when he should be willing to commence that evening lord mountfalcon could not get himself up to the farce and he felt a pity for the strangely innocent unprotected child with anguish hanging over her that withheld the words he wanted to speak or insinuate he sat silent and did nothing what i do not like him for said lucy meditatively is his changing his religion he would have been such a hero but for that i could have loved him who is it you could have loved mrs feverel lord mountfalcon asked the emperor julian oh the emperor julian well he was an apostate but then you know he meant what he was about he didn't even do it for a woman for a woman cried lucy what man would for a woman i would you lord mountfalcon yes i'd turn catholic to morrow you make me very unhappy if you say that my lord then i'll unsay it lucy slightly shuddered she put her hand upon the bell to ring for lights do you reject a convert mrs feverel said the nobleman oh yes yes i do one who does not give his conscience i would not have if he gives his heart and body can he give more lucy's hand pressed the bell she did not like the doubtful light with one who was so unscrupulous lord mountfalcon had never spoken in this way before he spoke better too she missed the aristocratic twang in his voice and the hesitation for words and the fluid lordliness with which he rolled over difficulties in speech simultaneously with the sounding of the bell the door opened and presented tom bakewell there was a double knock at the same instant at the street door lucy delayed to give orders can it be a letter tom so late she said changing colour pray run and see that an't powst tom remarked as he obeyed his mistress are you very anxious for a letter mrs feverel lord mountfalcon inquired oh no yes i am very said lucy her quick ear caught the tones of a voice she remembered that dear old thing has come to see me she cried starting up tom ushered a bunch of black satin into the room mrs berry said lucy running up to her and kissing her me my darlin' mrs berry breathless and rosy with her journey returned the salute me truly it is in fault of a better for i ain't one to stand by and give the devil his licence roamin' and the salt sure enough have spilte my bride gown at the beginnin' which ain't the best sign bless ye oh here he is she beheld a male figure in a chair by the half light and swung around to address him you bad man she held aloft one of her fat fingers i've come on ye like a bolt i have and goin' to make ye do your duty naughty boy but your my darlin' babe she melted as was her custom and i'll never meet you and not give to ye the kiss of a mother before lord mountfalcon could find time to expostulate the soft woman had him by the neck and was down among his luxurious whiskers ha she gave a smothered shriek and fell back what hair's that tom bakewell just then illumined the transaction oh my gracious mrs berry breathed with horror i been and kiss a strange man lucy half laughing but in dreadful concern begged the noble lord to excuse the woful mistake extremely flattered highly favoured i'm sure said his lordship re arranging his disconcerted moustache may i beg the pleasure of an introduction my husband's dear old nurse mrs berry said lucy taking her hand to lend her countenance lord mountfalcon mrs berry mrs berry sought grace while she performed a series of apologetic bobs and wiped the perspiration from her forehead lucy put her into a chair lord mountfalcon asked for an account of her passage over to the island receiving distressingly full particulars by which it was revealed that the softness of her heart was only equalled by the weakness of her stomach the recital calmed mrs berry down well and where's my where's mr richard yer husband my dear mrs berry turned from her tale to question did you expect to see him here said lucy in a broken voice and where else my love since he haven't been seen in london a whole fortnight lucy did not speak we will dismiss the emperor julian till to morrow i think said lord mountfalcon rising and bowing lucy gave him her hand with mute thanks he touched it distantly embraced mrs berry in a farewell bow and was shown out of the house by tom bakewell the moment he was gone mrs berry threw up her arms did ye ever know sich a horrid thing to go and happen to a virtuous woman she exclaimed i could cry at it i could to be goin' and kissin' a strange hairy man oh dear me what's cornin' next i wonder whiskers thinks i for i know the touch o' whiskers 't ain't like other hair what have he growed a crop that sudden i says to myself and it flashed on me i been and made a awful mistake and the lights come in and i see that great hairy man beggin' his pardon nobleman and if i could 'a dropped through the floor out o' sight o' men drat 'em they're al'ays in the way that they are mrs berry lucy checked her did you expect to find him here askin' that solemn retorted berry what him your husband o' course i did and you got him somewheres hid i have not heard from my husband for fifteen days said lucy and her tears rolled heavily off her cheeks not heer from him fifteen days berry echoed o mrs berry dear kind mrs berry have you no news nothing to tell me i've borne it so long they're cruel to me mrs berry oh do you know if i have offended him my husband while he wrote i did not complain i could live on his letters for years but not to hear from him to think i have ruined him and that he repents do they want to take him from me do they want me dead o mrs berry i've had no one to speak out my heart to all this time and i cannot cannot help crying mrs berry mrs berry was inclined to be miserable at what she heard from lucy's lips and she was herself full of dire apprehension but it was never this excellent creature's system to be miserable in company the sight of a sorrow that was not positive and could not refer to proof set her resolutely the other way fiddle faddle she said i'd like to see him repent he won't find anywheres a beauty like his own dear little wife and he know it now look you here my dear you blessed weepin' pet the man that could see ye with that hair of yours there in ruins and he backed by the law and not rush into your arms and hold ye squeezed for life he ain't got much man in him i say and no one can say that of my babe i was sayin' look here to comfort ye oh why to be sure he've got some surprise for ye and so've i my lamb hark now his father've come to town like a good reasonable man at last to u nite ye both and bring your bodies together as your hearts is for everlastin' now ain't that news oh cried lucy that takes my last hope away i thought he had gone to his father she burst into fresh tears mrs berry paused disturbed belike he's travellin' after him she suggested fifteen days mrs berry ah fifteen weeks my dear after sieh a man as that he's a regular meteor is sir austin feverel raynham abbey well so hark you here i says to myself that knows him for i did think my babe was in his natural nest i says the bar'net'll never write for you both to come up and beg forgiveness so down i'll go and fetch you up for there was your mistake my dear ever to leave your husband to go away from ye one hour in a young marriage it's dangerous it's mad it's wrong and it's only to be righted by your obeyin' of me as i commands it for i has my fits though i am a soft 'un obey me and ye'll be happy tomorrow or the next to it lucy was willing to see comfort she was weary of her self inflicted martyrdom and glad to give herself up to somebody else's guidance utterly but why does he not write to me mrs berry 'cause 'cause who can tell the why of men my dear but that he love ye faithful i'll swear haven't he groaned in my arms that he couldn't come to ye weak wretch hasn't he swore how he loved ye to me poor young man but this is your fault my sweet yes it be you should 'a followed my 'dvice at the fust 'stead o' going into your 'eroics about this and t'other here mrs berry poured forth fresh sentences on matrimony pointed especially at young couples i should 'a been a fool if i hadn't suffered myself she confessed so i'll thank my berry if i makes you wise in season lucy smoothed her ruddy plump cheeks and gazed up affectionately into the soft woman's kind brown eyes endearing phrases passed from mouth to mouth and as she gazed lucy blushed as one who has something very secret to tell very sweet very strange but cannot quite bring herself to speak it well these's three men in my life i kissed said mrs berry too much absorbed in her extraordinary adventure to notice the young wife's struggling bosom three men and one a nobleman he've got more whisker than my berry i wonder what the man thought ten to one he'll think now i was glad o' my chance they're that vain whether they's lords or commons how was i to know i nat'ral thinks none but her husband'd sit in that chair ha and in the dark and alone with ye mrs berry hardened her eyes and your husband away what do this mean tell to me child what it mean his bein' here alone without ere a candle lord mountfalcon is the only friend i have here said lucy he is very kind he comes almost every evening lord montfalcon that his name mrs berry exclaimed i been that flurried by the man i didn't mind it at first he come every evenin' and your husband out o' sight my goodness me it's gettin' worse and worse and what do he come for now ma'am now tell me candid what ye do together here in the dark of an evenin' mrs berry glanced severely o mrs berry please not to speak in that way i don't like it said lucy pouting what do he come for i ask because he is kind mrs berry he sees me very lonely and wishes to amuse me and he tells me of things i know nothing about and and wants to be a teachin' some of his things mayhap mrs berry interrupted with a ruffled breast you are a very ungenerous suspicious naughty old woman said lucy chiding her and you're a silly unsuspectin' little bird mrs berry retorted as she returned her taps on the cheek you haven't told me what ye do together and what's his excuse for comin' well then mrs berry almost every evening that he comes we read history and he explains the battles and talks to me about the great men and he says i'm not silly mrs berry that's one bit o' lime on your wings my bird history indeed history to a young married lovely woman alone in the dark a pretty history why i know that man's name my dear he's a notorious living rake that lord montfalcon no woman's safe with him ah but he hasn't deceived me mrs berry he has not pretended he was good more's his art quoth the experienced dame so you read history together in the dark my dear i was unwell to night mrs berry i wanted him not to see my face look there's the book open ready for him when the candles come in and now you dear kind darling old thing let me kiss you for coming to me i do love you talk of other things so we will said mrs berry softening to lucy's caresses so let us a nobleman indeed alone with a young wife in the dark and she sich a beauty i say this shall be put a stop to now and henceforth on the spot it shall he won't meneuvele bessy berry with his arts there i drop him i'm dyin' for a cup o' tea my dear lucy got up to ring the bell and as mrs berry incapable of quite dropping him was continuing to say let him go and boast i kiss him he ain't nothin' to be 'shamed of in a chaste woman's kiss unawares which men don't get too often in their lives i can assure 'em her eye surveyed lucy's figure lo when lucy returned to her mrs berry surrounded her with her arms and drew her into feminine depths oh you blessed she cried in most meaning tone you good lovin' proper little wife you what is it mrs berry lisps lucy opening the most innocent blue eyes as if i couldn't see you pet it was my flurry blinded me or i'd 'a marked ye the fast shock thinkin' to deceive me mrs berry's eyes spoke generations lucy's wavered she coloured all over and hid her face on the bounteous breast that mounted to her you're a sweet one murmured the soft woman patting her back and rocking her you're a rose you are and a bud on your stalk haven't told a word to your husband my dear she asked quickly lucy shook her head looking sly and shy that's right we'll give him a surprise let it come all at once on him and thinks he losin' breath 'i'm a father' nor a hint even you haven't give him lucy kissed her to indicate it was quite a secret oh you are a sweet one said bessy berry and rocked her more closely and lovingly then these two had a whispered conversation from which let all of male persuasion retire a space nothing under one mile returning after a due interval we see mrs berry counting on her fingers' ends concluding the sum she cries prophetically now this right everything a baby in the balance now i say this angel infant come from on high it's god's messenger my love and it's not wrong to say so he thinks you worthy or you wouldn't 'a had one not for all the tryin' in the world you wouldn't and some tries hard enough poor creatures now let us rejice and make merry i'm for cryin' and laughin' one and the same this is the blessed seal of matrimony which berry never stamp on me it's be hoped it's a boy make that man a grandfather and his grandchild a son and you got him safe oh this is what i call happiness and i'll have my tea a little stronger in consequence i declare i could get tipsy to know this joyful news so mrs berry carolled she had her tea a little stronger she ate and she drank she rejoiced and made merry the bliss of the chaste was hers says lucy demurely now you know why i read history and that sort of books do i replies berry belike i do since what you done's so good my darlin' i'm agreeable to anything a fig for all the lords they can't come anigh a baby you may read voyages and travels my dear and romances and tales of love and war you cut the riddle in your own dear way and that's all i cares for no but you don't understand persists lucy i only read sensible books and talk of serious things because i'm sure because i have heard saydear mrs berry don't you understand now mrs berry smacked her knees only to think of her bein' that thoughtful and she a catholic too never tell me that people of one religion ain't as good as another after that why you want to make him a historian to be sure and that rake of a lord who've been comin' here playin' at wolf you been and made him unbeknown to himself sort o' tutor to the unborn blessed ha ha say that little women ain't got art ekal to the cunningest of 'em oh i understand why to be sure didn't i know a lady a widow of a clergyman he was a postermost child and afore his birth that women read nothin' but blair's 'grave' over and over again from the end to the beginnin' that's a serious book very hard readin' and at four years of age that child that come of it reelly was the piousest infant he was like a little curate his eyes was up he talked so solemn mrs berry imitated the little curate's appearance and manner of speaking so she got her wish for one but at this lady lucy laughed they chattered on happily till bedtime lucy arranged for mrs berry to sleep with her if it's not dreadful to ye my sweet sleepin' beside a woman said mrs berry i know it were to me shortly after my berry and i felt it it don't somehow seem nat'ral after matrimony a woman in your bed i was obliged to have somebody for the cold sheets do give ye the creeps when you've been used to that that's different upstairs they went together lucy not sharing these objections then lucy opened certain drawers and exhibited pretty caps and laced linen all adapted for a very small body all the work of her own hands and mrs berry praised them and her you been guessing a boy woman like she said then they cooed and kissed and undressed by the fire and knelt at the bedside with their arms about each other praying both praying for the unborn child and mrs berry pressed lucy's waist the moment she was about to breathe the petition to heaven to shield and bless that coming life and thereat lucy closed to her and felt a strong love for her then lucy got into bed first leaving berry to put out the light and before she did so berry leaned over her and eyed her roguishly saying i never see ye like this but i'm half in love with ye myself you blushin' beauty sweet's your eyes and your hair do take one so lyin' back i'd never forgive my father if he kep me away from ye four and twenty hours just husband o' that berry pointed at the young wife's loveliness ye look so ripe with kisses and there they are a languishin' you never look so but in your bed ye beauty just as it ought to be lucy had to pretend to rise to put out the light before berry would give up her amorous chaste soliloquy then they lay in bed and mrs berry fondled her and arranged for their departure to morrow and reviewed richard's emotions when he came to hear he was going to be made a father by her and hinted at lucy's delicious shivers when richard was again in his rightful place which she bessy berry now usurped and all sorts of amorous sweet things enough to make one fancy the adage subverted that stolen fruits are sweetest she drew such glowing pictures of bliss within the law and the limits of the conscience till at last worn out lucy murmured peepy dear berry and the soft woman gradually ceased her chirp bessy berry did not sleep she lay thinking of the sweet brave heart beside her and listening to lucy's breath as it came and went squeezing the fair sleeper's hand now and then to ease her love as her reflections warmed a storm of wind came howling over the hampshire hills and sprang white foam on the water and shook the bare trees it passed leaving a thin cloth of snow on the wintry land the moon shone brilliantly berry heard the house dog bark his bark was savage and persistent she was roused by the noise by and by she fancied she heard a movement in the house then it seemed to her that the house door opened she cocked her ears and could almost make out voices in the midnight stillness she slipped from the bed locked and bolted the door of the room assured herself of lucy's unconsciousness and went on tiptoe to the window the trees all stood white to the north the ground glittered the cold was keen berry wrapped her fat arms across her bosom and peeped as close over into the garden as the situation of the window permitted berry was a soft not a timid woman and it happened this night that her thoughts were above the fears of the dark she was sure of the voices curiosity without a shade of alarm held her on the watch and gathering bundles of her day apparel round her neck and shoulders she silenced the chattering of her teeth as well as she could and remained stationary the low hum of the voices came to a break something was said in a louder tone the house door quietly shut a man walked out of the garden into the road he paused opposite her window and berry let the blind go back to its place and peeped from behind an edge of it he was in the shadow of the house so that it was impossible to discern much of his figure after some minutes he walked rapidly away and berry returned to the bed an icicle from which lucy's limbs sensitively shrank next morning mrs berry asked tom bakewell if he had been disturbed in the night tom the mysterious said he had slept like a top mrs berry went into the garden the snow was partially melted all save one spot just under the portal and there she saw the print of a man's foot by some strange guidance it occurred to her to go and find one of richard's boots she did so and unperceived she measured the sole of the boot in that solitary footmark there could be no doubt that it fitted she tried it from heel to toe a dozen times chapter xl sir austin feverel had come to town with the serenity of a philosopher who says 'tis now time and the satisfaction of a man who has not arrived thereat without a struggle he had almost forgiven his son his deep love for him had well nigh shaken loose from wounded pride and more tenacious vanity stirrings of a remote sympathy for the creature who had robbed him of his son and hewed at his system were in his heart of hearts this he knew and in his own mind he took credit for his softness but the world must not suppose him soft the world must think he was still acting on his system otherwise what would his long absence signify something highly unphilosophical so though love was strong and was moving him to a straightforward course the last tug of vanity drew him still aslant the aphorist read himself so well that to juggle with himself was a necessity as he wished the world to see him he beheld himself one who entirely put aside mere personal feelings one in whom parental duty based on the science of life was paramount a scientific humanist in short he was therefore rather surprised at a coldness in lady blandish's manner when he did appear at last said the lady in a sad way that sounded reproachfully now the scientific humanist had of course nothing to reproach himself with but where was richard adrian positively averred he was not with his wife if he had gone said the baronet he would have anticipated me by a few hours this when repeated to lady blandish should have propitiated her and shown his great forgiveness she however sighed and looked at him wistfully their converse was not happy and deeply intimate philosophy did not seem to catch her mind and fine phrases encountered a rueful assent more flattering to their grandeur than to their influence days went by richard did not present himself sir austin's pitch of self command was to await the youth without signs of impatience seeing this the lady told him her fears for richard and mentioned the rumour of him that was about if said the baronet this person his wife is what you paint her i do not share your fears for him i think too well of him if she is one to inspire the sacredness of that union i think too well of him it is impossible the lady saw one thing to be done call her to you she said have her with you at raynham recognize her it is the disunion and doubt that so confuses him and drives him wild i confess to you i hoped he had gone to her it seems not if she is with you his way will be clear will you do that science is notoriously of slow movement lady blandish's proposition was far too hasty for sir austin women rapid by nature have no idea of science we shall see her there in time emmeline at present let it be between me and my son he spoke loftily in truth it offended him to be asked to do anything when he had just brought himself to do so much a month elapsed and richard appeared on the scene the meeting between him and his father was not what his father had expected and had crooned over in the welsh mountains richard shook his hand respectfully and inquired after his health with the common social solicitude he then said during your absence sir i have taken the liberty without consulting you to do something in which you are more deeply concerned than myself i have taken upon myself to find out my mother and place her under my care i trust you will not think i have done wrong i acted as i thought best sir austin replied you are of an age richard to judge for yourself in such a case i would have you simply beware of deceiving yourself in imagining that you considered any one but yourself in acting as you did i have not deceived myself sir said richard and the interview was over both hated an exposure of the feelings and in that both were satisfied but the baronet as one who loves hoped and looked for tones indicative of trouble and delight in the deep heart and richard gave him none of those the young man did not even face him as he spoke if their eyes met by chance richard's were defiantly cold his whole bearing was changed this rash marriage has altered him said the very just man of science in life and that meant it has debased him he pursued his reflections i see in him the desperate maturity of a suddenly ripened nature and but for my faith that good work is never lost what should i think of the toil of my years lost perhaps to me lost to him it may show itself in his children the philosopher we may conceive has contentment in benefiting embryos but it was a somewhat bitter prospect to sir austin bitterly he felt the injury to himself one little incident spoke well of richard a poor woman called at the hotel while he was missing the baronet saw her and she told him a tale that threw christian light on one part of richard's nature but this might gratify the father in sir austin it did not touch the man of science a feverel his son would not do less he thought he sat down deliberately to study his son no definite observations enlightened him richard ate and drank joked and laughed he was generally before adrian in calling for a fresh bottle he talked easily of current topics his gaiety did not sound forced in all he did nevertheless there was not the air of a youth who sees a future before him sir austin put that down it might be carelessness and wanton blood for no one could say he had much on his mind the man of science was not reckoning that richard also might have learned to act and wear a mask dead subjects this is to say people not on their guard he could penetrate and dissect it is by a rare chance as scientific men well know that one has an opportunity of examining the structure of the living however that rare chance was granted to sir austin they were engaged to dine with mrs doria at the foreys' and walked down to her in the afternoon father and son arm in arm adrian beside them previously the offended father had condescended to inform his son that it would shortly be time for him to return to his wife indicating that arrangements would ultimately be ordered to receive her at raynham richard had replied nothing which might mean excess of gratitude or hypocrisy in concealing his pleasure or any one of the thousand shifts by which gratified human nature expresses itself when all is made to run smooth with it now mrs berry had her surprise ready charged for the young husband she had lucy in her own house waiting for him every day she expected him to call and be overcome by the rapturous surprise and every day knowing his habit of frequenting the park she marched lucy thither under the plea that master richard whom she had already christened should have an airing the round of the red winter sun was behind the bare kensington chestnuts when these two parties met happily for lucy and the hope she bore in her bosom she was perversely admiring a fair horsewoman galloping by at the moment mrs berry plucked at her gown once or twice to prepare her eyes for the shock but lucy's head was still half averted and thinks mrs berry twon't hurt her if she go into his arms head foremost they were close mrs berry performed the bob preliminary richard held her silent with a terrible face he grasped her arm and put her behind him other people intervened lucy saw nothing to account for berry's excessive flutter berry threw it on the air and some breakfast bacon which she said she knew in the morning while she ate it was bad for the bile and which probably was the cause of her bursting into tears much to lucy's astonishment what you ate makes you cry mrs berry it's all mrs berry pressed at her heart and leaned sideways it's all stomach my dear don't ye mind and becoming aware of her unfashionable behaviour she trailed off to the shelter of the elms you have a singular manner with old ladies said sir austin to his son after berry had been swept aside scarcely courteous she behaved like a mad woman certainly are you ill my son richard was death pale his strong form smitten through with weakness the baronet sought adrian's eye adrian had seen lucy as they passed and he had a glimpse of richard's countenance while disposing of berry had lucy recognized them he would have gone to her unhesitatingly as she did not he thought it well under the circumstances to leave matters as they were he answered the baronet's look with a shrug are you ill richard sir austin again asked his son come on sir come on cried richard his father's further meditations as they stepped briskly to the foreys' gave poor ferry a character which one who lectures on matrimony and has kissed but three men in her life shrieks to hear the very title of richard will go to his wife to morrow sir austin said to adrian some time before they went in to dinner adrian asked him if he had chanced to see a young fair haired lady by the side of the old one richard had treated so peculiarly and to the baronet's acknowledgment that he remembered to have observed such a person adrian said that was his wife sir sir austin could not dissect the living subject as if a bullet had torn open the young man's skull and some blast of battle laid his palpitating organization bare he watched every motion of his brain and his heart and with the grief and terror of one whose mental habit was ever to pierce to extremes not altogether conscious that he had hitherto played with life he felt that he was suddenly plunged into the stormful reality of it he projected to speak plainly to his son on all points that night richard is very gay mrs doris whispered her brother all will be right with him to morrow he replied for the game had been in his hands so long so long had he been the god of the machine that having once resolved to speak plainly and to act he was to a certain extent secure bad as the thing to mend might be i notice he has rather a wild laugh i don't exactly like his eyes said mrs doria you will see a change in him to morrow the man of science remarked it was reserved for mrs doria herself to experience that change in the middle of the dinner a telegraphic message from her son in law worthy john todhunter reached the house stating that clare was alarmingly ill bidding her come instantly she cast about for some one to accompany her and fixed on richard before he would give his consent for richard to go sir austin desired to speak with him apart and in that interview he said to his son my dear richard it was my intention that we should come to an understanding together this night but the time is short poor helen cannot spare many minutes let me then say that you deceived me and that i forgive you we fix our seal on the past you will bring your wife to me when you return and very cheerfully the baronet looked down on the generous future he thus founded will you have her at raynham at once sir said richard yes my son when you bring her are you mocking me sir pray what do you mean i ask you to receive her at once well the delay cannot be long i do not apprehend that you will be kept from your happiness many days i think it will be some time sir said richard sighing deeply and what mental freak is this that can induce you to postpone it and play with your first duty what is my first duty sir since you are married to be with your wife i have heard that from an old woman called berry said richard to himself not intending irony will you receive her at once he asked resolutely the baronet was clouded by his son's reception of his graciousness his grateful prospect had formerly been richard's marriage the culmination of his system richard had destroyed his participation in that he now looked for a pretty scene in recompense richard leading up his wife to him and both being welcomed by him paternally and so held one ostentatious minute in his embrace he said before you return i demur to receiving her very well sir replied his son and stood as if he had spoken all really you tempt me to fancy you already regret your rash proceeding the baronet exclaimed and the next moment it pained him he had uttered the words richard's eyes were so sorrowfully fierce it pained him but he divined in that look a history and he could not refrain from glancing acutely and asking do you regret it sir the question aroused one of those struggles in the young man's breast which a passionate storm of tears may still and which sink like leaden death into the soul when tears come not richard's eyes had the light of the desert do you his father repeated you tempt me i almost fear you do at the thought for he expressed his mind the pity that he had for richard was not pure gold ask me what i think of her sir ask me what she is ask me what it is to have taken one of god's precious angels and chained her to misery ask me what it is to have plunged a sword into her heart and to stand over her and see such a creature bleeding do i regret that why yes i do would you his eyes flew hard at his father under the ridge of his eyebrows sir austin winced and reddened did he understand there is ever in the mind's eye a certain wilfulness we see and understand we see and won't understand tell me why you passed by her as you did this afternoon he said gravely and in the same voice richard answered i passed her because i could not do otherwise your wife richard yes my wife if she had seen you richard god spared her that mrs doria bustling in practical haste and bearing richard's hat and greatcoat in her energetic hands came between them at this juncture dimples of commiseration were in her cheeks while she kissed her brother's perplexed forehead she forgot her trouble about clare deploring his fatuity sir austin was forced to let his son depart as of old he took counsel with adrian and the wise youth was soothing somebody has kissed him sir and the chaste boy can't get over it this absurd suggestion did more to appease the baronet than if adrian had given a veritable reasonable key to richard's conduct it set him thinking that it might be a prudish strain in the young man's mind due to the system in difficulties i may have been wrong in one thing he said with an air of the utmost doubt of it i perhaps was wrong in allowing him so much liberty during his probation adrian pointed out to him that he had distinctly commanded it yes yes that is on me his was an order of mind that would accept the most burdensome charges and by some species of moral usury make a profit out of them clare was little talked of adrian attributed the employment of the telegraph to john todhunter's uxorious distress at a toothache or possibly the first symptoms of an heir to his house that child's mind has disease in it she is not sound said the baronet on the door step of the hotel when they returned stood mrs berry her wish to speak a few words with the baronet reverentially communicated she was ushered upstairs into his room mrs berry compressed her person in the chair she was beckoned to occupy well' ma'am you have something to say observed the baronet for she seemed loth to commence wishin' i hadn't mrs berry took him up and mindful of the good rule to begin at the beginning pursued i dare say sir austin you don't remember me and i little thought when last we parted our meeting 'd be like this twenty year don't go over one without showin' it no more than twenty ox it's a might o' time twenty year leastways not quite twenty it ain't round figures are best adrian remarked in them round figures a be loved son have growed up and got himself married said mrs berry diving straight into the case sir austin then learnt that he had before him the culprit who had assisted his son in that venture it was a stretch of his patience to hear himself addressed on a family matter but he was naturally courteous he came to my house sir austin a stranger if twenty year alters us as have knowed each other on the earth how must they alter they that we parted with just come from heaven and a heavenly babe he were so sweet so strong so fat adrian laughed aloud mrs berry bumped a curtsey to him in her chair continuing i wished afore i spoke to say how thankful am i bound to be for my pension not cut short as have offended so but that i know sir austin feverel raynham abbey ain't one o' them that likes to hear their good deeds pumlished and a pension to me now it's something more than it were for a pension and pretty rosy cheeks in a maid which i was that's a bait many a man'll bite that won't so a forsaken wife if you will speak to the point ma'am i will listen to you the baronet interrupted her it's the beginnin' that's the worst and that's over thank the lord so i'll speak sir austin and say my say lord speed me believin' our idees o' matrimony to be sim'lar then i'll say once married married for life yes i don't even like widows for i can't stop at the grave not at the tomb i can't stop my husband's my husband and if i'm a body at the resurrection i say speaking humbly my berry is the husband o' my body and to think of two claimin' of me then it makes me hot all over such is my notion of that state 'tween man and woman no givin' in marriage o' course i know and if so i'm single the baronet suppressed a smile really my good woman you wander very much beggin' pardon sir austin but i has my point before me all the same and i'm comin' to it ac knowledgin' our error it'd done and bein' done it's writ aloft oh if you ony knew what a sweet young creature she be indeed 'taint all of humble birth that's unworthy sir austin and she got her idees too she reads history she talk that sensible as would surprise ye but for all that she's a prey to the artful o' men unpertected and it's a young marriage but there's no fear for her as far as she go the fear's t'other way there's that in a man at the commencement which make of him lord knows what if you any way interferes whereas a woman bides quiet it's consolation catch her which is what we mean by seduein' whereas a man he's a savage sir austin turned his face to adrian who was listening with huge delight well ma'am i see you have something in your mind if you would only come to it quickly then here's my point sir austin i say you bred him so as there ain't another young gentleman like him in england and proud he make me and as for her i'll risk sayin' it's done and no harm you might search england through and nowhere will ye find a maid that's his match like his own wife then there they be are they together as should be o lord no months they been divided then she all lonely and exposed i went and fetched her out of seducers' ways which they may say what they like but the inn'cent is most open to when they're healthy and confidin' i fetch her and the liberty boxed her safe in my own house so much for that sweet that you may do with women but it's him mr richard i am bold i know but there i'm in for it and the lord'll help me it's him sir austin in this great metropolis warm from a young marriage it's him and i say nothin' of her and how sweet she bears it and it's eating her at a time when natur' should have no other trouble but the one that's goin' on it's him and i ask so bold shall there and a christian gentlemen his father shall there be a tug 'tween him as a son and him as a husband soon to be somethin' else i speak bold out i'd have sons obey their fathers but a priest's words spoke over them which they're now in my ears i say i ain't a doubt on earth i'm sure there ain't one in heaven which dooty's the holier of the two sir austin heard her to an end their views on the junction of the sexes were undoubtedly akin to be lectured on his prime subject however was slightly disagreeable and to be obliged mentally to assent to this old lady's doctrine was rather humiliating when it could not be averred that he had latterly followed it out he sat cross legged and silent a finger to his temple one gets so addle gated thinkin' many things said mrs berry simply that's why we see wonder clever people goin' wrong to my mind i think it's al'ays the plan in a dielemmer to pray god and walk forward the keen witted soft woman was tracking the baronet's thoughts and she had absolutely run him down and taken an explanation out of his mouth by which mrs berry was to have been informed that he had acted from a principle of his own and devolved a wisdom she could not be expected to comprehend of course he became advised immediately that it would be waste of time to direct such an explanation to her inferior capacity he gave her his hand saying my son has gone out of town to see his cousin who is ill he will return in two or three days and then they will both come to me at raynham mrs berry took the tips of his fingers and went half way to the floor perpendicularly he pass her like a stranger in the park this evenin' she faltered ah said the baronet yes well they will be at raynham before the week is over mrs berry was not quite satisfied not of his own accord he pass that sweet young wife of his like a stranger this day sir austin i must beg you not to intrude further ma'am mrs berry bobbed her bunch of a body out of the room all's well that ends well she said to herself it's just bad inquirin' too close among men we must take 'em somethin' like providence as they come thank heaven i kep' back the baby in mrs berry's eyes the baby was the victorious reserve adrian asked his chief what he thought of that specimen of woman i think i have not met a better in my life said the baronet mingling praise and sarcasm clare lies in her bed as placid as in the days when she breathed her white hands stretched their length along the sheets at peace from head to feet she needs iron no more richard is face to face with death for the first time he sees the sculpture of clay the spark gone clare gave her mother the welcome of the dead this child would have spoken nothing but kind commonplaces had she been alive she was dead and none knew her malady on her fourth finger were two wedding rings when hours of weeping had silenced the mother's anguish she for some comfort she saw in it pointed out that strange thing to richard speaking low in the chamber of the dead and then he learnt that it was his own lost ring clare wore in the two worlds he learnt from her husband that clare's last request had been that neither of the rings should be removed she had written it she would not speak it i beg of my husband and all kind people who may have the care of me between this and the grave to bury me with my hands untouched the tracing of the words showed the bodily torment she was suffering as she wrote them on a scrap of paper found beside her pillow in wonder as the dim idea grew from the waving of clare's dead hand richard paced the house and hung about the awful room dreading to enter it reluctant to quit it the secret clare had buried while she lived arose with her death he saw it play like flame across her marble features the memory of her voice was like a knife at his nerves his coldness to her started up accusingly her meekness was bitter blame on the evening of the fourth day her mother came to him in his bedroom with a face so white that he asked himself if aught worse could happen to a mother than the loss of her child choking she said to him read this and thrust a leather bound pocket book trembling in his hand she would not breathe to him what it was she entreated him not to open it before her tell me she said tell me what you think john must not hear of it i have nobody to consult but you o richard my diary was written in the round hand of clare's childhood on the first page the first name his eye encountered was his own richard's fourteenth birthday i have worked him a purse and put it under his pillow because he is going to have plenty of money he does not notice me now because he has a friend now and he is ugly but richard is not and never will be the occurrences of that day were subsequently recorded and a childish prayer to god for him set down step by step he saw her growing mind in his history as she advanced in years she began to look back and made much of little trivial remembrances all bearing upon him we went into the fields and gathered cowslips together and pelted each other and i told him he used to call them 'coals sleeps' when he was a baby and he was angry at my telling him for he does not like to be told he was ever a baby he remembered the incident and remembered his stupid scorn of her meek affection little clare how she lived before him in her white dress and pink ribbons and soft dark eyes upstairs she was lying dead he read on mama says there is no one in the world like richard and i am sure there is not not in the whole world he says he is going to be a great general and going to the wars if he does i shall dress myself as a boy and go after him and he will not know me till i am wounded oh i pray he will never never be wounded i wonder what i should feel if richard was ever to die upstairs clare was lying dead lady blandish said there was a likeness between richard and me richard said i hope i do not hang down my head as she does he is angry with me because i do not look people in the face and speak out but i know i am not looking after earthworms yes he had told her that a shiver seized him at the recollection then it came to a period when the words richard kissed me stood by themselves and marked a day in her life afterwards it was solemnly discovered that richard wrote poetry he read one of his old forgotten compositions penned when he had that ambition thy truth to me is truer than horse or dog or blade thy vows to me are fewer than ever maiden made thou steppest from thy splendour to make my life a song my bosom shall be tender as thine has risen strong all the verses were transcribed it is he who is the humble knight clare explained at the close and his lady is a queen any queen would throw her crown away for him it came to that period when clare left raynham with her mother richard was not sorry to lose me he only loves boys and men something tells me i shall never see raynham again he was dressed in blue he said good bye clare and kissed me on the cheek richard never kisses me on the mouth he did not know i went to his bed and kissed him while he was asleep he sleeps with one arm under his head and the other out on the bed i moved away a bit of his hair that was over his eyes i wanted to cut it i have one piece i do not let anybody see i am unhappy not even mama she says i want iron i am sure i do not i like to write my name clare doria forey richard's is richard doria feverel his breast rose convulsively clare doria forey he knew the music of that name he had heard it somewhere it sounded faint and mellow now behind the hills of death he could not read for tears it was midnight the hour seemed to belong to her the awful stillness and the darkness were clare's clare's voice clear and cold from the grave possessed it painfully with blinded eyes he looked over the breathless pages she spoke of his marriage and her finding the ring i knew it was his i knew he was going to be married that morning i saw him stand by the altar when they laughed at breakfast his wife must be so beautiful richard's wife perhaps he will love me better now he is married mama says they must be separated that is shameful if i can help him i will i pray so that he may be happy i hope god hears poor sinners' prayers i am very sinful nobody knows it as i do they say i am good but i know when i look on the ground i am not looking after earthworms as he said oh do forgive me god then she spoke of her own marriage and that it was her duty to obey her mother a blank in the diary ensued i have seen richard richard despises me was the next entry but now as he read his eyes were fixed and the delicate feminine handwriting like a black thread drew on his soul to one terrible conclusion i cannot live richard despises me i cannot bear the touch of my fingers or the sight of my face oh i understand him now he should not have kissed me so that last time i wished to die while his mouth was on mine further i have no escape richard said he would die rather than endure it i know he would why should i be afraid to do what he would do i think if my husband whipped me i could bear it better he is so kind and tries to make me cheerful he will soon be very unhappy i pray to god half the night i seem to be losing sight of my god the more i pray richard laid the book open on the table phantom surges seemed to be mounting and travelling for his brain had clare taken his wild words in earnest did she lie there dead he shrouded the thought he wrapped the thoughts in shrouds but he was again reading a quarter to one o'clock i shall not be alive this time to morrow i shall never see richard now i dreamed last night we were in the fields together and he walked with his arm round my waist we were children but i thought we were married and i showed him i wore his ring and he said if you always wear it clare you are as good as my wife then i made a vow to wear it for ever and ever it is not mama's fault she does not think as richard and i do of these things he is not a coward nor am i he hates cowards i have written to his father to make him happy perhaps when i am dead he will hear what i say i heard just now richard call distinctly clare come out to me surely he has not gone i am going i know not where i cannot think i am very cold the words were written larger and staggered towards the close as if her hand had lost mastery over the pen i can only remember richard now a boy a little boy and a big boy i am not sure now of his voice i can only remember certain words 'clari' and 'don ricardo' and his laugh he used to be full of fun once we laughed all day together tumbling in the hay then he had a friend and began to write poetry and be proud if i had married a young man he would have forgiven me but i should not have been happier i must have died god never looks on me it is past two o'clock the sheep are bleating outside it must be very cold in the ground good bye richard with his name it began and ended even to herself clare was not over communicative the book was slender yet her nineteen years of existence left half the number of pages white those last words drew him irresistibly to gaze on her there she lay the same impassive clare for a moment he wondered she had not moved to him she had become so different she who had just filled his ears with strange tidings it was not possible to think her dead she seemed to have been speaking to him all through his life his image was on that still heart he dismissed the night watchers from the room and remained with her alone till the sense of death oppressed him and then the shock sent him to the window to look for sky and stars behind a low broad pine hung with frosty mist he heard a bell wether of the flock in the silent fold death in life it sounded the mother found him praying at the foot of clare's bed she knelt by his side and they prayed and their joint sobs shook their bodies but neither of them shed many tears they held a dark unspoken secret in common they prayed god to forgive her clare was buried in the family vault of the todhunters her mother breathed no wish to have her lying at lobourne after the funeral what they alone upon earth knew brought them together richard she said the worst is over for me i have no one to love but you dear we have all been fighting against god and this richard you will come with me and be united to your wife and spare my brother what i suffer he answered the broken spirit i have killed one she sees me as i am i cannot go with you to my wife because i am not worthy to touch her hand and were i to go i should do this to silence my self contempt go you to her and when she asks of me say i have a death upon my head that no say that i am abroad seeking for that which shall cleanse me if i find it i shall come to claim her if not god help us all she had no strength to contest his solemn words or stay him and he went forth chapter xli a man with a beard saluted the wise youth adrian in the full blaze of piccadilly with a clap on the shoulder adrian glanced leisurely behind do you want to try my nerves my dear fellow i'm not a man of fashion happily or you would have struck the seat of them how are you that was his welcome to austin wentworth after his long absence austin took his arm and asked for news with the hunger of one who had been in the wilderness five years the whigs have given up the ghost my dear austin the free briton is to receive liberty's pearl the ballot the aristocracy has had a cycle's notice to quit the monarchy and old madeira are going out demos and cape wines are coming in they call it reform so you see your absence has worked wonders depart for another five years and you will return to ruined stomachs cracked sconces general upset an equality made perfect by universal prostration austin indulged him in a laugh i want to hear about ourselves how is old ricky you know of his what do they call it when greenhorns are licensed to jump into the milkpails of dairymaids a very charming little woman she makes by the way presentable quite old anacreon's rose in milk well everybody thought the system must die of it not a bit it continued to flourish in spite it's in a consumption now though emaciated lean raw spectral i've this morning escaped from raynham to avoid the sight of it i have brought our genial uncle hippias to town a delightful companion i said to him 'we've had a fine spring' 'ugh' he answers 'there's a time when you come to think the spring old' you should have heard how he trained out the 'old' i felt something like decay in my sap just to hear him in the prize fight of life my dear austin our uncle hippias has been unfairly hit below the belt let's guard ourselves there and go and order dinner but where's ricky now and what is he doing said austin ask what he has done the miraculous boy has gone and got a baby a child richard has one austin's clear eyes shone with pleasure i suppose it's not common among your tropical savages he has one one as big as two that has been the death blow to the system it bore the marriage the baby was too much for it could it swallow the baby 'twould live she the wonderful woman has produced a large boy i assure you it's quite amusing to see the system opening its mouth every hour of the day trying to gulp him down aware that it would be a consummate cure or a happy release by degrees austin learnt the baronet's proceedings and smiled sadly how has ricky turned out he asked what sort of a character has he the poor boy is ruined by his excessive anxiety about it character he has the character of a bullet with a treble charge of powder behind it enthusiasm is the powder that boy could get up an enthusiasm for the maiden days of ops he was going to reform the world after your fashion austin you have something to answer for unfortunately he began with the feminine side of it cupid proud of phoebus newly slain or pluto wishing to people his kingdom if you like put it into the soft head of one of the guileless grateful creatures to kiss him for his good work oh horror he never expected that conceive the system in the flesh and you have our richard the consequence is that this male peri refuses to enter his paradise though the gates are open for him the trumpets blow and the fair unspotted one awaits him fruitful within we heard of him last that he was trying the german waters preparatory to his undertaking the release of italy from the subjugation of the teuton let's hope they'll wash him he is in the company of lady judith felle your old friend the ardent female radical who married the decrepit to carry out her principles they always marry english lords or foreign princes i admire their tactics judith is bad for him in such a state i like her but she was always too sentimental said austin sentiment made her marry the old lord i suppose i like her for her sentiment austin sentimental people are sure to live long and die fat feeling that's the slayer coz sentiment 'tis the cajolery of existence the soft bloom which whoso weareth he or she is enviable would that i had more you're not much changed adrian i'm not a radical austin further inquiries responded to in adrian's figurative speech instructed austin that the baronet was waiting for his son in a posture of statuesque offended paternity before he would receive his daughter in law and grandson that was what adrian meant by the efforts of the system to swallow the baby we're in a tangle said the wise youth time will extricate us i presume or what is the venerable signor good for austin mused some minutes and asked for lucy's place of residence we'll go to her by and by said adrian i shall go and see her now said austin well we'll go and order the dinner first coz give me her address really austin you carry matters with too long a beard adrian objected don't you care what you eat he roared hoarsely looking humorously hurt i daresay not a slice out of him that's handy sauce du ciel go batten on the baby cannibal dinner at seven adrian gave him his own address and lucy's and strolled off to do the better thing overnight mrs berry had observed a long stranger in her tea cup posting him on her fingers and starting him with a smack he had vaulted lightly and thereby indicated that he was positively coming the next day she forgot him in the bustle of her duties and the absorption of her faculties in thoughts of the incomparable stranger lucy had presented to the world till a knock at the street door reminded her there he is she cried as she ran to open to him there's my stranger come never was a woman's faith in omens so justified the stranger desired to see mrs richard feverel he said his name was mr austin wentworth mrs berry clasped her hands exclaiming come at last and ran bolt out of the house to look up and down the street presently she returned with many excuses for her rudeness saying i expected to see her comin' home mr wentworth every day twice a day she go out to give her blessed angel an airing no leavin' the child with nursemaids for her she is a mother and good milk too thank the lord though her heart's so low indoors mrs berry stated who she was related the history of the young couple and her participation in it and admired the beard although i'd swear you don't wear it for ornament now she said having in the first impulse designed a stroke at man's vanity ultimately mrs berry spoke of the family complication and with dejected head and joined hands threw out dark hints about richard while austin was giving his cheerfuller views of the case lucy came in preceding the baby i am austin wentworth he said taking her hand they read each other's faces these two and smiled kinship your name is lucy she affirmed it softly and mine is austin as you know mrs berry allowed time for lucy's charms to subdue him and presented richard's representative who seeing a new face suffered himself to be contemplated before he commenced crying aloud and knocking at the doors of nature for something that was due to him ain't he a lusty darlin' says mrs berry ain't he like his own father there can't be no doubt about zoo zoo pitty pet look at his fists ain't he got passion ain't he a splendid roarer oh and she went off rapturously into baby language a fine boy certainly mrs berry exhibited his legs for further proof desiring austin's confirmation as to their being dumplings lucy murmured a word of excuse and bore the splendid roarer out of the room she might a done it here said mrs berry there's no prettier sight i say if her dear husband could but see that he's off in his heroics he want to be doin' all sorts o' things i say he'll never do anything grander than that baby you should 'a seen her uncle over that baby he came here for i said you shall see your own family my dear and so she thinks he come and he laughed over that baby in the joy of his heart poor man he cried he did you should see that mr thompson mr wentworth a friend o' mr richard's and a very modest minded young gentleman he worships her in his innocence it's a sight to see him with that baby my belief is he's unhappy 'cause he can't anyways be nurse maid to him o mr wentworth what do you think of her sir austin's reply was as satisfactory as a man's poor speech could make it he heard that lady feverel was in the house and mrs berry prepared the way for him to pay his respects to her then mrs berry ran to lucy and the house buzzed with new life the simple creatures felt in austin's presence something good among them he don't speak much said mrs berry but i see by his eye he mean a deal he ain't one o' yer long word gentry who's all gay deceivers every one of 'em lucy pressed the hearty suckling into her breast i wonder what he thinks of me mrs berry i could not speak to him i loved him before i saw him i knew what his face was like he looks proper even with a beard and that's a trial for a virtuous man said mrs berry one sees straight through the hair with him think he'll think what any man'd think you a suckin spite o' all your sorrow my sweet and my berry talkin' of his roman matrons here's a english wife'll match 'em all that's what he thinks and now that leetle dark under yer eye'll clear my darlin' now he've come mrs berry looked to no more than that lucy to no more than the peace she had in being near richard's best friend when she sat down to tea it was with a sense that the little room that held her was her home perhaps for many a day a chop procured and cooked by mrs berry formed austin's dinner during the meal he entertained them with anecdotes of his travels poor lucy had no temptation to try to conquer austin that heroic weakness of hers was gone mrs berry had said three cups i goes no further and lucy had rejected the proffer of more tea when austin who was in the thick of a brazilian forest asked her if she was a good traveller i mean can you start at a minute's notice lucy hesitated and then said yes decisively to which mrs berry added that she was not a luggage woman there used to be a train at seven o'clock austin remarked consulting his watch the two women were silent could you get ready to come with me to raynham in ten minutes austin looked as if he had asked a commonplace question lucy's lips parted to speak she could not answer loud rattled the teaboard to mrs berry's dropping hands joy and deliverance she exclaimed with a foundering voice will you come austin kindly asked again lucy tried to stop her beating heart as she answered yes mrs berry cunningly pretended to interpret the irresolution in her tones with a mighty whisper she's thinking what's to be done with baby he must learn to travel said austin oh cried mrs berry and i'll be his nuss and bear him a sweet oh and think of it me nurse maid once more at raynham abbey but it's nurse woman now you must say let us be goin' on the spot she started up and away in hot haste fearing delay would cool the heaven sent resolve austin smiled eying his watch and lucy alternately she was wishing to ask a multitude of questions his face reassured her and saying i will be dressed instantly she also left the room talking bustling preparing wrapping up my lord and looking to their neatnesses they were nevertheless ready within the time prescribed by austin and mrs berry stood humming over the baby he'll sleep it through she said he's had enough for an alderman and goes to sleep sound after his dinner he do a duck before they departed lucy ran up to lady feverel she returned for the small one one moment mr wentworth just two said austin master richard was taken up and when lucy came back her eyes were full of tears she thinks she is never to see him again mr wentworth she shall austin said simply off they went and with austin near her lucy forgot to dwell at all upon the great act of courage she was performing i do hope baby will not wake was her chief solicitude he cries nurse woman berry from the rear his little tum tum's as tight as he can hold a pet a lamb a bird a beauty and ye may take yer oath he never wakes till that's slack he've got character of his own a blessed there are some tremendous citadels that only want to be taken by storm the baronet sat alone in his library sick of resistance and rejoicing in the pride of no surrender a terror to his friends and to himself hearing austin's name sonorously pronounced by the man of calves he looked up from his book and held out his hand glad to see you austin his appearance betokened complete security the next minute he found himself escaladed it was a cry from mrs berry that told him others were in the room besides austin lucy stood a little behind the lamp mrs berry close to the door the door was half open and passing through it might be seen the petrified figure of a fine man the baronet glancing over the lamp rose at mrs berry's signification of a woman's personality austin stepped back and led lucy to him by the hand i have brought richard's wife sir he said with a pleased perfectly uncalculating countenance that was disarming very pale and trembling lucy bowed she felt her two hands taken and heard a kind voice could it be possible it belonged to the dreadful father of her husband she lifted her eyes nervously her hands were still detained the baronet contemplated richard's choice had he ever had a rivalry with those pure eyes he saw the pain of her position shooting across her brows and uttering gentle inquiries as to her health placed her in a seat mrs berry had already fallen into a chair what aspect do you like for your bedroom east said the baronet lucy was asking herself wonderingly am i to stay perhaps you had better take to richard's room at once he pursued you have the lobourne valley there and a good morning air and will feel more at home lucy's colour mounted mrs berry gave a short cough as one who should say the day is ours undoubtedly strange as it was to think it the fortress was carried lucy is rather tired said austin and to hear her christian name thus bravely spoken brought grateful dew to her eyes the baronet was about to touch the bell but have you come alone he asked at this mrs berry came forward not immediately it seemed to require effort for her to move and when she was within the region of the lamp her agitation could not escape notice the blissful bundle shook in her arms by the way what is he to me austin inquired generally as he went and unveiled the younger hope of raynham my relationship is not so defined as yours sir an observer might have supposed that the baronet peeped at his grandson with the courteous indifference of one who merely wished to compliment the mother of anybody's child i really think he's like richard austin laughed lucy looked i am sure he is as like as one to one mrs berry murmured feebly but grandpapa not speaking she thought it incumbent on her to pluck up and he's as healthy as his father was sir austin spite o' the might 'a beens reg'lar as the clock we never want a clock since he come we knows the hour o' the day and of the night you nurse him yourself of course the baronet spoke to lucy and was satisfied on that point mrs berry was going to display his prodigious legs lucy fearing the consequent effect on the prodigious lungs begged her not to wake him 't'd take a deal to do that said mrs berry and harped on master richard's health and the small wonder it was that he enjoyed it considering the superior quality of his diet and the lavish attentions of his mother and then suddenly fell silent on a deep sigh he looks healthy said the baronet but i am not a judge of babies thus having capitulated raynham chose to acknowledge its new commandant who was now borne away under the directions of the housekeeper to occupy the room richard had slept in when an infant austin cast no thought on his success the baronet said she is extremely well looking he replied a person you take to at once there it ended but a much more animated colloquy was taking place aloft where lucy and mrs berry sat alone lucy expected her to talk about the reception they had met with and the house and the peculiarities of the rooms and the solid happiness that seemed in store mrs berry all the while would persist in consulting the looking glass her first distinct answer was my dear tell me candid how do i look very nice indeed mrs berry but could you have believed he would be so kind so considerate i am sure i looked a frump returned mrs berry oh dear two birds at a shot what do you think now i never saw so wonderful a likeness says lucy likeness look at me mrs berry was trembling and hot in the palms you're very feverish dear berry what can it be ain't it like the love flutters of a young gal my dear go to bed berry dear says lucy pouting in her soft caressing way i will undress you and see to you dear heart you've had so much excitement ha ha berry laughed hysterically she thinks it's about this business of hers why it's child's play my darlin' but i didn't look for tragedy to night sleep in this house i can't my love lucy was astonished not sleep here mrs berry oh why you silly old thing i know do ye said mrs berry with a sceptical nose you're afraid of ghosts belike i am when they're six foot two in their shoes and bellows when you stick a pin into their calves i seen my berry your husband large as life lucy meditated on optical delusions but mrs berry described him as the colossus who had marched them into the library and vowed that he had recognized her and quaked time ain't aged him said mrs berry whereas me he've got his excuse now i know i look a frump lucy kissed her you look the nicest dearest old thing you may say an old thing my dear and your husband is really here berry's below profoundly uttered as this was it chased every vestige of incredulity what will you do mrs berry go my dear leave him to be happy in his own way it's over atween us i see that when i entered the house i felt there was something comin' over me and lo and behold ye no sooner was we in the hall passage if it hadn't been for that blessed infant i should 'a dropped i must 'a known his step for my heart began thumpin' and i knew i hadn't got my hair straight that mr wentworth was in such a hurry nor my best gown i knew he'd scorn me he hates frumps scorn you cried lucy angrily he who has behaved so wickedly mrs berry attempted to rise i may as well go at once she whimpered if i see him i shall only be disgracin' of myself i feel it all on my side already did ye mark him my dear i know i was vexin' to him at times i was those big men are so touchy about their dignity nat'ral hark at me i'm goin' all soft in a minute let me leave the house my dear i daresay it was good half my fault young women don't understand men sufficient not altogether and i was a young woman then and then what they goes and does they ain't quite answerable for they feels i daresay pushed from behind yes i'll go i'm a frump i'll go 'tain't in natur' for me to sleep in the same house lucy laid her hands on mrs berry's shoulders and forcibly fixed her in her seat leave baby naughty woman i tell you he shall come to you and fall on his knees to you and beg your forgiveness berry on his knees yes and he shall beg and pray you to forgive him if you get more from martin berry than breath away words great'll be my wonder said mrs berry we will see said lucy thoroughly determined to do something for the good creature that had befriended her mrs berry examined her gown won't it seem we're runnin' after him she murmured faintly he is your husband mrs berry he may be wanting to come to you now oh where is all i was goin' to say to that man when we met mrs berry ejaculated lucy had left the room on the landing outside the door lucy met a lady dressed in black who stopped her and asked if she was richard's wife and kissed her passing from her immediately lucy despatched a message for austin and related the berry history austin sent for the great man and said do you know your wife is here before berry had time to draw himself up to enunciate his longest he was requested to step upstairs and as his young mistress at once led the way berry could not refuse to put his legs in motion and carry the stately edifice aloft of the interview mrs berry gave lucy a slight sketch that night he began in the old way my dear and says i a true heart and plain words martin berry so there he cuts himself and his johnson short and down he goes down on his knees i never could 'a believed it i kep my dignity as a woman till i see that sight but that done for me i was a ripe apple in his arms 'fore i knew where i was there's something about a fine man on his knees that's too much for us women and it reely was the penitent on his two knees not the lover on his one if he mean it but ah what do you think he begs of me my dear not to make it known in the house just yet i can't i can't say that look well lucy attributed it to his sense of shame at his conduct and mrs berry did her best to look on it in that light did the bar'net kiss ye when you wished him goodnight she asked lucy said he had not then bide awake as long as ye can was mrs berry's rejoinder and now let us pray blessings on that simple speaking gentleman who does so much 'cause he says so little like many other natural people mrs berry was only silly where her own soft heart was concerned as she secretly anticipated the baronet came into her room when all was quiet she saw him go and bend over richard the second and remain earnestly watching him he then went to the half opened door of the room where lucy slept leaned his ear a moment knocked gently and entered mrs berry heard low words interchanging within she could not catch a syllable yet she would have sworn to the context he've called her his daughter promised her happiness and given a father's kiss to her when sir austin passed out she was in a deep sleep chapter xlii briareus reddening angrily over the sea what is that vaporous titan and hesper set in his rosy garland why looks he so implacably sweet it is that one has left that bright home to go forth and do cloudy work and he has got a stain with which he dare not return far in the west fair lucy beckons him to come ah heaven if he might how strong and fierce the temptation is how subtle the sleepless desire it drugs his reason his honour for he loves her she is still the first and only woman to him otherwise would this black spot be hell to him otherwise would his limbs be chained while her arms are spread open to him and if he loves her why then what is one fall in the pit or a thousand is not love the password to that beckoning bliss so may we say but here is one whose body has been made a temple to him and it is desecrated a temple and desecrated for what is it fit for but for a dance of devils his education has thus wrought him to think he can blame nothing but his own baseness but to feel base and accept the bliss that beckons he has not fallen so low as that ah happy english home sweet wife what mad miserable wisp of the fancy led him away from you high in his conceit poor wretch that thought to be he of the hundred hands and war against the absolute gods jove whispered a light commission to the laughing dame she met him and how did he shake olympus with laughter sure it were better to be orestes the furies howling in his ears than one called to by a heavenly soul from whom he is for ever outcast he has not the oblivion of madness clothed in the lights of his first passion robed in the splendour of old skies she meets him everywhere morning evening night she shines above him waylays him suddenly in forest depths drops palpably on his heart at moments he forgets he rushes to embrace her calls her his beloved and lo her innocent kiss brings agony of shame to his face daily the struggle endured his father wrote to him begging him by the love he had for him to return from that hour richard burnt unread all the letters he received he knew too well how easily he could persuade himself words from without might tempt him and quite extinguish the spark of honourable feeling that tortured him and that he clung to in desperate self vindication to arrest young gentlemen on the downward slope is both a dangerous and thankless office it is nevertheless one that fair women greatly prize and certain of them professionally follow lady judith as far as her sex would permit was also of the titans in their battle against the absolute gods for which purpose mark you she had married a lord incapable in all save his acres her achievements she kept to her own mind she did not look happy over them she met richard accidentally in paris she saw his state she let him learn that she alone on earth understood him the consequence was that he was forthwith enrolled in her train it soothed him to be near a woman did she venture her guess as to the cause of his conduct she blotted it out with a facility women have and cast on it a melancholy hue he was taught to participate in she spoke of sorrows personal sorrows much as he might speak of his vaguely and with self blame and she understood him how the dark unfathomed wealth within us gleams to a woman's eye we are at compound interest immediately so much richer than we knew almost as rich as we dreamed but then the instant we are away from her we find ourselves bankrupt beggared how is that we do not ask we hurry to her and bask hungrily in her orbs the eye must be feminine to be thus creative i cannot say why lady judith understood richard and he feeling infinitely vile somehow held to her more feverishly as one who dreaded the worst in missing her the spirit must rest he was weak with what he suffered austin found them among the hills of nassau in rhineland titans male and female who had not displaced jove and were now adrift prone on floods of sentiment the blue flocked peasant swinging behind his oxen of a morning the gaily kerchiefed fruit woman the jackass driver even the doctor of those regions have done more for their fellows horrible reflection lady judith is serene above it but it frets at richard when he is out of her shadow often wretchedly he watches the young men of his own age trooping to their work not cloud work theirs work solid unambitious fruitful lady judith had a nobler in prospect for the hero he gaped blindfolded for anything and she gave him the map of europe in tatters he swallowed it comfortably it was an intoxicating cordial himself on horseback overriding wrecks of empires well might common sense cower with the meaner animals at the picture tacitly they agreed to recast the civilized globe the quality of vapour is to melt and shape itself anew but it is never the quality of vapour to reassume the same shapes briareus of the hundred unoccupied hands may turn to a monstrous donkey with his hind legs aloft or twenty thousand jabbering apes the phantasmic groupings of the young brain are very like those we see in the skies and equally the sport of the wind lady judith blew there was plenty of vapour in him and it always resolved into some shape or other you that mark those clouds of eventide and know youth will see the similitude it will not be strange it will barely seem foolish to you that a young man of richard's age richard's education and position should be in this wild state had he not been nursed to believe he was born for great things did she not say she was sure of it and to feel base yet born for better is enough to make one grasp at anything cloudy suppose the hero with a game leg how intense is his faith to quacks with what a passion of longing is he not seized to break somebody's head they spoke of italy in low voices the time will come said she and i shall be ready said he what rank was he to take in the liberating army captain colonel general in chief or simple private here as became him he was much more positive and specific than she was simple private he said yet he save himself caracoling on horseback private in the cavalry then of course private in the cavalry over riding wrecks of empires she looked forth under her brows with mournful indistinctness at that object in the distance they read petrarch to get up the necessary fires italia mia vain indeed was this speaking to those thick and mortal wounds in her fair body but their sighs went with the tiber the arno and the po and their hands joined who has not wept for italy i see the aspirations of a world arise for her thick and frequent as the puffs of smoke from cigars of pannonian sentries so when austin came richard said he could not leave lady judith lady judith said she could not part with him for his sake mind this richard verified perhaps he had reason to be grateful the high road of folly may have led him from one that terminates worse ho is foolish god knows but for my part i will not laugh at the hero because he has not got his occasion meet him when he is as it were anointed by his occasion and he is no laughing matter richard felt his safety in this which to please the world we must term folly exhalation of vapours was a wholesome process to him and somebody who gave them shape and hue a beneficent iris he told austin plainly he could not leave her and did not anticipate the day when he could why can't you go to your wife richard for a reason you would be the first to approve austin he welcomed austin with every show of manly tenderness and sadness at heart austin he had always associated with his lucy in that hesperian palace of the west austin waited patiently lady judith's old lord played on all the baths in nassau without evoking the tune of health whithersoever he listed she changed her abode so admirable a wife was to be pardoned for espousing an old man she was an enthusiast even in her connubial duties she had the brows of an enthusiast with occasion she might have been a charlotte corday so let her also be shielded from the ban of ridicule nonsense of enthusiasts is very different from nonsense of ninnies she was truly a high minded person of that order who always do what they see to be right and always have confidence in their optics she was not unworthy of a young man's admiration if she was unfit to be his guide she resumed her ancient intimacy with austin easily while she preserved her new footing with richard she and austin were not unlike only austin never dreamed and had not married an old lord the three were walking on the bridge at limburg on the lahn where the shadow of a stone bishop is thrown by the moonlight on the water brawling over slabs of slate a woman passed them bearing in her arms a baby whose mighty size drew their attention what a wopper richard laughed well that is a fine fellow said austin but i don't think he's much bigger than your boy he'll do for a nineteenth century arminius richard was saying then he looked at austin what was that you said lady judith asked of austin what have i said that deserves to be repeated austin counterqueried quite innocently richard has a son you didn't know it his modesty goes very far said lady judith sweeping the shadow of a curtsey to richard's paternity richard's heart throbbed with violence he looked again in austin's face austin took it so much as a matter of course that he said nothing more on the subject well murmured lady judith when the two men were alone richard said in a quick voice austin you were in earnest you didn't know it richard no why they all wrote to you lucy wrote to you your father your aunt i believe adrian wrote too i tore up their letters said richard he's a noble fellow i can tell you you've nothing to be ashamed of he'll soon be coming to ask about you i made sure you knew no i never knew richard walked away and then said what is he like well he really is like you but he has his mother's eyes and she's yes i think the child has kept her well they're both at raynham both hence fantastic vapours what are ye to this where are the dreams of the hero when he learns he has a child nature is taking him to her bosom she will speak presently every domesticated boor in these hills can boast the same yet marvels the hero at none of his visioned prodigies as he does when he comes to hear of this most common performance a father richard fixed his eyes as if he were trying to make out the lineaments of his child telling austin he would be back in a few minutes he sallied into the air and walked on and on a father he kept repeating to himself a child and though he knew it not he was striking the keynotes of nature but he did know of a singular harmony that suddenly burst over his whole being the moon was surpassingly bright the summer air heavy and still he left the high road and pierced into the forest his walk was rapid the leaves on the trees brushed his cheeks the dead leaves heaped in the dells noised to his feet something of a religious joy a strange sacred pleasure was in him by degrees it wore he remembered himself and now he was possessed by a proportionate anguish a father he dared never see his child and he had no longer his phantasies to fall upon he was utterly bare to his sin in his troubled mind it seemed to him that clare looked down on him clare who saw him as he was and that to her eyes it would be infamy for him to go and print his kiss upon his child then came stern efforts to command his misery and make the nerves of his face iron by the log of an ancient tree half buried in dead leaves of past summers beside a brook he halted as one who had reached his journey's end there he discovered he had a companion in lady judith's little dog he gave the friendly animal a pat of recognition and both were silent in the forest silence it was impossible for richard to return his heart was surcharged he must advance and on he footed the little dog following an oppressive slumber hung about the forest branches in the dells and on the heights was the same dead heat here where the brook tinkled it was no cool lipped sound but metallic and without the spirit of water yonder in a space of moonlight on lush grass the beams were as white fire to sight and feeling no haze spread around the valleys were clear defined to the shadows of their verges the distances sharply distinct and with the colours of day but slightly softened richard beheld a roe moving across a slope of sward far out of rifle mark the breathless silence was significant yet the moon shone in a broad blue heaven tongue out of mouth trotted the little dog after him crouched panting when he stopped an instant rose weariedly when he started afresh now and then a large white night moth flitted through the dusk of the forest on a barren corner of the wooded highland looking inland stood grey topless ruins set in nettles and rank grass blades richard mechanically sat down on the crumbling flints to rest and listened to the panting of the dog sprinkled at his feet were emerald lights hundreds of glow worms studded the dark dry ground he sat and eyed them thinking not at all his energies were expended in action he sat as a part of the ruins and the moon turned his shadow westward from the south overhead as she declined long ripples of silver cloud were imperceptibly stealing toward her they were the van of a tempest he did not observe them or the leaves beginning to chatter when he again pursued his course with his face to the rhine a huge mountain appeared to rise sheer over him and he had it in his mind to scale it he got no nearer to the base of it for all his vigorous outstepping the ground began to dip he lost sight of the sky then heavy thunder drops streak his cheek the leaves were singing the earth breathed it was black before him and behind all at once the thunder spoke the mountain he had marked was bursting over him up startled the whole forest in violet fire he saw the country at the foot of the hills to the bounding rhine gleam quiver extinguished then there were pauses and the lightning seemed as the eye of heaven and the thunder as the tongue of heaven each alternately addressing him filling him with awful rapture alone there sole human creature among the grandeurs and mysteries of storm he felt the representative of his kind and his spirit rose and marched and exulted let it be glory let it be ruin lower down the lightened abysses of air rolled the wrathful crash then white thrusts of light were darted from the sky and great curving ferns seen steadfast in pallor a second were supernaturally agitated and vanished then a shrill song roused in the leaves and the herbage prolonged and louder it sounded as deeper and heavier the deluge pressed a mighty force of water satisfied the desire of the earth even in this drenched as he was by the first outpouring richard had a savage pleasure keeping in motion he was scarcely conscious of the wet and the grateful breath of the weeds was refreshing suddenly he stopped short lifting a curious nostril he fancied he smelt meadow sweet he had never seen the flower in rhineland never thought of it and it would hardly be met with in a forest he was sure he smelt it fresh in dews his little companion wagged a miserable wet tail some way in advance he went an slowly thinking indistinctly after two or three steps he stooped and stretched out his hand to feel for the flower having he knew not why a strong wish to verify its growth there groping about his hand encountered something warm that started at his touch and he with the instinct we have seized it and lifted it to look at it the creature was very small evidently quite young richard's eyes now accustomed to the darkness were able to discern it for what it was a tiny leveret and ha supposed that the dog had probably frightened its dam just before he found it he put the little thing on one hand in his breast and stepped out rapidly as before the rain was now steady from every tree a fountain poured so cool and easy had his mind become that he was speculating on what kind of shelter the birds could find and how the butterflies and moths saved their coloured wings from washing folded close they might hang under a leaf he thought lovingly he looked into the dripping darkness of the coverts on each side as one of their children he was next musing on a strange sensation he experienced it ran up one arm with an indescribable thrill but communicated nothing to his heart it was purely physical ceased for a time and recommenced till he had it all through his blood wonderfully thrilling he grew aware that the little thing he carried in his breast was licking his hand there the small rough tongue going over and over the palm of his hand produced the strange sensation he felt now that he knew the cause the marvel ended but now that he knew the cause his heart was touched and made more of it the gentle scraping continued without intermission as on he walked what did it say to him human tongue could not have said so much just then a pale grey light on the skirts of the flying tempest displayed the dawn richard was walking hurriedly the green drenched weeds lay all about in his path bent thick and the forest drooped glimmeringly impelled as a man who feels a revelation mounting obscurely to his brain richard was passing one of those little forest chapels hung with votive wreaths where the peasant halts to kneel and pray cold still in the twilight it stood rain drops pattering round it he looked within and saw the virgin holding her child he moved by but not many steps had he gone ere his strength went out of him and he shuddered what was it he asked not he was in other hands vivid as lightning the spirit of life illumined him he felt in his heart the cry of his child his darling's touch with shut eyes he saw them both they drew him from the depths they led him a blind and tottering man and as they led him he had a sense of purification so sweet he shuddered again and again when he looked out from his trance on the breathing world the small birds hopped and chirped warm fresh sunlight was over all the hills he was on the edge of the forest entering a plain clothed with ripe corn under a spacious morning sky chapter xliii they heard at raynham that richard was coming lucy had the news first in a letter from ripton thompson who met him at bonn ripton did not say that he had employed his vacation holiday on purpose to use his efforts to induce his dear friend to return to his wife and finding richard already on his way of course ripton said nothing to him but affected to be travelling for his pleasure like any cockney richard also wrote to her in case she should have gone to the sea he directed her to send word to his hotel that he might not lose an hour his letter was sedate in tone very sweet to her assisted by the faithful female berry she was conquering an aphorist woman's reason is in the milk of her breasts was one of his rough notes due to an observation of lucy's maternal cares let us remember therefore we men who have drunk of it largely there that she has it mrs berry zealously apprised him how early master richard's education had commenced and the great future historian he must consequently be this trait in lucy was of itself sufficient to win sir austin here my plan with richard was false he reflected in presuming that anything save blind fortuity would bring him such a mate as he should have he came to add and has got he could admit now that instinct had so far beaten science for as richard was coming as all were to be happy his wisdom embraced them all paternally as the author of their happiness between him and lucy a tender intimacy grew i told you she could talk sir said adrian she thinks said the baronet the delicate question how she was to treat her uncle he settled generously farmer blaize should come up to raynham when he would lucy must visit him at least three times a week he had farmer blaize and mrs berry to study and really excellent aphorisms sprang from the plain human bases this natural couple presented it will do us no harm he thought some of the honest blood of the soil in our veins and he was content in musing on the parentage of the little cradled boy a common sight for those who had the entry to the library was the baronet cherishing the hand of his daughter in law so richard was crossing the sea and hearts at raynham were beating quicker measures as the minutes progressed that night he would be with them sir austin gave lucy a longer warmer salute when she came down to breakfast in the morning mrs berry waxed thrice amorous it's your second bridals ye sweet livin' widow she said thanks be the lord it's the same man too and a baby over the bed post she appended seriously strange berry declared it to be strange i feel none o' this to my berry now all my feelin's o' love seem t'ave gone into you two sweet chicks in fact the faithless male berry complained of being treated badly and affected a superb jealousy of the baby but the good dame told him that if he suffered at all he suffered his due berry's position was decidedly uncomfortable it could not be concealed from the lower household that he had a wife in the establishment and for the complications this gave rise to his wife would not legitimately console him lucy did intercede but mrs berry was obdurate she averred she would not give up the child till he was weaned then perhaps she said prospectively you see i ain't so soft as you thought for you're a very unkind vindictive old woman said lucy belike i am mrs berry was proud to agree we like a new character now and then berry had delayed too long were it not notorious that the straightlaced prudish dare not listen to the natural chaste certain things mrs berry thought it advisable to impart to the young wife with regard to berry's infidelity and the charity women should have toward sinful men might here be reproduced enough that she thought proper to broach the matter and cite her own christian sentiments now that she was indifferent in some degree oily calm is on the sea at raynham they look up at the sky and speculate that richard is approaching fairly speeded he comes to throw himself on his darling's mercy lucy irradiated over forest and sea tempest and peace to her the hero comes humbly great is that day when we see our folly ripton and he were the friends of old richard encouraged him to talk of the two he could be eloquent on and ripton whose secret vanity was in his powers of speech never tired of enumerating lucy's virtues and the peculiar attributes of the baby she did not say a word against me rip against you richard the moment she knew she was to be a mother she thought of nothing but her duty to the child she's one who can't think of herself you've seen her at raynham rip yes once they asked me down and your father's so fond of her i'm sure he thinks no woman like her and he's right she is so lovely and so good richard was too full of blame of himself to blame his father too british to expose his emotions ripton divined how deep and changed they were by his manner he had cast aside the hero and however ripton had obeyed him and looked up to him in the heroic time he loved him tenfold now he told his friend how much lucy's mere womanly sweetness and excellence had done for him and richard contrasted his own profitless extravagance with the patient beauty of his dear home angel he was not one to take her on the easy terms that offered there was that to do which made his cheek burn as he thought of it but he was going to do it even though it lost her to him just to see her and kneel to her was joy sufficient to sustain him and warm his blood in the prospect they marked the white cliffs growing over the water nearer the sun made them lustrous houses and people seemed to welcome the wild youth to common sense simplicity and home they were in town by mid day richard had a momentary idea of not driving to his hotel for letters after a short debate he determined to go there the porter said he had two letters for mr richard feverel one had been waiting some time he went to the box and fetched them the first richard opened was from lucy and as he read it ripton observed the colour deepen on his face while a quivering smile played about his mouth he opened the other indifferently it began without any form of address richard's forehead darkened at the signature this letter was in a sloping feminine hand and flourished with light strokes all over like a field of the bearded barley thus it ran i know you are in a rage with me because i would not consent to ruin you you foolish fellow what do you call it going to that unpleasant place together thank you my milliner is not ready yet and i want to make a good appearance when i do go i suppose i shall have to some day your health sir richard now let me speak to you seriously go home to your wife at once but i know the sort of fellow you are and i must be plain with you did i ever say i loved you you may hate me as much as you please but i will save you from being a fool now listen to me you know my relations with mount that beast brayder offered to pay all my debts and set me afloat if i would keep you in town i declare on my honour i had no idea why and i did not agree to it but you were such a handsome fellow i noticed you in the park before i heard a word of you but then you fought shy you were just as tempting as a girl you stung me do you know what that is i would make you care for me and we know how it ended without any intention of mine i swear i'd have cut off my hand rather than do you any harm upon my honour circumstances then i saw it was all up between us brayder came and began to chaff about you i dealt the animal a stroke on the face with my riding whip i shut him up pretty quick do you think i would let a man speak about you i was going to swear you see i remember dick's lessons o my god i do feel unhappy brayder offered me money go and think i took it if you like what do i care what anybody thinks something that black guard said made me suspicious i went down to the isle of wight where mount was and your wife was just gone with an old lady who came and took her away i should so have liked to see her you said you remember she would take me as a sister and treat me i laughed at it then my god how i could cry now if water did any good to a devil as you politely call poor me i called at your house and saw your man servant who said mount had just been there in a minute it struck me i was sure mount was after a woman but it never struck me that woman was your wife then i saw why they wanted me to keep you away i went to brayder you know how i hate him i made love to the man to get it out of him richard my word of honour they have planned to carry her off if mount finds he cannot seduce her talk of devils he's one but he is not so bad as brayder i cannot forgive a mean dog his villany now after this i am quite sure you are too much of a man to stop away from her another moment i have no more to say i suppose we shall not see each other again so good bye dick i fancy i hear you cursing me why can't you feel like other men on the subject but if you were like the rest of them i should not have cared for you a farthing i have not worn lilac since i saw you last i'll be buried in your colour dick that will not offend you will it you are not going to believe i took the money if i thought you thought that it makes me feel like a devil only to fancy you think it the first time you meet brayder cane him publicly adieu say it's because you don't like his face i suppose devils must not say adieu here's plain old good bye then between you and me good bye dear dick you won't think that of me may i eat dry bread to the day of my death if i took or ever will touch a scrap of their money bella richard folded up the letter silently jump into the cab he said to ripton anything the matter richard no the driver received directions richard sat without speaking his friend knew that face he asked whether there was bad news in the letter for answer he had the lie circumstancial he ventured to remark that they were going the wrong way it'd the right way cried richard and his jaws were hard and square and his eyes looked heavy and full ripton said no more but thought the cabman pulled up at a club a gentleman in whom ripton recognized the hon peter brayder was just then swinging a leg over his horse with one foot in the stirrup hearing his name called the hon peter turned about and stretched an affable hand is mountfalcon in town said richard taking the horse's reins instead of the gentlemanly hand his voice and aspect were quite friendly mount brayder replied curiously watching the action yes he's off this evening he is in town richard released his horse i want to see him where is he the young man looked pleasant that which might have aroused brayder's suspicions was an old affair in parasitical register by this time want to see him what about he said carelessly and gave the address by the way he sang out we thought of putting your name down feverel he indicated the lofty structure what do you say richard nodded back at him crying hurry brayder returned the nod and those who promenaded the district soon beheld his body in elegant motion to the stepping of his well earned horse what do you want to see lord mountfalcon for richard said ripton i just want to see him richard replied ripton was left in the cab at the door of my lord's residence he had to wait there a space of about ten minutes when richard returned with a clearer visage though somewhat heated he stood outside the cab and ripton was conscious of being examined by those strong grey eyes as clear as speech he understood them to say to him you won't do but which of the many things on earth he would not do for he was at a loss to think go down to raynham ripton say i shall be there tonight certainly don't bother me with questions drive off at once or wait get another cab i'll take this ripton was ejected and found himself standing alone in the street as he was on the point of rushing after the galloping cab horse to get a word of elucidation he heard some one speak behind him you are feverel's friend ripton had an eye for lords an ambrosial footman standing at the open door of lord mountfalcon's house and a gentleman standing on the doorstep told him that he was addressed by that nobleman he was requested to step into the house when they were alone lord mountfalcon slightly ruffled said feverel has insulted me grossly i must meet him of course it's a piece of infernal folly i suppose he is not quite mad ripton's only definite answer was a gasping iteration of my lord my lord resumed i am perfectly guiltless of offending him as far as i know in fact i had a friendship for him is he liable to fits of this sort of thing not yet at conversation point ripton stammered fits my lord ah went the other eying ripton in lordly cognizant style you know nothing of this business perhaps ripton said he did not have you any influence with him not much my lord only now and then a little you are not in the army the question was quite unnecessary ripton confessed to the law and my lord did not look surprised i will not detain you he said distantly bowing ripton gave him a commoner's obeisance but getting to the door the sense of the matter enlightened him it's a duel my lord no help for it if his friends don't shut him up in bedlam between this and to morrow morning of all horrible things a duel was the worst in ripton's imagination he stood holding the handle of the door revolving this last chapter of calamity suddenly opened where happiness had promised a duel but he won't my lord he mustn't fight my lord he must come on the ground said my lord positively ripton ejaculated unintelligible stuff finally lord mountfalcon said i went out of my way sir in speaking to you i saw you from the window your friend is mad deuced methodical i admit but mad i have particular reasons to wish not to injure the young man and if an apology is to be got out of him when we're on the ground i'll take it and we'll stop the damned scandal if possible you understand i'm the insulted party and i shall only require of him to use formal words of excuse to come to an amicable settlement let him just say he regrets it now sir the nobleman spoke with considerable earnestness should anything happen i have the honour to be known to mrs feverel and i beg you will tell her i very particularly desire you to let her know that i was not to blame mountfalcon rang the bell and bowed him out with this on his mind ripton hurried down to those who were waiting in joyful trust at raynham chapter xliv the watch consulted by hippias alternately with his pulse in occult calculation hideous to mark said half past eleven on the midnight adrian wearing a composedly amused expression on his dimpled plump face held slightly sideways aloof from paper and pen sat writing at the library table round the baronet's chair in a semi circle were lucy lady blandish mrs doria and ripton that very ill bird at raynham they were silent as those who question the flying minutes ripton had said that richard was sure to come but the feminine eyes reading him ever and anon had gathered matter for disquietude which increased as time sped sir austin persisted in his habitual air of speculative repose remote as he appeared from vulgar anxiety he was the first to speak and betray his state pray put up that watch impatience serves nothing he said half turning hastily to his brother behind him hippias relinquished his pulse and mildly groaned it's no nightmare this his remark was unheard and the bearing of it remained obscure adrian's pen made a louder flourish on his manuscript whether in commiseration or infernal glee none might say what are you writing the baronet inquired testily of adrian after a pause twitched it may be by a sort of jealousy of the wise youth's coolness do i disturb you sir rejoined adrian i am engaged on a portion of a proposal for uniting the empires and kingdoms of europe under one paternal head on the model of the ever to be admired and lamented holy roman this treats of the management of youths and maids and of certain magisterial functions connected therewith 'it is decreed that these officers be all and every men of science' etc and adrian cheerily drove his pen afresh mrs doria took lucy's hand mutely addressing encouragement to her and lucy brought as much of a smile as she could command to reply with i fear we must give him up to night observed lady blandish if he said he would come he will come sir austin interjected between him and the lady there was something of a contest secretly going on he was conscious that nothing save perfect success would now hold this self emancipating mind she had seen him through he declared to me he would be certain to come said ripton but he could look at none of them as he said it for he was growing aware that richard might have deceived him and was feeling like a black conspirator against their happiness he determined to tell the baronet what he knew if richard did not come by twelve what is the time he asked hippias in a modest voice time for me to be in bed growled hippias as if everybody present had been treating him badly mrs berry came in to apprise lucy that she was wanted above she quietly rose sir austin kissed her on the forehead saying you had better not come down again my child she kept her eyes on him oblige me by retiring for the night he added lucy shook their hands and went out accompanied by mrs doria this agitation will be bad for the child he said speaking to himself aloud lady blandish remarked i think she might just as well have returned she will not sleep she will control herself for the child's sake you ask too much of her of her not he emphasized it was twelve o'clock when hippies shut his watch and said with vehemence i'm convinced my circulation gradually and steadily decreases going back to the pre harvey period murmured adrian as he wrote sir austin and lady blandish knew well that any comment would introduce them to the interior of his machinery the eternal view of which was sufficiently harrowing so they maintained a discreet reserve taking it for acquiescence in his deplorable condition hippies resumed despairingly it's a fact i've brought you to see that no one can be more moderate than i am and yet i get worse my system is organically sound i believe i do every possible thing and yet i get worse nature never forgives i'll go to bed the dyspepsy departed unconsoled sir austin took up his brother's thought i suppose nothing short of a miracle helps us when we have offended her nothing short of a quack satisfies us said adrian applying wax to an envelope of official dimensions ripton sat accusing his soul of cowardice while they talked haunted by lucy's last look at him he got up his courage presently and went round to adrian who after a few whispered words deliberately rose and accompanied him out of the room shrugging when they had gone lady blandish said to the baronet he is not coming to morrow then if not tonight he replied but i say he will come to night you do really wish to see him united to his wife the question made the baronet raise his brows with some displeasure can you ask me i mean said the ungenerous woman your system will require no further sacrifices from either of them when he did answer it was to say i think her altogether a superior person i confess i should scarcely have hoped to find one like her admit that your science does not accomplish everything no it was presumptuous beyond a certain point said the baronet meaning deep things lady blandish eyed him ah me she sighed if we would always be true to our own wisdom you are very singular to night emmeline sir austin stopped his walk in front of her in truth was she not unjust here was an offending son freely forgiven here was a young woman of humble birth freely accepted into his family and permitted to stand upon her qualities who would have done more or as much this lady for instance had the case been hers would have fought it all the people of position that he was acquainted with would have fought it and that without feeling it so peculiarly but while the baronet thought this he did not think of the exceptional education his son had received he took the common ground of fathers forgetting his system when it was absolutely on trial false to his son it could not be said that he had been false to his system he was others saw it plainly but he had to learn his lesson by and by lady blandish gave him her face then stretched her hand to the table saying well well she fingered a half opened parcel lying there and drew forth a little book she recognized ha what is this she said benson returned it this morning he informed her the stupid fellow took it away with him by mischance i am bound to believe it was nothing other than the old note book lady blandish turned over the leaves and came upon the later jottings she read a maker of proverbs what is he but a narrow mind with the mouthpiece of narrower i do not agree with that she observed he was in no humour for argument was your humility feigned when you wrote it he merely said consider the sort of minds influenced by set sayings a proverb is the half way house to an idea i conceive and the majority rest there content can the keeper of such a house be flattered by his company she felt her feminine intelligence swaying under him again there must be greatness in a man who could thus speak of his own special and admirable aptitude further she read which is the coward among us he who sneers at the failings of humanity oh that is true how much i admire that cried the dark eyed dame as she beamed intellectual raptures another aphorism seemed closely to apply to him there is no more grievous sight as there is no greater perversion than a wise man at the mercy of his feelings he must have written it she thought when he had himself for an example strange man that he is lady blandish was still inclined to submission though decidedly insubordinate she had once been fairly conquered but if what she reverenced as a great mind could conquer her it must be a great man that should hold her captive the autumn primrose blooms for the loftiest manhood is a vindictive flower in lesser hands nevertheless sir austin had only to be successful and this lady's allegiance was his for ever the trial was at hand she said again he is not coming to night and the baronet on whose visage a contemplative pleased look had been rising for a minute past quietly added he is come richard's voice was heard in the hall there was commotion all over the house at the return of the young heir berry seizing every possible occasion to approach his bessy now that her involuntary coldness had enhanced her value such is men as the soft woman reflected berry ascended to her and delivered the news in pompous tones and wheedling gestures the best word you've spoke for many a day says she and leaves him unfee'd in an attitude to hurry and pour bliss into lucy's ears lord be praised she entered the adjoining room exclaiming we're got to be happy at last they men have come to their senses i could cry to your virgin and kiss your cross you sweet hush lucy admonished her and crooned over the child on her knees the tiny open hands full of sleep clutched the large blue eyes started awake and his mother all trembling and palpitating knowing but thirsting to hear it covered him with her tresses and tried to still her frame and rocked and sang low interdicting even a whisper from bursting mrs berry richard had come he was under his father's roof in the old home that had so soon grown foreign to him he stood close to his wife and child he might embrace them both and now the fulness of his anguish and the madness of the thing he had done smote the young man now first he tasted hard earthly misery had not god spoken to him in the tempest had not the finger of heaven directed him homeward and he had come here he stood congratulations were thick in his ears the cup of happiness was held to him and he was invited to drink of it which was the dream his work for the morrow or this but for a leaden load that he felt like a bullet in his breast he might have thought the morrow with death sitting on it was the dream yes he was awake now first the cloud of phantasms cleared away he beheld his real life and the colours of true human joy and on the morrow perhaps he was to close his eyes on them that leaden bullet dispersed all unrealities they stood about him in the hall his father lady blandish mrs doria adrian ripton people who had known him long they shook his hand they gave him greetings he had never before understood the worth of or the meaning now that he did they mocked him there was mrs berry in the background bobbing there was martin berry bowing there was tom bakewell grinning somehow he loved the sight of these better ah my old penelope he said breaking through the circle of his relatives to go to her tom how are you bless ye my mr richard whimpered mrs berry and whispered rosily all's agreeable now she's waiting up in bed for ye like a new born the person who betrayed most agitation was mrs doria she held close to him and eagerly studied his face and every movement as one accustomed to masks you are pale richard he pleaded exhaustion what detained you dear business he said she drew him imperiously apart from the others richard is it over he asked what she meant the dreadful duel richard he looked darkly is it over is it done richard getting no immediate answer she continued and such was her agitation that the words were shaken by pieces from her mouth don't pretend not to understand me richard is it over are you going to die the death of my child clare's death is not one in a family enough think of your dear young wife we love her so your child your father will you kill us all mrs doria had chanced to overhear a trifle of ripton's communication to adrian and had built thereon with the dark forces of a stricken soul wondering how this woman could have divined it richard calmly said it's arranged the matter you allude to indeed truly dear yes tell me but he broke away from her saying you shall hear the particulars to morrow and she not alive to double meaning just then allowed him to leave her he had eaten nothing for twelve hours and called for food but he would take only dry bread and claret which was served on a tray in the library he said without any show of feeling that he must eat before he saw the young hope of raynham so there he sat breaking bread and eating great mouthfuls and washing them down with wine talking of what they would his father's studious mind felt itself years behind him he was so completely altered he had the precision of speech the bearing of a man of thirty indeed he had all that the necessity for cloaking an infinite misery gives but let things be as they might he was there for one night in his life sir austin's perspective of the future was bounded by the night will your go to your wife now he had asked and richard had replied with a strange indifference the baronet thought it better that their meeting should be private and sent word for lucy to wait upstairs the others perceived that father and son should now be left alone adrian went up to him and said i can no longer witness this painful sight so good night sir famish you may cheat yourself into the belief that you've made a meal but depend upon it your progeny and it threatens to be numerous will cry aloud and rue the day nature never forgives a lost dinner can never be replaced good night my dear boy and here oblige me by taking this he handed richard the enormous envelope containing what he had written that evening credentials he exclaimed humorously slapping richard on the shoulder ripton heard also the words propagator species but had no idea of their import the wise youth looked you see we've made matters all right for you here and quitted the room on that unusual gleam of earnestness richard shook his hand and ripton's then lady blandish said her good night praising lucy and promising to pray for their mutual happiness the two men who knew what was hanging over him spoke together outside ripton was for getting a positive assurance that the duel would not be fought but adrian said time enough tomorrow he's safe enough while he's here i'll stop it to morrow ending with banter of ripton and allusions to his adventures with miss random which must adrian said have led him into many affairs of the sort certainly richard was there and while he was there he must be safe so thought ripton and went to his bed mrs doria deliberated likewise and likewise thought him safe while he was there for once in her life she thought it better not to trust to her instinct for fear of useless disturbance where peace should be so she said not a syllable of it to her brother she only looked more deeply into richard's eyes as she kissed him praising lucy i have found a second daughter in her dear oh may you both be happy they all praised lucy now his father commenced the moment they were alone poor helen your wife has been a great comfort to her richard i think helen must have sunk without her so lovely a young person possessing mental faculty and a conscience for her duties i have never before met he wished to gratify his son by these eulogies of lucy and some hours back he would have succeeded now it had the contrary effect you compliment me on my choice sir richard spoke sedately but the irony was perceptible and he could speak no other way his bitterness was so intense i think you very fortunate said his father sensitive to tone and manner as he was his ebullition of paternal feeling was frozen richard did not approach him he leaned against the chimney piece glancing at the floor and lifting his eyes only when he spoke fortunate very fortunate as he revolved his later history and remembered how clearly he had seen that his father must love lucy if he but knew her and remembered his efforts to persuade her to come with him a sting of miserable rage blackened his brain but could he blame that gentle soul whom could he blame himself not utterly his father yes and no the blame was here the blame was there it was everywhere and nowhere and the young man cast it on the fates and looked angrily at heaven and grew reckless richard said his father coming close to him it is late to night i do not wish lucy to remain in expectation longer or i should have explained myself to you thoroughly and i think or at least hope you would have justified me i had cause to believe that you had not only violated my confidence but grossly deceived me it was not so i now know i was mistaken much of our misunderstanding has resulted from that mistake but you were married a boy you knew nothing of the world little of yourself to save you in after life for there is a period when mature men and women who have married young are more impelled to temptation than in youth though not so exposed to it to save you i say i decreed that you should experience self denial and learn something of your fellows of both sexes before settling into a state that must have been otherwise precarious however excellent the woman who is your mate my system with you would have been otherwise imperfect and you would have felt the effects of it it is over now you are a man the dangers to which your nature was open are i trust at an end i wish you to be happy and i give you both my blessing and pray god to conduct and strengthen you both sir austin's mind was unconscious of not having spoken devoutly true or not his words were idle to his son his talk of dangers over and happiness mockery richard coldly took his father's extended hand we will go to her said the baronet i will leave you at her door not moving looking fixedly at his father with a hard face on which the colour rushed richard said a husband who has been unfaithful to his wife may go to her there sir it was horrible it was cruel richard knew that he wanted no advice on such a matter having fully resolved what to do yesterday he would have listened to his father and blamed himself alone and done what was to be done humbly before god and her now in the recklessness of his misery he had as little pity for any other soul as for his own sir austin's brows were deep drawn down what did you say richard clearly his intelligence had taken it but this the worst he could hear this that he had dreaded once and doubted and smoothed over and cast aside could it be richard said i told you all but the very words when we last parted what else do you think would have kept me from her angered at his callous aspect his father cried what brings you to her now that will be between us two was the reply sir austin fell into his chair meditation was impossible he spoke from a wrathful heart you will not dare to take her without no sir richard interrupted him i shall not have no fear then you did not love your wife did i not a smile passed faintly over richard's face did you care so much for this this other person so much if you ask me whether i had affection for her i can say i had none o base human nature then how then why a thousand questions rose in the baronet's mind bessy berry could have answered them every one poor child poor child he apostrophized lucy pacing the room thinking of her knowing her deep love for his son her true forgiving heart it seemed she should be spared this misery he proposed to richard to spare her vast is the distinction between women and men in this one sin he said and supported it with physical and moral citations his argument carried him so far that to hear him one would have imagined he thought the sin in men small indeed his words were idle she must know it said richard sternly i will go to her now sir if you please sir austin detained him expostulated contradicted himself confounded his principles made nonsense of all his theories he could not induce his son to waver in his resolve ultimately their good night being interchanged he understood that the happiness of raynham depended on lucy's mercy he had no fears of her sweet heart but it was a strange thing to have come to on which should the accusation fall on science or on human nature he remained in the library pondering over the question at times breathing contempt for his son and again seized with unwonted suspicion of his own wisdom troubled much to be pitied even if he deserved that blow from his son which had plunged him into wretchedness richard went straight to tom bakewell roused the heavy sleeper and told him to have his mare saddled and waiting at the park gates east within an hour tom's nearest approach to a hero was to be a faithful slave to his master and in doing this he acted to his conception of that high and glorious character he got up and heroically dashed his head into cold water she shall be ready sir he nodded tom if you don't see me back here at raynham your money will go on being paid to you rather see you than the money mr richard said tom and you will always watch and see no harm comes to her tom mrs richard sir tom stared god bless me mr richard no questions you'll do what i say ay sir that i will did'n isle o' wight the very name of the island shocked richard's blood and he had to walk up and down before he could knock at lucy's door that infamous conspiracy to which he owed his degradation and misery scarce left him the feelings of a man when he thought of it the soft beloved voice responded to his knock he opened the door and stood before her lucy was half way toward him in the moment that passed ere she was in his arms he had time to observe the change in her he had left her a girl he beheld a woman a blooming woman for pale at first no sooner did she see him than the colour was rich and deep on her face and neck and bosom half shown through the loose dressing robe and the sense of her exceeding beauty made his heart thump and his eyes swim my darling each cried and they clung together and her mouth was fastened on his they spoke no more his soul was drowned in her kiss supporting her whose strength was gone he almost as weak as she hung over her and clasped her closer closer till they were as one body and in the oblivion her lips put upon him he was free to the bliss of her embrace heaven granted him that he placed her in a chair and knelt at her feet with both arms around her her bosom heaved her eyes never quitted him their light as the light on a rolling wave this young creature commonly so frank and straightforward was broken with bashfulness in her husband's arms womanly bashfulness on the torrent of womanly love tenfold more seductive than the bashfulness of girlhood terrible tenfold the loss of her seemed now as distantly far on the horizon of memory the fatal truth returned to him lose her lose this he looked up as if to ask god to confirm it the same sweet blue eyes the eyes that he had often seen in the dying glories of evening on him they dwelt shifting and fluttering and glittering but constant the light of them as the light on a rolling wave and true to him true good glorious as the angels of heaven and his she was a woman his wife the temptation to take her and be dumb was all powerful the wish to die against her bosom so strong as to be the prayer of his vital forces again he strained her to him but this time it was as a robber grasps priceless treasure with exultation and defiance one instant of this lucy whose pure tenderness had now surmounted the first wild passion of their meeting bent back her head from her surrendered body and said almost voicelessly her underlids wistfully quivering come and see him baby and then in great hope of the happiness she was going to give her husband and share with him and in tremour and doubt of what his feelings would be she blushed and her brows worked she tried to throw off the strangeness of a year of separation misunderstanding and uncertainty darling come and see him he is here she spoke more clearly though no louder richard had released her and she took his hand and he suffered himself to be led to the other side of the bed his heart began rapidly throbbing at the sight of a little rosy curtained cot covered with lace like milky summer cloud it seemed to him he would lose his manhood if he looked on that child's face stop he cried suddenly lucy turned first to him and then to her infant fearing it should have been disturbed lucy come back what is it darling said she in alarm at his voice and the grip he had unwittingly given her hand o god what an ordeal was this that to morrow he must face death perhaps die and be torn from his darling his wife and his child and that ere he went forth ere he could dare to see his child and lean his head reproachfully on his young wife's breast for the last time it might be he must stab her to the heart shatter the image she held of him lucy she saw him wrenched with agony and her own face took the whiteness of his she bending forward to him all her faculties strung to hearing he held her two hands that she might look on him and not spare the horrible wound he was going to lay open to her eyes lucy do you know why i came to you to night she moved her lips repeating his words lucy have you guessed why i did not come before her head shook widened eyes lucy i did not come because i was not worthy of my wife do you understand darling she faltered plaintively and hung crouching under him what have i done to make you angry with me o beloved cried he the tears bursting out of his eyes o beloved was all he could say kissing her hands passionately she waited reassured but in terror lucy i stayed away from you i could not come to you because i dared not come to you my wife my beloved i could not come because i was a coward because hear me this was the reason i have broken my marriage oath again her lips moved she caught at a dim fleshless meaning in them but you love me richard my husband you love me yes i have never loved i never shall love woman but you darling kiss me have you understood what i have told you kiss me she said he did not join lips i have come to you to night to ask your forgiveness her answer was kiss me can you forgive a man so base but you love me richard yes that i can say before god i love you and i have betrayed you and am unworthy of you not worthy to touch your hand to kneel at your feet to breathe the same air with you her eyes shone brilliantly you love me you love me darling and as one who has sailed through dark fears into daylight she said my husband my darling you will never leave me we never shall be parted again he drew his breath painfully to smooth her face growing rigid with fresh fears at his silence he met her mouth that kiss in which she spoke what her soul had to say calmed her and she smiled happily from it and in her manner reminded him of his first vision of her on the summer morning in the field of the meadow sweet he held her to him and thought then of a holier picture of mother and child of the sweet wonders of life she had made real to him had he not absolved his conscience at least the pangs to come made him think so he now followed her leading hand lucy whispered you mustn't disturb him mustn't touch him dear and with dainty fingers drew off the covering to the little shoulder one arm of the child was out along the pillow the small hand open his baby mouth was pouted full the dark lashes of his eyes seemed to lie on his plump cheeks richard stooped lower down to him hungering for some movement as a sign that he lived lucy whispered he sleeps like you richard one arm under his head great wonder and the stir of a grasping tenderness was in richard he breathed quick and soft bending lower till lucy's curls as she nestled and bent with him rolled on the crimson quilt of the cot a smile went up the plump cheeks forthwith the bud of a mouth was in rapid motion the young mother whispered blushing he's dreaming of me and the simple words did more than richard's eyes to make him see what was then lucy began to hum and buzz sweet baby language and some of the tiny fingers stirred and he made as if to change his cosy position but reconsidered and deferred it with a peaceful little sigh lucy whispered he is such a big fellow oh when you see him awake he is so like you richard he did not hear her immediately it seemed a bit of heaven dropped there in his likeness the more human the fact of the child grew the more heavenly it seemed his son his child should he ever see him awake at the thought he took the words that had been spoken and started from the dream he had been in will he wake soon lucy oh no not yet dear not for hours i would have kept him awake for you but he was so sleepy richard stood back from the cot he thought that if he saw the eyes of his boy and had him once on his heart he never should have force to leave him then he looked down on him again struggled to tear himself away two natures warred in his bosom or it may have been the magian conflict still going on he had come to see his child once and to make peace with his wife before it should be too late might he not stop with them might he not relinquish that devilish pledge was not divine happiness here offered to him if foolish ripton had not delayed to tell him of his interview with mountfalcon all might have been well but pride said it was impossible and then injury spoke for why was he thus base and spotted to the darling of his love a mad pleasure in the prospect of wreaking vengeance on the villain who had laid the trap for him once more blackened his brain if he would stay he could not so he resolved throwing the burden on fate the struggle was over but oh the pain lucy beheld the tears streaming hot from his face on the child's cot she marvelled at such excess of emotion but when his chest heaved and the extremity of mortal anguish appeared to have seized him her heart sank and she tried to get him in her arms he turned away from her and went to the window a half moon was over the lake look he said do you remember our rowing there one night and we saw the shadow of the cypress i wish i could have come early to night that we might have had another row and i have heard you sing there darling said she will it make you happier if i go with you now i will no lucy lucy you are brave oh no that i'm not i thought so once i know i am not now yes to have lived the child on your heart and never to have uttered a complaint you are brave o my lucy my wife you that have made me man i called you a coward i remember it i was the coward i the wretched vain fool darling i am going to leave you now you are brave and you will bear it listen in two days or three i may be back back for good if you will accept me promise me to go to bed quietly kiss the child for me and tell him his father has seen him he will learn to speak soon will he soon speak lucy dreadful suspicion kept her speechless she could only clutch one arm of his with both her hands going she presently gasped for two or three days no more i hope to night yes now going now my husband her faculties abandoned her you will be brave my lucy richard my darling husband going what is it takes you from me but questioning no further she fell on her knees and cried piteously to him to stay not to leave them then she dragged him to the little sleeper and urged him to pray by his side and he did but rose abruptly from his prayer when he had muttered a few broken words she praying on with tight strung nerves in the faith that what she said to the interceding mother above would be stronger than human hands on him nor could he go while she knelt there and he wavered he had not reckoned on her terrible suffering she came to him quiet i knew you would remain and taking his hand innocently fondling it am i so changed from her he loved you will not leave me dear but dread returned and the words quavered as she spoke them he was almost vanquished by the loveliness of her womanhood she drew his hand to her heart and strained it there under one breast come lie on my heart she murmured with a smile of holy sweetness he wavered more and drooped to her but summoning the powers of hell kissed her suddenly cried the words of parting and hurried to the door it was over in an instant she cried out his name clinging to him wildly and was adjured to be brave for he would be dishonoured if he did not go then she was shaken off mrs berry was aroused by an unusual prolonged wailing of the child which showed that no one was comforting it and failing to get any answer to her applications for admittance she made bold to enter there she saw lucy the child in her lap sitting on the floor senseless she had taken it from its sleep and tried to follow her husband with it as her strongest appeal to him and had fainted oh my oh my mrs berry moaned and i just now thinkin' they was so happy warming and caressing the poor infant she managed by degrees to revive lucy and heard what had brought her to that situation go to his father said mrs berry ta te tiddle te heighty o go my love and every horse in raynham shall be out after 'm this is what men brings us to heighty oighty iddlety ah or you take blessed baby and i'll go the baronet himself knocked at the door what is this he said i heard a noise and a step descend it's mr richard have gone sir austin have gone from his wife and babe rum te um te iddledy oh my goodness what sorrow's come on us and mrs berry wept and sang to baby and baby cried vehemently and lucy sobbing took him and danced him and sang to him with drawn lips and tears dropping over him and if the scientific humanist to the day of his death forgets the sight of those two poor true women jigging on their wretched hearts to calm the child he must have very little of the human in him there was no more sleep for raynham that night chapter xlv his ordeal is over i have just come from his room and seen him bear the worst that could be return at once he has asked for you i can hardly write intelligibly but i will tell you what we know two days after the dreadful night when he left us his father heard from ralph morton richard had fought a duel in france with lord mountfalcon and was lying wounded at a hamlet on the coast his father started immediately with his poor wife and i followed in company with his aunt and his child the wound was not dangerous he was shot in the side somewhere but the ball injured no vital part we thought all would be well oh how sick i am of theories and systems and the pretensions of men there was his son lying all but dead and the man was still unconvinced of the folly he had been guilty of i could hardly bear the sight of his composure i shall hate the name of science till the day i die give me nothing but commonplace unpretending people they were at a wretched french cabaret smelling vilely where we still remain and the people try as much as they can do to compensate for our discomforts by their kindness the french poor people are very considerate where they see suffering i will say that for them the doctors had not allowed his poor lucy to go near him she sat outside his door and none of us dared disturb her that was a sight for science his father and myself and mrs berry were the only ones permitted to wait on him and whenever we came out there she sat not speaking a word for she had been told it would endanger his life but she looked such awful eagerness she had the sort of eye i fancy mad persons have i was sure her reason was going we did everything we could think of to comfort her a bed was made up for her and her meals were brought to her there of course there was no getting her to eat what do you suppose his alarm was fixed on he absolutely said to me but i have not patience to repeat his words he thought her to blame for not commanding herself for the sake of her maternal duties he had absolutely an idea of insisting that she should make an effort to suckle the child i shall love that mrs berry to the end of my days i really believe she has twice the sense of any of us science and all she asked him plainly if he wished to poison the child and then he gave way but with a bad grace poor man perhaps i am hard on him i remember that you said richard had done wrong yes well that may be but his father eclipsed his wrong in a greater wrong a crime or quite as bad for if he deceived himself in the belief that he was acting righteously in separating husband and wife and exposing his son as he did i can only say that there are some who are worse than people who deliberately commit crimes no doubt science will benefit by it they kill little animals for the sake of science we have with us doctor bairam and a french physician from dieppe a very skilful man it was he who told us where the real danger lay we thought all would be well a week had passed and no fever supervened we told richard that his wife was coming to him and he could bear to hear it i went to her and began to circumlocute thinking she listened she had the same eager look when i told her she might go in with me to see her dear husband her features did not change m despres who held her pulse at the time told me in a whisper it was cerebral fever brain fever coming on we have talked of her since i noticed that though she did not seem to understand me her bosom heaved and she appeared to be trying to repress it and choke something i am sure now from what i know of her character that she even in the approaches of delirium was preventing herself from crying out her last hold of reason was a thought for richard it was against a creature like this that we plotted i have the comfort of knowing that i did my share in helping to destroy her had she seen her husband a day or two before but no there was a new system to interdict that or had she not so violently controlled her nature as she did i believe she might have been saved he said once of a man that his conscience was a coxcomb will you believe that when he saw his son's wife poor victim lying delirious he could not even then see his error you said he wished to take providence out of god's hands his mad self deceit would not leave him i am positive that while he was standing over her he was blaming her for not having considered the child indeed he made a remark to me that it was unfortunate 'disastrous' i think he said that the child should have to be fed by hand i dare say it is all i pray is that this young child may be saved from him i cannot bear to see him look on it he does not spare himself bodily fatigue but what is that that is the vulgarest form of love i know what you will say you will say i have lost all charity and i have but i should not feel so austin if i could be quite sure that he is an altered man even now the blow has struck him he is reserved and simple in his speech and his grief is evident but i have doubts he heard her while she was senseless call him cruel and harsh and cry that she had suffered and i saw then his mouth contract as if he had been touched perhaps when he thinks his mind will be clearer but what he has done cannot be undone i do not imagine he will abuse women any more the doctor called her a 'forte et belle jeune femme' and he said she was as noble a soul as ever god moulded clay upon a noble soul 'forte et belle' she lies upstairs if he can look on her and not see his sin i almost fear god will never enlighten him she died five days after she had been removed the shock had utterly deranged her i was with her she died very quietly breathing her last breath without pain asking for no one a death i should like to die her cries at one time were dreadfully loud she screamed that she was 'drowning in fire' and that her husband would not come to her to save her we deadened the sound as much as we could but it was impossible to prevent richard from hearing he knew her voice and it produced an effect like fever on him whenever she called he answered you could not hear them without weeping mrs berry sat with her and i sat with him and his father moved from one to the other but the trial for us came when she was gone how to communicate it to richard or whether to do so at all his father consulted with us we were quite decided that it would be madness to breathe it while he was in that state i can admit now as things have turned out we were wrong his father left us i believe he spent the time in prayer and then leaning on me he went to richard and said in so many words that his lucy was no more i thought it must kill him he listened and smiled i never saw a smile so sweet and so sad he said he had seen her die as if he had passed through his suffering a long time ago he shut his eyes i could see by the motion of his eyeballs up that he was straining his sight to some inner heaven i cannot go on i think richard is safe had we postponed the tidings till he came to his clear senses it must have killed him his father was right for once then but if he has saved his son's body he has given the death blow to his heart richard will never be what he promised a letter found on his clothes tells us the origin of the quarrel i have had an interview with lord m this morning i cannot say i think him exactly to blame richard forced him to fight at least i do not select him the foremost for blame he was deeply and sincerely affected by the calamity he has caused alas he was only an instrument your poor aunt is utterly prostrate and talks strange things of her daughter's death she is only happy in drudging dr bairam says we must under any circumstances keep her employed whilst she is doing something she can chat freely but the moment her hands are not occupied she gives me an idea that she is going into a fit we expect the dear child's uncle to day mr thompson is here i have taken him upstairs to look at her that poor young man has a true heart come at once you will not be in time to see her she will lie at raynham if you could you would see an angel he sits by her side for hours i can give you no description of her beauty you will not delay i know dear austin and i want you for your presence will make me more charitable than i find it possible to be have you noticed the expression in the eyes of blind men that is just how richard looks as he lies there silent in his bed striving to image her on his brain the end etext editor's bookmarks a maker of proverbs what is he but a narrow mind wit feeling nothing beyond a lively interest in
