conclusion chapter i love at a school a procession of schoolboys having to meet a procession of schoolgirls on the sundays dead march called a walk round the park could hardly go by without dropping to a hum in its chatter and the shot of incurious halfeyes the petticoated creaturesall so much of a swarm unless you stare at them like lanterns the boys cast glance because it relieved their heaviness things were lumpish and gloomy that day of the week the girls who sped their peep of inquisition before the moment of transit let it be seen that they had minds occupied with thoughts of their own our gallant fellows forgot the intrusion of the foreign as soon as it had passed a sarcastic discharge was jerked by chance at the usher and the governessat the old game it seemed or why did they keep steering columns to meet there was no fun in meeting it would never be happening every other sunday and oftener by sheer tosspenny accident they were moved like pieces for the pleasure of these two sometimes the meeting occurred twice during the stupid marchout when it became so nearly vexatious to boys almost biliously oppressed by the tedium of a day merely allowing them to shove the legs along ironically naming it animal excise that some among them pronounced the sham variation of monotony to be a bothering nuisance if it was going to happen every sunday though sunday required diversions they hated the absurdity in this meeting and meeting for they were obliged to anticipate it as a part of their ignominious weekly performance and they could not avoid reflecting on it as a thing done over again it had them in front and in rear and it was a kind of broadside mirror flashing at them the exact opposite of themselves in an identically similar situation that forced a resemblance touching the old game cupers fold was a healthy school owing to the good lead of the head boy matey weyburn a lad with a heart for games to bring renown and no thought about girls his emulation the fellows fancied was for getting the school into a journal of the sports he used to read one sent him by a sporting officer of his name and talk enviously of public schools printed whatever they dida privilege and dignity of which they had unrivalled enjoyment in the past days when wealth was more jealously exclusive and he was always prompting for challenges and saving up to pay expenses and the fellows were to laugh at kicks and learn the art of selfdefencetrain to rejoice in whipcord muscles the son of a tradesman if a boy fell under the imputation was worthy of honour with him let the fellow but show grip and toughness he loathed a skulker and his face was known for any boy who would own to fatigue or confess himself beaten go to bed was one of his terrible stings matey was good at lessons tooliked them liked latin and greek would help a poor stumbler where he did such good work was in sharpening the fellows to excel he kept them to the grindstone so that they had no time for rusty brooding and it was fit done by exhortations off a pedestal like st paul at the athenians it breathed out of him every day of the week he carried a light for followers whatever he demanded of them he himself did it easily he would say to boys youre going to be men meaning something better than women there was a notion that matey despised girls consequently never much esteemed they were in disfavour the old game was mentioned only because of a tradition of an usher and governess leering sick eyes until they slunk away round a corner and married and set up a school for themselvesan emasculate ending comment on it came of a design to show that the whole game had been examined dismissed as uninteresting and profitless one of the boys alluded in mateys presence to their general view upon the part played by womankind on the stage confident of a backing and he had it in a way their noble chief whisked the subject as not worth a discussion but he turned to a younger chap who said he detested girls and asked him how about a sister at home and the youngster coloured and matey took him and spun him round with a friendly tap on the shoulder odd remarks at intervals caused it to be suspected that he had ideas concerning girls they were high as his head above the school and there they were left with algebra and homer for they were not of a sort to inflame until the boys noticed how he gave up speaking and fell to hard looking though she was dark enough to get herself named browny in the absence of a fair girl of equal height to set beside her browny shone she had a nice mouth ready for a smile at the corners or so it was before matey let her see that she was his mark now she kept her mouth asleep and her eyes half down up to the moment of her nearing to pass when the girl opened on him as if lifting her eyelids from sleep to the window a full sidelook like a throb and no disguiseno slyness or boldness either not a bit of languishing you might think her heart came quietly out the look was like the fall of light on the hills from the first of morning it lasted half a minute and left a ruffle for a good halfhour even the younger fellows without knowing what affected them were moved by the new picture of a girl as if it had been a frontispiece of a romantic story some day to be read she looked compelled to look but consenting and unashamed at home in submission just the look that wins observant boys shrewd as dogs to read by signs if they are interested in the persons they read brownys meaning that matey had only to come and snatch her he was her master and she was a brave girl ready to go all over the world with him had taken to him as he to her shot for shot her taking to the pick of the school was a capital proof that she was of the right sort to be sure she could not much help herself some of the boys regretted her not being fair but as they felt and sought to explain in the manner of the wag of a tail with elbows and eyebrows to one anothers understanding fair girls could never have let fly such look fair girls are softer woollier and when they mean to look serious overdo it by craping solemn or they pinafore a jigging eagerness or hoist propriety on a chubby flaxen grin or else they dart an eye or they mince and prim and pout and are sighaway and dyingducky given to girls tricks browny after all was the girl for matey she won a victory right away and out of hand on behalf of her cloudandmoon sisters as against the sunnymeadowy for slanting intermediates are not espied of boys in anything conquered by browny they went over to her colour equal to arguing that venus at her mightiest must have been dark or she would not have stood a comparison with the forest goddess of the crescent swanning it through a lakeon the leap for run of the chasewatching the dart with her humming bow at breast the fair are simple sugary things prone to fat like broadsops in milk but the others are milky nuts good to bite lacedaemonian virgins hard to beat putting us on our mettle and they are for heroes and they can be brave so these boys felt conquered by browny a sneaking native taste for the forsaken side known to renegades hauled at them if her image waned during the week and it waned a little but sunday restored and stamped it by a sudden turn the whole upperschool had fallen to thinking of girls and the meeting on the sunday was a prospect one of the dayboarders had a sister in the seminary of miss vincent he was plied to obtain information concerning brownys name and her parents he had it pat to hand in answer no parents came to see her an aunt came now and then her aunts name was not wanted brownys name was aminta farrell farrell might pass aminta was debated this female christian name had a foreign twang it gave dissatisfaction boy after boy had a try at it with the same effect you could not speak the name without a pursing of the month and a puckering of the nose beastly to see as one little fellow reminded them on a day when matey was in more than common favour topping a pitch of rapture for clean bowling first ball middle stump on the kick the best bat of the other eleven in a match and says this youngster drawling soon after the cheers and claps had subsided to business aminta he made it funny by saying it as if to himself and the ground in a subdued way while he swung his leg on a halfcircle like a skater hands in pockets he was a sly young rascal innocently precocious enough and he meant no disrespect either to browny or to matey but he had to run for it his delivery of the name being so like what was in the breasts of the senior fellows as to the inferiority of any aminta to old matey that he set them laughing and browny was on the field to reprove them left of the teabooth with her schoolmates part of her head under a scarlet parasol a girl with such a name as aminta might not be exactly up to the standard of old matey still if he thought her so and she had spirit the school was bound to subscribe and that look of hers warranted her for taking her share in the story like the brigands wife loading gnus for him while he knocks over the foremost carabineer on the mountainledge below who drops on his back with a hellish expression browny was then clearly seen all round instead of only frontface as on the sunday in the park when fellows could not spy backward after passing the pleasure they had in seeing her all round involved no fresh stores of observation for none could tell how she tied her backhair which was the question put to them by a cynic of a boy said to be queasy with excess of sisters they could tell that she was tall for a girl or tallishnot a maypole she drank a cup of tea and ate a slice of breadandbutter no cake she appeared undisturbed when matey wearing his holiday white ducks and all aglow entered the booth she was not expected to faint only she stood for the foreign aminta more than for their familiar browny in his presence not a sign of the look which had fired the school did she throw at him change the colour and you might compare her to a lobster fixed on end with a chin and no eyes matey talked to miss vincent up to the instant of his running to bat she would have liked to guess how he knew she had a brother on the medical staff of one of the regiments in india she asked him twice and his cheeks were redder than cricket in the sun he said he read all the reports from india and asked her whether she did not admire lord ormont our general of cavalry whose charge at the head of fifteen hundred horse in the last great battle shattered the enemys right wing and gave us the victoryrolled him up and stretched him out like a carpet for dusting miss vincent exclaimed that it was really strange now he should speak of lord ormont for she had been speaking of him herself in morning to one of her young ladies whose mind was bent on his heroic deeds matey turned his face to the group of young ladies quite pleased that one of them loved his hero and he met a smile here and therenot from miss aminta farrell she was a complete disappointment to the boys that day aminta was mouthed at any allusions to her so she not being a match for matey they let her drop the flush that had swept across the school withered to a dry recollection except when on one of their sunday afternoons she fanned the desert lord ormont became the subject of inquiry and conversation and for his own sakenot altogether to gratify matey the saturday autumn evenings walk home after the race out to tea at a distant village too late in the year for cricket too early for regular football suited matey going at long strides for the story of his heros adventures and it was nicer than talk about girls and puzzling here lay a clear field for he had the right to speak of a cavalry officer his father died of wounds in the service and matey naturally intended to join the dragoons if he could get enough money to pay for mess he said laughing lord ormont was his pattern of a warrior we had in him a lord who cast off luxury to live like a spartan when under arms with a passion to serve his country and sustain the glory of our military annals he revived respect for the noble class in the hearts of englishmen he was as good an authority on horseflesh as any englishman alive the best for the management of cavalry there never was a better cavalry leader the boys had come to know that browny admired lord ormont so they saw a double reason why matey should and walking home at his grand swing in the october dusk their school hero drew their national hero closer to them every fellow present was dead against the usher mr shalders when he took advantage of a pause to strike in with his murat he harped on murat whenever he had a chance now he did it for the purpose of casting eclipse upon majorgeneral lord ormont the son and grandson of english earls for he was an earl by his title and murat was the son of an innkeeper shalders had to admit that murat might have served in the stables when a boy honour to murat of course for climbing the peaks shalders too might interest him in military affairs and murat he did no harm and could be amusing it rather added to his amount of dignity it was rather absurd at the same time for an english usher to be spouting and glowing about a french general who had been a stableboy and became a king with his murat this murat that and hurrah murat in red and white and green uniform tunic and breeches and a chimneyafire of feathers and how the giant he was charged at the head of ten thousand horse all going like a cataract under a rainbow over the rocks right into the middle of the enemy and through and he a spark ahead and the enemy streaming on all sides flat away as you see puffed smoke and flame of a bonfire that was fun to set boys jigging no wonder how in russia the cossacks feared him and scampered from the shadow of his plumeswere clouds flying off his breath that was a fine warm picture for the boys on late autumn or early winter evenings shalders warming his back at the grate describing bivouacs in the snow they liked well enough to hear him when he was not opposing matey and lord ormont he perked on his toes and fetched his hand from behind him to flourish it when his murat came out the speaking of his name clapped him on horsebackthe only horseback he ever knew he was as fond of giving out the name murat as you see in old engravings of tobaccoshops men enjoying the emission of their whiff of smoke matey was not inclined to class lord ormont alongside murat a firstrate horseman and an eagleeye as shalders rightly said and matey agreed that forty thousand cavalry under your orders is a toss above fifteen hundred but the claim for a frenchman of a superlative merit to swallow and make nothing of the mention of our best cavalry generals irritated him to call murat a mountebank shalders retorted that lord ormont was a reprobate matey hoped he would some day write us an essay on the morale of illustrious generals of cavalry and shalders told him he did not advance his case by talking nonsense each then repeated to the boys a famous exploit of his hero their verdict was favourable to lord ormont our english general learnt riding before he was ten years old on the pampas where you ride all day and cook your steak for your dinner between your seat and your saddle he rode with his father and his uncle muncastle the famous traveller into paraguay he saw fighting before he was twelve before he was twenty he was learning outpost duty in the austrian frontier cavalry he served in the peninsula served in canada served in india volunteered for any chance of distinction no need to say much of his mastering the picked indian swordsmen in single combat he knew their trick and was quick to save his reins when they made a dash threatening the headstrokeabout the same as disabling sails in old naval engagements that was the part for the officer we are speaking of the general for that matter he had as keen an eye for the field and the moment for his arm to strike as any murat one world have liked to see murat matched against the sabre of a wily rajpoot as to campaigns and strategy lord ormonts head was a map what of murat and lord ormont horse to horse and sword to sword come imagine that if you are for comparisons and if lord ormont never headed a lot of thousands it does not prove he was unable lord ormont was as big as murat more he was a christian to his horses how about murat in that respect lord ormont cared for his men did murat so particularly much and he was as cunning fronting odds and a thunderbolt at the charge why speak of him in the past he is an english lord a lord by birth and he is alive things may be expected of him tomorrow or next day shalders here cut matey short by meanly objecting to that men are mortal he said with a lot of pretended stuff deploring our human condition in the elegy strain and he fell to reckoning the english heros ageas that he lord ormont had been a name in the world for the last twentyfive years or more the noble lord could be no chicken we are justified in calculating by the course of nature that his term of activity is approaching or has approached or in fact has drawn to its close if your estimate sir approaches to correctness rejoined mateytellingly his comrades thought sixty as you may learn some day is a serious age matthew weyburn matey said he should be happy to reach it with half the honours lord ormont had won excepting the duels shalders had the impudence to say if the cause is a good one cried matey the cause or lord ormont has been maligned was reprehensible in the extremest degree shalders cockhorsed on his heels to his toes and back with a bang what was the cause if you please sir a boy probably naughty inquired and as shalders did not vouchsafe a reply the bigger boys knew they revelled in the devilish halo of skirts on the whirl encircling lord ormonts laurelled head that was a spark in their blood struck from a dislike of the tone assumed by mr shalders to sustain his argument with his men are mortal and talk of a true living champion as no chicken and the wordy drawl over justification for calculating the approach of a close to a term of activityin the case of a proved hero guardians of boys should make sure that the boys are on their side before they raise the standard of virtue nor ought they to summon morality for support of a polemic matey weyburns object of worship rode superior to a morality puffing its phrasy trumpet and somehow the sacrifice of an enormous number of women to lord ormonts glory seemed natural the very thing that should be in the case of a firstrate military hero and commanderscipio notwithstanding it brightens his flame and it is agreeable to them that is how they come to distinction they have no other chance they are only women they are mad to be singed and they rush pelfmall all for the honour of the candle shortly after this discussion matey was heard informing some of the bigger fellows he could tell them positively that lord ormonts age was under fiftyfourthe prime of manhood and a jolly long way off death the greater credit to him therefore if he had been a name in the world for anything like the period shalders insinuated to get himself out of a sad quandary matey sounded the queer word so as to fix it sticking to the usher calling him mr peter bell shalders at which the boys roared and there was a question or two about names which belonged to verses for people caring to read poems to the joy of the school he displayed a greater knowledge of murat than shalders had named the different places in europe where lord ormont and murat were both springing to the saddle at the same timeone a marshal the other a lieutenant one a king to be off his throne any day the other a born english nobleman seated firm as fate and he accused murat of carelessness of his horses ingratitude to his benefactor circussy style shalders went so far as to defend murat for attending to the affairs of his kingdom instead of galloping over hedges and ditches to swell napoleons ranks in distress matey listened to him there he became grave he nodded like a man saying i suppose we must examine it in earnest the school was damped to hear him calling it a nice question still he said he thought he should have gone and that settled it the boys inclined to speak contemptuously of shalders matey world not let them he contrasted shalders with the other ushers who had no enthusiasms he said enthusiasms were salt to a man and he liked shalders for spelling at his battles and thinking he understood them and admiring murat and leading virgil and parts of lucan for his recreation he said he liked the french because they could be splendidly enthusiastic he almost lost his english flavour when he spoke in downright approval of a small french fellow coming from orthez near the pyrenees for senselessly dashing and kicking at a couple of english who jeered to hear orthez nameda place trampled under wellingtons heels on his march across conquered france the foreign little cockerel was a clever lad learning english fast and anxious to show he had got hold of the english trick of not knowing when he was beaten his french vanity insisted on his engaging the two though one of them stood aside and the other let him drive his nose all the compass round at a poker fist what was worse matey examined these two in the interests of fair play as if he doubted little emile grenat set matters right with his boast to vindicate his country against double the number and matey praised him though he knew emile had been floored without effort by the extension of a single fist he would not hear the french abused he said they were chivalrous they were fine fellows topping the world in some things his father had fought them and learnt to respect them perhaps his father had learnt to respect jews for there was a boy named abner he protected who smelt jewish he said they ran us gentiles hard and carried big guns only a reputation like mateys could have kept his leadership from a challenge joseph masner formerly a rival went about hinting and shrugging all to no purpose you find boys born to be chiefs on the day of the snowfight matey won the toss and chose j masner first pick and masner aged seventeen and some months big as a navvy lumbered across to him and took his directions proud to stand in the front centre at the head of the attack and bear the bruntjust what he was fit for matey gave no offence by choosing halfway down the list his little french friend whom he stationed beside himself rather off his battlefront as at point at cricket not quite so far removed two boys at his heels piled ammunition the sides met midway of a marshy ground where a couple of flat and shelving banks formed for a broad new road good for ten abreastcounting a step of the slopesran transverse and the order of the game was to clear the bank and drive the enemy on to the frozen ditchwater miss vincent heard in the morning from the sister of little collett of the great engagement coming off she was moved by curiosity and so the young ladies of her establishment beheld the young gentlemen of mr cupers in furious division and mateys sore aim and hard fling equal to a slingers relieving j masner of a foremost assailant with a spanker on the nob they may have fancied him clever for selecting a position rather comfortable as things went until they had sight of him with his little french ally and two others ammunition boys to rear descending one bank and scaling another right into the flank of the enemy when his old tower of a masner was being heavily pressed by numbers then came a fight hand to hand but the enemy stood in a clamp not to split like a nut between crackers they gave way and rolled backing in lumps from bank to ditch the battle was over before the young ladies knew they wondered to see matey shuffling on his coat and hopping along at easy bounds to pay his respects to miss vincent near whom was browny and this time he and browny talked together he then introduced little emile to her she spoke of napoleon at brienne and complimented matey he said he was cavalry not artillery that day they talked to hear one anothers voices by constantly appealing to miss vincent he made their conversation together seem as under her conduct and she took a slide on some french phrases with little emile her young ladies looked shrinking and envious to see the fellows wet to the skin laughing wrestling linking arms and some who were clownfaced with a wipe of scarlet getting friends to rub their cheeks with snow all of them happy as larks in air a big tea steaming for them at the school those girls had a leap and a fail of the heart glad to hug themselves in their dry clothes and not so warm as the dripping boys were nor so madly fond of their dresscircle seats to look on at a play they were not allowed even to desire to share they looked on at blows given and taken in good temper hardship sharpening jollity the thought of the difference between themselves and the boys must have been something like the tight bandcall it corsetover the chest trying to lift and stretch for draughts of air but brownys feeling naturally was that all this advantage for the boys came of matey weyburns lead miss vincent with her young ladies walked off in couples orderly chicks the usual sunday march of their every day the school was coolish to them one of the fellows hummed bars of some hymn tune rather faster than church and next day there was a murmur of letters passing between matey and browny regularly little collett for postman anybody might have guessed it but the report spread a feeling that girls are not the entirely artificial beings or flat targets we suppose the school began to brood like air deadening on ovenheat winter is henmother to the idea of love in schools if the idea has fairly entered various girls of different colours were selected by boys for animated correspondence that never existed and was vigorously prosecuted with efforts to repress contempt of them in courtship for their affections they found their part of it by no means difficult when they imagined the lines without the words or better still the letter without the lines a holy satisfaction belonged to the sealed thing the breaking of the seal and inspection of the contents imposed perplexity on that sentiment they thought of certain possible sentences matey and browny would exchange but the plain conceivable almost visible outside of the letter had a stronger spell for them than the visionary inside this fancied contemplation of the loveletter was reversed in them at once by the startling news of miss vincents discovery and seizure of the sealed thing and her examination of the burden it contained then their thirst was for dramato see to drink every wonderful syllable those lovers had written miss vincents hand was upon one of mateys letters she had come across the sister of little collett selina her name was carrying it she saw nothing of the others aminta was not the girl to let her nor did mr cuper dare demand from matey a sight or restitution of the young ladys half of the correspondence he preached heavily at matey deplored that the boy he most trusted etcthe school could have repeated it without hearing we know the masters lecture in tonesit sings up to sing down and touches nobody as soon as he dropped to natural talk and spoke of his responsibility and miss vincents matey gave the word of a man of honour that he would not seek to communicate farther with miss farrell at the school now there was a regular thunderhash among the boys on the rare occasions when they met the girls all that matey and browny were forbidden to write they lookedmuch like what it had been before the discovery and they dragged the boys back from promised instant events it was nevertheless a heaving picture like the sea in the background of a marine piece at the theatre which rouses anticipations of storm and shows readiness brownys full eyebrow sat on her dark eye like a cloud of winter noons over the vanishing sun matey was the prisoner gazing at light of a barred window and measuring the strength of the bars she looked unhappy but looked unbeaten more her look at him fed the school on thoughts of what love really is when it is not fished out of books and poetry for though she was pale starved and pale they could see she was never the one to be sighing and as for him he looked ground dower all to edge however much they puzzled over things she made them feel they were sure as to her that she drove straight and meant blood the life or death of it all her own if need be and confidence in the captain she had chosen she could have been imagined saying there is a storm but i am ready to embark with you this minute that sign of courage in real danger ennobled her among girls the name browny was put aside for a respectful aminta big and bright events to come out in the world were hinted from the love of such a couple the boys were not ashamed to speak the very word love how he does love that girl well and how she loves him she did but the boys had to be seeing her look at matey if they were to put the girl on some balanced equality with a fellow she was compelled to love it seemed to them that he gave and that she was a creature carried to him like driftwood along the current of the flood given in spite of herself when they saw those eyes of hers they were impressed with an idea of her as a voluntary giver too pretty well the half to the bargain and it confused their notion of feminine inferiority they resolved to think her an exceptional girl which in truth they could easily do for none but an exceptional girl could win matey to love her since nothing appeared likely to happen at the school they speculated upon what would occur out in the world and were assisted to conjecture by a rumour telling of aminta farrells aunt as a resident at dover those were days when the benevolently international m de porquet had begun to act as interpreter to english schools in the portico of the french language and under his guidance it was asked in contempt of the answer combien de postes dici a douvres but accepting the rumour as a piece of information the answer became important ici was twenty miles to the northwest of london how long would it take matey to reach donvres or at which of the combien did he intend to waylay and away with aminta the boys went about pounding at the interrogative french phrase in due sincerity behind the burlesque of traveller bothering coachman mateys designs could be finessed only by a knowledge of his character that he was not the fellow to give up the girl he had taken to and impediments might multiply but he would bear them down three days before the breakup of the school another rumour came tearing through it amintas aunt had withdrawn her from miss vincents and now rose the question twodozenmouthed did matey know her address at douvres his face grew stringy and his voice harder and his eyes ready to burst from a smother of fire all the same he did his work he was the good old fellow at games considerate in school affairs kind to the youngsters he was heard to laugh he liked best the company of his little french friend from orthez over whose shoulder his hand was laid sometimes as they strolled and chatted in two languages he really went a long way to make french fellows popular and the boys were sorry that little emile was off to finish his foreign education in germany his english was pretty good thanks to matey he went away promising to remember old england saying he was french first and a briton next he had lots of plunk which accounted for mateys choice of him as a friend among the juniors chapter ii lady charlotte lovepassages at a school must produce a ringing crisis if they are to leave the rosy impression which spans the gap of holidays neither matey nor browny returned to their yoke and cupers boys recollected the couple chiefly on sundays they remembered several of mateys doings and sayings his running and high leaping his bowling a maxim or two of his and the tight strong fellow he was also that the damsels colour distinctly counted for dark she became nearly black in their minds well and englishmen have been known to marry indian princesses some have a liking for negresses there are nubians rather pretty in pictures if you can stand thick lips her colour does not matter provided the girl is of the right sort the exchange of letters between the lovers was mentioned the discovery by miss vincent of their cool habit of corresponding passed for an incident and there it remained stiff as a poet not being heated by a story to run so the foregone excitement lost warmth and went out like a winter sun at noon or a match lighted before the candle is handy lord ormont continued to be a subject of discussion from time to time for he was a name in the newspapers and mr shalders had been worked by matey weyburn into a state of raw antagonism at the mention of the gallant general he could not avoid sitting in judgement on him according to mr shalders the opinion of all thoughtful people in england was with john company and the better part of the press to condemn lord ormont in his quarrel with the commissioner of one of the indian provinces who had the support of the governor of his presidency and of the viceroy the latter not unreservedly yet ostensibly inclined to condemn a too prompt military hand the gordian knot of a difficulty cut is agreeable in the contemplation of an official chief hesitating to use the sword and benefiting by having it done for him lord ormont certainly cut the knot mr shalders was cornered by the boys coming at him one after another without a stop vowing it was the exercise of a military judgement upon a military question at a period of urgency which had brought about the quarrel with the commissioner and the reproof of the governor he betrayed the man completely cornered by generalizing he said we are a civilian people we pride ourselves on having civilian methods how can that be if we have won india with guns and swords but that splendid jewel for englands tiara won said he and he might as well have said crown we are bound to sheathe the sword and govern by the book of the law but if they wont have the book of the law they knew the power behind it not if we knock nothing harder than the book of the law upon their skulls happily for the country englands councils are not directed by boys ah but were speaking of india mr shalders you are presuming to speak of an act of insubordination committed by a military officer under civilian command what if we find an influential prince engaged in conspiracy we look for proof suppose we have good proof we summon him to exonerate himself no we mount and ride straight away into his territory spot the treason deport him and rule in his place it was all very well for mr shalders to say he talked to boys he was cornered again as his shrug confessed the boys asked among themselves whether he would have taken the same view if his murat had done it these illogical boys fought for matey weyburn in their defence of lord ormont somewhere they wee sure old matey was hammering to the same endthey could hear him thought of him inspired them to unwonted argumentative energy that they might support his cause and scatter the gloomy prediction of the school as going to the dogs now matey had left the subject provoked everywhere in great britain a division similar to that between master and boys at cupers establishment one party for our modern english magisterial methods with indians the other for the decisive oriental at the early time to suit their native tastes and the book of the law is to be conciliatingly addressed to their sentiments by a benign civilizing power or the sword is out smartly at the hint of a warning to protect the swords conquests under one aspect we appear potteringly european under another drunk of the east lord ormonts ride at the head of two hundred horsemen across a stretch of country including hill and forest to fall like a bolt from the blue on the suspected prince in the midst of his gathering warriors was a handsome piece of daring and the highhanded treatment of the prince was held by his advocates to be justified by the provocation and the result he scattered an unprepared body of many hundreds who might have enveloped him and who would presumptively have stood their ground had they not taken his handful to be the advance of regiments these are the deeds that win empires the argument in his favour ran are they of a character to maintain empires the counterquestion was urged men of a deliberative aspect were not wanting in approval of the sharp and summary of the sword in air when we have to deal with indians they chose to regard it as a matter of the dealing with indians and put aside the question of the contempt of civil authority counting the cries lord ormont won his case festival aldermen smoking clubmen buckskin squires obsequious yet privately excitable tradesmen sedentary coachmen and cabmen of viking descent were set to think like boys about him and the boys the women and the poets formed a tipsy chorea journalists on the whole were fairly halved as regarded numbers in relation to weight they were with the burgess and the presbyter they preponderated heavily in the direction of englands burgess view of all cases disputed between civilian and soldier but that was when the peril was over admirers of lord ormont enjoyed a perusal of a letter addressed by him to the burgesss journal and so did his detractors the printing of it was an act of editorial ruthlessness the noble soldier had no mould in his intellectual or educational foundry for the casting of sentences and the editors leading type to the letter without further notice of the writerwho was given a prominent place or scaffolding for the execution of himself publicly if it pleased him to do that thingtickled the critical mind lord ormont wrote intemperately his titanic hurling of blocks against critics did no harm to an enemy skilled in the use of trimmer weapons notably the fine one of letting big missiles rebound he wrote from india with indian heatcurry and capsicums it was remarked he dared to claim the countenance of the commanderinchief of the army of india for an act disapproved by the india house other letters might be on their way curryer than the preceding his friends feared and might also be malevolently printed similarly commissioning the reverberation of them to belabour his name before the public admirers were still prepared to admire but aldermen not at the feast squirearchs not in the saddle or at the bottle some few of the juvenile and female fervent were becoming susceptible to a frosty critical tone in the public pronunciation of lord ormonts name since the printing of his letter and the letters it called forth none of them doubted that his case was good the doubt concerned the effect on it of his manner of pleading it and if he damaged his case he compromised his admirers why the case of a man who has cleverly won a bold stroke for his country must be good as long as he holds his tongue a grateful country will right him in the end he has only to wait and not so very long this i did now examine it nothing more needed to be said by him if that true he has a temper it is owned that he is a hero we take him with his qualities impetuosity being one and not unsuited to his arm of the service as he has shown if his temper is high it is an element of a character proved heroical so has the sun his blotches and we believe that they go to nourish the luminary rather than that they are a disease of the photosphere lord ormonts apologists had to contend with anecdotes and dicta now pouring in from offended britons for illustration of an impetuosity fit to make another charley xii of swedena gratuitous coriolanus haughtiness as well new among a people accustomed socially to bow the head to their nobles and not of late expecting a kick for their pains newspapers wrote of him that a martinet to subordinates he was known for the most unruly of lieutenants they alluded to current sayings as that he habitually took counsel of his horse on the field when a movement was entrusted to his discretion numerous were the journalistic sentences running under an air of eulogy of the lordly warrior purposely to be tripped and producing their damnable effect despite the obvious artifice the writer of the letter from bombay signed ormont was a born subject for the antithetical craftsmens tricky springes he was additionally of infamous repute for morale in burgess estimation from his having a keen appreciation of female beauty and a prickly sense of masculine honour the stir to his name roused pestilential domestic stories in those days the aristocrat still claimed licence and eminent soldiernobles comporting themselves as imitative servants of their god mars on the fields of love and war stood necessarily prepared to vindicate their conduct as the field of the measured paces without deeming themselves bounden to defend the course they took our burgess who bowed head to his aristocrat and hired the soldier to fight for him could not see that such misbehaviour necessarily ensued lord ormont had fought duels at home and abroad his readiness to fight again and against odds and with a totally unused weapon was exhibited by his attack on the press in the columns of the press it wore the comical face to the friends deploring it which belongs to things we do that are so very like us they agreed with his devoted sister lady charlotte eglett as to the prudence of keeping him out of england for a time if possible at the first perusal of the letter lady charlotte quitted her place in leicestershire husband horses guests the hunt to scour across a vacant london and pick up acquaintances under stress to be spots there in the hunting season with them to gossip for counsel on the subject of ormonts handgrenade and how to stop and extinguish a second she was a person given to plain speech stinkpot she called it when acknowledging foul elements in the composition and the harm it did to the unskilful balist her view of the burgess english imaged a mighty monster behind bars to whom we offer anything but our hand as soon as he gets held of that he has you he wont let it loose with flesh on the bones we must offend himwe cant be man or woman without offending his tastes and his worships but while we keep from contact ie intercommunication he may growl he is harmless witness the many occasions when her brother offended worse and had been unworried only growled at and distantly not in a way to rouse concern and at the neat review or procession into the city or public display of any sort ormont had but to show himself he was the popular favourite immediately he had not committed the folly of writing a letter to a newspaper then lady charlotte paid an early visit to the office of the great london solicitor arthur abner who wielded the law as an instrument of protection for countless illustrious people afflicted by what they stir or attract in a wealthy metropolis she went simply to gossip of her brothers affairs with a refreshing man of the world not given to circumlocutions and not afraid of her she had no deeper object but fancying she heard the clerk on his jump from the stool inform her that mr abner was out out she cried and rattled the room thumping under knitted brows out of town for a man of business taking holidays when a lady craves for gossip disappointed her faith in him as cruelly as the shutup empty inn the broken hunter knocking at a hollow door miles off home mr abner hatted and gloved and smiling came forth going out the man meant lady charlotte at your service for five minutes she complimented his acuteness in the remark you see ive only come to chat and entered his room he led her to her theme the excitement is pretty well over my brothers my chief carealways was im afraid hell be pitchforking at it again and we shall have another blast that letter ought never to have been printed that editor deserves the horsewhip for letting it appear if he prints a second one i shall treat him as a personal enemy better make a friend of him how meet him at my table she jumped an illumined halfabout on her chair so i will then what are the creatures tastes hunts does he the editor rose in her mind from the state of neuter to something of a man i recollect an article in that paper on the ormont duel i hate duelling but i side with my brother i had to laugh though luckily theres no woman on hand at present as far as i know ormonts not likely to be hooked by garrison women or blacks those coloured womensome of ours toosend the nose to the clouds not a bad sign for health and there are men like that old cardinal guicciardini tells of hum ormonts not one of them i hope hell stay in india till this blows over or i shall be hearing of provocations you have seen the duke she nodded her reserve was a summary of the interview kind as he always is she said ormont has no chance of employment unless theres a european war they cant overlook him in case of war hell have to pray for that let us hope we shant get it my wish but i have to think of my brother if hes in england with no employment hes in a mess with women and men both he kicks if hes laid aside to rust he has a big heart thats what i said all he wants is to serve his country if you wont have war give him gibraltar or malta or command of one of our military districts the southeastern ll be vacant soon hed like to be constable of the castle and have an eye on france i think hes fond of the french loves the french expects to have to fight them all the same he loves his country best heres the man everybodys abusing i demur my lady i was dining the other day with a client of mine and a youngster was present who spoke of lord ormont in a way i should like you to have heard he seemed to know the whole of lord ormonts career from the time of the ride to paraguay up to the capture of the plotting rajah he carried the table good boy we must turn to the boys for justice then name your day for this man this editor i will see him you shall have the day tonight lady charlotte and the editor met she was racy he anecdotal stag fox and hare ran before them over fields and through drawingrooms the scent was rich they found that they could talk to one another as they thought that he was not the islebound burgess nor she the postured english great lady and they exchanged salt without which your current scandal is of exhausted savour they enjoyed the peculiar novel relish of it coming from a social pressman and a dame of high society the different hemispheres became known as one sphere to these birds of broad wing convening in the upper blue above a quartered carcase earth a week later a letter the envelope of a bulky letter in lord ormonts handwriting reached lady charlotte there was a line from the editor would it please your ladyship to have this printed she read the letter and replied come to me for six days you shall have the best mount in the county an editor devoid of malice might probably have forborne to print a letter that appealed to lady charlotte or touched her sensations as if a glimpse of the moon on the homeward ride in winter on a nodding horse had suddenly bared to view a precipitous quarry within two steps there is no knowing few men can forbear to tell a spicy story of their friends and an editor to whom an exhibition of the immensely preposterous on the part of one writing arrogantly must be provocative would feel the interests of his journal not to speak of the claims of readers pluck at him when he meditated the consignment of such a precious composition to extinction lady charlotte withheld a sight of the letter from mr eglett she laid it in her desk understanding well that it was a laugh lost to the world poets could reasonably feign it to shake the desk inclosing it she had a strong sense of humour her mind reverted to the desk in a way to make her lips shut grimly she sided with her brother only pen in hand did he lay himself open to the enemy in his personal intercourse he was the last of men to be taken at a disadvantage lady charlotte was brought round to the distasteful idea of some help coming from a legitimate adjunct at his elbow a restraining womanwife it had to be said and to name the word wife for thomas rowsley earl of ormont put up the porcupine quills she bristled with at the survey of a sex thirsting and likely to continue thirsting for such honour what woman had she known fit to bear the name she had assumed the judicial seat upon the pretensions of several and dismissed them to their limbo after testifying against them who is to know the fit one in these mines of deception women of the class offering wives decline to be taken on trial they are boxes of puzzlesoften dire surprises her brother knew them well enough to shy at the box her brother rowsley had a funny pride like a boy at a game at the never having been caught by one among the many he made captive she let him have it all to himself he boasted it to a sister sharing the pride exultant in the cry of the hawk scornful of ambitions poultry a passed fingerpost to the plucked and really regretful that no woman had been created fit for him when she was not aiding with her brother women however contemptible for their weakness appeared to her as better than barndoor fowl or vermin in their multitudes gnawing to get at the cheesetrap she could be humane even sisterly with women whose conduct or prattle did not outrage plain sense just as the stickler for the privileges of her class was largeheartedly charitable to the classes flowing in oily orderliness round about below itif they did so flow unable to read womans character except upon the broadest lines as it were the spiders main threads of its web she read men minutely from the fact that they were neither mysteries nor terrors to her but creatures of importunate appetites humorous objects very manageable if we leave the road to their muscles dress their wounds smoothe their creases plume their vanity and she had an unerring eye for the man to be used when a blow was needed methods for setting him in action likewise she knew how much stronger than ordinary men the woman who can put them in motion they can be set to serve as pieces of cannon under compliments on their superior powers which were not all undervalued by her on their own merits for she worshipped strength but the said with a certain amount of truth that the women unaware of the advantage society gave them as to mastering men were fools tender is not a word coming near to lady charlotte thoughtful on behalf of the poor foolish victims of men she was she had saved some avenged others it should be stated that her notion of saving was the saving of them from the public she had thrown up a screen the saving of them from themselves was another matterhopeless to her thinking how preach at a creature on the bend of passions rapids one might as well read a chapter from the bible to delirious patients when once a woman is taken with the lovepassion we must treat her as bitten hide her antics from the public that is the principal business if she recovers she resumes her place and horrid old nature who drove her to the frenzy is unlikely to bother or at least overthrow her again unless she is one of the detestable wantons past compassion or consideration in the case reviewed the woman has gone through fire and is none the worse for her experiences worth ten times what she was to an honest man if men could be got to see it some do of those men who do not lady charlotte spoke with the old familynurse humour which is familiar with the tricks and frailties of the infants and it is a knife to probe the male while seemingly it does the part of the napkinpities and pats they expect a return of much for the little that is next to nothing they are fall of expectations and of what else they are hard bargainers she thought this of men and she liked men by choice she had old nurses preference for the lustier male child the others are puling things easier to rear because they bend better and less esteemed though they give less trouble rouse less care but when it came to the duel between the man and the woman her sense of justice was moved to join her with the party of her unfairly handled sistersa strong party if it were not so cowardly she had to think mr eglett her husband accepted heraccepted the position into which he naturally fell beside her and the ideas she imposed on him for she never went counter to his principles these were the fixed principles of a very wealthy man who abhorred debt and was punctilious in veracity scrupulous in cleanliness of mind and body devoted to the honour of his country the interests of his class she respected the high landmark possessing such principles and she was therefore enabled to lead without the wish to rule as it had been between them at the beginning so it was now when they were grandparents running on three lines of progeny from two daughters and a son they were excellent friends few couples can say more the union was good english greythat of a prolonged november to which we are reconciled by occasions for the hunt and the gun she was nevertheless an impassioned woman the feeling for her brother helped to satisfy her hearts fires though as little with her brother as with her husband was she demonstrative lord ormont disrelished the caresses of relatives she for her part had so strong a sympathy on behalf of poor gentlemen reduced to submit to any but a young womans hug that when bronzed from india he quitted the carriage and mounted her steps at olmer the desire to fling herself on his neck and breast took form in the words here you are home again rowsley glad to have you they shook hands firmly he remained three days at olmer his temper was mild his frame of mind bad as could be angry evaporations had left a residuum of solid scorn for these english who rewarded soldierly services as though it were a question of damaged packages of calico he threatened to take the first offer of a foreign state not in insurrection but clear sky was overhead he was the rowsley of the old boyish delight in field sports reminiscences of prowlings and trappings in the woods gropings along waterbanks enjoyment of racy gossip he spoke wrathfully of one of their newspapers which steadily persisted in withholding from publication every letter he wrote to it after printing the first and if it printed one why not the others lady charlotte put it on the quaintness of editors he had found in london perhaps reason for saying that he should do well to be out of this country as early as he could adding presently that he meant to go though it broke his heart to keep away from a six months rest at steignton his wiltshire estate no woman was in the field lady charlotte could have submitted to the intrusion of one of those at times wholesome victims for the sake of the mollification the unhappy proud thing might bring to a hero smarting under injustice at the hands of chiefs and authorities he passed on to steignton returned to london and left england for spain as he wrote word saying he hoped to settle at steignton neat year he was absent the next year and longer lady charlotte had the surprising news that steignton was let shooting and all for five years and he had no appointment out of england or at home when he came to olmer again he was under one of his fits of reserve best undisturbed her sympathy with a great soldier snubbed an active man rusting kept her from remonstrance three years later she was made meditative by the discovery of a womans being absolutely in the field mistress of the field and having been there for a considerable period dating from about the time when he turned his back on england to visit a comradeinarms condemned by the doctors to pass the winter in malaga and it was a young woman a girl in her teens a handsome girl handsome was to be expected ormont bargained for beauty but report said the girl was very handsome and showed breeding she seemed a foreigner walked like a goddess sat her horse the perfect amazon rumour called her a spaniard not if she rides lady charlotte cut that short rumour had subsequently more to say the reporter in her ear did not confirm it and she was resolutely deaf to a story incredible of her brotherthe man of all men living proudest of his name blood station so proud was he by nature too that he disdained to complain of rank injustice he maintained a cheerful front against adversity and obloquy and this man of complete selfcommand who has every form of noble pride gets cajoled like a twentyyearold yahoo at college do you imagine it to suppose of a man cherishing the name of ormont that he would bestow it legally on a woman a stranger and imperil his race by mixing blood with a creature of unknown lineage waswhy of course it was to suppose him struck mad and there never had been madness among the ormonts they were too careful of the purity of the strain lady charlotte talked she was excited and ran her sentences to blanks a cunning way for ministering consolation to her hearing where the sentence intended a question and the blank ending caught up the query tone and carried it dwindling away to the most distant of throttled interrogatives she had in this manner only to askher hearing received the comforting answer it desired for she could take that thin far sound as a travelling laughter of incredulity triumphant derision this meant to herthough she scarcely knew it though the most wilful of women declined to know ita state of alarm she had said of her brother in past days that he would have his time of danger after striking sixty the dangerous person was to be young but then ormont had high principles with regard to the dues to his family his principles could always be trusted the dangerous young person would have to be a person of lineage of a certain station at least no need for a titled woman only for warranted good blood is that to be found certificated out of the rolls of society it may just possibly be found without certificate however in those muddled caverns where the excluded intermingle here and there in a peasant family or a small country tradesmans just raised above a peasant honest regenerating blood will be found nobles wanting refreshment from the soil might do worse than try a slip of one of those juicy weeds illfated sickly royalties would be setup striding through another halfcentury with such invigoration if it could be done for them there are tales the tales are honourably discredited by the crazy constitutions of the heirs to the diadem yes but we are speculating on the matter seriously as though it were one of intimate concern to the family what is there to make us think that ormont would marry impossible to imagine him intimidated unlikely that he a practised reader of women having so little of the woman in him would be melted by a wily girl as women in the twilight situation have often played the trick to come into the bright beams how they do a desperate thing and call it generosity and then they appeal from it to my lords generosity and so the two generosities drive off in a close carriage with a friend and a professional landlady for the blessing of the parson and are legitimately united women have won round fools to give way in that way and quite right too thought lady charlotte siding with nature and justice as she reflected that no woman created would win round her brother to give way in that way he was too acute the moment the woman showed sign of becoming an actress her doom was written poor idiot was not uncharitably inscribed by the sisterly lady on the tombstone of hopes aimed with scarce pardonable ambition at her brother she blew away the rumour ormont she vowed had not entitled any woman to share and bear his title and this was her interpretation of the report he permitted if he did permit the woman to take his name that he might have a scornful fling at the world maltreating him besides the name was not published it was not to be seen in the papers it passed merely among male friends tradesmen servants no great harm in that listen further here is an unknown girl why should he marry her a girl consenting to the place beside a man of his handsome ripe age is either bought or she is madly enamoured she does not dictate terms ormont is not of the brute buyers in that market one sees it is the girl who leads the dance a girl is rarely so madly enamoured as when she falls in love with her grandfather she pitches herself at his head this had not happened for the first time in ormonts case and he had never proposed marriage why should he do it now but again if the girl has breeding to some extent he might think it her due that she should pass under the safeguard of his name out of sight then so far the report is trustworthy we blow the rumour out of belief a young woman there is she is not a wife lady charlotte allowed her the fairly respectable post of hecate of the shades as long as the girl was no pretender to the place and name in the upper sphere her deductions were plausible convincing to friends shaken by her vehement manner of coming at them she convinced herself by means of her multitude of reasons for not pursuing inquiry her brother said nothing there was no need for him to speak he seemed on one or two occasions in the act of getting himself together for the communication of a secret and she made ready to listen hard with ears eyebrows shut month and a gleam at the back of her eyes for a signification of something she would refer him to after he had spoken he looked at her and held his peace or virtually held itthat is he said not one word on the subject she was to have told him she had anticipated lady charlotte ascribed it to his recollection of the quick blusher the pained blusher she was in her girlhood at mention or print of the story of men and women who not having known her could conceive it but who could conceive that behind the positive plaindealing downright woman of the world there was at times when a nerve was touched or an old blocked path of imagination thrown open a sensitive youthfulness still quick to blush as far as the skin of a grandmother matron might show it chapter iii the tutor there was no counting now on lord ormonts presence in the british gathering seasons when wheatears wing across our fields or swallows return to their eaves he forsook the hunt to roam the continent one of the vulgar band of tourists honouring town only when mayflies had flown and londons indiscriminate people went about without their volatile heads lady charlotte put these changed conditions upon the behaviour of the military authorities to her brother saying that the wonder was he did not shake the dust of his country from his feet in her wise head she rejoiced to think he was not the donkey she sketched for admiration and she was partly consoled or played at the taking of a comfort needed in her perpetual struggle with a phantom of a fact by the reflection that a young woman on his arm would tense him to feel himself more at home abroad her minds habit of living warmly beside him in separation was vexed by the fixed intrusion of a female third person who checked the run of intimate chatter especially damped the fancied talk over early daysof which the creature was ignorant and her propinquity to him arrested or broke the dialogue lady charlotte invented and pressed to renew but a wife while letting him be seen would have insisted on appropriating the thought of himall his days past as well as present an impassioned sisters jealousy preferred that it should not be a wife reigning to dispute her share of her brother in imagination then came a rumour telling of him as engaged upon the composition of his memoirs lady charlottes impulsive outcry writing them signified her grounds for alarm happily memoirs are not among the silly deeds done in a moment they were somewhere ahead and over the hills a band of brigands rather than a homely shining mansion it was true but distant and a principal question shrieked to know whether he was composing them for publication she could look forward with a girls pleasure to the perusal of them in manuscript in a woody nook in a fervour of partizanship easily avoiding sight of errors grammatical or moral she chafed at the possible printing and publishing of them that would be equivalent to an exhibition of him cleanstripped for a run across londonbrilliant in himself spotty in the offence published memoirs indicate the end of a mans activity and that he acknowledges the end and at a period of lord ormonts life when the denial of it should thunder they are his final chapter making mummy of the grand figure they wrap in the printed stuff they are virtually his apology can those knowing lord ormont hear him apologize but it is a craven apology if we stoop to expound we are seen as pleading our case before the public call it by any name you please and under any attitude it is that and set aside the writing it may be perfect the act is the degradation it is a rousing of swarms his friends and the public will see the proudest nobleman of his day pleading his case in mangled english in the headlong of an outpoured undrilled rabble vocabulary doubling the ridicule by his imperturbability over the ridicule he excites he who is no more ridiculous cried the partizan sister conjuring up the scene not an ace more ridiculous than a judge of assize calling himself miserable sinner on sunday before the parson after he has very properly condemned half a score of weekday miserable sinners to penal servitude or the rope nobody laughs at the judge everybody will be laughing at the scornful man down halfway to his kneecape with a stutter of an apology for having done his duty to his country after stigmatizing numbers for inability or illwill to do it but ormonts weapon is the sword not a pen lady charlotte hunted her simile till the dogs had it or it ran to earth she struck at the conclusion that the young woman had been persuading him an adoring young woman is the person to imagine and induce to the commission of such folly what do you think you have seen her you say she asked of a man she welcomed for his flavour of the worldlings fine bile lord adderwood made answer she may be having a hand in it she worships and that is your way of pulling gods to the ground does she understand good english speaks it can she write i have never had a letter from her you tell me morsfield admires the womanwould marry her tomorrow if he could get her he would go through the ceremony ormont has performed i do not doubt i dont doubt all of you are ready she doesnt encourage one on the contrary all shes clever this has been going on for now seven years and as far as i know she has my brother fast she may have done the clever trick of having him fast from the beginning shed like people to think it she has an aunt to advertise it ormont cant swallow the woman im told trying if one is bound to get her down boasts of the connection everywhere shes admitted randeller says randeller procures the admission to various particoloured places she must be a blinking mollowl and i ask any sane christian or paganproof enoughwould my brother rowsley let his wife visit those places those people monstrous to have the suspicion that he would you know him mrs lawrence finchley for example i say nothing to hurt the poor woman i back her against her imbecile of a husband he brings a charge he cant support she punishes him by taking three years lease of independence and kicks up the grass all over the paddock and then comes cuckoo barking his name abroad to have her home again you can win the shyest filly to corn at last she goes and he digests ruefully the hotchpotch of a dish the woman brings him only the world spies a sidehead at her husbanded or not though the main fault was his and she had a right to insist that he should be sure of his charge before he smacked her in the face with it before the world in dealing with a woman a man commonly prudentput aside chivalry justice and the restshould bind himself to disbelieve what he cant prove otherwise let him expect his whipping with or without ornament my opinion is lawrence finchley had no solid foundation for his charge except his being an imbecile she wasnt one of the adventurous women to jump the barsthe gate had to be pushed open and he did it there she is and i ask you would my brother rowsley let his wife be intimate with her and there are others and sauf votre respect the menmorsfield for one randeller another they have a wholesome dread of the lion if they smell a chance with the lions boneits the sweeter for being the lions these metaphors carry us off our ground i must let these ormont memoirs run and upset him if they get to print ive only to oppose printed theyll be the same if i say a word of this woman he marries her tomorrow morning you speak of my driving men why cant i drive ormont because im too fond of him there you have the secret of the subjection of women they can hold their own and a bit more when theyve no enemy beating inside heartsah well its possible i dont say no ive not discovered them lord adderwood observed they are rarely discovered in the haunts he frequented her allusion to mrs lawrence finchley rapped him smartly and she admired his impassiveness under the stroke such a spectacle was one of her pleasures lady charlotte mentioned incidentally her want of a tutor for her grandson leo during the winter holidays he suggested an application to the clergyman of her parish she was at feud with the rev stephen hamptonevey and would not take she said a man to be a bootblack in her backyard or a woman a scullerywench in her kitchen upon his recommendation she described the person of mr hamptonevey his manner of speech general opinions professional doctrines rolled him into a ball and bowled him with a shrug for lamentation over the decay of the good old order of manly english protestant clergymen who drank their port bothered nobody about belief abstained from preaching their sermon if requested were capital fellows in the huntingfield too for if they came they had the spur to hunt in the devils despite now we are going to have a kind of bitter clawed forked female in vestments over breeches how do you like that bundling of the sexes lord adderwood liked the lines of division to be strictly and invitingly definite he was thinking as he reviewed the frittered appearance of the rev stephen hamptonevey in lady charlottes hinds of the possibility that lord ormont who was reputed to fear nobody feared her in which case the handsome young woman passing among his associates as the pseudo lady ormont might be the real one after all and isabella lawrence finchley prove right in the warning she gave to dogs of chase the tutor required by lady charlotte was found for her by mr abner their correspondence on the subject filled the space of a week and then the gentleman hired to drive a creaky wheel came down from london to olmer arriving late in the evening lady charlottes blunt oh when he entered her room and bowed upon the announcement of his name was caused by an instantaneous perception and refection that it would be prudent to keep her granddaughter philippa aged between seventeen and eighteen out of his way you are friend of mr abners are you he was not disconcerted he replied in an assured and pleasant voice i have hardly the pretension to be called a friend madam are you a jew her abruptness knocked something like a laugh almost out of him but he restrained the signs of it i am not you wouldnt be ashamed to tell me you were one if you were not at all you like the jews those i know i like not many christians have the good sense and the good heart of arthur abner now go and eat come back to me when youve done i hope you are hungry ask the butler for the wine you prefer she had not anticipated the enrolment in her household of a man so young and goodlooking these were qualifications for cupids business which his unstrained selfpossession accentuated to a note of danger to her chicks because she liked the taste of him her granddaughter philippa was in the girls waxen age another beatrice was coming to it both were under her care and she was a vigilant woman with an intuition and a knowledge of sex she did not blame arthur abner for sending her a goodlooking young man she had only a general idea that tutors in a house and even visiting tutors should smell of dust and wear a snuffy appearance the conditions will not always insure the tutors from foolishness as her girls experience reminded her but they protect the girl your name is weyburn your father was an officer in the army killed on the battlefield arthur abner tells me was her somewhat severelytoned greeting to the young tutor on his presenting himself the second time it had the sound of the preliminary of an indictment read in a court of law my father died of his wounds in hospital he said why did you not enter the service want of an income my lady bad lookout army or navy for gentlemen if they stick to the school of honour the sedentary professions corrupt men bad for the blood those monastery monks found that out they had to birch the devil out of them three times a day and half the night howling like fullmoon dogs all through their lives till the flesh was off them that was their exercise if they were for holiness my brother lord ormont has never been still in his youth or his manhood see him now he counts his years by scores and he has about as many wrinkles as you when youre smiling his cheeks are as red as yours now youre blushing you ought to have left off that trick by this time its well enough in a boy against her will she was drawn to the young man and her consciousness of it plucked her back to caution with occasional jerksquaint alternations of the familiar and the harshly formal in the strangers experience if i have your permission lady charlotte said he the reason why i mount red a littleif i do itis you mention lord ormont and i have followed his career since i was the youngest of boys good to begin with the worship of a hero he cant sham cant deceivenot even a woman and youre old enough to understand the temptation theyre so silly all the more its a point of honour with a man of honour to shield her from herself when its a girl the young mans eyebrows bent chapters of stories if you want to hear them she resumed and i can vouch some of them true lord ormont was never one of the wolves in a hood whatever you hear of him you may be sure he laid no trap hes just the opposite to the hypocrite so hypocrites date him ive heard them called highpriests of decency then we choose to be indecent and honest if theres a god to worship fear theyre in the habit of sayingwe are to fear god a man here a rev hamptonevey youll hear him harp on fear god hypocrites may honest sinners have no fear and see the cause they dont deceive themselvesthat is why do you think we call love what we fear they love god or they disbelieve and if they believe in him they know they cant conceal anything from him honesty means piety we cant be one without the other and here are peopleparsonswho talk of dying as going into the presence of our maker as if he had been all the while outside the world he created those parsons i told the rev hamptonevey here make infidelsthey make a puzzle of their god im for a rational deity they preach up a supernatural eccentric i dont say all ive heard good sermons and met soundheaded clergymennot like that gaping hamptonevey when a woman tells him she thinks for herself we have him sitting on our pariah a freethinker startles him as a kind of demon but a female freethinker is one of satans concubines he took it upon himself to reproach meflung his glove at my feet because i sent a cheque to a poor man punished for blasphemy the man had the right to his opinions and he had the courage of his opinions i doubt whether the rev hamptonevey would go with a willing heart to prison for his all the better for him if he comes headup out of a trial but now see all these parsons and judges and mobcaps insist upon conformity a man with common manly courage comes before them and hes cast in penalties yet we know from history in england france germany that the time of nonconformity brought out the manhood of the nation now i say a nation to be a nation must have meni mean brave men thats what those hosts of female men combine to try to stifle they wont succeed but we shall want a war to teach the country the value of courage you catch what i am driving at they accuse my brother of immorality because he makes no pretence to be better than the men of his class weyburns eyelids fluttered her kitelike ascent into the general with the sudden drop on her choice morsel switched his humour at the moment when he was respectfully considering that her dartings and gyrations had motive as mach as the flight of the swallow for food they had meaning and here was one of the great ladies of the land who thought for herself and was thoughtful for the country if she came down like a bird winged it was her love of her brother that did it his look at lady charlotte glistened she raised her defences against the basilisk fascinating philippa and with a vow to keep them apart and deprive him of his chance she relapsed upon the stiff frigidity which was not natural to her it lasted long enough to put him on his guard under the seductions of a noble dames condescension to a familiar tone but as he was too well bred to show the change in his mind for her change of manner and as she was the sister of his boyhoods hero and could be full of flavour his eyes retained something of their sparkle they were ready to lighten again in the way peculiar to him when she quite forgetting her defence of philippa disburdened herself of her antagonisms and enthusiasms her hates and her loves all round the neighbourhood and over the world won to confidential communication by this young mans face she confessed as much had he been guided to perceive it she said arthur abners a reader of men i can trust his word about them presently it is true she added no mans to be relied upon where theres a woman she refused her implicit trust to saintsif ever a man really was a saint before he was canonized her penetrative instinct of sex kindled the scepticism sex she saw at play everywhere dogging the conduct of affairs directing them at times she saw it as the animation of nature senselessly stigmatized hypocritically concealed active in our thoughts where not in our deeds and the declining of the decorous to see it or admit the sight got them abhorred bad names from her after a touch at the deadly poison coming of that blindness or blindfoldedness and a grimly melancholy shrug over the cruelties resultingcruelties chiefly affecting women youre too young to have thought upon such matters she said for a finish to them that was hardly true i have thought said weyburn and his head fell to reckoning of the small sum of his thoughts upon them he was pulled up instantly for close inspection by the judge what is your age i am in my twentysixth year you have been among men have you studied women not largely lady charlotte opportunity has been wanting at french and german colleges its only a large and a close and a pretty long study of them that can teach you anything and you must get rid of the poetry about them and be sure you havent lost it altogether thats what is called the golden mean im not for the golden mean in every instance its a way of exhorting to brutal selfishness i grant its the right way in those questions youll learn in time her scanning gaze at the young mans face drove him along an avenue of his very possible chances of learning certain to but dont tell me that at your age you have thought about women you may say you have felt a young mans feelings about women are better reading for him six or a dozen chapters farther on then he can sift and strain it wont be perfectly clear but it will do mr eglett hereupon threw the door open and ushered in master leo lady charlotte noticed that the tutor shook the boys hand offhandedly with not a whit of the usual obtrusive geniality and merely dropped him a word soon after he was talking to mr eglett of games at home and games abroad poor fun over there we head the world in field games at all events he drew a picture of a foreigner of his acquaintance looking on at football on the other hand french boys and german having passed a year or two at an english school get the liking for our games and do a lot of good when they go home the things we learn from them are to dance to sing and to studythey are more in earnest than we about study they teach us at fencing too the tutor praised fencing as an exercise and an accomplishment he had large reserves of eulogy for boxing he knew the qualities of the famous bruisers of the time cited fisty names whose owners were then to be seen all over an admiring land in prints in the glorious defensiveoffensive attitude englands owntouch me if you dare with bullish or bulldog or oakbole fronts for the blow handsome to pugilistic eyes the young tutor had lighted on a pet theme of mr eglettsthe excelling virtues of the practice of pugilism in old england and the school of honour that it is to our lower population fifty times better for them than cockfighting he exclaimed admitting that he could be an interested spectator at a ring or the pit cockfighting or ratting ratting seems to have more excuse the tutor said and made no sign of a liking for either of those popular pastimes as he disapproved without squeamishness the impulsive but sharply critical woman close by nodded and she gave him his dues for being no courtier leo had to be off to bed the tutor spared him any struggle over the shaking of hands and saying goodnight leo continued the conversation the boy went away visibly relieved of the cramp that seizes on a youngster at the formalities pertaining to these chilly and fateful introductions what do you think of the look of him mr eglett asked the tutor had not appeared to inspect the boy big head he remarked yes leo wont want pushing at books when hes once in harness he will have six weeks of me its more than the yeomanry get for drill per annum and theyre expected to know something of a soldiers duties theres a chance of putting him on the right road in certain matters well walk or ride or skate if the frost holds tomorrow no lessons the first day do as you think fit said lady charlotte the one defect she saw in the tutor did not concern his pupil and a girl if hit would be unable to see that this tutor judged as a man was to some extent despicable for accepting tutorships and one might say dishonouring the family of a soldier of rank and distinction by coming into houses at the back way with footing enough to air his graces when once established there he ought to have knocked at every door in the kingdom for help rather than accept tutorships and disturb households or providentlyminded mistresses of them with all sorts of probably groundless apprehensions founded naturally enough on the good looks he intrudes this tutor committed the offence next day of showing he had a firm and easy seat in the saddle which increased lady charlottes liking for him and irritated her watchful forecasts she rode with the young man after lunch to show him the country and gave him a taste of what he took for her variable moods he misjudged her like a swimmer going through warm and cold springs of certain lake waters he thought her a capricious ladyship dangerous for intimacy alluring to the deeps and gripping with cramps she pushed him to defend his choice of the tutors profession think you understand boys she caught up his words you cant you can humour them as you humour women theyre just as hard to read and dont tell me a young man can read women boys and women go on their instincts egyptologists can spell you hieroglyphs theyd be stumped as leo would say to read a spider out of an inkpot over a sheet of paper one gets to interpret by degrees by observing their habits the tutor said and vexed her with a towering complacency under provocation that went some way further to melt the woman she was while her knowledge of the softness warned her still more of the duty of playing dragon round such a young man in her house the despot is alert at every issue to every chance and she was one the wakefuller for being benevolent her mind had no sleep by day for a month she subjected mr matthew weyburn to the microscope of her observation and the probe of her instinct he proved that he could manage without cajoling a boy the practical fact established by agreement between herself and the unobservant gentleman who was her husband lady charlotte allowed her meditations to drop an indifferent glance at the speculative views upon education entertained by this young tutor to her mind they were flighty but she liked him and as her feelings dictated to her mind when she had not to think for others she spoke of his views toleratingly almost with an implied approval after passing them through the form of burlesque to which she customarily treated things failing to waft her enthusiasm in regard to philippa he behaved well he bestowed more of his attention on beatrice nearer leos age in talk about games and storybooks and battles nothing that he did when the girls were present betrayed the strutting plumed cock bent to attract or the sickly reptile thirsty for a prize above him and meaning to have it like satan in eden still of course he could not help his being a handsome fellow having a vivid face and eyes transparent whether blue or green to flame of the brain exciting them and that becomes a picture in the dream of girlsa picture creating the dream often and philippa had asked her grandmother very ingenuously indeed with a most natural candour why they saw so little of leos hero simple female child however there was no harm done and lady charlotte liked him she liked few forthwith in the manner of her particular head a restless head she fell to work at combinations thushe is a nice young fellow well bred no cringing courtier accomplished good at classics fairish at mathematics a scholar in french german italian with a shrewd knowledge of the different races and with sound english sentiment too and the capacity for writing good english although in those views of his the ideas are unusual therefore unenglish profoundly so but his intentions are patriotic they would not displease lord ormont he has a worship of lord ormont all we can say on behalf of an untried inferior is in thatonly the valiant admire devotedly well he can write grammatical readable english what if lord ormont were to take him as a secretary while the memoirs are in hand he might help to chasten the sentences laughed at by those newspapers or he might being a terrible critic of writing and funny about styles put it in an absurd light that would cause the memoirs to be tossed into the fire he was made for the post of secretary the young mans good looks would be out of harms way then if any sprig of womankind come across him there it will at any rate not be a girl women must take care of themselves only the fools among them run to mischief in the case of a handsome young fellow supposing a certain woman to be one of the fools lady charlotte merely suggested it in the dashing current of her meditationsdid not strike it out interrogatively the woman would be a fine specimen among her class that was all for the favourite of lord ormont to stoop from her place beside himay but women do heroes have had the woeful experience of that fact first we see them aiming themselves at their hero next they are shooting an eye at the handsome man the thirst of nature comes after that of their fancy in conventional women sick of the hero tried tired of their place in the market no longer ashamed to acknowledge it they begin to consult their own taste for beautythey have it quite as much as the men have it and when their worshipped figure of manliness in a romantic sombrero is a threadbare giant showing bruises they sink on their inherent desire for a dance with the handsome man and the really handsome man is the most extraordinary of the rarities no wonder that when he appears he slays them walks over them like a pestilence this young weyburn would touch the fancy of a woman of a romantic turn supposing her enthusiastic in her worship of the hero after a number of yearsfor anything may be imagined where a woman is concernedwhy another enthusiasm for the same object and on the part of a stranger a stranger with effective eyes rapidly leads to sympathy suppose the reversethe enthusiasm gone to dust or become a wheezy old bellows as it does where theres disparity of age or it frequently doesthen the sympathy with a goodlooking stranger comes more rapidly still these were lady charlottes glances right and leftidle flights of the eye of a mounted amazon across hedges at the canter along the main road of her scheme which was to do a service to the young man she liked and to the brother she loved for the marked advantage of both equally perhaps for the chance of a little gossip to follow about that tenacious woman by whom her brother was held hard and fast kept away from friends and relatives isolated insomuch as to have given up living on his estatethe old homebecause he would not disgrace it or incur odium by taking her there in consequence of lord ormonts resistance to pressure from her on two or three occasions she chose to nurse and be governed by the maxim for herself never propose a plan to him if you want it adopted that was her way of harmlessly solacing loves vindictiveness for an injury she sent arthur abner a letter thanking him for his recommendation of young mr weyburn stating her benevolent wishes as regarded the young man and those hateful memoirs requesting that her name should not be mentioned in the affair because she was anxious on all grounds to have the proposal accepted by her brother she could have vowed to herself that she wrote sincerely he must want a secretary he would be shy at an offer of one from me do you hint it if you get a chance you gave us mr weyburn and mr eglett and i like him ormont would too i am certain you have obliged him before this will be better than anything you have done for us it will stop the memoirs or else give them a polish your young friend has made me laugh over stuff taken for literature until we put on our spectacles leo jogs along in harness now and may do some work at school yet having posted her letter she left the issue to chance as we may when conscience is easy an answer came the day before weyburns departure arthur abner had met lord ormont in the street had spoken of the rumour of memoirs promised to the world hinted at the possible need for a secretary lord ormont would appoint a day to see mr weyburn lady charlotte considered that to be as good as the engagement so we keep you in the family she said and now look here you ought to know my brothers ways if youre going to serve him youll have to guess at half of everything he tells you hell expect you to know the whole theres no man so secret why he fears nothing i cant tell why and what his mouth shuts on he exposes as if in his hand of course hes proud and good reason youll see when you mustnt offend a ladys in the housei hear of it she takes his name they say she may be a respectable womanive heard no scandal we have to hear of a lady ormont out of society we have to suppose it means theres not to be a real one he cant marry if he has allowed her to go about bearing his name she has a fool of an aunt im told as often in the house as not good proof of his fondness for the woman if he swallows half a year of the aunt well you wont unless youve mere mans eyes be able to help seeing him trying to hide what he suffers from that aunt he bears it like the man he is but woe to another betraying it she has a tongue that goes like the reel of a rod with a pike bolting out of the shallows to the snag he knowsto wind round it and defy you to pull often my brother rowsley and i have fished the day long and in hard weather and brought home a basket and he boasted of it more than of anything he has ever done since that woman holds him away from me now i say no harm of her she may be right enough from her point of view or it maynt be owing to her i wouldnt blame a woman well but my point with you is you swallow the womans auntthe ladys auntwithout betraying you suffer at all lord ormont has eyes of an eagle for a speck above the surface all the more because the aunt is a gabbling idiot does hei say it seeing itfire up to defend her from the sneer of the lip or half a sign of it no you would be an your guard i can trust you of course youd behave like the gentleman you are where any kind of womans concerned but you mustnt let a shadow be seen think what you may the womanladycalling herself lady ormontpoor woman i should do the same in her placeshe has a hard game to play i have to be for my family she has manners im told holds herself properly she fancies she brings him up to the altar in the end by decent behaviour thats a delusion its creditable to her only she cant understand the claims of the family upon a man like my brother when you have spare timekickups he need to call it writing to me from schoolcome here youre welcome after three days notice i shall be glad to see you again youve gone some way to make a man of leo he liked her well he promised to come she was a sinewy bite of the gentle sex but she had much flavour and she gave nourishment let me have three days notice she repeated not less lady charlotte said he weyburn received intimation from arthur abner of the likely day lord ormont would appoint and he left olmer for london to hold himself in readiness lady charlotte and leo drove him to meet the coach philippa so strangely baffled in her natural curiosity begged for a seat she begged to be allowed to ride petitions were rejected she stood at the window seeing grandmamas tutor as she named him carried off by grandmama her nature was avenged on her tyrant grandmama it brought up almost to her tongue thoughts which would have remained subterranean under control of her habit of mind or the nurserys modesty if she had been less tyrannically treated they were subterranean thoughts natures original such as the sense of injustice will rouse in young women and they are better unstirred for they ripen girls overrapidly when they are made to revolve near the surface it flashed on the girl why she had been treated tyrannically grandmama has good taste in tutors was all that she said while the thoughts rolled over chapter iv recognition our applicant for the post of secretary entered the street of lord ormonts london house to present himself to his boyhoods hero by appointment he was to see perhaps to serve the great soldier things had come to this and he thought it singular but for the previous introduction to lady charlotte he would have thought it passing wonderful he ascribed it to the whirligig the young man was not yet of an age to gather knowledge of himself and of life from his present experience of the fact that passionate devotion to an object strikes a vein through circumstances as a travelling run of flame darts the seeming haphazard zigzags to catch at the dry of dead wood amid the damp and when passion has become quiescent in the admirer there is often the unsubsided first impulsion carrying it on he will almost sorely embrace his idol with one or other of the senses weyburn still read the world as it came to him by bite marvelling at this and that after the fashion of most of us he had not deserted his adolescents hero or fallen upon analysis of a past season but he was now a young man stoutly and cognizantly on the climb with a good aim overhead axed green youths enthusiasms a step below his heels one of the lovers of life beautiful to behold when we spy into them generally their aspect is an enlivenment whatever may be the carving of their features for the sake of holy unity this lover of life whose gaze was to the front in hungry animation held fast to his young dreams perceiving a soul of meaning in them though the fire might have gone out and he confessed to a past pursuit of delusions young men of this kind will have for the like reason a similar rational sentiment on behalf of our worlds historic forward march while admitting that history has to be taken from far backward if we would gain assurance of mans advance it nerves an admonished ambition he was ushered into a london houses library looking over a niggard enclosure of gravel and dull grass against a wall where ivy dribbled an armchair was beside the fireplace to right and left of it a floreate company of books in high cases paraded shoulder to shoulder without a gap grenadiers on the line weyburn read the titles on their scarletandblue facings they were approved english classics honoured veterans who have emerged from the conflict with contemporary opinion stamped excellent or have been pushed by the roar of contemporaneous applauses to wear the leatherandgilt uniform of our immortals until a more qualmish posterity disgorges them the books had costly bindings lord ormonts treatment of literature appeared to resemble lady charlottes in being reverential and uninquiring the books she bought to read were memoirs of her time by dead men and women once known to her these did fatigue duty in cloth or undress it was high drill with all of lord ormonts books and there was not a modern or a minor name among the regiments they smelt strongly of the booksellers lump lots by order but if a show soldiery they were not a sham like a certain row of venerablytitled backs that lady charlotte without scruple left standing to blow an ecclesiastical trumpet of empty contents any one might have his battle of brains with them for the twining of an absent key the door opened weyburn bowed to his old star in human shape a grey head on square shoulders filling the doorway he had seen at olmer lady charlottes treasured miniature portrait of her brother a perfect likeness she saidcomplaining the neat instant of injustice done to the fire of his look fire was low down behind the eyes at present they were quick to scan and take summary of their object as the young man felt while observing for himself height and build of body were such as might be expected in the brother of lady charlotte and from the tales of his prowess weyburn had a glance back at cupers boys listening to the tales the soldierlords manner was courteously militarythat of an established superior indifferent to the deferential attitude he must needs enact his curt nick of the head for a response to the visitors formal salutation signified the requisite acknowledgment like a city creditors busy stroke of the typestamp receipt upon payment the ceremony over he pitched a bugle voice to fit the contracted area i hear from mr abner that you have made acquaintance with olmer good hunting country there lady charlotte kindly gave me a mount my lord i knew your father by namecolonel sidney weyburn you lost him at toulouse we were in the peninsula i was at talavera with him bad day for our cavalry our officers were young at their work then they taught the emperors troops to respect a charge of english horse it was teaching their fox to set traps for them lord ormont indicated a chair he stood the french had good cavalry leaders weyburn said for cover to a continued study of the face montbrun yes murat lassalle bessieres under the emperor they had you think them not at home in the saddle my lord frenchmen have nerves horses are nerves they pile excitement too high when cool theyre among the best none of them had head for command of all the arms one might say the same of seidlitz and ziethen of ziethen seidlitz had a wider grasp i suppose he pursed his month pondering no and in the austrian service too generals of cavalry are left to whistle for an independent command theres a jealousy of our branch the injured warrior frowned and hummed he spoke his thought mildly jealousy of the name of soldier in this country out of the service is the place to recommend id have advised a son of mine to train for a jockey rather than enter it we deal with that tomorrow in my papers you come to me mr abner has arranged the terms so i see you at ten in the morning i am glad to meet a young manenglishmanwho takes an interest in the service weyburn fancied the hearing of a step he heard the whispering dress it passed him a lady went to the armchair she took her seat as she had moved with sedateness the exchange of a toneless word with my lord she was a brune he saw that when he rose to do homage lord ormont resumed some are born to it must be soldiers and in peace they are snubbed by the heads in war they are abused by the country they dont understand in england how to treat an army how to make one either the gentlemanmr weyburn mr arthur abners recommendation he added hurriedly with a light wave of his hand and a murmur that might be the ladys title continuing a young man of military tastes should take service abroad theyre in earnest about it over there here they play at it and an armys shipped to land without commissariat ambulances medical stores and march against the odds as usualif it can march albuera my lord our men can spurt for a flick o the whip theyre expected to be constantly ready for doing prodigiesto repair the countrys omissions all the country cares for is to hope dick turpin may get to york our men are good beasts they give the best in em and drop mores the scandal to a country that has grand material and overtasks it a blazing disaster ends the chapter this was talk of an injured veteran it did not deepen the hue of his ruddied skin he spoke in the tone of matter of fact weyburn had been prepared for something of the sort by his friend arthur abner he noted the speakers heightened likeness under excitement to lady charlotte excitement came at an early call of their voices to both and both had handsome open features bluntly cut nothing of aquiline or the supercilious eyes bluishgrey in arched recesses horny between the thick lids lively to shoot their meaning when the trapmouth was active effectively expressing promptitute for combat pleasure in attack wrestle tag whatever pertained to strife an absolute sense of their right as there was a third person present at this dissuasion of military topics the silence of the lady drew weyburn to consult her opinion in her look it was on him strange are the womans eyes which can unoffendingly assume the privilege to dwell on such a living object as a man without become gateways for his return look and can seem in pursuit of thoughts while they enfold they were large dark eyes eyes of southern night they sped no shot they rolled forth an envelopment a child among toys caught to think of other toys may gaze in that way but these were a womans eyes he gave lord ormont his whole face as an auditor should he was interested besides as he told a ruffled conscience he fell upon the study of his old hero determinedly the pain of a memory waking under pillows unable to do more than strain for breath distracted his attention there was a memory that was all he knew or else he would have lashed himself for hanging on the beautiful eyes of a woman to be seeing and hearing his old hero was wonder enough recollections of lady charlottes plain hints regarding the lady present resolved to the gross retort that her eyes were beautiful and he knew themthere lay the strangeness they were known beautiful eyes in a foreign land of night and mist lord ormont was discoursing with racy eloquence of our hold on india his views in which respect were those of cupers boys weyburn ventured a dotrunning description of the famous ride and out flew an english soldiers grievance but was not the unjustlytreated great soldier well rewarded whatever the snubs and the bitterness with these large dark eyes in his house for his own eyes like these are the beginning of a young mans world they nerve inspire arm him colour his life he would labour fight die for them it seemed to weyburn a blessedness even to behold them so it had been with him at the early stage and his heart went swifter memory fetched a breath memory quivered eyelids when the thought returnedof his having known eyes as lustrous first lights of his world they had more volume warmth mysterywere sweeter still these in the room were sisters to them they quickened throbs they seemed a throb of the heart made visible that was their endowment of light and lustre simply and the mystical curve of the lids for so they could look only because the heart was disengaged from them they were but heavenly orbs the ladys elbow was on an arm of her chair her forefinger at her left temple her mind was away one might guess she could hardly be interested in talk of soldiering and of foreign army systems jealous english authorities and officials games fieldsports she had personal matters to think of adieu until tomorrow to the homes she inhabited the street was a banishment and a relief when weyburns first interview with lord ormont was over he rejoiced to tell his previous anticipations that he had not been disappointed and he bade heroworshippers expect no gilded figure we gather heroes as we go if we are among the growing our constancy is shown in the not discarding of our old ones he held to his earlier hero though he had seen him and though he could fancy he saw round him another too had been a herolover how did that lady of nights eyes come to fall into her subjection he put no question as to the name she bore it hung in a black suspensevividly at its blackest illuminated her possessor a man is a hero to some effect who wins a woman like this and if his glory bespells her so that she flings all to the winds for him burns the world if for solely the desperate rapture of belonging to him she consents of her free will to be one of the nameless and discoloured he shines in a way to make the marrow of men thrill with a burning envy for that must be the idolatrous devotion desired by them all weyburn struck down upon his mans naturethe bad in us when beauty of woman is viewed or say the old original revolutionary best kept untouched for a touch or a meditative pause above him fetches him up to roam the civilized world devouringly and lawlessly it is the special peril of the young lover of life that an inflammability to beauty in women is in a breath intense with him he is in truth a thinlysealed volcano of our imperishable ancient father and has it in him to be the multitudinouslyamorous of the mythologic jove give him head he can be civilizations devil is she fair and under a shadethen is she doubly fair the shadow about her secretes mystery just as the forest breeds romance and mystery is a measureless realm if we conceive it we have a mysterious claim on her who is the heart of it he marched on that road to the music of sonorous brass for some drunken minutes the question came what of the man who takes advantage of her selfsacrifice it soon righted him and he did lord ormont justice and argued the case against lady charlottes naked hints this darkeyed heroines bearing was assured beyond an air of dependency her deliberate short nod to him at his leavetaking and the toneless few words she threw to my lord signified sufficiently that she did not stand defying the world or dreading it she had by miracle the eyes which had once charmed himcould againwould always charm she reminded him of aminta farrells very eyes under the couchantdove browssomething of her mouth the dimple running from a corner she had as aminta had the selfcollected and selfcancelled look a realm in a look that was neither depth nor fervour nor a bestowal nor an allurement nor was it an exposure though there seemed no reserve one would be near the meaning in declaring it to bewilder men with the riddle of openhandedness we read itall may read itas we read inexplicable plain life in which let us have a confiding mind despite the blows at our heart and some understanding will enter us he shut the door upon picture and speculations returning to them by another door the lady had not amintas freshness she might be taken for an elder sister of aminta but weyburn wanted to have her position defined before he set her beside aminta he writhed under lady charlottes tolerating scorn of the young woman it roused an uneasy sentiment of semihostility in the direction of my lord and he had no personal complaint to make lord ormont was cordial on the day of the secretarys installation as ifif one might dare to guess itsome one had helped him to a friendly judgement the lady of amintas eyes was absent at the luncheon table she came into the room a step to speak to lord ormont dressed for a drive to pay a visit the secretary was unnoticed lord ormont put inquiries to him at table for the why of his having avoided the profession of arms and apparently considered that the secretary had made a mistake and that he would have committed a greater error in becoming a soldierin this country a man with a grievance is illogical under his burden he mentioned the name lady ormont distinctly during some remarks on travel lady ormont preferred the continent two days later she came to the armchair as before met weyburns eyes when he raised them gave him no home in hersnot a temporary shelter from the pelting of interrogations she hardly spoke why did she come but how was it that he was drawn to think of her absent or present she was round him like the hills of a valley she was round his thoughtscaged them however high however far they flew they were conscious of her she took her place at the midday meal she had amintas voice in some tones a mellower than amintasthe voice of one of amintas family she had the trick of amintas upper lip in speaking her look on him was foreign a civil smile as they conversed she was very much at home with my lord whom she rallied for his addiction to his club at a particular hour of the afternoon she conversed readily she reminded him incidentally that her aunt would arrive early next day he informed her some time after of an engagement to tiffin with a brother officer and she nodded they drove away together while the secretary was at his labour of sorting the heap of autobiographical scraps in a worn dispatchbox pen and pencil jottings tossed to swell the mess when they had relieved an angry reminiscence he noticed heedlessly at the moment feminine handwriting on some few clear sheets among them next day he was alone in the library he sat before the box opened it and searched merely to quiet his annoyance for having left those sheets of the fair amanuensis unexamined they were not discoverable they had gone he stood up at the stir of the door it was she and she acknowledged his bow she took her steps to her chair he was informed that lord ormont had an engagement and he remarked i can do the work very well she sat quite silent he read first lines of the scraps laid them in various places as in a preparation for conjurers tricks at cards refraining from a glance lest he should disconcert the eyes he felt to be on him fitfully at last she spoke and he knew aminta in his hearing and sight is emile grenat still anglomane an instant before her voice was heard he had been persuading himself that the points of unlikeness between his young aminta and this tall and stately lady of the proud reserve in her bearing flouted the resemblance chapter v in which the shades of browny and matey advance and retire emile is as anglomane as ever and not a bit less a frenchman weyburn said in a tone of one who muffles a shock at the heart it would be the poorer compliment to us she rejoined they looked at one another she dropped her eyelids he looked away she had the grand manner by nature she was the woman of the girl once known a soldier is he emiles profession and mine are much alike or will be a secretary her deadness of accent was not designed to carry her opinion of the post of secretary it brought the reply we hope to be schoolmasters she drew in a breath there was a thin short voice hardly voice as when one of the unschooled minor feelings has been bruised after a while she said does he think it a career not brilliant he was formed for a soldier he had to go as the road led a young man renouncing ambition considering what we can do best it signifies the taste for what he does certainly that weyburn had senses to read the word schoolmaster in repetition behind her shut mouth he was sharply sensible of a fall the task with his papers occupied him if he had a wish it was to sink so low in her esteem as to be spurned a kick would have been a refreshment yet he was unashamed of the cause invoking it we are instruments to the touch of certain women and made to play strange tunes mr cuper flourishes the school exists i have not been down there i met mr shalders yesterday he has left the school you come up from olmer i was at olmer last week lady ormont an involuntary beam from her eyes thanked him for her title at that juncture of the dialogue she grew more spirited mr shalders has joined the dragoons has he the worthy man has a happy imagination he goes through a campaign daily it seems to one to dignify his calling i like his enthusiasm the lady withdrew into her thoughts weyburn fell upon his work mention of the military cloak of enthusiasm covering shalders brought the scarce credible old time to smite at his breast in the presence of these eyes a ringing of her title of lady ormont rendered the present time the incredible i can hardly understand a young frenchmans not entering the army she said the napoleonic legend is weaker now said he the son of an officer grandson it was his choice to behe gave it up without reluctance emile obeyed the command of his parents weyburn answered and he was obedient to the veiled direction of her remark in speaking of himself i had a reason too one wonders it would have impoverished my mothers income to put aside a small allowance for me for years she would not have hesitated i then set my mind on the profession of schoolmaster emile grenat was a brave boy has he no regrets neither of us has a regret he began ambitiously its the way at the beginning it is not usually abjured im afraid we neither of us dignify our calling by discontent with it a dusky flash worth seeing came on her cheeks i respect enthusiasms she said and it was as good to him to hear as the begging pardon though clearly she could not understand enthusiasm for the schoolmasters career light of evidence was before him that she had a friendly curiosity to know what things had led to their new meeting under these conditions he sketched them cursorily there was little to telllittle that is appealing to a romantic mind for interest aware of it by sympathy he degraded the narrative to a flatness about as cheering as a suburban london sundays promenade sympathy caused the perverseness he felt her disillusionment felt with it and spread a feast of it she had to hear of studies at caen and at a paris lycee french fairly mastered german the same italian the same after studies at heidelberg asti and florence between four and five months at athens he was needlessly precise in tutorship with a young nobleman no events nor a spot of colour thus did he wilfully with pain to himself put an extinguisher on the youth painted brilliant and eminent in a maidens imagination so there can no longer be thought of the army she remarked and the remark had a sort of sigh though her breathing was equable unless a big war knocks over all rules and the country comes praying us to serve he said you would not refuse then not in case of need one may imagine a crisis when they would give commissions to men of my age or older for the cavalryheavy losses of officers she spoke as if urged by a sting to revert to the distasteful that professionmust you not take enter into orders if you aim at any distinction and a member of the anglican church would not be allowed to exchange his frock for a cavalry sabre said he that is true i do not propose to settle as a schoolmaster in england where on the continent would not america be better it would not so well suit the purpose in view for us there are others besides besides emile there is a german and an italian and a swiss it is a company a company of schoolmasters companies of all kinds are forming colleges are companies and they have their collegians our aim is at pupils we have no ambition for any title higher than school and schoolmaster it is not a company so like nature parading her skeleton to youthful adorers of her face he insisted on reducing to hideous material wreck the fair illusion which had once arrayed him in alluring promise she explained i said america you would be among protestants in america catholics and protestants are both welcome to us according to our scheme and germans french english americans italians if they will come spaniards and portuguese and scandinavians russians as well and jews mahommedans too if only they will come the more mixed the more it hits our object you have not stated where on the continent it is to be the spot fixed on is in switzerland you will have scenery i hold to that as an influence a cool vision of the bernese alps encircled the young schoolmaster and she said it would influence girls i dare say a harder matter with boys of courseat first we think we may make it serve and where is the spot is that fixed on fifteen miles from berne on elevated land neighbouring a water not quite to be called a lake unless in an auctioneers advertisement i am glad of the lake i could not look on a country home where there was no swimming you will be head of the school there must be a head is the school likely to be established soon he fell into her dead tone money is required for establishments i have a reversion coming some day i dont dabble in post obits he waited for farther questions they were at an end you have your work to do mr weyburn saying that she bowed an implied apology for having kept him from it and rose she bowed again as she passed through the doorway in acknowledgment of his politeness here then was the end of the story of browny and matey such was his thought under the truncheonstroke of their colloquy lines of brownys letters were fiery waving ribands about him while the coldly gracious bow of the lady wrote finis the gulf between the two writings remained unsounded it gave a heave to the old passion but stirred no new one he had himself in hand now and he shut himself up when the questions bred of amazement buzzed and threatened to storm after all what is not curious in this world the curious thing would be if curious things should fail to happen men have been saying it since they began to count and turn corners and let us hold off from speculating when there is or but seems a shadow of unholiness over that molelike business there shall be no questions and as to feelings the same they if petted for a moment beneath the shadow corrupt our blood weyburn was a man to have them by the throat at the birth still they thronged heavy work of strangling had to be done her tone of disappointment with the schoolmaster bit him and it flattered him the feelings leapt alive equally venomous from the wound and the caress they pushed to see had to be repelled from seeing the girl browny in the splendid woman they had lightning memories not the pain of his grip could check their voice on the theme touching her happiness or the reverse and this was an infernal cunning he paused perforce to inquire giving them space for the breeding of their multitudes was she happy did she not seem too meditative enclosed toneless at her age vainly the persecuted fellow said to himself but what is it to me nowthe browny days were over the passion for the younger aminta was overburied and a dream of power belonging to those days was not yet more than visionary it had moved her once when it was a young soldiers she treated the schoolmasters dream as vapour and the old days as dead and ghostless she did rightly how could they or she or he be other than they were with that sage exclamation he headed into the browny days and breasted them and he had about him the living foamy sparkle of the very time until the countess of ormont breathed the word schoolmaster when at once it was dusty land where buoyant waters had been and the armies of the facts in uniform drab with some feathers and laces and a significant surpliced figure decorously covering the wildest of cupids marched the standard of the winking goldpiece which is their nourishing sun and eclipser of all suns that foster dreams as you perceive he was drawing swiftly to the vortex of the fools and round and round he went lucky to float his view of the business of the schoolmaster plucked him from the whirl she despised it he upheld it he stuck to his view finding their antagonism on the subject wholesome for him all that she succeeded in doing was to rob it of the aurora colour clothing everything on which matey weyburn set his aim her contempt of it whether as a profession in itself or as one suitable to the former young enthusiast for arms dwarfed it to appear like the starved plants under greenland skies but those are of a sturdy genus they mean to live they live perforce of the right to live they will prove their right in a coming season when some one steps near and wonders at them and from more closely observing gets to understand learning that the significance and the charm of earth will be as well shown by them as by her tropical fair flaunters or the tenderlynurtured exotics an unopened coffer of things to be said in defence ofno on behalf ofno in honour of the profession of schoolmaster perhaps to the convincing of aminta lady ormont was glanced at a sentence or two leapt out and stepped forward and had to retire he preferred to the fathering of tricky windy phrases the being undervaluedeven by her he was taught to see again how rhetoric haunts and rhetoric bedevils the vindication of the clouded especially in the case of a disesteemed profession requiring one to raise it and impose it upon the antagonistic senses for the bewildering of the mind one has to sound it loudly there is no treating it as in the advocacy of the cases of flesh and blood with the masterly pathos of designed simplicity and weyburn was cupers matey weyburn still in his loathing of artifice to raise emotion loathing of the affected the stilted the trumpet of speechalways excepting schoolexercises in the tongues the unmasking of a catiline the address of a general athenian or other to troops he kept his coffer shut and for a consequence he saw the contents as an avenue of blossom leading to vistas of infinite harvest she was lady ormont aminta shared the title of his old hero he refused to speculate upon how it had come to pass and let the curtain hang though dramas and romances with the miracles involved in them were agitated by a transient glimpse at the curtain well and he hoped to be a member of the profession she despised hoped it with all his heart and one good effect of his giving his heart to the hope was that he could hold from speculating and from feeling even from pausing to wonder at the most wonderful turn of events blessed antagonism drove him to be braced by thoughts upon the hardest of the schoolmasters tasksbright winter thoughts prescribing to him satisfaction with a faith in the sowing which may be his only reaping away fly the boys in sheaves after his toil with them to instruct restrain animate point their minds they leave him they plunge into the world and are gone will he see them again it is a flickering perhaps to sustain his belief that he has done serviceable work he must be sore of his having charged them with good matter how can the man do it if during his term of apprenticeship he has allowed himself to dally here and there down to moony dreamings over inscrutable beautiful eyes of a married lady for the sole reason that he meets her unexpectedly after an exchange of letters with her in longpast days at school when she was an inexperienced girl who knew not what she vowed and he a flightyheaded youngster crying out to be the arrow of any bow that was handy yea she was once that girl named browny by the boys temptation threw warm light on the memory and very artfully by conjuring up the faces cries characters all the fun of the boys there was no possibility of forgetting her image in those days he had therefore to live with it and to live near the grown womantimes present answer to the old riddle it seemed to him that instead of sorting lord ormonts papers he ought to be at sharp exercise according to his prescript sharp exercise of lungs and limbs is a mans moral aid against temptation he knew it as the one trusty antidote for him who was otherwise the vessel of a temperament pushing to mutiny certainly it is the best philosophy youth can pretend to practise and lord ormont kept him from it worse than that the slips and sheets of paper in the dispatchbox were not an exercise of the mind even there was nothing to grapple withno diversion criticism passed by them indulgently if not benevolently quite apart from the subject inscribed on them weyburn had now and again a blow at the breast of untraceable origin for he was well enough aware that the old days when browny imagined him a hero in drinking his praises of a brighter were drowned they were dead but here was she the bride of the proved hero his praises might have helped in causing her willingnessdevotional readiness he could fancyto yield her hand perhaps at the moment when the hero was penning some of the indian slips here the boy at school was preparing aminta but he could not be responsible for a sacrifice of the kind suggested by lady charlotte and no there had been no such sacrifice although lord ormonts inexplicable treatment of his young countess under cover of his notorious reputation with women conduced to the suspicion while the vagrant in weyburn was thus engaged his criticism of the soldierlords fieldenglish on paper let the stuff go tolerantly unexamined but with a degree of literary contempt at heart for the writer who had that womanscented reputation and expressed himself so poorly the sentiment was outside of reason we do nevertheless expect our don juans to deliver their minds a trifle elegantly if not in classic english on paper and when we find one of them inflicting cruelty as it appears and the victim is a young woman a beautiful young woman she pleads to us poetically against the bearish sentences of his composition we acknowledge however that a mere sentiment entertained possibly by us alone should not be permitted to condemn him unheard lady ormont was not seen again after luncheon at a solitary table the secretary worked till winters lamps were lit and then shone freedom with assurance to him that he would escape from the miry mental ditch he had been floundering in since aminta revealed herself sunday was the glorious day to follow with a cleansing bath of a walk along the southern hills homely english scenery to show to a german friend one of his company half a dozen good lads were pledged to the walk bearing which in view it could be felt that this nonsensical puzzlement over his relations to the moods and tenses of a married woman would be bounced out of recollection before nightfall the landscape given off any of the airy hills of surrey would suffice to do it a lady stood among her boxes below as he descended the stairs to cross the hall he knew her for the person lady charlotte called the womans aunt whom lord ormont could not endurea forgiven old enemy mrs nargett pagnell he saluted she stared and corrected her incivility with ah yes and a formal smile if not accidentally delayed on her journey she had been needlessly the cause why lord ormont hugged his club during the morning and afternoon weyburn was pushed to think of the matter by remembrance of his foregone resentment at her having withdrawn aminta from miss vincents three days earlier than the holiday time the resentment was over but a germ of it must have sprang from the dust to prompt the kindling leap his memory took out of all due connection like a lightning among the crags it struck aminta smartly he called to mind the conversation at table yesterday had she played on lord ormonts dislike of the aunt to drive him forth for some purpose of her own if so the little trick had been done with deplorable spontaneity or adeptness of usage what was the purposeto converse with an old acquaintance undisturbed by lord ormont and her aunt neatly done supposing the surmise correct but what was there in the purpose he sifted rapidly for the gist of the conversation reviewed the manner of it the words the sound they had the feelings they touched then owned that the question could not be answered owning further that the recurrence of these idiotic speculations feelings questions wrote him down as both dull fellow and impertinent he was unabled to restore aminta to the queenly place she took above the schoolmaster who was very soon laughing at his fever or flash of the afternoon the day had brought a great surprise nothing more twenty minutes of fencing in the a salle darmes of an italian captain braced him to health and shifted scenes of other loves lighter loves following the browny daysnot to be called loves in fact hardly beyond inclinations nevertheless inclinations are an infidelity to meet a married woman and be mooning over her because she gave him her eyes and her handwriting when a girl was enough to rouse an honest fellows laugh at himself in the contemplation of his intermediate amorous vagabondage had he ever known the veritable passion after browny sank from his ken let it be confessed never his first love was his only true love despite one shuddering episode oddly humiliating to recollect though he had not behaved badly so then by right of his passion thus did eternal justice rule it that browny belonged to matey weyburn aminta to lord ormont aminta was a lady blooming in the flesh browny was the pasts pale phantom for which reason he could call her his own without harm done to any one and with his usual appetite for dinner breakfast lunch whatever the meal supplied by the hour it would somewhat alarmingly have got to mr weyburns conscience through a disturbance of his balance telling him that he was on a perilous road if his relish for food had been blunted he had his axiom on the subject and he was wrong in the general instance for the appetites of rogues and ogres are not known to fail as regarded himself he was eminently right and he could apply it to boys also to all young peoplethe unlaunched he called them he counted himself among the launched no doubt and had breasted seas but the boy was alive a trencherman lad in the coming schoolmaster and told him profitable facts concerning his condition besides throwing a luminous ray on the arcane of our elusive youthful if they have no stout zest for eating put query against them his customary enjoyment of dinner convinced mr weyburn that he had not brooded morbidly over his phantom browny and could meet aminta countess of ormont on the next occasion with the sentiments proper to a common official did she not set him a commendable example he admired her for not concealing her disdain of the aspirant schoolmaster quite comprehending by sympathy why the woman should reproach the girl who had worshipped heroes if this was a fullgrown specimen and the reply of the shamed girl that in her ignorance she could not know better he spared the girl but he laughed at the woman he commended laughed at himself amintas humour was being stirred about the same time she and her aunt were at the dinnertable in the absence of my lord the dinner had passed with the stiff dialogue peculiar to couples under supervision of their inferiors and as soon as the room was clear she had asked her aunt touching the secretary have you seen him mrs nargett pagnells answer could have been amusing only to one whose intimate knowledge of her found it characteristically salt for she was a lady of speech addressed ever directly or roundabout to the chief point of business between herself and her hearer and the more she was brief oblique farshooting the more comically intelligible she was to her niece she bent her head to signify that she had seen the secretary and struck the table with both hands exclaiming well to be sure lord ormont their discussion before they descended the stairs to dinner concerned his lordships extraordinary indifference to the thronging of handsome young men around his young countess here the implication ran is one established in the house amintas thoughts could be phrased yes that is true for one part of it as for the other part the ascent of a phoebus apollo with his golden bow and quiver off the fairest of eastern horizon skies followed suddenly by the sight of him toppling over in mr cupers longskirted brown coat with spectacles and cane is an image that hardly exceeds the degradation she conceived it was past ludicrous yet admitted of no woefulness nothing soothingly pathetic it smothered and barked at the dreams of her blooming spring of life to which her mind had latterly been turning back for an escape from sour one may say cynical reflections the present issue of a beautiful young womans first savour of battle with the world chapter vi in a mood of languor up in amintas amber dressingroom mrs nargett pagnell alluded sadly to the long month of separation and begged her niece to let her have in plain words an exact statement of the present situation adding items will do thereupon she slipped into prattle and held the field she was the known worthy good intolerable woman whom the burgess turns out for his world in regiments that do and look and all but step alike and they mean well and have conventional worships and material aspirations and very peculiar occult refinements with a blind head and a haphazard gleam of acuteness impressive to acquaintances convincing themselves that they impersonate sagacity she had said this done that and it was by proof providence consenting the right thing a niece written down in her girlhood because of her eyes and her striking air and excellent deportment as mate for a nobleman marries him before she is out of her teens i said she shall be a countess a countess she is providence does not comply with our predictions in order to stultify us admitting the position of affairs for the moment as extraordinary we are bound by what has happened to expect they will be conformable in the end temporarily warped we should say of them she could point to the reason it was lord ormonts blunt misunderstanding of her character the burgesss daughter was refining to an appreciation of the exquisite so rapidly that she could criticize patricians my lord had never forgiven her for correcting him in his pronunciation of her name by marriage singular indeed but men even great men men of title are so some of them whom you could least suspect of their being so he would speak the g in nargett and he declinedafter a remonstrance he declinedto pass pagnell under the cedilla lord ormont spoke the name like a man hating it or an english rustic nargett pagnell instead of the soft and elegant naryett pagnell the only true way of speaking it and she had always taken that pronunciation of her name for a test of peoples breeding the expression of his lordships countenance under correction was memorable naturally in those honeymoony days the young countess of ormont sided with her husband the earl she declared that her aunt had never dreamed of the cedilla before the expedition to spain when for example alfred nargett pagnell had a laughing remark which aminta in her childhood must have heard we rhyme with spaniel that was the secret of lord ormonts prepossession against amintas aunt and who can tell perhaps of much of his behaviour to the beautiful young wife he at least admired sincerely admired though he caused her to hang her headcast a cloud on the head so dear to him otherwise there was no interpreting his lordship to think of herself as personally disliked by a nobleman stupefied mrs pagnell from her just expectation of reciprocal dealings in high society for she confessed herself a fly to a title where is the shame if titles are created to attract elsewhere than in that upper circle we may anticipate hard bargains the widow of a solicitor had not to learn it but when a distinguished member and ornament of the chosen seats above blew cold upon their gesticulatory devotee and was besides ungrateful she was more than commonly assured of his being as she called him a sphinx his behaviour to his legally wedded wife confirmed the charge she checked her flow to resume the question so then where are we now he allows you liberally for pinmoney in addition to your own small independent income satisfaction with that would warrant him to suppose his whole duty done by you we are where we were aunty the month has made no change said aminta in languor and you as patient as ever i am supposed to have everything a woman can require can he possibly think it and i have to warn you child that lawyers are not so absolving as the world is with some of the ladies lord ormont allows you to call your friends i have been hearingit is not mere airy tales one hears from lawyers about cases in courts of law tighten your lips as you like i say nothing to condemn or reflect on mrs lawrence finchley i have had my eyes a little opened that is all oh i know my niece aminta when its a friend to stand by but our positionthanks to your inscrutable lord and masterdemands of us the utmost scrupulousness or it soon becomes a whirl and scandal flying about and those lawyers picking up and putting together i have had a difficulty to persuade them and my own niece whom i saw married at the british embassy in madrid as i take good care to tell everybody for it was my doing i am the responsible person and by an english protestant clergyman to all appearance able to walk erect in and out of any of these excellent new life assurance offices they are starting for the benefit of widows and orphans and deceased within six days of the ceremonyif ceremony one may call the hasty affair in those foreign places my dear the instant i heard it i had a presentiment all has gone well up to now i remember murmuring the words then your letter received in that smelly barcelona lord ormont was carrying you off to granadaa dream of my infancy it may not have been his manoeuvre but it was the beginning of his manoeuvres aminta shuddered and tralala and castanets and my cid my cid and the alhambra the sierra nevada and ay di me alhama and boabdil el chico and el zagal and fray antonio agapida she flung out the rattle yawning with her arms up and her head back in the posture of a woman wounded one of her aunts chance shots had traversed her breast flashing at her the time the scene the husband intensest sunniness on swordedges of shadeand now the wedded riddle illusion dropping mask romance in its anatomy cold english mist ah what a background is the present when we have the past to the fore that filmy past is diaphanous on heaving ribs she smiled at the wideeyed little gossip dont speak of manaoeuvres dear aunt and well leave granada to the poets im tired talk of our own people on your side and my fathers and as much as you please of the pagnellpagnells they refresh me do they go on marrying why my child how could they go on without it aminta pressed her hands at her eyelids oh me she sighed feeling the tear come with a sting from checked laughter but there are marriages aunty that dont go on though protestant clergymen officiated leave them unnoticed i have really nothing to tell you have not heard anything of lady eglett lady charlotte eglett no syllable or waitmy lords secretary was with her at olmer approved by her i have to suppose there my dear i say again i do dread that woman if she can make a man like lord ormont afraid of her and no doubt she is of our old aristocracy and they tell me she is coarse in her conversationlike a man lawyers tell me she is never happy but in litigation years back i am given to understand she did not set so particularly good an example lawyers hear next to everything i am told she lifted her horsewhip on a gentleman once and then put her horse at him and rode him down you will say the sister of your husband no not to make my niece a countess would i if i had known the kind of family then one asks is she half as much afraid of him in that case no wonder they have given up meeting was formerly one of the keepsake beauties well lady eglett and aminta countess of ormont will be in that peerage as they call it let her only have her dues my dear i wouldif i ever didswear the woman is jealous of me aunty i say more i say again it would be a good thing for somebody if somebody had his twitch of jealousy wives may be too meek cases and cases my poor alfred read to me where an illbehaving man was brought to his senses by a clever little shuffle of the cards and by the most innocent of wives a kind of poison to him of course but there are poisons that cure it might come into the courts and the nearer the proofs the happier he in withdrawing from his charge and effecting a reconciliation short of guilt of course men are so strange imagine now if a handsome young woman were known to be admired rather more than enough by a goodlooking gentleman near about her own age oh ive no patience with the man for causing us to think and scheme only there are men who wont be set right unless we do my husband used to say change is such a capital thing in lifes jogtrot that men find it refreshing if we now and then reverse the order of our pillionriding for them a spiritless woman in a wife is what they bear least of all anything rather is mr morsfield haunting mrs lawrence finchleys house as usual amintas cheeks unrolled their deep damask rose at the abrupt intrusion of the name i meet him there lord adderwood sir john randeller and the rest two or three times a week and the lady wife of the captain really a lady fairmrs month of may so i have to get at it she may be seen there really a contrast when you two are together as to reputation there is an exchange of colours those lawyers hold the keys of the great world and a naughty world it is i fearwith exceptions who are the salt but dont taste so much i cant help enjoying the people at mrs lawrence finchleys i like to feel i can amuse them as they do me one puzzles for what they sayin somebodys absence i mean they must take lord ormont for a perfect sphinx unless they are so silly as to think they may despise him or suppose him indifferent oh that upper class its a garden and we cant help pushing to enter it and fair flowers indeed but serpents too like the tropics it tries us more than anything else in the worldwell just as good eating tries the constitution he ought to know it and feel it and give his wife all the protection of his name instead ofnot that he denies i have brought him to that point he cannot deny it with me but not to present herto shun the court not to introduce her to his family to appear ashamed of her my darling aminta a month of absence for reflection on your legallywedded husbands conduct increases my astonishment for usually men old enough to be the grandfathers of their wives oh pray aunty pray pray aminta cried and her body writhed no more tonight you mean well i am sure let us wait i shall sleep perhaps if i go to bed early i dare say i am spiritlessnot worth more than i get i gave him the lead altogether he keeps it in everything else he is kind i have all the luxuriesenough to loathe them kiss me and say good night aminta made it imperative by rising her aunt stood up kissed and exclaimed i tell you you are a queenly creature not to be treated as any puny trollop of a handmaid and although he is a great nobleman he is not to presume to behave any longer my dear as if your family had no claim on his consideration my husband alfred pagnell would have laid that before him pretty quick you are the child of the farrells and the solers both old families on your fathers side you are linked with the oldest nobility in europe it flushes one to think of it your grandmother marrying captain algernon farrell was the legitimate daughter of a grandee of spain as i have told lord ormont often and i defy him to equal that for a romantic marriage in the annals of his house or boast of bluer blood again the solers we take the solers for granted aunty good night commoners if you like but established since the conquest that is we trace the pedigree and to be treated even by a great nobleman as if we were stuff picked up out of the ditch i declare there are times when i sit and think and boil is it chivalrous is it generousis it i say decentis it what alfred would have called a fair fulfilment of a pact for your wedded husband you may close my mouth but he pretends to be chivalrous and generous and he has won a queen any wealthy gentleman in englandi know of one if not twowould be proud to have beside him in equal state and what is he to her he is an extinguisher or is it the very meanest miserliness that he may keep you all to himself there we are again i say he is an unreadable sphinx aminta had rung the bell for her maid mrs pagnell could be counted on for drawing in her tongue when the domestics were near a languor past delivery in sighs was on the young womans breast she could have heard without a regret that the heart was to cease beating had it been downright misery she would have looked about her with less of her exanimate glassiness the unhappy have a form of life until they are worn out they feel keenly she felt nothing the blow to her pride of station and womanhood struck on numbed sensations she could complain that the blow was not heavier a letter lying in her jewelbox called her to read it for the chance of some slight stir the contents were known the signature of adolphus morsfield had a new meaning for her eyes and dashed her at her husband in a spasm of revolt and wrath against the man exposing her to these letters which a motion of her hand could turn to blood and abstention from any sign maintained in a satanic whisper saying here lies one way of solving the riddle it was her husband who drove her to look that way the look was transient and the wrath she could not burn a small portion of contempt lodged in her mind to shadow husbands precipitating women on their armoury for a taste of vengeance women can always be revengedso speedily so completely they have but to dip husbands driving wives to taste their power execrate the creature for her fall deep downward they are forgetful of causes does it matter amintas languor asked the letter had not won a reply thought of the briefest of replies was a mountain of effort and she moaned at her nervelessness in body and mind to reply to reproach the man to be flamean image of herself under the form she desiredgave her a momentary false energy wherein the daring of the man whose life was at a loss for the writing of this letter hung lighted she had therewith a sharp vision of his features repellent in correctness greek in lines with close eyes hollow temples pressed lipsa face indicating the man who can fling himself on a die she had heard tales of women and the man some had loved him report said here were words to say that he loved her they might poor man be true otherwise she had never been loved memory had of late been paying visits to a droopy plant in the golden summer drought on a gorgeous midsea island and had taken her on board to refresh her with voyages always bearing down full sail on a couple of blissful schools abodes of bloom and briny vigour sweet merriment innocent longings dreams the shyest dreams the mightiest at night before sleep at morn before rising often during day and when vexed or when dispirited she had issued her command for the voyage sheer refreshment followed as is ever the case if our vessel carries no freight of hopes there could be no hopes it was forgotten that they had ever been seriously alive but it carried an admiration now an admiration may endure and this one had been justified all round the figure heroical the splendid active youth hallowed amintas past the past of a bitterly humiliated aminta was a garden in the coming kiss of sunset with that godlike figure of young manhood to hallow it there he stayed perpetually assuring her of his triumphs to come she could have no further voyages ridicule convulsed her home of refuge for the young soldierhero to be unhorsed by misfortune was one thing but the meanness of the ambition he had taken in exchange for the thirst of glory accused his nature he so certainly involved her in the burlesque of the transformation that she had to quench memory she was therefore having smothered a good part of herself accountably languida condition alternating with fire in aminta and as mr morsfields letter supplied the absent element her needy instinct pushed her to read his letter through she had not yet done that with attention whether a woman loves a man or not he is her lover if he dare tell her he loves her and is heard with attention aware that the sentences were poison she summoned her constitutional antagonism to the mad step proposed so far nullifying the virus as to make her shrink from the madness even then her soul cried out to her husband who drives me to read or rather to brood upon what she read the brooding ensued was the thirst of her malady the best antidote she could hit on was the writers face yet it expressed him his fire and his couragegifts she respected in him found wanting in herself read by lord ormont this letter would mean a deadly thing aminta did her lord the justice to feel sure of him that with her name bearing the superscription it might be left on her table and world not have him to peruse it if he manoeuvred it was never basely despite resentment her deepest heart denied his being indifferent either to her honour or his own in relation to it he would vindicate both at a stroke for a sign nevertheless he had been behaving cruelly she charged on him the guilt of the small preludes archeries anglings veilings evasions all done with the eyelids and the mute of the lips or a skirmisher word or a fans flourish and which intended to pique the husband rather than incite the lover had led mrs lawrence finchley to murmur at her ear in close assembly without a distinct designation of mr morsfield dangerous man to play little games with it had brought upon her this letter of declaration proposal entreaty this letter was the mans life in her hands and safe of course but surely it was a proof that the man loved her aminta was in her fiveandtwentieth year when the woman who is uncertain of the having been loved and she reputed beautiful desirable is impelled by a sombre necessity to muse on a declaration and nibble at an idea of a test if a dangerous man to play little games with he could scarcely be dangerous to a woman having no love for him at all it meant merely that he would soon fall to writing letters like this and he could not expect an answer to it but her heart really thanked him and wished the poor gentleman to take its dumb response as his reward for being the one sole one who had loved her aminta dwelt on the one sole one lord ormonts treatment had detached her from any belief in love on his part and the schoolboy now ambitions to become a schoolmaster was behind the screen unlikely to be lifted again by a woman valuing her pride of youth though he hadbehold our deceptionsthe sympathetic face entirely absent from that of mr adolphus morsfield whom the world would count quite as handsomenay it boasted him he enjoyed the reputation of a killer of ladies women have odd tastes aminta thought and examined the gentlemans handwriting it pleased her better she studied it till the conventional phrases took a fiery hue and came at her with an invasive rush the letter was cast back into the box locked up there an end to it or no interdiction of sleep sleep was a triumph amintas healthy frame rode her over petty agitations of a blood uninflamed as lightly as she swam the troubled seawaters her body gloried to cleave she woke in the morning peaceful and mildly reflective like one who walks across green meadows only by degrees by glimpses was she drawn to remember the trotting cantering galloping leaping of an active heart during night we cannot men or woman control the heart in sleep at night there had been wild leapings night will lead an unsatisfied heart of a woman by way of sleep to scale black mountains jump jagged chasms sleep is a horse

begin to know they feel when it is refused them when they know they feel they have begun to reflect the void of justice is a godless region women to whom the solitary thought has come as a blown candle illumining the fringes of their storm ask themselves whether they are gods creatures or mans the question deals a swordstroke of division between them and their human masters young women animated by the passions their feeling bosoms of necessity breed and under terror discover do not distinguish an abstract justice from a concrete they are of the tribe too long hereditarily enslaved

narrator sensible to the pulses of his audience justice compels at times in truth there are times when the foggy obscurities of the preacher are by comparison broad daylight beside the whirling loose tissues of a woman unexplained aminta was one born to prize rectitude to walk on the traced line uprightly and while the dark rose overflowed the soft brown of her cheeks under musings upon her unlicenced hearts doings overnight she not only pleaded for woeful creatures of her sex burdened as she and erring she weighed them in the scales with men and put her heart where justice pointed sending men to kick aloft her husband the manriddle she was unable to rede or read him her will could not turn him nor her tongue combat nor was it granted her to pique the mailed veteran every poor innocent little bit of an art had been exhausted her title was lady ormont her condition actually slave a luxuriously established slave consorting with a singularly enfranchised setas for instance mrs lawrence finchley and lord adderwood sir john randeller and lady staines mrs may amy may notorious wife of a fighting captain the loneliest of blondes and other ladies other gentlemen mr morsfield in the list paired or not yet paired gossip raged aminta was of a disposition too generously cordial to let her be the rigorous critic of people with whom she was in touch but her mind knew relief when she recollected that her humble little schoolmate selina collect who had suffered on her behalf in old days was coming up to her from the suffolk coast on a visit for a week however much a slave and an unloved woman she could be a constant and protecting friend besides lord ormont was gracious to little selina she thought of his remarks about the modestminded girl after first seeing her from that she struck upon a notion of reserves of humaneness being in him if she might find the path to them and thence fortified by the repose her picture of little selinas merit had bestowed she sprang to the idea of valiancy that she would woo him to listen to her without inflicting a scene he had been a listening lover seeming lover once later than the granada sunsets the letter in her jewelbox urged aminta to clear her conscience by some means for leaving it unburnt chapter vii exhibits effects of a prattlers doses the rules in lord ormonts household assisted to shelter him for some hours of the day from the lady who was like a blast of sirocco under his roof he had his breakfast alone as lady charlotte had it at olmer a dislike of a common table in the morning was a family trait with both at ten oclock the secretary arrived and they were shut up together at the luncheon table aminta usually presided if my lord dined at home he had by that time established an equanimity rendering his constant civility to mrs pagnell less arduous the presence of a woman of tongue perpetually on the spring to gratify him and win him was among the burdens he bore for his aminta mrs pagnell soon perceived that the secretary was in favour my lord and this mr weyburn had their pet themes of conversation upon which the wary aunt of her niece did not gaze like the wintry sun with the distant smile her niece displayed over discussions concerning military biographies hannibals use of his elephants and his numidian horse the little st bernard modern artillery ancient slingers english and genoese bowmen napoleons tactics his command to the troopers to give point and english officers neglect of sword exercise and the devil of a day old england is to have on a day to come my lord connected our day of trial with india mrs pagnell assumed an air of studious interest she struck in to give her niece a lead that lord ormont might know his countess capable of joining the driest of subjects occupying exalted minds aminta did not follow her and she was extricated gallantly by the gentlemen in turn the secretary behaved with a pretty civility aminta shook herself to think tolerantly of him when he after listening to the suggestion put interrogatively that we should profit by hannibals example and train elephants to serve as a special army corps for the perfect security of our priceless indian empire instanced the danger likely to result from their panic fear of cannon and forbore to consult lord ormonts eye mrs pagnell knew that she had put her foot into it but women advised of being fools in what they say are generally sustained by their sense of the excellent motive which impelled them even to the countess of ormont she could have replied we might have given them a higher idea of usif that meant the countess of ormont had entered the field beside her to the exclusion of a shrinking aminta she hinted as much subsequently and amintas consciousness of the troth was touched the young schoolmasters company sat on her spirits deadened her vocabulary her aunt spoke of passing the library door and hearing the two gentlemen loudly laughing it seemed subserviency on the fallen young heros part his tastes were low he frequented the haunts of boxing men her lord informed her of his having made or of his making matches to run or swim or walk certain distances against competitors or within a given time he had also half a dozen boys or more in tow whom he raced out of town on sundays a nucleus of the school he intended to form but will not achilles become by comparison a common rushlight where was a blazing torch if we see him clap a clowns cap on the head whose golden helm was fired by pallas nay and let him look the hero still all the more does he point finger on his meanness of nature turning to another it is another kind of shame that a woman feels if she consents to an exchange of lettersshameful indeed but not such a feeling of deadly sickness as comes with the humiliating view of an object of admiration degraded bad she may be and she may be deceived vilely treated in either case and what is a womans pride but the staff and banner of her soul beyond all gifts he who wounds it cannot be forgivenneverhe has killed the best of her aminta found herself sliding along into the sentiment that the splendid idol of a girls worship is if she discover him in the lapse of years as an infinitesimally small one responsible for the womans possible reckless fit of giddiness and she could see her nonsense she could not correct it lines of the letters under signature of adolphus were phosphorescent about her they would recur and she charged their doing so on the discovered meanness of the girls idol her wicked memory was caused by his having plunged her low mrs pagnell performed the offices of attention to mr weyburn in lieu of the countess who seemed to find it a task to sit at the luncheon table with him when lady ormont was absent just peeped in she said as she entered the library to see if all was comfortable and gossip ensued not devoid of object she extracted an astonishingly smooth description of lady charlotte weyburn was brightness in speaking of the muchmisunderstood lady shes one of the living women of the world you are sure you dont mean one of the worldly women mrs pagnell rejoiced she has to be known to be liked he owned and you were one hears among the favoured i can scarcely pretend to that maam you were recommended lady charlotte is devoted to her brother mrs pagnells bosom heaved how strange lord ormont is one would suppose with his indignation at the country for its treatment of him admirers would be welcome oh dear no that is not the way on board the packet on our voyage to spain my niece in her cabin imploring mercy of neptune as they say i heard of lord ormont among the passengers i could hardly credit my ears for i had been hearing of him from my niece ever since her return from a select establishment for the education of young ladies not much more than a mornings drive out of london though dover was my residence she had got a hero it was lord ormont lord ormont all day and when the behaviour of the country to him became notorious amintamy niece the countessshe could hardly contain herself a secreti promised herits not known to lord ormont himselfa printed letter in a metropolitan paper copied into the provincial papers upholding him for one of the greatest of our patriot soldiers and the saviour of india was the work of her hands you would i am sure think it really well written meeting him on deckthe outline of the coast of portugal for an introductory subject our peninsular battles and so forthi spoke of her enthusiasm the effect was to cut off all communication between us i had only to appear lord ormont vanished i said to myself this is a character however the very mention of him to my niece as one of the passengers on boardmedicine miraculous she was up in half an hour out pacing the deck before evening hardly leaning on my arm and the colour positively beginning to show on her cheeks again he fled of coarse i had prepared her for his eccentricities next morning she was out by herself in the afternoon lord ormont strode up to us hismilitary stepand most courteously requested the honour of an introduction i had broken the ice at last from that moment he was cordiality itself untili will not say until he had called her his owna few little misunderstandingsnot with his countess you see a resident aunt is translated motherinlaw by husbands though i spare them pretty frequently i go to friends they travel here in london she must have a duenna the marriage at madrid at the embassywell perhaps it was a step for us for commoners though we rank with the independent has her own little pinmoneyan inheritance perhaps lady eglett gives the world her version she may say there was aiming at station i reply never was there a more wholehearted lovematch absolutely the girls heart has been his from the period of her schooldays oh a little affairshe was persecuted by a boy at a neighbouring school her mistress wrote me worda very determined romeo young gentleman indeedquite alarmed about him in the bud i carried her off on the spot and snapped it effectually warned he meant to be desperate i kept her away from my house at dover four months place to place and i did well i heard on my return that a youth answering to the schoolmistresss description of him had been calling several times the first two months and longer you have me alluding to these little nonsensical nothings because she seemed born to create violent attachments even at that early day and lady eglettlady charlotte eglett may hear for there is no end to them and impute them to her when reallycan she be made responsible for eyes innocent of the mischief they appear destined to do but i am disturbing you in your work you are very good maam said the ghost of the determined young gentleman a slight cold have you mrs pagnell asked solicitously dear me no he gave answer with a cleared throat in charging him with more than he wanted to carry she supplied him with particulars he had wanted to know and now he asked himself what could be the gain of any amount of satisfied curiosity regarding a married aminta she slew my lord on board a packetboat she bears the arrows that slay my lord married her where the first english chaplain was to be found that is not wonderful either british embassy madrid weyburn believed the ceremony to have been performed there at the same time he could hear lady charlottes voice repeating with her varied intonation mrs pagnells impressive utterances and he could imagine how the somewhat silly duenna aunt so penetrable in her transparent artifices struck emphasis on the incredulity of people inclined to judge of the reported ceremony by lord ormonts behaviour to his captive how explain that strange matter but can there be a gain in trying to sound it weyburn shuffled it away before the fit of passion seized him he could turn his eager mind from anything which had not a perceptible point of gain either for bodily strength or mental acquisition or for money too now that the school was growing palpable as an infant in arms and agape for the breast thought of gain and the bent to pursue it is the shield of athene over young men in the press of the seductions he had to confess his having lost some bits of himself by reason of his meditations latterly and that loss if we let it continue a space will show in cramp at the wrist logs on the legs a wheezy wind for any fellow vowed to physical trials of strength and skill it will show likewise in the brain beating broken wingsinability to shoot a thought up out of the body for half a minute and good lord how quickly the tightstrong fellow crumbles when once the fragmentary disintegration has begun weyburn cried out on a heart that bounded off at prodigal gallops and had to be nipped with reminders of the place of good leader he was for taking among the young hang superexcellence but we know those moanings over the troubles of a married woman we know their sources know their goal or else we are the fictionpuppet or the bedlamite and she is a married woman married at the british embassy madrid if you please after a few weeks acquaintance with her husband who doubtless wrote his name intelligibly in the registrars book but does not prove himself much the hero when he drives a pen even for so little as the signing of his name he signed his name apparently not more than partly pledging himself to the bond lord ormonts autobiographical scraps combined with lady charlottes hints and mrs pagnells communications to provoke the secretarys literary contempt of his behaviour to his wife however the former might be mended and he resumed the task it had the restorative effect of touching him to see his old hero in action whereby he was brought about to a proper modesty so that he really craved no more than for the mistress of this house to breathe the liberal air of a public acknowledgment of her rightful position things constituted by their buoyancy to float are remarkable for lively bobbings when they are cast upon the waters and such was the case with weyburn until the agitation produced by mrs pagnell left him free to sail away in the society of the steadiest he decided that by not observing not thinking not feeling about the circumstances of the household into which fate had thrown him he would best be ableprobably it was the one wayto keep himself together and his resolution being honest all round he succeeded in it as long as he abstained from a very wakeful vigilance over simple eyesight for if one is nervously on guard to notsee the matter starts up winged and enters us and kindles the mind and tingles through the blood it has us as a foe the art of blind vision requires not only practice but an intimate knowledge of the arts of the traitor we carry within safest for him after all was to lay fast hold of the particularly unimportant person he was both there and anywhere else the countess of ormonts manner toward him was to be read as a standing index of the course he should follow and he thanked her he could not quite so sincerely thank her aunt his ingratitude for the sickly dose she had administered to him sprang a doubt whether lady ormont now thanked her aunt on account of services performed at the british embassy madrid certain looks of those eyes recently when in colloquy with my lord removed the towering nobleman to a shadowed landscape was it solely an effect of eyes commanding light and having every shaft of the quiver of the rays at her disposal or was it a shot from a powerful individuality issuing out of bondage to some physical oppressor no longer master of the soul in peril of the slipping away of the body her look on him was not hate it was larger more terribly divine those eyes had elsewhere once looked love they had planted their object in a throbbing eden the man on whom they had looked shivered over the thought of it after years of blank division rather than have those eyes to look on him their displacing unintentness the man on whom they had once looked love would have chosen looks of wrath the darts that killblest darts of the celestial huntress giving sweet sudden cessation of pain in the one everlasting last flash of life with thought that the shot was hers oh for the ayava behea of the merciful in splendour these were the outcries of the man deciding simultaneously not to observe not to think not to feel and husbanding calculations upon storage of gain for the future softness held the song below it came of the fact that his enforced resolution for the sake of sanity drove his whole reflective mind backward upon his younger days when an evening and a morning star in him greeted the bright goddess browny or sang adieu and adored beyond all golden beams the underworld whither she had sunk where she was hidden meanwhile the worthy dame who had dosed him was out in her carriage busy paying visits to distinguished ladies of the great world with the best of excuses for an early call which was gossip to impart such as the countess of ormont had not yet thought of mentioning and two or three of them were rather amusedly interested to hear that lord ormont had engaged a handsome young secretary under the patronage of lady charlotte eglett devoted to sports of all kinds immensely favoured by both gossip must often have been likened to the winged insect bearing pollen to the flowers it fertilizes many a vacuous reverie those flowers of the upper garden are not indeed stationary and in need of the missionary buzzer but if they have been in one place unmoved for one hour they are open to take animation from their visitors aminta was pleasantly surprised next day by the receipt of a note from mrs lawrence finchley begging to be invited to lunch if she came as she had a purpose in the wish to meet my lord note the remainder of lord ormont and his aminta is taken from an older edition which uses single rather than double quotation marks dw chapter viii mrs lawrence finchley my lord had one of his wilful likings for isabella lawrence finchley and he consented to the torture of an hour of mrs nargett pagnell in the middle of the day just to taste the favourite he welcomed at home as he championed her abroad the reasons were numerous and intimate why she pleased him he liked the woman enjoyed the cause for battle that she gave weyburn on coming to the luncheon table beheld a lady with the head of a comely boy the manner softened in delicate feminine of a capital comrade her air of candour was her nature in her face and it carried a guileless roguery a placid daring a supersensual naughtiness a simplicity of repose amid the smoky reputation she created that led one to think the vapour calumnious or the creature privileged that young boys look opened him at once he had not to warm to herhe flew ordinarily the sweetest ladies will make us pass through cold mist and cross a stile or two or a broken bridge before the formalities are cleared away to grant us rights of citizenship she was like those frank lands where we have not to hand out a passport at the frontier and wait for dubious inspection of it she prevailed with cognizant men and with the frivolous women were capable of appreciating her too as aminta did despite some hinted qualifications addressed shyly to her husband but these were the very matters exciting his particular esteem he was of lady charlottes mind in her hot zeal against injustice done to the creatures she despised and yet more than she applauded a woman who took up her idiot husbands challenge to defend her good name and cleared it right or wrong and beat him down on his knees and then started for her spell of the merry canter over turf an example to the english of the punishment they get for their stupid puritanic tyrannysure to be followed by a national helterskelter downhill headlong and mrs lawrence was not one of the corrupt he argued she concealed what it was decent to conceal without pouting hypocritical pretences she had merely dispensed with idle legal formalities in the prettiest curvetting airy wanton way to divorce the man who tried to divorce her and whined to be forgiven when he found he couldnt adderwood was ready to marry her tomorrow if the donkey husband would but go and bray his last half a dozen others were heads off on the same course to that goal that was her champions perusal of a lady candidly asserting her right to have breeched comrades and paying for it in the advocacy which compromises she was taken to be and she was used as a weapon wherewith to strike at our pharisees women pushing out into the world for independence bleed heavy payments all round the earls doubleedged defence of her was partly a vindication of another husband who allowed his wife to call her friend he was nevertheless assured of her not being corrupt both by his personal knowledge of the lady and his perception of her image in the bosom of his wife she did no harm there he knew well although he was not a man to put his trust in faces as his young secretary inclined to do mrs lawrences look of honest boy did count among the pleadings and somewhat so might a government cruiser observe the intrusion of a whitesailed yacht in protected seawaters where licenced trawlers are at the haul talk over the table coursed as fluently as might be with mrs pagnell for a boulder in the stream uninformed by malice she led up to lord adderwoods name and perhaps more designedly spoke of mr morsfield on whom her profound reading into the female heart of the class above her caused her to harp as a real antinous that the ladies might discuss him and lord ormont wax meditative mrs lawrence pitied the patient gentleman while asking him in her mind who was the author of the domestic burden he had to bear it reminds me i have a mission she said theres a fencing match down at a hall in the west near the barracks private and select soldier and civilian i forget who challengedcivilian one judges soldiers are the peaceful party they want you to act umpire as they call it on the military side my dear lord and you willi have given my word you will bring lady ormont you willand not let me be confounded yes and we shall make a party i see consent aminta will enjoy the switch of steel i love to see fencing it rouses all that is diabolical in me she sent a skimming look at the opposite and i said he much freshened you fence handle the foils if you must speak modestly are you in practice i spend in hour in captain chiallos fencing rooms generally every evening before dinner i heard there the first outlines of the match proposed you are right it was the civilian mr morsfield as i suspected she smiled to herself like one saying not badly managed mr morsfield italian school lord ormont inquired with a screw of the eyelids french my lord the only school for teaching the simplesthas the most rational method italians are apt to be tricky but they were masters once and now and then they send out a fencer the french cant touch how would you account for it if i had to account for it i should say hotter blood cool nerve quick brain hum where are we then we dont shine with the small sword we had men neatly pinked for their slashings in the peninsula weve had clever irishmen hot enough blood this man morsfieldhave you crossed the foils with him goes at it like a spaniard though spaniards in paris have been found wary enough my lord hummed fellow looks as if he would easily lose his head over steel he can be dangerous the word struck on something and rang mrs lawrence had a further murmur within her lips her travelling eye met amintas and passed it but not dangerous surely if the breast is padded said mrs pagnell oh no oh no not in that case mrs lawrence ran out her voluble assent and her eyelids blinked her fair boys face was mischief at school under shadow of the master she said to weyburn are you one in the listto give our military a lesson they want it his answer was unheard by aminta she gathered from mrs lawrences pleased sparkle that he had been invited to stand in the list and the strange the absurd spectacle of a young schoolmaster taking the heroic attitude for attack and defence wrestled behind her eyes with a suddenly vivid firstofmay cricketing field a scene of snowballs flying the vision of a strenuous lighted figure scaling to noble young manhood isabella lawrences look at him spirited the bright past out of the wretched longbrowncoat shroud of the present prompting her to grieve that some womans hand had not smoothed a small tuft of hair disorderly on his head a little above the left parting because isabella lawrence finchley could have no recollection of how it used to toss featherywild at his games my lord hummed again i suspect we re going to get a drubbing this fellow here has had his french maitre darmes show me your hand sir weyburn smiled and extended his right hand saying the wrist wants exercise ha square thumb flesh full at the nails ends you were a bowler at cricket now examine the palms my lord i judge by the lines on the palms mrs pagnell remarked he nodded to her and rose coffee had not been served she reminded him it was coming in so down he sat a yard from the table outwardly equable inwardly cursing coffee though he refused to finish a meal without his cup i think the palms do betray something said mrs lawrence and aminta said everything betrays no my dear mrs pagnell corrected her the extremities betray and we cannot read the centre is it not so my lord it may be as you say maam she was disappointed in her scheme to induce a general examination of palms and especially his sphinx lordships weyburn controlled the tongue she so frequently tickled to an elvish gavotte but the humour on his face touched mrs lawrences to a subdued goodfellow roguishness and he felt himself invited to chat with her on the walk for a reposeful ten minutes in amintas drawingroom mrs pagnell quite enjoying the company as she told her niece was dismayed to hear her niece tell her of a milliners appointment positive for three oclock and she had written it in her head pm four oclock and she had mislaid or destroyed the milliners note and she still had designs upon his lordships palms things to read and hint around her off the lines she departed lord ormont became genial and there was no one present who did not marvel that he should continue to decree a state of circumstances more or less necessitating the infliction he groaned under he was too lofty to be questioned even by his favourites mrs lawrence conjured the ghost of lady charlotte for an answer this being lord adderwoods idea weyburn let his thoughts go on fermenting pride froze a beginning stir in the bosom of aminta her lord could captivate a reluctant womans bosom when he was genial he melted her and made her call up her bitterest pride to perform its recent office that might have failed but it had support in a second letter received from the man accounted both by mrs lawrence and by mr weyburn dangerous and the thought of who it was that had precipitated her to play little games for the sole sake of rousing him through jealousy to a sense of righteous duty armed her desperately against him she could exult in having read the second letter right through on receipt of it and in remembering certain phrases and notably in a reflection shot across her bewildered brain by one of the dangerous mans queer mad sentences be as iron as you like i will strike you to heat and her thought is there assurance of safety in a perpetual defenceall while she smiled on her genial lord and signified agreement with a smiting of wonderment at her heart when he alluded to a panic shout of the country for defence and said much crying of that kind weakens the power to defend when the real attack comes was it true but say what you propose she asked lord ormont proposed vigilance and drill a small degree of selfsacrifice on the part of the population and a lookout head in the war department he proposed to have a nation of stoutbraced men laughing at the foreign bully or bandit instead of being a pack of whimpering women whom he likened to the randomly protestant geese of our country roadside heads out a yard in a gabble of defence while they go backing so thereupon amintas notion of a resemblance in the mutual thought subsided she relapsed on the cushioning sentiment that she was a woman andonly a woman he might exclaim if it pleased him though he would never be able to say she was one of the whimpering she too had the choice to indulge in scorn of the superior man stone blind to proceedings intimately affecting himif he cared one might doubt it mrs lawrence listened to him with a mind more disengaged and a flitting disapproval of amintas unsympathetic ear or reluctance to stimulate the devout attention a bruised warrior should have in his tent she did not press on him the post of umpire he consentedat her request he saidto visit the show but refused any official position that would it was clearly enough implied bring his name in any capacity whatever before the country which had unpardonably maltreated him feminine wits will be set working when a point has been gained and as mrs lawrence could now say she had persuaded lord ormont to gratify her specially she warmed to fancy she read him and that she might have managed the wounded and angry giant her minor intelligence caracoling unhampered by harassing emotions rebuked amintas for not perceiving that to win him round to whatever a woman may desire she must be with him outstrip him even along the line he chooses for himself abuse the country rail at the government ridicule the title of english army proscribe the name of india in his hearing little stings of jealousy are small insect bites and do not pique a wounded giant hardly sensible of irritation under his huge and as we assume for our purpose justifiable wrath we have to speculate which way does the giant incline to go and turn him according to the indication mrs lawrence was driven by her critic mood to think aminta reliederroneously after womans old fashionon the might of superb dark eyes after having been captured it seemed to her worse than a beautiful womans vanity a childishness but her boys head held boys brains and lord ormonts praise of the splendid creatures nerve when she had to smell powder in spain and at bullfights and once at a wrecking of their carriage down a gully on the road over the alpujarras sent her away subdued envious happy to have kissed the cheek of the woman who could inspire it chapter ix a flash of the bruised warrior the winning of lord ormonts consent to look on at the little bout of arms was counted an achievement for even in his own rarefied upper circle where the fervid sentiments are not allowed to be seen plunging he had his troop of enthusiasts and they were anxious that he should make an appearance in public to take what consolation a misunderstood and injured man could get from evidence of the grateful esteem entertained for him by a party of his countrymen who might reasonably expect at the same time to set eyes at rather close quarters on the wonderful dark beauty supposed a spaniard occasionally beheld riding beside him if it is possible to connect a woman with the devoutest of their anticipations the sons of leisure up there will do it but in truth an english world was having cause to ransack the dustheaps for neglected men of mettle our intermittent ague known as dread of invasion was over the land twice down the columns of panic newspaper correspondence lord ormont saw his name cited with the effect on him that such signs of national repentance approaching lodged a crabbed sourness in his consultingroom whether of head or breast he was assailed by a gusty appeal from lady charlotte bidding him seize the moment to proclaim his views while the secretary had a private missive from her wherein between insistency and supplication she directed him to bring the subject before my lord every day and be sure to write out a fair copy of the epistle previous to the transmission of it capua was mentioned she brought in a siren too her brother was to be the soldier againfling off silken bonds the world might prate of his morality now was the hour for showing his patriotism casting aside his just anger and backing his chiefs opinion a good chance to get their names together to her brother she declared that the columns of the leading journal were open to himin large type he was to take her word for it he had only to dictate away quite at his ease just as he talked at olmer and leave the bother of the scribes business to his aide lose no time she concluded the country wants your ideas let us have your plan the earl raised his shoulders and kept his aide exclusively at the memoirs weyburn however read out to him with accentuation foolish stuff in the recurrent correspondence of the daily sheets and a complacent burgess article meant to be a summary of the controversy and a recommendation to the country to bask in the sun of its wealth again ay be the porker sow its getting liker and liker to every year lord ormont exclaimed and sprang on his feet take a pen shut up that box well give em digestive biscuits for their weak stomachs invasion cant be done they say i tell the doddered asses napoleon would have been over if villeneuve had obeyed him to the letter villeneuve had a fit of paralysis owing to the prestige of nelsonthat s as it happened and they swear at prestige wont believe in it because its not fat bacon i tell them after napoleons first battles prestige did half his work for him it saved him at essling from a plunge into the danube it saved him at moskowa it would have marched him half over england at his first jump on our shingle beach but that squelch of fat citizens should be toldto the devil with them will they ever learn short of a second williamthere were eightandforty hours when the liberty of this country hung wavering in the balance with those boulogne boats now look at ulm and austerlitz essling wagram put the victors in those little affairs to front our awkward squads the french could boast a regimental system and chiefs who held them as the whistplayer his hand of cards had we a better general than the archduke charles or cavalry and artillery equal to the hungarian or drilled infantry numbering within eighty thousand of the boulognewimereux camps we had nothing but the raw material of couragepluck and no science ask any boxing man what he thinks of the chances the french might have sacrificed a fleet to land fifty thousand our fleet was our one chance any foreign general at the head of fifty thousand trained picked troops would risk it and cut an entrechat for joy of the chance we should have fought and bled and been marched overa field of anglosaxon stubble and nelson riding the channel undisputed lord of the waters heigh by the lord this country would have been like a man free to rub his skin with his hand and a mortal disease in his blood are you ready how anticipate a hostile march on the capital is our business striding up and down the library lord ormont dropped his wrath to dictate the practical measures for defencedetesting the catscry defence he said but the foe would bring his old growlers and we should have to season our handful of regulars and mob of levies turn the mass into troops with plenty of food and blows daily englishmen soon get stomachs for the right way to play the game bowl as well as bat and the sooner they give up the idea of shamming sturdy on a stiff hind leg the better for their chances only its a beastly thing to see that for their favourite attitudelike some dog of a fellow weak in the fists weaker in the midriff at a fair who cries come on and prays his gods you wont all for peace the rascal boasts himself and he beats his wife and kicks his curs at home is there any one to help him now he vomits gold and honours on the man he yesterday treated as a felon ha bull the bumpkin disposed of my lord drew leisurely back from the foemans landingplace at the head of a body of serious englishmen teaching them to be manageable as chesspieces ready as bowstrings to let fly weyburn rejoiced to find himself transcribing crisp sentences hard on the matter without garnish of scorn kent sussex surrey all the southern heights about london round away to the southwestern of the hampshire heathland were accurately mapped in the old warriors brain he knew his points of vantage by name there were no references to gazetteer or atlas a chain of forts and earthworks enables us to choose our ground not for clinging to them but for choice of time and place to give battle if we have not been playing doubledyed traitor to ourselves we have a preponderating field artillery our yeomanry and volunteer horsemen are becoming a serviceable cavalry arm our infantry prove that their heterogeneous composition can be welded to a handy mass and can stand fire and return it and not be beaten by an acknowledged defeat thats english yes thats english when theyre at it my lord sang out to know how to take a licking that wins in the end cried weyburn his former enthusiasm for the hero mounting enlightened by a reminiscence of the precept he had hammered on the boys at cupers they fall well yes the english fall like men said my lord pardoning and embracing the cuffed nation bodies knocked over hearts upright thats example we breed ironsides out of a sight like that if it werent for a cursed feeble government scraping conges to the taxpayerwell so many of our good fellows would not have to fall that i say for this thing is going to happen some day mind you sir and i dont want to have puncheons and hogsheads of our english blood poured out merely to water the soil of a conquered country because english governments are a craven lot not daring risk of office by offending the taxpayer but on weyburn sent lady charlotte glowing words of the composition in progress they worked through a day and a second daytalked of nothing else in the intervals explanatory answers were vouchsafed to amintas modest inquiries at finch as she pictured scenes of smoke dust and blood from the overpowering plain masculine lines they drew terrible in bluntness the third morning lord ormont had map and book to verify distances and attempt a scale of heights take names of estates farms parishes commons patches of woodland weyburn wrote his fair copy on folio paper sevenandthirty pages he read it aloud to the author on the afternoon of the fourth day with the satisfaction in his voice that he felt my lord listened and nodded the plan for the defence of englands heart was a good plan he signed to have the manuscript handed to him a fortified london secure of the thames for abundant supplies well able to breathe within earthworks extending along the southern hills was clearly shown to stand the loss of two big battles on the sussex weald or more east to northeast if fortune willed it he rose from his chair paced some steps with bent head came back thoughtfully lifted the manuscript sheets for another examination then he stooped to the fire spreading the edges unevenly so that they caught flame weyburn spied at him it was to all appearance the doing of a man who had intended it and brought it to the predetermined conclusion about time for you to be off for your turn at chiallos our countrys defender remarked after tossing the last halfburnt lump under the grate and shovelling at it i will go my lord said weyburnand he was glad to go he went calculated his term of service under lord ormont he was young not a philosopher waste of anything was abhorrent to a nature pointed at store of daily gain if it were only the gain in a new or a freshened idea and time lost work lost good counsel to the nation lost represented horrid vacuity to him and called up the counter demonstration of a dance down the halls of madness for proof that we should at least have jolly motion of limbs there before perdition struck the great gong ay and we should be twirling with a fair form on the arm woman and man as it ought to be twirling downward true but together such a companionship has a wisdom to raise it above the title of madness name it heartily pleasure and in contempt of the moralist burgess praise the dance of a woman and the man together high over a curmudgeonly humping solitariness that wont forgive an injury nurses rancour smacks itself in the face because it cantto use the old schoolboy wordstake a licking these were the huddled drunken sensations and thoughts entertained by weyburn without his reflecting on the detachment from his old hero of which they were the sign he criticized impulsively and fancied he did no more and was not doing much though in fact criticism is the end of worship the brutus blow at that imperial but mortal bosom the person criticized was manifest who was the woman he twirled with she was unfeatured undistinguished one of the sex or all the sex the sex to be shunned as our deadly sapper of gain unless we find the chosen one to superterrestrialize it and us and trebly outdo our gift of our whole self for her she was indistinguishable absolutely unknown yet she murmured or seemed to murmurfor there was no sounda complaint of lord ormont and she or some soundless mouth of woman said he was a splendid military hero a chivalrous man a man of inflexible honour but had no understanding of how to treat a woman or belief in her having equal life with him on earth she was put aside rather petulantly and she took her seat out of the whirl with submission thinking she certainly was not browny whom he would have known among a million he tried to quit the hall and he twirled afresh necessarily not alone it is the unpardonable offence both to the graces and the great mother for man to valse alone she twirled on his arm uninvited accepted as in the course of nature hugged under dictate of the nature of the man steeled against her by the counting of gain and going now at desperations pace by very means of those defensive locked steamvalves meant to preserve him from this madnessfor the words of the redlipped mate where there were no words went through him like a music when the bow is over the viol sweeping imagination and they said her life was wasting was not she a priceless manuscript cast to the flames her lord had been at some trouble to win her or his great fame and his shadowed fortunes had won her he took her for his own and he would not call her his own he comported himself with absolute with kindly deference to the lady whose more than vital spark he let the gossips puff at and blur he praised her courage visibly admired her person admitted her in private to be his equal degraded her in public could anything account for the behaviour of so manly and noble a gentlemanrhetoric made the attempt and weyburn gave up the windy business discovering that his fair partner of the wasting life washe struggled to quench the revelationaminta he stopped the dance if there was no gain in whirling fancifully with one of the sex a spin of a minute with her was downright bankruptcy he was young full of blood his heart led him away from the door lord ormont had exposed at which a little patient unemotional watchfulness might have intimated to him something besides the simple source of the old heros complex chapter of conduct as it was weyburn did see the rancour of a raw wound in operation but he moralized and disapproved telling himself truly enough that so it would not have been with him instead of sounding at my lords character and his condition of the unjustly neglected great soldier for the purpose of asking how that raw wound would affect an injured veteran who compressed almost repressed the roar of achilles though his military bright name was to him his briseis chapter x a short passage in the game played by two politest of men in the domestic circle and everywhere among women lord ormont was annoyed to find himself often gruffish behind the tie of his cravat indeed the temper of our eminently serene will feel the strain of a doldrumdulness that is goaded to activity by a nettle the forbearance he carried farther than most could do was tempted to kick under pressure of mrs nargett pagnell without much blaming aminta on whose behalf he submitted to it and whose resolution to fix in england had brought it to this crisis he magnanimously proposed to the fair enemy he forced her to be and liked to picture her as being a month in paris aminta declined it for herself after six or more years of travelling she wished to settle and know her country she said a repetition remark wide of the point and indicatory to the game of pull she was again playing beneath her smooth visage unaware that she had the wariest of partners at the game but go youdo i beg she entreated it will give you new impressions and i cannot bear to tie you down here how you can consent to be tied down here is the wonder to me said he when we travelled through the year just visited england and were off again we were driving on our own road vienna in april and maywhat do you say you like the reviews there and the dances concerts zigeuner

the name of her honeymoon days was not a cajolery to her his name had been that of the christian romancero knight durandarte and she gave it to him to be on the proper level with him while she still declined well but just a month in paris theres nothing doing here and we both like the french theatre london will soon be filling well but he stopped for the filling of london did really concern her in the game of pull she was covertly playing with him you seem to have caught the fever of this london no bands no reviews low comedy acting he muttered his objections to london the society of people speaking ones own tongue add that she ventured to say you know you are ten times more spanish than english moorish if you like the slave of the gallant christian knight converted baptized and blissful oh i know but now we are settled in england i have a wish to study english society disappointing i assure youdinners heavy dancing boorish intrigue a blindmansbuff weve been over it all before we have

i can never feel at home in saying rowsley is lady charlottes name for you the name of lady charlotte was an invitation to the conflict between them he passed it and said durandarte runs a mile on the mouth and the coriolanus of their newspapers helps a stageplayer to make lantern jaws neither of them comes well from the lips of my girl after seven years she should have hit on a nickname of none of the christian suit i am not at home either with my lord however you send me off to paris alone and youll be alone and dull here in this london incomprehensible to me why we are both wondering said aminta you re handsomer than when i met you firstby heaven you are she flushed her dark brownred latesunset brunes are exceptional in england thousands admiring you of course i know my love i have a jewel she asked him what are jewels for and he replied to excite cupidity when they re shut in a box ware burglars but this one is not shut up she shuts herself up and up go her shoulders decide to be out of it and come to paris for some life for a month no its positive when do you expect your little school friend after easter aunt will be away your little friend likes the country ill go to my house agents if there s a country house open on the upper thames you can have swimming boating botanizing he saw her throat swallow but as he was offering agreeable things he chose to not understand how he was to be compassionate steignton she said and did her cause no good by saying it feebly his look of a bygone awakeinsleep old look drearily known to her was like a strip of sunlight on a fortress wall it signified is the poor soul pushing me back to that again she compelled herself to say your tenant there matter of business me and my tenant he remarked the man pays punctually the lease has expired not quite you are misinformed at easter ah question of renewing you were fond of the place i was fond of the place thank blazes im not what i was he paced about theres not a corner of the place that doesnt screw an eye at me because i had a dream there la gloire the rest he muttered these english was heard aminta said am i never to see steignton lord ormont invoked the powers he could not really give answer to this female talk of the eternities beaten i can never be he said with instinctive indulgence to the greater creature but down there at steignton i should be haunted by a young donkey swearing himself the fellow i grew up out of no doubt of that i dont like him the better for it steignton grimaces at a cavalry officer fool enough at his own risks and penalties to help save india for the english maunderers you cant tellthey dont know themselveswhat they mean except that they re ready to take anything you hand em and then pipe to your swinging i served them welland at my age in full activity they condemn me to sit and gape he stopped his pacing and gazed on the glass of the window would you wish me not to be present at this fencing said aminta dear me by all means go my love he replied any step his fair enemy won in the secret game pull between them she was undisputedly to keep she suggested it might lead to unpleasantness of what sort you ask he emphasized have you forgotten something happened after that last ball at challiss rooms their women as well as their men must be careful not to cross me aminta had confused notions of her being planted in hostile territory and torn and knitted trumpeted to the world as mended but not honourably mended in a way to stop corridor scandal the ball at challiss rooms had been one of her steps won it had necessitated a requirement for the lion in her lord to exhibit himself and she had gained nothing with society by the step owing to her poor performance of the lions mate she had in other words shunned the countenance of some scattered people pityingly ready to support her against the deadly passive party known to be lady charlottes she let her lord go thinking that once more had she striven and gained nothing which was true of all their direct engagements and she had failed because of her being only a woman mr morsfield was foolishly wrong in declaring that she as a woman had reserves of strength he was perhaps of lady charlottes mind with regard to the existence of a countess of ormont or he would know her to be incredibly cowardly cowardly under the boast of pride too well then say if you like a woman yet this mere shallow woman would not hesitate to meet the terrible lady charlotte at any instant on any terms and what are we to think of a soldier hero lion dreading to tell her to her face that the persecuted woman is his wife am i a woman they can be ashamed of she asked and did not seek the answer at her mirror she was in her bedroom and she put out a hand to her jewelbox fingered it found it locked and abandoned her idle project a gentleman was dangerous she had not found him so he had the reputation perhaps because he was earnest not so very many men are earnest she called to recollection how ludicrously practical he was in the thick of his passion his third letter addressed to the countess of ormontwhom he manifestly did not or would not take to be the veritable countessand there was much to plead for his error or was it his fourththe letters were a tropical hailstorm third or fourth he broke off a streaked thunderpeal to capitulate his worldly possessions give the names and degrees of kinship of his relatives the exact amount of the rentroll of his yorkshire estates of his funded property silly man but not contemptible he proposed everything in honour from his view of it whether in his third fourth or fifth letter how many had come she drew the key from her purse and opened a drawer the key of the jewelbox was applied to the lock mr morsfield had sent her six flaming letters he not only took no precautions he boasted that he hailed the consequences of discovery six she lifted a pen it had to be done he was briefly informed that he disturbed her peace she begged he would abstain from any further writing to her the severity was in the brevity the contrast of her style and his appeared harsh but it belonged to the position having with one dash of the pen scribbled her three lines she slipped the letter into her pocket that was done and it had to be done it ought to have been done before how simple it was when one contemplated it as actually done aminta made the motion of a hand along the paper just a flourish soon after her head dropped back on the chair and her eyes shut she took in breath through parted lips the brief lines of writing had cut away a lump of her vitality chapter xi the secretary taken as an antidote dusty wayfarers along a white highroad who know of a bubbling little spring across a stile on the woodland borders of deep grass are hailed to sit aside it awhile and amintas feverishness was cooled by now and then a quiet conversation with the secretary ambitious to become a schoolmaster lady charlotte liked him so did her lord mrs lawrence had chatted with him freshly as it was refreshing to recollect nobody thought him a stunted growth in amintas realized recollections amid the existing troubles of her mind the charge against him grew paler and she could no longer quite think that the young hero transformed into a mr cuper had deceived her though he had done itmuch as if she had assisted at the planting and watched aforetime the promise of a noble tree to find it after an interval of years pollardeda short trunk shooting out a shock of small slim stiff branches dwarfed and disgraced serviceable perhaps not ludicrous or ugly certainly taking it for a pollard and he was a cool wellspring to talk with he supposed once to be a passionate nature scorned passion as a madness he smiled in his merciful executioners way at the high society of which her aim was to pass for one among the butterflies or dragonflies he had lost his patriotism he labelled our english classes the skimmers the gorgers the grubbers and stigmatized them with a friendly air and uttered words of tolerance only for farmers and surgeons and schoolmasters but that was quite incidental in the humorous run of his talk diverting to hear while it lasted he had of course a right to his ideas no longer concerned in contesting them she drank at the water of this plain earthwell and hoped she preferred it to fiery draughts though it was flattish or say flavourless in the other there was excess of flavouror no spice it had to be called the young schoolmasters world seemed a sunless place the world of traders bargaining for gain without a glimmer of the rich generosity to venture life give it dare all for native landor for the one beloved love pressed its claim on heroical generosity and instantly it suffused her as an earth under flush of sky the one beloved she had not known love she was in her fiveandtwentieth year and love was not only unknown to her it was shut away from her by the lock of a key that opened on no estimable worldly advantage in exchange but opened on a dreary clouded round such as she had used to fancy it must be to the beautiful creamy circushorse of the tossing mane and flowing tail and superb step she was admired she was just as much doomed to a round of paces denied the glorious fling afield her natures food hitherto she would have been shamefaced as a boy in forming the word love now believing it denied to her for good and allfor ever and everher bosom held and uttered the word she saw the word the nothing but the word that it was and she envisaged it for the purpose of saying adieu to itgoodbye even to the poor empty word this condition was attributable to a gentlemans wild rageing with the word into which he had not infused the mystic spirit he poured hot wine and spiced if not the spirit of love it was really the passion of the man her tremors now and again in the reading of his later letters humiliated her in the knowledge that they came of no response to him but from the temporary base acquiescence which is with women a terrible perception of the gulf of their unsatisfied nature the secretary cheerful at his work was found for just the opening of a door sometimes she hesitatedto disturb him she said to herselfand went upstairs or out visiting he protested that he could work on and talk too she was able to amuse her lord with some of his ideas he had a stock of them all his own ideas newborn and naked original ideas are acceptable at no time to the humanity they visit to help uplift it from the state of beast in the england of that period original or unknown ideas were a smoking brimstone to the nose dread arabian afrites invisible in the air jumping out of vases armed for the slaughter of the venerable and the cherished the ivyclad and celestially haloed they carried the dishevelled maenads torch a step with them and we were on the phlegethon waters of the french revolution for a publication of simple ideas men were seized tried at law mulcted imprisoned and not pardoned after the term of punishment their names were branded the horned elect butted at them he who alluded to them offered them up wittingly or not to be damned in the nose of the public for an execrable brimstone stench lord ormont broke through his shouts or grunts at amintas report of the secretarys ideas on various topics particularly the proposal that the lords of the land should head the land in a revolutionary effort to make law of his crazy topheavy notions with a selfsatisfied ejaculation he has not favoured me with any of these puffballs of his the deduction was that the author sagaciously considered them adapted for the ear of a woman they were womanishie flighty gossamer to the host of males all ideas are female until they are made facts this idea proposing it to our aristocracy to take up his other ideas or reject them on pain of the forfeiture of their caste and headship with the generations to follow and a total displacing of them in history by certain notorious frowzy scrubby pamphleteers and publishers lord ormont thought amazingly comical english nobles heading the weavers cobblers and barbers of england he laughed but he said charlotte would listen to that the dread highsitting lady charlotte was in his lofty thinking a woman and would therefore listen to nonsense if it happened to strike a particular set of bells hanging in her cranium she patronized blasphemous and traitorous lawbreakers just to keep up the pluck of the people not with a notion of maintaining our english aristocracy eminent in history lady charlotte however would be the foremost to swoop down on the secretarys ideas about the education of women on that subject aminta said she did not know what to think now if a man states the matter he thinks and a woman does but listen whether inclining to agree or not a perceptible stamp is left on soft wax lord ormont told her so with cavalier kindness she confessed she did not know what to think when the secretary proposed the education and collocation of boys and girls in one group never separated declaring it the only way for them to learn to know and to respect one another they were to learn together play together have matches together as a scheme for stopping the mischief between them but my dear girl dont you see the devilry was intended by nature life would be the coldest of dishes without it and as for mixing the breeched and petticoated in those young daysi cant enter into it my lord considerately said all i can tell you is i know boys aminta persisted in looking thoughtful things are bad as they are now she said always werealways will be they were intended to be if we are to call them bad botched mendings will only make them worse which side suffers both and both like it one side must be beaten at any game its off and on pretty equalexcept in the sets where one side wears thick boots is this fellow for starting a mixed sexes school funny mothers i suppose aminta said and checked the supposition the mothers would not leave their girls unless they were confident theres to be a female head of the female department he reckons on finding a woman as big a fool as himself a fair bit of reckoning enough hes clever at the pen he doesnt bother me with his ideas now and then i ve caught a sound of his bee buzzing the secretary was left undisturbed at his labours for several days he would have been gladdened by a brighter look of her eyes at her next coming they were introspective and beamless she had an odd leaning to the talk upon cupers boys he was puzzled by what he might have classed in any other woman as a want of delicacy when she recurred to incidents which were red patches of the school time and had clearly lost their glow for her a letter once written by him in his early days at cupers addressed to j masner containing a provocation to fight with any weapons and signed your antagonist had been read out to the whole school under strong denunciation of the immorality the unchristianlike conduct of the writer by mr cuper creating a sensation that had travelled to miss vincents establishment where some of the naughtiest of the girls had taken part with the audacious challenger dreadful though the contemplation of a possible duel so close to them was and then the girls heard that the anonymous your antagonist on being cited to proclaim himself in public assembly of schoolmates and masters had jumped on his legs and into the name ofone who was previously thought by miss vincents good girls incapable of the appalling wickedness as mr cuper called it of signing your antagonist to a christian schoolfellow having the design to provoke a breach of the law of the land and shed christian blood mr cuper delivered an impressive sermon from his desk to the standing up boarders and dayscholars alike vilifying the infidel greek word antagonist do you remember the offenders name the countess of ormont said and weyburn said oh yes i ve not forgotten the incident her eyes wherein the dead time hung just above the underlids lingered as with the wish for him to name the name she said i am curious to hear how you would treat a case of that sort would you preach to the boys ten words at most the right assumption is that both fellows were to blame i fancy the proper way would be to appeal to the naughty girls for their opinion as to how the dispute should be decided you impose too much on them and you are not speaking seriously pardon me i am i should throw myself into the mind of a naughty girlsupposing none of these at handand i should let it be known that my eyes were shut to proceedings always provided the weapons were not such as would cause a shock of alarm in female bosoms you would at your school allow it to be fought out judging by the characters of the boys if they had heads to understand i would try them at their heads otherwise they are the better they come round quicker to good blood at their agei speak of english boysfor a little hostile exercise of their fists well for one thing it teaches them the value of sparring i must imagine i am not one of the naughty sisterhoodfor i cannot think i should ever give consent to fighting of any description unless for the very best of reasons said the countess his eyes were at the trick of the quarterminutes poising her lids fluttered oh i dont mean to say i was one of the good she added at the same time her enlivened memory made her conscious of a warning that she might as any woman might so talk on of past days as to take rather more than was required of the antidote she had come for the antidote was excellent cooling fortifying quite a chalybeate her aunt would say and she was thankful her heart rose on a quiet wave of the thanks and pitched down to a depth of uncounted fathoms aminta was unable to tell herself why mrs lawrence finchley had been announced on her way to the drawing room amintas brain fell upon a series of dots that wound along a track to the point where she accused herself of a repented coquettrycause of the burning letters she was doomed to receive and could not stop without rousing her lion she dotted backwards there was no sign that she had been guilty of any weakness other than the almostat least in designinnocent first move which had failed to touch lord ormont in the smallest degree never failure more absolute she was about to inquire of her bosoms oracle whether she greatly cared now for an answer her brain went dotting along from mr cupers school and a boy named abner there and a boy named matey weyburn who protected the little jewboy up to mr abner in london who recommended him in due season to various acquaintances among them to lady charlotte eglett hence the introduction to lord ormont how little extraordinary circumstances are if only we trace them to the source but if only it had appeared marvellous the throbbing woman might have seized on it as a thing fateful an intervention distinctly designed to waken the best in her which was after all the strongest yea she could hope and pray and believe it was the strongest she was listening to isabella lawrence finchley wishing she might have followed to some end the above line of her meditations mrs lawrence was changed much warmer pressing to be more than merely friendly aminta twice gave her cheek for kisses the secretary had spoken of mrs lawrence as having the look of a handsome boy and amintas view of her now underwent a change likewise compunction together with a sisterly taste for the boyish fair one flying her sail independently and gallantly braving the winds induced her to kiss in return you do like me a morsel said mrs lawrence i fell in love with you the last time i was here i came to see mr secretaryits avowed and i have been thinking of you ever since of no one else oh yes for a man but you caught me ive been hearing of him from captain may they fence at those rooms and it s funny mr morsfield practises there you know and there was a time when the lovely innocent amy queen of blondes held the seat of the queen of brunes ah my dear the infidelity of men doesnt count they are affected by the changeing moons as long as the captain is civil to him we may be sure beautiful amy has not complained her husband is the pistol she carries in her pocket and she has fired him twice with effect through love of you i have learnt the different opinion the world of the good has of her and of me i thought we ran under a common brand there are gradations i went to throw myself at the feet of my greataunt good old greataunt lady de culme who is a power in the land i let her suppose i came for myself and she reproached me with lord adder i confessed to him and ten others she is a dear shes ticklish and at eightyfour she laughed she looked into my eyes and saw a field with never a man in itjust the shadow of a man she admitted the ten cancelled the one and exactly named to me by comparison with the erring amy the sinner i am and must be if i m to live so dear the end of it is and mrs lawrence put her fingers to a silken amber bow at amintas throat and squared it and flattened it with dainty precision speaking on under dropped eyelids intent upon her work lady de culme will be happy to welcome you whenever it shall suit the countess of ormont to accompany her disreputable friend but what can i do dear she raised her lids and looked beseechingly i was born with this taste for the ways and games and style of men i hope i dont get on badly with women but if i m not allowed to indulge my natural taste i kick the stableboards and bite the manger aminta threw her arms round her and they laughed their mutual peal caressing her still aminta said i dont know whether i embrace a boy that idea comes from a man said mrs lawrence it was admitted the secretary was discussed mrs lawrence remarked yes i like talking with him hes bright you drove him out of me the day i saw him doesnt he give you the idea of a man who insists on capturing you and lets it be seen he doesnt care two snaps of a finger aminta petitioned on his behalf indifferently he s well bred she was inattentive to mrs lawrences answer the allusion of the queen of blondes had stung her in the unacknowledged regions where women discard themselves and are most sensitive decide on coming soon to lady de culme said mrs lawrence now that her arms are open to you she would like to have you in them she is old you wont be rigorous no standing on small punctilios she would call but she does nothm it is m le comte that she does not choose tohm but her arms are open to the countess it ought to be a grand step you may be assured that lady charlotte eglett would not be taken into them my greataunt has a greataunts memory the ormonts are the only explanationif it s an apologyshe can offer for the behaviour of the husband of the countess of ormont you know i like him i cant help liking a man who likes me is that the way with a boy mr secretary i must have another talk with the gentleman my dear you are aminta to me always aminta to you was the reply tenderly given but as for comprehending him im as far off that as lady de culme who hasnt the liking for him i have the earl said aminta showing by her look that she was in the same position mrs lawrence shrugged i believe men and women marry in order that they should never be able to understand one another the riddles best read at a moderate distance it s what they call the golden mean too close too far were strangers i begin to understand that husband of mine now were on bowing terms now i must meet the earl tomorrow you will arrange his hand wants forcing upon my word i dont believe it s more mrs lawrence contrasted him in her mind with the husband she knew and was invigorated by the thought that a placable impenetrable giant may often be more pliable in a womans hands than an irascible dwarfuntil perchance the latter has been soundly cuffed and then he is docile to trot like a squire as near your heels as he can get she rejoiced to be working for the woman she had fallen in love with aminta promised herself to show the friend a livelier affection at their next meeting a seventh letter signed adolphus came by post was read and locked up in her jewelbox they were all nigh destruction for a wavering minute or so they were placed where they lay because the first of them had been laid there the box being a strong one under a patent key and discovery would mean the terrible they had not been destroyed because they had or seemed to her to have the language of passion she could read them unmoved and appease a wicked craving she owned to having and reproached herself with having for that language was she not colour in the sight of men here was one a mouthpiece of numbers who vowed that homage was her due and devotion the pouring forth of the soul to her what was the reproach if she read the stuff unmoved but peruse and reperuse it and ask impressions to tell our deepest instinct of truthfulness whether language of this character can have been written to two women by one hand men are cunning can they catch a tone not that tone she too mrs amy may was colour in the sight of men yet it seemed that he could not have written so to the queen of blondes and she by repute was as dangerous to slight as he to attract her indifference exonerated him besides a queen of blondes would not draw the hearts out of men in england as in italy and in spain aminta had got thus far when she found queen of brunes expunged by a mist she imagined hearing the secretarys laugh she thought he was right to laugh at her she retorted simply these are feelings that are poetry a man may know nothing about them and be an excellent schoolmaster suggestions touching the prudence of taking mrs lawrence into her confidence as regarded these troublesome letters of the man with the dart in his breast were shuffled aside for various reasons her modesty shrank and a sense of honour toward the man forbade it she would have found it easier to do if she had conspired against her heart in doing it and yet coldbloodedly to expose him and pluck the clothing from a passiondear to think of only when it is profoundly secretstruck her as an extreme baseness of which not even the woman who perused and reperused his letters could be guilty her head rang with some of the lines and she accused her head of the crime of childishness seeing that her heart was not an accomplice at the same time her heart cried out violently against the business of a visit to lady de culme and all the steps it involved justly she accused her heart of treason heart and head were severed this as she partly apprehended is the state of the woman who is already on the slope of her natures mineshaft dreading the rush downwards powerless to break away from the light letters perused and reperused coming from a man never fervently noticed in person conjure features one would wish to put beside the actual to make sure that the fiery lines he writes are not practising a beguilement aminta had lost grasp of the semblance of the impassioned man she just remembered enough of his eyes to think there might be healing in a sight of him latterly she had refused to be exhibited to a tattling world as the great noblemans conquestthe beautiful lady doubtful of a report that had scorched her cars theatres rides pleasuredrives even such houses as she saw standing open to her had been shunned now she asked the earl to ride in the park he complied and sent to the stables immediately just noted another of her veerings the whimsy creatures we are matched to contrast with shift as the very winds or feathergrasses in the wind possibly a fine day did it possibly too her not being requested to do it he was proud of her bearing on horseback she rode well and looked well a finer weapon wherewith to strike at a churlish world was never given into the hands of man these english may see in her if they like that they and their laws and customs are defied it does her no hurt and it hits them a ringing buffet among the cavaliers they passed was mr morsfield he rode by slowly the earl stiffened his back in returning the salute both that and the gentleman were observed by aminta he sees to having good blood under him said the earl i admired his mount she replied interpreted by the fire of his writing his features expressed character insomuch that a woman could say of another woman that she admired him and might reasonably do so his gaze at her in the presence of her lord was audacious he had the defect of his virtue of courage yet a man indisputably possessing courage cannot but have an interesting facethough one may continue saying pity that the eyes are not a little wider apart he dresses tastefully the best english style a portrait by a master hand might hand him down to generations as an ancestor to be proud of but with passion and with courage and a bent for snatching at the lions own does he not look foredoomed to an early close her imagination called up a portrait of elizabeths earl of essex to set beside him and without thinking that the two were fraternally alike she sent him riding away with the face of the earl of essex and the shadow of the unhappy noblemans grievous fortunes over his head but it is inexcuseable to let the mind be occupied recurrently by a man who has not moved the feelings wicked though it be to have the feelings moved by him aminta rebuked her silly wits and proceeded to speculate from an altitude seeing the mans projects in a singularly definite minuteness as if the crisis he invoked the perils he braved the mute participation he implored of her for the short space until their fate should be decided were a story sharply cut on metal several times she surprised herself in an interesting pursuit of the story abominably cold abominably interested she fell upon a review of small duties of the day to get relief and among them a device for spiriting away her aunt from the table where mrs lawrence wished to meet lord ormont it sprang up to her call like an imp of the burning pit she saw it ingenious and of natural aspect i must be a born intriguer she said in her breast that was hateful but it seemed worse when she thought of a woman commanding the faculty and consenting to be duped and foiled that might be termed despicable but what if she had not any longer the wish to gain her way with her lord those letters are acting like a kind of poison in me her heart cried and it was only her head that dwelt on the antidote chapter xii more of cupers boys entering the diningroom at the appointed minute in a punctual household mrs lawrence informed the company that she had seen a horse guards orderly at the trot up the street weyburn said he was directing a boy to ring the bell of the house for him lord ormont went to the window amends and honours mrs lawrence hummed and added an operatic flourish of an arm something like it might really be imagined a large square missive was handed to the footman thereupon the orderly trotted off my lord took seat at table telling the footman to lay that parcel beside the clock on the mantelpiece aminta and mrs lawrence gave out a little cry of bird or mouse pitiable to hear they could not wait they must know they pished at sight of plates his look deferred to their good pleasure like the dead hand of a clock under key and weyburn placed the missive before him seeing by the superscription that it was not official it was addressed in the roman hand of a boys copybook writing to general the earl of ormont icb etc horse guards london the earls eyebrows creased up over the address they came down low on the contents he resumed his daily countenance nothing of importance he said to the ladies mrs lawrence knocked the table with her knuckles aminta put out a hand in sign of her wish pray let me see it after lunch will do no no no we are womenwe are women cried mrs lawrence how can it concern women as well ask how a battlefield concerns them yes the shots hit us behind you said aminta and she too struck the table he did not prolong their torture weyburn received the folio sheet and passed it on aminta read mrs lawrence jumped from her chair and ran to the countesss shoulder her red lips formed the petitioning word to the earl for the liberty she was bent to take peep if you like my lord said jesting at the blank she would find and soft to the pretty play of her mouth when the ladies had run to the end of it he asked them well now then but its capitalthe dear laddies mrs lawrence exclaimed amintas eyes met weyburns she handed him the sheet of paper upon the transmission of which empty thing from the horse guards my lord commented an orderly weyburn scanned it rapidly for the table had been served the contents were these high brent near artswell april th to general the earl of ormont cavalry may it please your lordship we the boys of mr cupers school are desirous to bring to the notice of the bravest officer england possesses now living a deed of heroism by a little boy and girl children of our school laundress aged respectively eight and six who seeing a little fellow in the water out of depth and sinking twice before the third time jumped in to save him though unable to swim themselves the girl aged six first we are sorry to say but the brother robert coop followed her example and together they made a line and she caught hold of the drowning boy and he held her petycoats and so they pulled we have seen the place it is not a nice one they got him ashore at last the parkkeeper here going along found them dripping rubbing his hands and blowing into his nostrils name t shellen son of a small cobbler here and recovered may it please your lordship we make bold to apply because you have been for a number of years as far as the oldest can recollect the hero of our school and we are so bold as to ask the favour of general lord ormonts name to head a subscription we are making to circulate for the support of their sick mother who has fallen ill we think her a good woman gentlemen and ladies of the neighbourhood are willing to subscribe if we have a great name to head the list we think we shall make a good subscription names martha mary coop mother robert coop jane coop the girl aged six if we are not taking too great a liberty a subscription paper will follow we are sure general the earl of ormonts name will help to make them comfortable we are obediently and respectfully david gowen walter bench james panners parsons and seven others weyburn spared aminta an answering look that would have been a begging of browny to remember matey it s genuine he said to mrs lawrence as he attacked his plate with the gusto for the repast previously and benignly observed by her it ought to be the work of some of the younger fellows they spell correctly on the whole excepting said my lord an article they dont know much about yet weyburn had noticed the word and he smiled said to be the happy state the three signing their names are probably what we called bellman and beemen collector and heads of the swarmenthusiasts if it is not the work of some of the younger hands the school has levelled on minors in any case it shows the school is healthy i subscribe said mrs lawrence the little girl aged six shall have something done for her said aminta and turned her eyes on the earl he was familiar with her thrilled voice at a story of bravery he said the boys dont say the girls brother turned tail only that the girls brother aged eight followed the lead of the little girl aged six mrs lawrence remarked well i like the schoolboys toowe are sorry to say but they re good lads boys who can appreciate brave deeds are capable of doing them speak to me about it on monday the earl said to weyburn he bowed and replied i shall have the day tomorrow i ll walk it and call on messrs he glanced at the paper gowen bench and parsons i have a german friend in london anxious to wear his legs down stumpier the name of the school it is called cupers aminta on hearing the name of cuper a second time congratulated herself on the happy invention of her pretext to keep mrs pagnell from the table at midday her aunt had a memory for names what might she not have exclaimed there would have been little in it but it was as well that the boy of the name of weyburn at cupers should be unmentioned by an exaggeration peculiar to a disgust in fancy she could hear her aunt vociferating weyburn and then staring at mr weyburn oppositeperhaps not satisfied with staring he withdrew after his usual hearty meal during which his talk of boys and their monkey tricks and what we can train them to had been pleasant generally especially to mrs lawrence aminta was carried back to the minute early years at high brent a line or two of a smile touched her cheek yes my dear countess that is the face i want for lady de culme today said mrs lawrence she likes a smiling face auntyaunty has always been good she has never been prim i was too much for her until i reflected that she was very old and deserved to know the truth before she left us and so i went to her and then she said she wished to see the countess of ormont because of her being my dearest friend i fancy she entertains an arriere idea of proposing her flawless niece gracey marchioness of fencaster to present you she s quite equal to the fatigue herself you ll rejoice in her anecdotes people were virtuous in past days they counted their sinners in those days too as i have to understand the men chivalrously bore the blame though the women were rightly punished now alas the initiative is with the women and men are not asked for chivalry hence it languishes lady de culme wont hear of the queen of blondes has forbidden her these many years lord ormont to whom the ladys prattle was addressed kept his visage moveless except in slight jerks of the brows what queen you insist upon renewing my old old pangs of jealousy my dear lord the queen of cyprus they called her in the last generation she fights our great duellist handsomely my dear mrs lawrence he triumphs finally we know but she beats him every round it s only tattle that says the duel has begun may is the month of everlasting beauty there s a widower marquis now who claims the right to cast the glove to any who dispute it mrs may is too goodlooking to escape from scandal amy may has the good looks of the immortals she cant be thirty in the calendar of women she counts thirtyfour malignity her husbands a lucky man the shots have proved it lord ormont nodded his head over the hopeless task of defending a woman from a woman and their sharp interchange ceased but the sight of his complacency in defeat told aminta that he did not respect his fair client it drew a sketch of the position he allotted his wife before the world side by side with this mrs amy may though a lady de culme was persuaded to draw distinctions he had however quite complacently taken the dose intended for him by mrs lawrence who believed that the system of gently forcing him was the good one the ladies drove away in the afternoon the earl turned his back on manuscript he sent for a couple of walking sticks and commanded weyburn to go through his parades he was no tyro merely out of practice and unacquainted with the later simpler form of the great master of the french school by which at serious issues the guarding of the line can be more quickly done as for instance the parade de septime supplanting the slower parade de prime the parade de quarte having advantage over the parade de quince the parade de tierce being readier and stronger than the parade de sixte the same said for the parade de seconde instead of the weak parade doctave these were then new points of instruction weyburn demonstrated them as neatly as he could do with his weapon yes the french think lord ormont said grasping the stick to get conviction of thumbstrength and fingerstrength from the parades advocated their steel would thread the ribs of our louts before they could raise a cry of parry so here they re pleased to sneer at fencing as if it served no purpose but the duel fencing for one thing means that with a good stick in his hand a clever fencer can double up a giant or two grant him choice of ground some of our men box but the swords the weapon for an officer and precious few of em are fit for more than to kick the scabbard slashing comes easier to them a plaguey cut if it does cutsay one in six navy too their cutlassdrill is like a womans fling of the arm to fetch a slap from behind her shoulder pinking beats chopping these english ll have their lesson it s like what you call good writing the simple way does the business and thats the most difficult to learn because you must give your head to it as those french fellows do trop de finesse is rather their fault anythings better than loutishness well the lesson ll come he continued he spoke as he thought he was not speaking what he was thinking his mind was directed on the visit of aminta to lady de culme and the tolerably wonderful twist whereby mrs lawrence finchley had vowed herself to his girls interests and he blamed neither of them only he could not understand how it had been effected for aminta and mrs lawrence had not been on such particularly intimate terms last week or yesterday his ejaculation women was as he knew merely ignorance roaring behind a mask of sarcasm but it allied him with all previous generations on the male side and that was its virtue his view of the shifty turns of women got no further for the reason that he took small account of the operations of the feelings to the sole exercise of which he by system condemned the sex he was also insensibly half a grain more soured by the homage of those poor schoolboys who called to him to take it for his reward in a country whose authorities had snubbed whose parliament had ignored whose press had abused him the ridiculous balance made him wilfully oblivious that he had seen his name of late eulogized in articles and in books for the right martial qualities can a country treating a good soldiernot serving it for payin so scurvy a fashion be struck too hard with our disdain one cannot tell it in too plain a language how one despises its laws its moralities its sham of society the club some choice anecdotists two or three listeners to his dolences clothed as diatribes a rubber and the sight of his girl at home composed with a weeks shooting now and then his round of life now that she refused to travel what a life for a soldier in his vigour weyburn was honoured by the earls company on the walk to chiallos in the street of elegant shops they met lord adderwood and he as usual appeared in the act of strangling one of his flock of yawns with gentlemanly consideration for the public exercise was ever his temporary specific for these incurables flinging off his coat he cast away the cynic style engendering or engendered by them he and weyburn were for a bout sir john randeller and mr morsfield were at it like bull in training and desperado foiled a french maitre darmes famed in escrime standing near captain chiallo looked amused in the eyes behind a mask of professional correctness he had come on an excursion for the display of his art sir johns very sturdy defence was pierced weyburn saluted the frenchman as an acquaintance and they shook hands chatted criticized nodded presently he and his adversary engaged vizored and in their buckram and he soon proved to be too strong for adderwood as the latter expected and had notified to lord ormont before they crossed the steel my lord had a pleasant pricking excitement in the sound there was a pretty display between weyburn and the escrimeur who neatly and kindly trifled took a point and returned one and at the finish complimented him the earl could see that he had to be sufficiently alert age mouthed an ugly word to the veteran insensible of it in his body when a desire to be one with these pairs of nimble wrists and legs was like an old gamecock shown the pit and put back into the basket he left the place carrying away an image of the coxcombical attitudinizing of the man morsfield at the salut upon which he brought down his powers of burlesque my lord sketched the scene he had just quitted to a lady who had stopped her carriage she was the still beautiful mrs amy may wife of the famous fighting captain her hair was radiant in a shady street her eyelids tenderly toned round the almond enclosure of blue pebbles bright as if shining from the seawash the lips of the fair woman could be seen to say that they were sweet when laughing or discoursing they gave sight of teeth proudly her own rivalling the regularity of the grin of dentistry a venus of nature was melting into a venus of art and there was a decorous concealment of the contest and the anguish in the process for which lord ormont liked her well enough to wink benevolently at her efforts to cheat the world at various issues and maintain her duel with time the world deserved that she should beat it even if she had been all deception she let the subject of mr morsfield pass without remark from her until the exhaustion of openair topics hinted an end of their conversation and she said we shall learn next week what to think if the civilians i have heard mr morsfield tell that he is de premiere force be on your guard you are to know that i never forget a service and you did me one once you have reason said the earl if anybody is the dragon to the treasure he covets he is a spadassin who wont hesitate at provocations adieu lord ormonts eye had been on mr morsfield he had seen what mrs pagnell counselled her niece to let him see he thanked mr morsfield for a tonic that made him young with anticipations of bracing and he set his head to work upon an advance halfway to meet the gentleman and safely exclude his wifes name monday brought an account of cupers boys aminta received it while the earl was at his papers for the mornings news of the weightier deeds of men they were the right boys weyburn said his interview with gowen bench parsons and the others assured him that the school was breathing big lungs mr cuper too had spoken well of them you walked the twenty miles aminta interrupted him with my german friend out and home plenty of time in the day he has taken to english boys but asks why enthusiasm and worship of great deeds dont grow upward from them to their elders and i in turn ask why germans insist on that point more even than the french do germans are sentimental but the english boys he saw belonged to a school with traditions of enthusiasm sown by some one the school remembered curiously mr cuper tells me the hero of the school has dropped and sprung up stout as ever twiceit tells me what i wish to believesince lord ormont led their young heads to glory he cant say how it comes the traditions there and it s kindled by some flying spark they remember who taught the school to think of lord ormont i m a minor personage i certainly did some good and that s a push forward they speak of you it was aminta more than the countess of ormont speaking to him you take an interest in the boys he said glowing yes well they have their talks i happened to be a cricketer counting wickets and scores i dont fancy its remembered that it was i preached my lord a day of nine wickets and one catch doesnt die out of a school the boy gowen was the prime spirit in getting up the subscription for the laundress but bench and parsons are good boys too he described them dwelt on them the enthusiast when not lyrical is perilously near to boring aminta was glad of mrs lawrences absence she had that feeling because matthew weyburn would shun talk of himself to her not from a personal sense of tedium in hearing of the boys and she was quaintly reminded by suggestions coming she knew not whence of a dim likeness between her and these boys of the school when their hero dropped to nothing and sprang up again brilliantlya kind of distant cousinship in her susceptibility to be kindled by so small a flying spark as this one on its travels out of high brent moreover the dear boys tied her to her girlhood and netted her fleeting youth for the mothbox she pressed to hear more and more of them and of the schoollaundress weyburn had called to see and particularly of the child little jane aged six weyburn went to look at the sheet of water to which little jane had given celebrity over the county the girl stood up to her shoulders when she slid off the bank and made the line for her brother to hold he in the water as well altogether cupers boys were justified in promoting a subscription the mother being helpless modest little woman he said of jane well hope people wont spoil her dont forget lady ormont that the brother did his part he had more knowledge of the danger than she you will undertake to convey our subscriptions lord ormont spoke of the little ones and the schoolboys yesterday ill be down again among them next sunday lady ormont on the monday i go to olmer the girls of high brent subscribe there was a ripple under weyburns gravity messrs gowen bench and parsons thought proper to stop miss vincent at the head of her detachment in the park on the sunday and one of them handed her a paper containing a report of their interview with mrs coop and a neat eulogy of little jane but dont suspect them i beg i believe them to be good honest fellows bench they say is religious gowen has written verses parsons generally harumscarum theyre boyish in one way or another and thatll do the cricket of the school has been low seems to be reviving mr weyburn said the countess after a short delayand aminta broke throughit pleases me to hear of them and think they have not forgotten you or at least they follow the lead you gave i should like to know whether an idea i have is true is much i mean constant looking down on young people likely to pull ones mind down to their level likely enough to betray our level if there s danger he murmured society offers an example that your conjecture is not unfounded lady ormont but if we have great literature and an interest in the worlds affairs can there be any fear of it the schoolmaster ploughs to make a richer world i hope he must live with them join with them in their games accustom them to have their heads knocked with what he wants to get into them leading them all the while as the bigger schoolfellow does if he is a good fellow he has to be careful not to smell of his office doing positive good is the business of his every dayon a small scale but it s positive if he likes his boys avaunt favouritism he must like all boys and it s human nature not so far removed from the dog only its a supple human nature there s the beauty of it we train it nothing is more certain than that it will grow upward i have the belief that i shall succeed because i like boys and they like me it always was the case i know said aminta their eyes met she looked moved at heart behind that deep forest of her chestnut eyes and i think i can inspire confidence in fathers and mothers he resumed i have my boys already waiting for me to found the school i was pleased the other day an english friend brought an italian gentleman to see me and discuss my system up at norwood at my mothersa signor calliani he has a nephew the parents dote on him the uncle confesses that the boy wantshe has got hold of our wordpluck we had a talk he has promised to send me the lad when i am established in switzerland when said aminta a relative from whom a reversion comes is near the end it wont be later than september that i shall go my swiss friend has the school and would take me at once before he retires you make friends wherever you go said aminta why shouldnt everybody im convinced its because i show people i mean well and i never nurse an injury great or small and besides they see i look forward i do hope good for the world if at my school we have all nationalitiesfrench boys and german italian russian spaniardwithout distinction of race and religion and station and with english intermixingenglish games english sense of honour and conception of gentlemanwe shall help to nationalize europe emile grenat adolf fleischer and an italian vincentino chiuse are prepared to start with me and they are men of attainments they will throw up their positions they will do me the honour to trust to my leadership its not scaling alps or commanding armies true it may be better said aminta and thought as she spoke slow work if we have a taste for the work doesnt dispirit otherwise one may say that an african or south american traveller has a more exciting time i shall manage to keep my head on its travels you have ideas about the education of girls they cant be carried out unaided aid will come weyburns confidence high though it was had not mounted to that pitch one may find a mate he said the woman to share and practically to aid in developing such ideas is not easily found that he left as implied aminta was in need of poetry but the young schoolmasters plain welldirected prose of the view of a business in life was welcome to her lord ormont entered the room she reminded him of the boys of high brent and the heroine jane he was ready to subscribe his fiveandtwenty guineas he said the amount of the sum gratified weyburn she could see she was proud of her lord and of the boys and the little girl and she would have been happy to make the ardent young schoolmaster aware of her growing interest in the young the night before the earls departure on the solitary expedition to which she condemned him he surprised her with a visit of farewell so that he need not disturb her in the early morning he said she was reading beside her open jewelbox and she closed it with the delicate touch of a hand turned backward while listening to him with no sign of nervousness chapter xiii war at olmer lively doings were on the leap to animate weyburn at olmer during easter week the rev mr hamptonevey rector of barborough on hearing that lady charlotte eglett was engaged in knocking at the doors of litigation with certain acts that constituted distinct breaches of the law and the peace and were a violation of the rights of her neighbour mr gilbert addicote might hope that the troublesome parishioner whom he did not often number among his congregation would grant him a term of repose therein he was deceived alterations and enlargements of the church much required had necessitated the bricking up of a door regarded by the lady as the private entrance to the olmer pew she sent him notice of her intention to batter at the new brickwork so there was the prospect of a pewfight before him but now she came to sit under him every sunday and he could have wished her absent for she diverted his thoughts from piety to the selections of texts applicable in the case of a woman who sat with arms knotted and the frown of an intemperate schoolgirl forbidden speech while her pews firelight startlingly at intervals danced her sinister person into view as from below the ladys inaccessible and unconquerable obtuseness to exhortation informed the picture with an evil spirit that cried for wrestlings regularly every weekday she headed the war now rageing between olmer and addicotes on the borders of the estates it was open war and herself to head the cavalry weyburn driving up a lane in the gig she had sent to meet the coach beheld a thicket of countrymen and boys along a ridge and it swayed and broke and through it burst the figure of a mounted warrior woman at the gallop followed by what bore an appearance of horse and gun minus carriage drivers at the flanks cracking whips on foot off went the train across a small gorse common through a gate thats another down said his whip sound good wood it is not made to fall her ladyships at it hard today she ll teach mr addicote a thing or two about things females can do that is when they stand for their rights he explained to weyburn that mr addicote a yeoman farmer and a good hunting man but a rare obstinate one now learning his lesson from her ladyship was in dispute with her over rights of property on a stretch of firtrees lining the ridge where the estates of olmer and addicotes met her ladyship had sworn that if he did not yield to her claim she would cut down every tree of the ridge and sell the lot for timber under his nose she acted according to her oath in the teeth of his men two feet across the border all the world knew the roots of those trees were for the most part in olmer soil though addicote shared the shade all the people about mourned for the felling of those trees all blamed mr gilbert addicote for provoking her ladyship good hunting man though he was but as to the merits of the question under the magnifier of the gentlemen of the law there were as many different opinions as wigs in the land and your opinion said weyburn to which the young groom answered oh i dont form an opinion sir i m of my mistresss opinion and if she says do it think as we like done it has to be lady charlotte came at a trot through the gate to supervise the limberingup of another felled tree she headed it as before the log dragged bounding and twirling rattling its chains the crowd along the ridge forbidden to cheer watching it with intense repression of the roar we have not often in england sight of a great lady challengeing an unpopular man to battle and smacking him in the face like this to provoke him weyburn was driven on a halfcircle of the lane to the gate where he jumped out to greet lady charlotte trotting back for another smack in the face of her enemya third rounding of her troy with the vanquished dead at her heels as weyburn let a flimsy suggestion beguile his fancy until the homeric was overwhelming even to a playful mind and he put her in a mediaeval frame she really had the heroical aspect in a grandiosegrotesque fitted to some lines of ariosto her head wore a close hood disclosing a fringe of grey locks owlish to see about features hooked for action ah you there you are goodill join you in three minutes she sang out to him and cantered to the ridge hardly beyond the stated number she was beside him again ranging her steed for the victim log to dance a gyration on its branches across the lane and enter a field among the fallen compeers one of her men had run behind her she slid from her saddle and tossed him the reins catching up her skirts that means war as much as theyll have it in england she said seeing his glance at the logs my husbands wise enough to leave it to me so i save him trouble with neighbours an ass of a mr gilbert addicote dares us to make good our claim on our property our timber because half a score of firtree roots go stretching on to his ground she swished her whip mr gilbert addicote received the stroke and retired a buried subject they walked on at an even pace you ll see leo tomorrow he worships you you may as well give him a couple of hours coaching a day for the week hell be hanging about you and you wont escape him well and my brother rowsley how is lord ormont he never comes to me now sincewell it s nothing to me but i like to see my brother she cant make any change here olmer and lady charlotte s bosom were both implied what do you thinkyou ve noticed is he in good health it s the last thing he ll be got to speak of weyburn gave the proper assurances not he said she hes never ill men beat women in the long race if they havent overdone it when young my doctor wants me to renounce the saddle he says it s time not if i ve got work for horseback she nicked her head emphatically i hate old age they shant dismount me till a blow comes hate it but i should despise myself if i showed signs like a worm under heel let nature do her worst she cant conquer us as long as we keep up heart you wont have to think of that for a good time yet now tell me why lord ormont didnt publish the plan for the defence you said he was writing and he was i know he wrote it and he finished it you made the fair copy well and he read itthere see she took the invisible sheets in her hands and tore them thats my brother hes so proud it would have looked like asking the country that injured him to forgive him i wish it had been printed but whatever he does i admire thatshe might have advised if she d been a woman of public spirit or cared for his reputation he never comes near me did she read your copy the question was meant for an answer weyburn replied lady ormont had no sight of it ah shes lady ormont to the servants i know she has an aunt living in the house if my brothers a sinner and theres punishment for him he has it from that aunt pag something he bears with her he s a spartan she s his pack on his back for what she covers and the game he plays it looks just tolerably decent with her in the house she goes gabbling a story about our embassy at madrid to preserve propriety as they call it her niece doesnt stoop to any of those tricks i m told i like her for that weyburn was roused i think you would like lady ormont if you knew her my lady the chances of my liking the young woman are not in the dicebox you call her lady ormont you are not one of the servants dont call her lady ormont to me it is her title lady charlotte she let fly a broadside at him you are one of the womans dupes i thought you had brains how can you be the donkey not to see that my brother rowsley lord ormont would never let a woman lawfully bearing his name go running the quadrille over london in couples with a lady staines and a mrs lawrence finchley lord adderwood and that man morsfield who boasts of your lady ormont and does it unwhippedtell me why pooh you must be the poorest fool born to suppose it possible my brother would allow a man like that man morsfield to take his wifes name in his mouth a second time have you talked much with this young person with lady ormont i have had the honour occasionally stick to the title and write yourself plushbreech cant you be more than a footman try to be a man of the world youre old enough for that by now i know she s goodlooking the whole tale hangs on that you neednt be singing me mooncalf hymn tunes of lady ormont lady ormont solemn as a parsons clerk the young woman brought good looks to market and she got the exchange she had a right to expect but it s not my brother rowsleys title she has gotexcept for footmen and tradesmen when theres a true countess of ormont unless my brother has cut himself from his family not he hes not mad they passed through olmer parkgates lady charlotte preceded him and she turned waiting for him to rejoin her he had taken his flagellation in the right style neither abashed nor at sham crow he was easy ready to converse on any topic he kept the line between supple courtier and sturdy independent and he was a pleasant figure of a young fellow thinking which a reminder that she liked him drew her by the road of personal feeling as usual with her to reflect upon another and a younger womans observing and necessarily liking him too you say you fancy i should like the person you call lady ormont i believe you would my lady are her manners agreeable perfect no pretension ah she sings playsall that she plays the harp and sings you have heard her twice she didnt set you mewing i dont remember the impulse at all events it was restrained she would me but im an old woman i detest their squalling and strumming i can stand it with italians on the boards they dont stop conversation she was present at that fencing match where you plucked a laurel i had an account of it i cant see the use of fencing in this country younger women can i dare say now look if were to speak of her i cant call her lady ormont and i dont want to hear you give me her christian name it isweyburn found himself on a slope without a stayaminta lady charlottes eye was on him he felt intolerably hot his vexation at the betrayal of the senseless feeling made it worse a conscious crimson aminta said she rather in the style of cupers boys when the name was a strange one to them i remember my italian master reading out a poem when i was a girl i read poetry then you wouldnt have imagined that i did and liked it i hate old age it changes you so none of my children know me as i was when i had life in me and was myself and my brother rowsley called me cooey they think me a hard old woman i was cooey through the woods and over the meadows and down stream to rowsley old age is a prison wall between us and young people they see a miniature head and bust and think it a flatterywont believe it after i married i came to understand that the world we are in is a world to fight in or under we go but i pity the young who have to cast themselves off and take up arms young women above all why had she no pity for aminta weyburn asked it of his feelings and he had the customary insurgent reply from them you havent seen steignton yet she continued no place on earth is equal to steignton for me it s got the charm here at olmer im a mother and a grandmotherthe devil of an oldwoman my neighbours take me to be she hasnt been to steignton either no and wont go there though shes working her way round she supposes hell do everything for his aminta but he wont take her to steignton im

louder the more they seem to be pushing him into a corner untili know my brother rowsleyand poor dear fellow a man like that the best cavalry general england ever hadtheyll remember it when there comes a cry for a general from india thats the way with the english only their necessities teach them to be justhe to be reduced to be outmanoeuvring a swarm of womeni tell them not before my brother rowsley comes to me for what he handed to my care and i keep safe for him will i believe he has made or means to make his aminta countess of ormont they were at the steps of the house turning to weyburn there the inexhaustible lady charlotte remarked that their conversation had given her pleasure leo was hanging on to one of his hands the next minute a small girl took the other philippa and beatrice were banished damsels lady charlottes breath had withered the aspect of amintas fortunes weyburn could forgive her for he was beginning to understand her he could not pardon her brother rowsley who loomed in his mind incomprehensible and therefore black once he had thought the great general a great man he now regarded him as a mere soldier a soured veteran socially as a masker and a trifler virtually a callous angler playing his cleverlyhooked fish for pastime what could be the meaning of lady charlottes that man morsfield who boasts of your lady ormont and does it unwhipped weyburn stopped his questioning with the reflection that he had no right to recollect her words thus accurately the words however stamped morsfields doings and sayings and postures in the presence of aminta with significance when the ladies were looking on at the fencers morsfields perfect coxcombry had been noticeable he knew the art of airing a fine figure mrs lawrence finchley had spoken of it and aminta had acquiesced in the gravely simple manner of women who may be thinking of it much more intently than the vivacious prattler aminta confessed to an admiration of masculine physical beauty the picador matador of the spanish ring called up an undisguised glow that english ladies show coldly when they condescend to let it be seen as it were a line or two of colour on the wintriest of skies she might after all at heart be one of the leisured jewelled prettywinged the spending never harvesting world she claimed and sought to enter and what a primitive world it wasworld of the glittering beast and the not too swiftly flying prey the savage passions clothed in silk surely desire to belong to it writes us poor creatures mentally she could hardly be maturer than the heroworshipping girl in the procession of miss vincents young seminarists probably so but she carried magic she was of the order of women who walk as the goddesses of old bearing the gift divine and by the way she had the step of the goddess weyburn repeated to himself the favourite familiar line expressive of the glorious walk and accused lord ormont of being in cacophonous accordance with the perpetual wrong of circumstance he her possessor the sole person of her sphere insensible to the magic she bore so ran his thought the young man chose to conceive that he thought abstractedly he was in truth often casting about for the chances of his meeting on some fortunate day the predestined schoolmasters wife a lady altogether praiseworthy for carrying principles of sound government instead of magic consequently susceptible to womans graces though he knew himself to be lady ormonts share of them hung in the abstract for him his hopes were bent on an early escape to switzerland and his lifes work lady charlotte mounted to ride to the battle daily she talked of her brother rowsley and of aminta and provoked an advocacy of the countess of ormont and trampled the pleas and defences to dust much in the same tone as on the first day sometimes showing a peep of sweet humaneness like the ripe berry of a bramble and at others rattling thunder at the wretch of a woman audacious enough to pretend to a part in her brothers title not that she had veneration for titles she considered them a tinsel and the devotee on his kneecaps to them a lump for a kick adding of course i stand for my class and if we cant have a manlier peopleand it s not likely in a country treating my brother so badlywell then let things go on as they are but it was the pretension to a part in the name of ormont which so violently offended the democratic aristocrat and caused her to resent it as an assault on the family honour by a woman springing up out of nothinga woman of no distinctive birth she was rational in her fashion or weyburn could at least see where and how the reason in her took a twist the rev mr hamptonevey would not see it he was in charity to her ladyship of a totally contrary opinion he informed weyburn the laborious pastor and muchenduring churchman met my ladys apologist as he was having a swing of the legs down the lanes before breakfast and he fell upon a series of complaints which were introduced by a declaration that he much feared her ladyship would have a heavy legal bill to pay for taking the law into her hands up at addicotes her ladyship might if she pleased he said encourage her domestics and her husbands tenants and farmlabourers to abandon the church for the chapel and go as she had done and threatened to do habitually to the chapel herself but to denounce the ritual of the orthodox church under the denomination of barbarous to say of the invoking supplications of the service that they wereshe had been heard to state it more or less publicly and repeatedlysuitable to abject ministers and throngs at the court of an indian rajah that he did not hesitate to term highly unbecoming in a lady of her station subversive and unchristian the personal burdens inflicted on him by her ladyship he prayed for patience to endure he surprised weyburn in speaking of lady charlotte as educated and accomplished she was rather more so than weyburn knew and more so than was common among the great ladies of her time weyburn strongly advised the reverend gentleman on having it out with lady charlotte in a personal interview he sketched the great ladys combative character on a foundation of benevolence and stressed her tolerance for open dealing and the advantage gained by personal dealings with herafter a mauling or two his language and his illustrations touched an oldschool chord in the rev mr hamptonevey who hummed over the project profoundly disrelishing the introductory portion do me the honour to call and see me tomorrow after breakfast before her ladyship starts for the fray on addicote heights weyburn said and i will ask your permission to stand by you her bark is terrific we know and she can bite but theres no venom finally on a heave of his chest mr hamptonevey consented to call in the interests of peace weyburn had said it must be man to man with her facing her and taking steps and although the prospect was unpleasant to repulsiveness it was a cheerful alternative beside mr hamptoneveys experiences and anticipations of the malignant black power her ladyship could be when she was not faced let the man come said lady charlotte her shoulders intimated readiness for him she told weyburn he might be presentinsisted to have him present during the day weyburn managed to slide in observations on the favourable reports of mr hamptoneveys work among the pooremollient doses that irritated her to fret and paw as at a checking of her onset in the afternoon the last disputed tree on the addicotes ridge was felled and laid on olmer ground riding with weyburn and the joyful leo she encountered mr eglett and called out the news he remarked in the tone of philosophy proper to a placable country gentleman obedient to government on foreign affairs now for the next act but no more horseback now mind she muttered of not recollecting a promise he repeated the interdict weyburn could fancy seeing her lips form words of how she hated old age he had been four days at olmer always facing her man to man in the matter of lady ormont not making way at all but holding firm and winning respectful treatment they sat alone in her private room where without prelude she discharged a fiery squib at impudent hussies caught up to the saddlebow of a hero for just a canter and pretending to a permanent seat beside him you have only to see lady ormont you will admit the justice of her claim my lady said he and as evidently he wanted a fight she let him have it you try to provoke me you take liberties you may call the woman aminta ive told you you insult me when you call the woman by my family name pardon me my lady i have no right to call lady ormont aminta youve never done so eh say she had him at the edge of the precipice he escaped by saying her christian name was asked the other day and i mentioned it she is addressed by me as lady ormont and by her groom and her footman they all do it s the indemnity to that class of young woman her linendraper is ladyormonting as you do i took you for a gentleman let me hear you give her that title again you shall hear her true one that the world fits her with from me the time was near the halfhour bell before dinner the situation between them that of the fall of the breath to fetch words electrical she left it to him to begin the fight and was not sorry that she had pricked him for it a footman entered the room bearer of a missive for mr weyburn lord ormonts groom had brought it from london send in the man said lady charlotte weyburn read the countess of ormont begs mr weyburn to return instantly there has been an accident in his home it may not be very serious an arma shock to the system from a fall messenger informs her fear of internal hemorrhage best doctors in attendance he handed lady charlotte the letter she humped at the first line flashed across the remainder and in a lowered voice asked sister in the house my mother weyburn said the groom appeared he knew nothing the countess had given him orders to spare no expense on the road to olmer without a minutes delay he had ridden and driven he looked worn lady charlotte rang the bell for her butler to him she said see that this man has a good feed of meat any pastry you have and a bottle of port wine he has earned a pipe of tobacco make up a bed for him despatch at once any one of the stableboys to loughtonthe dolphin mr leeman there will have a chariot fly gig anything readyhorsed in three hours from now see empson yourself he will put my stepper

you understand mrs maples will pack a basket for the journey she will judge add a bottle of the waterloo bordeaux wait a dozen of mr egletts cigars brisk with all the orders go she turned to weyburn you pack your portmanteau faster than a servant will do it he ran upstairs she was beside the tray to welcome and inspirit his eating and she performed the busy butlers duty in pouring out wine for him it was a toned old burgundy happy in the year of its birth the grandest of instruments to roll the gambolmarch of the dionysiaca through the blood of this frame and sound it to the spirit she spoke no word of his cause for departure he drank and he felt what earth can do to cheer one of her stricken children and strengthen the beat of a heart with a dread like a shot in it she while he flew supporting the body of his most beloved to the sun of life in brighter hope reckoned the stages of his journey leeman at loughton will post you through the night to mersley wherever you bait it is made known that you come from olmer and are one of us that passes you on up to london where can lord ormont be now in paris still in paris he leaves her she did well to send as she did you will not pay for the posting along the road i will pay for myselfi have a purse weyburn said and continued oh my lady there is mr hamptonevey tomorrow morning i promised to stand by him ill explain said lady charlotte he shall not miss you if he strips the parson and comes as a man and a servant of the poor he has nothing to fear youve done the night before my brother rowsleys first duel i sat with him at supper and poured his wine out and knew what was going to happen didnt say a word no use in talking about feelings besides death is only the other side of the ditch and one or other of us must go foremost now then goodbye empsons waiting by this time mr eglett and leo shall hear the excuses from me think of anything you may want while i count ten she held his hand he wanted her to be friendly to lady ormont but could not vex her at the last moment touched as he was by her practical kindness she pressed his hand and let it go chapter xiv old lovers new friends the cottage inhabited by weyburns mother was on the southern hills over london he reached it late in the afternoon his mothers old servant martha spied the roadway at the gate of the small square of garden her steady look without welcome told him the scene he would meet beyond the door and was the dead in her eyes he dropped from no height he stood on a level with the blow his apprehensions on the road had lowered him to meet it too late martha shes in heaven my dear she is lying alone the london doctor left half an hour back shes gone slipped and fell coming from her room all the way down she prayed for grace to see her son she ll watch over him be sure you ll not find it lone and cold a lady sits with itlady ormont they call hera very kind lady my mistress liked her voice ever since news of the accident up to ten at night and never eats or drinks more than a poor tiny bit of breadandbutter with a teacup weyburn went upstairs aminta sat close to the bedside in a darkened room they greeted silently he saw the white shell of the life that had flown he took his mothers hand and kissed it and knelt clasping it fear of disturbing his prayer kept aminta seated death was a stranger to him the still warm halfcold nerveless hand smote the fact of things as they were through the prayer for things as we would have them the vitality of his prayer was the sole light he had it drew sustainment from the dead hand in his grasp and cowered down to the earth claiming all we touch he tried to summon vision of a soaring spirituality he could not his understanding and senses were too stricken he prayed on his prayer was as a little fountain not rising high out of earth and in the clutch of death but its being it had from death his love gave it food prayer is power within us to communicate with the desired beyond our thirsts the goodness of the dear good mother gone was in him for assurance of a breast of goodness to receive her whatever the nature of the eternal secret may be the good life gone lives on in the mind the bad has but a life in the body and that not lastingit extends dispreads it worms away it perishes need we more to bid the mind perceive through obstructive flesh the god who reigns a devil vanquished be certain that it is the pure mind we set to perceive the god discerned in thought is another than he of the senses and let the prayer be as a little fountain rising on a spout from dread of the hollow below the prayer may be prolonged in words begetting words and have a pulse of fervour the spirit of it has fallen after the first jet that is the delirious energy of our craving which has no life in our souls we do not get to any heaven by renouncing the mother we spring from and when there is an eternal secret for us it is befit to believe that earth knows to keep near her even in our utmost aspirations weyburn still knelt he was warned to quit the formal posture of an exhausted act by the thought that he had come to reflect upon how he might be useful to his boys in a like calamity having risen he became aware that for some time of his kneeling amintas hand had been on his head and they had raised their souls in unison it was a souls link they gazed together on the calm rapt features they passed from the room i cannot thank you he said oh no i have the reason for gratitude said she i have learnt to know and love her and hope i may imitate when my time is near she at the last peacefully no pain the breath had not left her very long before you came i said i cannot but i must do not not in speech then they went into the tasteful little sittingroom below where the stillness closed upon them as a consciousness of loss you have comforted her each day he said it has been my one happiness i could not wish for better than for her to have known you say that for me i have gained she left her last words for you with me they were love love pride in her son thanks to god for having been thought worthy to give him birth she was one of the noble women of earth she was your mother let me not speak any more i think i will now go i am rarely given to these the big drops were falling you have not ordered your carriage it brings me here i find my way home alone i like the independence at night too nothing harmed me now it is daylight a letter arrived for you from high brent this morning i forgot to bring it yesterday two of your pupils called here martha saw them her naming of the old servant familiarly melted him you will not bear to hear praise or thanks if i deserved them i should like you to call on dr buxton he will tell you more than we can he drove with me the first day after i had sent you the local doctors report i had it from the messenger his assistant weyburn knew dr buxtons address he begged her to stay and take some nourishment ventured a remark on her wasted look it is poor fare in cottages i have been feeding on better than bread and meat she said i should have eaten if i had felt appetite my looks will recover such as they are i hope i have grown out of them they are a large part of the bondage of women you would like to see me safe into some conveyance go upstairs for a few minutes i will wait here he obeyed her passing from the living to the dead from the dead to the living they were united in his heart her brevity of tone and her speech so practical upon a point of need under a crisis of distress reminded him of lady charlotte at the time of the grooms arrival with her letter aminta was in no hurry to drive she liked walking and looking down on london she said my friend and schoolmate selina collett comes to me at whitsuntide we have taken a house on the upper thames above marlow you will come and see us if you can be persuaded to leave your boys we have a boathouse and a bathingplank for divers the stream is quiet there between rich meadows it seems to flow as if it thought i am not poetical i tell you only my impression you shall be a great deal by yourself as men prefer to be as men are forced to bei beg said he division is against my theories we might help if we understood one another i have often fancied i know something of your theories i should much like to hear you some day on the scheme of the school in switzerland and also on the schoolmasters profession she whom we have lost was full of it and spoke of it to me as much as her weakness would permit the subject seemed to give her strength she has always encouraged me said weyburn i have lost her but i shall feel that she is not absent she had ideas of her own about men and women some she mentioned and about marriage that too aminta shook herself out of a sudden stupor her mind was very clear up to the last hour upon all the subjects interesting her son she at one time regretted his not being a soldier for the sake of his fathers memory then she learned to think he could do more for the world as the schoolmaster she said you can persuade we had our talks she would have the reason if she was to be won i like no other kind of persuasion i long to talk over the future school with you that is to hear your plans they were at the foot of the hill in view of an inn announcing livery stables she wished to walk the whole distance he shook his head the fly was ready for her soon and he begged to see her safe home she refused after taking her seat but said at any other time we are old friends you will really go through the ceremony of consulting me about the school he replied i am honoured ah not to me said aminta we will be the friends weyou will not be formal with menot from this day she put out her hand he took it gently the dead who had drawn them together withheld a pressure holding the hand he said i shall crave leave of absence for some days i shall see you on the day said she if it is your desire i will send word we both mourn at heart we should be in company adieu their hands fell apart they looked the old school time was in each mind they saw it as a shorebank in grey outline across morning mist years were between and there was a division of circumstance more repelling than an abyss or the rush of deep wild waters neither of them had regrets under their cloud and with the grief they shared they were as happy as two could be in recovering one another as friends on the day of the funeral aminta drove to the spot where they had partedshe walked to the churchyard she followed the coffin to its gravelheap wishing neither to see nor be seen only that she might be so far attached to the remains of the dead and the sense of blessedness she had in her bowed simplicity of feeling was as if the sainted dead had cleansed and anointed her when the sods had been cast on the last word spoken she walked her way back happy in being alone unnoticed she was grateful to the chief mourner for letting her go as she had come that helped her to her sense of purification the haven out of the passions hardly less quiet than the repose into which the dear dead woman his mother had entered london lay beneath her the might of the great hive hummed at the verge of her haven of peace without disturbing there she had been what none had known of her an ambitious girl modest merely for lack of intrepidity paralyzed by her masterful lord aiming her highest at a gilt weathercock and a disappointed creature her breast a home of serpents never herself she thought and hoped she was herself now alarm lest this might be another of her moods victim of moods as she had latterly been was a shadow armed with a dart playing round her to find the weak spot it sprang from her acknowledged weakness of nature and she cast about for how to keep it outside her and lean on a true though a small internal support she struck at her desires to sound them they were yesterday for love partly for distinction for a woman having beauty to shine in the sphere of beauty but chiefly to love and be loved therefore to live she had yesterday read letters of a man who broke a music from the wordabout as much music as there is in a tuningfork yet it rang and lingered and he was not the magical musician now those letters were as dust of the road the sphere of beauty was a glass lampglobe for delirious moths she had changed belief in the real change gave her full view of the compliant coward she had been her heart assured her she had natural courage she felt that it could be stubborn to resist a softness now she cared no more for the hackneyed musical word friendship was her desire if it is not lifes poetry it is a credible prose a land of low undulations instead of alps beyond the terrors and the deceptions and she could trust her friend he who was a singular constancy his mother had told her of his preserving letters of a girl he loved when at school and of his journeys to an empty house at dover that was past but as the boy so the man would be in sincerity of feeling trustworthy to the uttermost she mused on the friend he was brave she had seen how he took his blow and sorrow as a sister conquering emotion it was not to be expected of him by one who knew him when at school had he faults he must have faults she curiously could see none after consenting to his career as a schoolmaster and seeing nothing ludicrous in it she endowed him with the young schoolheros reputation beheld him with the eyes of the girl who had loved himand burnt his old lettersbitterly regretted that she burnt his lettersand who had applauded his contempt of ushers and master opposing his individual will and the thing he thought it right to do musing thus she turned a corner on a sudden in her mind and ran against a mirror wherein a small figure running up to meet her grew large and nodded with the laugh and eyes of browny so little had she changed the stedfast experienced woman rebuked that volatile and some might say faithless girl but the girl had her answer she declared they were one and the same affirmed that the years between were a bad nights dream that her heart had been faithful that he who conjures visions of romance in a young girls bosom must always have her heart as a crisis will reveal it to her she had the volubility of the mettled browny of old and was lectured when she insisted on shouting matey matey she was angrily spurned and silenced aminta ceased to recline in her carriage an idea that an indolent posture fostered vapourish meditations counselled her sitting rigidly upright and interestedly observing the cottages and merry gutterchildren along the squat straight streets of a london suburb her dominant ultimate thought was i too can work like her courage the plea of a capacity to work appealed for confirmation to the belief which exists without demonstrated example and as she refrained from probing to the inner sources of that mental outcry it was allowed to stand and remain among the convictions we storewherewith to shape our destinies childishly indeed quite witlessly she fell into a trick of repeating the name of matthew weyburn in her breast and on her lips after the manner of isabella lawrence finchley when she had inquired for his christian name and went on murmuring it as if sucking a new bonbon with the remark it sounds nice it suits the mouth little selina collett had told aminta remembered how those funny boys at cupers could not at first get the name aminta to suit the mouth but went about making hideous faces in uttering it she smiled at the recollection and thought up to a movement of her lips one is not tempted to do that in saying matthew weyburn chapter xv showing a secret fished without angling that great couchant dragon of the devouring jaws and the withering breath known as our london world was in expectation of an excitement above yawns on the subject of a beautiful lady doubtful proposing herself through a group of infatuated influential friends to a decorous court as one among the ladies acceptable the popular version of it sharpened the sauce by mingling romance and cynicism very happily for the numerous cooks when out of the kitchen will furnish a piquant dish thus a jeweleyed girl of half english origin a wounded british officer is amiably nursed in a castle near the famous peninsula battlefield etc running wild down the streets of seville is picked up by lord ormont made to discard her tambourine brought over to our shores and allowed the decoration of his name without the legitimate adornment of his title discontented with her position after a time she now pushes boldly to claim the place which will be most effective in serving her as a bath she has by general consent beauty she must seeing that she counts influential friends have witchery those who have seen her riding and driving beside her lord speak of andalusian grace oriental lustre fit qualification for the fair slave of a notoriously susceptible old warrior she won a party in the widening gossip world and enough of a party in the regent world to make a stream pretending to be the actual countess of ormont though not publicly acknowledged as his countess by the earl she had on her side the strenuous few who knew and liked her some who were pleased compassionately to patronize all idle admirers of a shadowed beautiful woman at bay the devotees of any beauty in distress and such as had seen such as imagined they had seen such as could paint a mental picture of a lady of imposing stature persuasive appearance pathetic history and pronounce her to be unjustly treated with a general belief that she was visible and breathing she had the ready enthusiasts the responsive sentimentalists and an honest active minor number of whom not every one could be declared perfectly unspotted in public estimation however innocent under verdict of the courts of law against her was the livid cloudbank over a flowery field that has not yet spoken audible thunder the terrible aggregate social woman of mans creation hated by him dreaded scorned satirized and nevertheless upheld esteemed applauded a mark of civilization on to which our human society must hold as long as we have nothing humaner she exhibits virtue with face of waxen angel with paw of desert beast and blood of victims on it her fold is a genial climate and the material pleasures for the worlds sheepy worshipping herself she claims the sanctification of a performed religion she is gentle when unassailed going her way serenely with her malady in the blood when the skin bears witness to it she swallows an apothecary and there is a short convulsion she is refreshed by cutting off diseased inferior members the superior betraying foul symptoms she covers up and retains rationally too for they minister to her present existence and she lives all in the present her subjects are the mixed subservient among her rebellious are earths advanced who have cold a morning on their foreheads and these would not dethrone her they would but shame and purify by other methods than the druggist she loves nothing undoubtedly she dislikes the vicious on that merit she subsists the vexatious thing in speaking of her is that she compels to the use of the rhetoricians brass instrument as she is one of the powers giving life and death one may be excused this tremendous queen of the congregation has brought discredit on her sex for the scourge laid on quivering female flesh and for the flippant indifference shown to misery and to fine distinctions between right and wrong good and bad and particularly for the undiscriminating hardness upon the starved of women we forget her having been conceived in the fear of men shaped to gratify them she is their fiction of the state they would fain beguile themselves to suppose her sex has reached for their benefit where she may be queen of it in a corner certain of a loyal support if she will only give men her halftheworlds assistance to uplift the fabric comfortable to them together with assurance of paternity case of mind in absence exclusive possession enormous and minutest etc not by any means omitting a regimental orderliness from which men are privately exempt because they are men or because they are grown boysthe brisker at lessons after a vacation or a truancy says the fiction in those days the world had oscillated under higher leading than its royal laxity to rigidity tiny peccadilloes were no longer matter of jest and the sinner exposed stood sola to receive the brand a beautiful lady doubtful needed her husbands countenance if she was to take one of the permanent steps in public places the party of lady charlotte eglett called on the livid cloudbank aforesaid to discharge celestial bolts and sulphur oil on the head of an impudent underbred ambitious young slut whose arts had bewitched a distinguished nobleman not young in years at least and ensnared the remainder wits of some principal ancient ladies of the land professional puritans born conservatives malicious tattlers made up a goodly tail to lady charlottes party the epithet unbred was accredited upon the quoted sayings and doings of the pretentious young persons aunt repeated abroad by noblemen and gentlemen present when she committed herself and the same were absurd they carried a laugh and so they lived and circulated lord ormont submitted to the infliction of that horrid female in his household it was no wonder he stopped short of allying himself with the family nor was it a wonder that the naturally enamoured old warrior or invalided mars for she had the gift of beauty should deem it prudent to be out of england when she and her crazy friends determined on the audacious move or put it the other wayfor it is just as confounding right side or leftshe and her friends take advantage of his absence to make the clever push for an establishment and socially force him to legalize their union on his return the deeds of the preceding reign had bequeathed a sort of legendary credence to the wildest tales gossip could invent under a demurrer but there was the fact the earl was away lady charlottes party buzzed everywhere her ladyship had come to town to head it her ladyship laid trains of powder from dinnerparties balls routs parkprocessions into the lord chamberlains ear and fired and exploded them deafening the grand official do you consider that virulent pagan goddesses and the flying torchfuries are extinct error of christians we have relinquished the old names and have no new ones for them but they are here inextinguishable threading the day and night air with their dire squibtrail if we would but see hissing they go and we do not hear we feel the effects upon the counsel of mrs lawrence aminta sent a letter to lord ormont at his hotel in paris informing him of the position of affairs he had delayed his return and there had been none of his brief communications she wrote as she knew as she felt coldly she was guided by others and her name was up before the world owing to some halfremembered impulsion of past wishes but her heart was numbed she was not a woman to have a wish without a beat of the heart in it for her name she had a feeling to be likened rather to the losing gamblers contemplation of a big stake he has flung and sees it gone while fortune is undecided and he catches at a philosophy nothing other than his hug of a modest little background pleasure that he has always preferred to this accursed bad habit of gambling with the luck against him reckless in the cast she was reckless of success her letter was unanswered then and day by day more strongly she felt for her name she put a false heart into it she called herself to her hearing the countess of ormont and deigned to consult the most foolish friend she could have chosenher aunt and even listened to her advice that she should run about knocking at all the doors open to her and state her case against the earl it seemed the course to take the moment for taking it was she not asked if she could now at last show she had pride her pride ran stinging through her veins like a band of freed prisoners who head the rout to fire a city she charged her lord with having designedlyoh cunningly indeed left her to be the prey of her enemies at the hour when he knew it behoved him to be her great defender there had been no disguise of the things in progress they had been spoken of allusively quite comprehensibly after the fashion common with two entertaining a secret semihostility on a particular subject one of them being the creature that blushes and is educated to be delicate reserved and timorous he was not ignorant and he had left her and he would not reply to her letter so fell was her mood that an endeavour to conjure up the scene of her sitting beside the deathbed of matthew weyburns mother failed to sober and smooth it holy though that time was the false heart she had put into the pride of her name was powerfuller than the heart in her bosom but to what end had the true heart counselled her of late it had been a home of humours and languors an impotent insurgent the sapper of her character and as we see in certain disorderly states a curative incendiarism usurp the functions of the sluggish citizen and the work of reestablishment done by destruction in peril of a total extinction amintas feverish anger on behalf of her name went a stretch to vivify and give her dulled character a novel edge she said goodbye to cowardice i have no husband to defend mei must do it for myself the peril of a too complete exercise of independence was just intimated to her perceptions on whom the blame and let the motively guilty go mourn over consequences that institution of marriage was eyed is it not a halting step to happiness it is the step of a crippleand one leg or the other poses for the feebler sexsmall is the matter which and is happiness our cry our cry is rather for circumstance and occasion to use our functions and the conditions are denied to women by marriagedenied to the luckless of women who are many very many denied to aminta calling herself countess of ormont for one denied to mrs lawrence finchley for another and in a base bad manner she had defended her good name triumphantly only to enslave herself for life or snatch at the liberty which besmirches reviewing mrs lawrence amintas real heart pressed forward at the beat in tender pity of the woman for whom a yielding to love was to sin and unwomanly is the woman who does not love men will say it aminta found herself phrasing why was she unable to love her husbandhe is not old she hurried in flight from the remark to confidences imparted by other ladies showing strange veins in an earthy world after which her mind was bent to rebuke mrs pagnell for the silly souls perpetual allusions to lord ormonts age she did not think of his age but she was vividly thinking that she was young young married loveless cramped in her energies publicly dishonoureda lady doubtful courting one friend whom she liked among women one friend whom she respected among men that was the sketch of her that was in truth the outline as much as aminta dared sketch of herself without dragging her down lower than her trained instinct would bear to look our civilization shuns nature and most shuns it in the most artificially civilized to suit the market they however are always close to their mother nature beneath their second natures mask of custom and amintas unconscious concluding touch to the sketch my husband might have helped me to a footing in society would complete it as a coloured picture if writ in tones she said it and for the footing in society she had lost her taste mrs lawrence brought the final word from high quarters that the application must be deferred until lord ormont returned to town it was known before that such would be the decision she had it from the eminent official himself and she kicked about the room setting her pretty mouth and nose to pout and sniff exactly like a boy whose chum has been mishandled by a bully your dear good man is too much for us i thought we should drive him cest un ruse homme de guerre i like him but i could slap him he stops the way upon my word he seems tolerably careless of his treasure does he suppose mrs paggy is a protection do you know shes devoted to that man morsfield he listens to her stories to judge by what he shouts aloud he intends carrying you off the first opportunity divorcing and installing you in cobeck hall all he fears is that your lord wont divorce you should have seen him the other day he marched up and down the room smacking his head and crying out legal measures or any weapons her husband pleases for he has come to believe that the lady would have been off with him long before if her lord had no claim to the marital title it s that husband i cant get over that husband he reminded me to the life of lawrence finchley with a headache the morning after a supper striding with his hand on the shining middle of his head its that welsh rabbit that welsh rabbit he has a poor digestion and he will eat cheese the welsh rabbit chased him into his bed but listen to me dear about your morsfield i told you he was dangerous he is not my morsfield said aminta beware of his having a tool in paggy he boasts of letters mine two and written to request him to cease writing to me he stops at nothing and oh my simplicity dont you see you gave him a step in begging him to retire morsfield has lived a good deal among our neighbours who expound the physiology of women he anatomizes us pulls us to pieces puts us together and then animates us with a breath of his passionsincere upon every occasion i dont doubt he spared me although he saw i was engaged perhaps it was because i m of no definite colour or he thought i was not a receptacle for passion and quite trueadder the dear good fellow has none or where should we be on a swiss alp in a chalet he shooting chamois and i milking cows with ahahio ahahio all day long and a quarrel at night over curds and whey well and that s a better old pensioners limp to his end for passion than the foreign hotel bell rung mightily and one of the two discovered with a dagger in the breast and the other a dontlook lying on the pavement under the window yes and thats better than passion splitting and dispersing upon new adventures from habit with two sparks remaining of the fire aminta took mrs lawrences hands is it a lecture she was kissed frothy gabble im really near to passion when i embrace you youre the only one i could run away with live with all alone i believe i wonder men can see you while that silly lord of yours is absent and not begin morsfielding theyre virtuous if they resist paggy tells the world well aminta had reddened what does my aunt tell the world mrs lawrence laid her smoothing hand absently on a frill of lace fichu above a sternly disciplined bosom at halfheave i think i can judge now that youre not much hurt by this wretched business of the presentation the little service i could do was a moral lesson to me on the subject of deucemaycare antecedents my brother tom too was always playing truant as a boy it s in the blood she seemed to be teasing and aminta cried my aunt let me hear she tells the world paggy ah yes only that she says the countess has an exalted opinion of mr secretarys handwritingas witnessed by his fair copy of the memoirs of course poor woman how can she talk such foolishness i guessed it you wear a dark red rose when youre guessing ma miefrench for my aminta but consider isabella mr weyburn has just had the heaviest of losses my aunt should spare mention of him matthew weyburn we both like the name mrs lawrence touched at her friend and gazed ive seen it on certain eveningscrimson over an olive sky what it forebodes i cant imagine but its the end of a lovely day they say it threatens rain if it begins one it s an ominous herald you make me said aminta i must redden if you keep looking at me so closely now frown one little bit please i love to see you i love to see a secret disclose itself ingenuously but what secret my dear cried amintas defence of her innocence and she gave a short frown have no fear mr secretary is not the man to be morsfielding and he can enjoy his repast a very good sign but is he remaining long he is going soon i hear hes a good boy i could have taken to him myself and not dreaded a worrying there s this difference between you and me though my aminta one of us has the fireplace prepared for whatshisnamepassion kiss me how could you fancy you were going to have a woman for your friend and keep hidden from her any one of the secrets that blush and with paggy to aid i am sure it means very little admiration for good handwriting is a smile broke the sentence youre astray isabella not i dear im too fond of you you read what is not what is not yet written you mean what never could be written i read what is in the blood and comes out to me when i look that lord of yours should take to study you as i have done ever since i fell in love with you he s not counselling himself well in keeping away now you speak wisely said aminta not a particle more wisely and the reason is close at handsee you are young you attracthow could it be otherwiseand you have passion sleeping and likely to wake with a spring whether roused or not in my observation goodman tother fellowthe poets friendis never long absent when the time is ripeat least not in places where we gather together well one is a buckler against the other i dont say with lovely amy maywith an honourable woman but aminta can smell powder and grow more mettlesome who can look at you and be blind to passion sleeping the sight of you makes me dream of itme a woman cool as a winecellar or a well so theres to help you to know yourself and be on your guard i know im not deceived because ive fallen in love with you and no love can be without jealousy so i have the needle in my breast that points at any one who holds a bit of you kind of sympathetic needle to the magnet behind anything youll know it if you dont now i should have felt the thing without the aid of paggy so then imagine all my nonsense unsaid and squeeze a drop or two of sirop de bon conseil out of it as if it were your own wise meditations the rest of mrs lawrences discourse was a swallows wing skimming the city stream she departed and aminta was left to beat at her heart and ask whether it had a secret but if there was one the secret was out and must have another name it had been a secret for her until she heard her friend speak those pinpoints that pricked her heart and sent the blood coursing over her face like a betrayal so like as to resemble a burning confession but if this confessed the truth she was the insanest of women no woman could be surer that she had her wits she had come to see things previously mysteries with surprising clearness as for example that passion was part of her nature therefore her very life lying tranced she certainly could not love without passion such an abandonment was the sole justification of love in a woman standing where she stood and now for the first time she saw her exact position before the world and she saw some way into her lord saw that he nursed a wound extracted balm from anything enabling him to show the world how he despised it and undesigningly immolated her for the petty gratification it could not in consequence be the truth to bear what she had borne she must be a passionless woman and she was glad of her present safety in thinking it once it was absolutely true she swam away to the goldencircled island of once landed and dwelt there solitarily and blissfully looking forward to sundays walk round the park looking back on it proudly she could tell herself that her dreams of the prince of the island had not been illusions as far as he was concerned for he had a great soul he did not aim at a tawdry glory he was a loss to our armyno loss to his country or the world a woman might clasp her feeling of pride in having foreseen distinction for him and a little too in distinguishing now the true individual distinction from the feathered uniform vulgar where the girls dreams had proved illusions she beheld in a title and luxuries in a loveless marriage that was perilous ground still it taught her to see that the substantial is the dust and passion not being active she could reflect after a series of penetrative flashes flattering to her intelligence the more startling they were reflection was exhausted she sank on her natures desire to join or witness agonistic incidents shocks wrestlings the adventures which are brilliant air to sanguine energies imagination shot tap and whirled the circle of a succession of them and she had a companion and leader unfeatured reverently obeyed accepted as not to be known not to be guessed at in the deepest hooded inmost of her being speechlessly divined the sudden result of amintas turmoil was a determination that she must look on steignton and what was to be gained by that she had no idea and how had she stopped her imaginative flight with the thought of looking on steignton all she could tell was that it would close a volume she could not say why the volume must be closed her orders for the journey down to steignton were prompt mrs pagnell had an engagement at the house of lady staines for the next day to meet titles and celebrities and it precluded her comprehension of the project she begged to have the journey postponed she had pledged her word she said to mr morsfield said aminta her aunt was astounded i did tell him we should be there my dear he appears to have a pleasure in meeting you he is one of the real gentlemen of the land you correspond with him i may not be the only one foolish aunty how can you speak to me in that senseless way cried aminta you know the schemer he is and that i have no protection from his advances unless i run the risk of bloodshed my dear aminta whenever i go into society and he is present i know i shall not be laughed at or fall into that pit of one of their dead silences worse for me to bear than titters and faces it is their way of letting one feel they are of birth above us mr morsfieldpurer blood than many of their highest titlesis always polite always deferential he helps me to feel i am not quite out of my element in the sphere i prefer we shall be travelling alone have you any fear not if nothing happens might we not ask that mr weyburn he has much work to do he will not long be here he is absent today mrs pagnell remarked i must say he earns his money easily aminta had softened herself with the allusion to the shortness of his time with them her aunts coarse hint and the thought of his loss and the banishment it would be to her all the way to steignton checked a sharp retort she could have uttered but made it necessary to hide her eyes from sight she went to her bedroom and flung herself on the bed even so little as an unspoken defence of him shook her to floods of tears chapter xvi along two roads to steignton unaccountable resolutions if impromptu and springing from the female breast are popularly taken for caprices and even when they divert the current of a history and all the more when they are very small matters producing a memorable crisis in this way does a lazy world consign discussion to silence with the cynical closure mans hoary shrug at a whimsy sex is the reading of his enigma still but ask if she has the ordinary pumping heart in that riddle of a breast and then as the organ cannot avoid pursuit we may get hold of it and succeed in spelling out that she is consequent in her fashion she is a creature of the apparent moods and shifts and tempers only because she is kept in narrow confines resembling if you like a wild cat caged amintas journey down to steignton turned the course of other fortunes besides her own and she disdained the minor adventure it was while dreaming it important and she determined eagerly on going without wanting to go and it was neither from a sense of duty nor in a spirit of contrariety that she went nevertheless with her heart in hand her movements are traceably as rational as a soldiers before the enemy or a traders matching his customer the wish to look on steignton had been spoken or sighed for during long years between aminta and her aunt until finally shame and anger clinched the subject to look on steignton for once was now amintas phrasing of her sudden resolve it appeared as a holiday relief from recent worries and it was an expedition with an aim though she had but the coldest curiosity to see the place and felt alien to it yet the thought never to have seen steignton roused phantoms of dead wishes to drive the strange engine she was faster than the living would have done her reason for haste was rationally founded on the suddenness of her resolve which seeing that she could not say she desired to go seemed to come of an external admonition and it counselled quick movements lest her inspired obedience to the prompting should as abruptly breathe itself out and in that case i shall never have seen steignton at all she said with perfect calmness and did not attempt to sound her meaning she did know that she was a magazine of a great storage of powder it banked inoffensively dry she had forgiven her lord owning the real nobleman he was in courtesy to women whom his inherited ideas of them so quaintly minimized and reduced to pretty insect or tricky reptile they too had the choice of being ultimately the one or the other in fact the latter most likely if however she had forgiven her lord the shattering of their union was the cost of forgiveness in letting him stand high as the lofty man she had originally worshipped she separated herself from him to feel that the humble she was of a different element as a running water at a mountains base they are one in the landscape they are far from one in reality amintas pride of being chafed at the yoke of marriage her aunt was directed to prepare for a start at an early hour the next morning mrs pagnell wrote at her desk and fussed and ordered the posting chariot and bewailed herself submissively for it was the countess of ormont speaking when aminta delivered commands and the only grievance she dared to mutter was the unexpectedness her letters having been despatched she was amazed in the late evening to hear aminta give the footman orders for the chariot to be ready at the door an hour earlier than the hour previously appointed she remonstrated aminta simply observed that it would cause less inconvenience to all parties a suspicion of her aunts proceedings was confirmed by the good womans flustered state she refrained from smiling she would have mustered courage to invite matthew weyburn as her escort if he had been at hand he was attending to his affairs with lawyersmainly with his friend mr abner she studied map and gazetteer till late into the night giving her orders to the postillion on the pavement in the morning she named a southwesterly direction out of london and after entering the chariot she received a case from one of the footmen what is that my dear said mrs pagnell aminta unlocked and laid it open a pair of pistols met mrs pagnells gaze we shant be in need of those things the lady said anxiously one never knows on the road aunt loaded you wouldnt hesitate to fire im sure at mr morsfield himself if he attempted to stop me mrs pagnell withdrew into her astonishment and presently asked in a tone of some indignation why did you mention mr morsfield aminta did you not write to him yesterday afternoon aunt you read the addresses on my letters did you not supply him with our proposed route and the time for starting pistols exclaimed mrs pagnell one would fancy you think we are in the middle of the last century mr morsfield is a gentleman not a highwayman he gives the impression of his being a madman the real madman is your wedded husband aminta if wedding it was it was too surely so in amintas mind she tried by looking out of the window to forget her companion the dullness of the roads and streets opening away to flat fields combined with the postillions unvarying jog to sicken her thoughts over the exile from london she was undergoing and the chance that matthew weyburn might call at a vacant house next day to announce his term of service to the earl whom he had said he much wanted to see he said it in his sharp manner when there was decision behind it several times after contemplating the end of her journey and not perceiving any spot of pleasure ahead an emotion urged her to turn back for the young are acutely reasoning when their breasts advise them to quit a road where no pleasure beckons unlike matthew weyburn the tiptoe sparkle of a happy mind did not leap from her at wayside scenes a sweep of grass distant hills clouds in flight she required since she suffered the positive of events or blessings to kindle her glow matthew weyburn might call at the house would he be disappointed he had preserved her letters of the old schooldays she had burnt his but she had not burnt the letters of mr morsfield and she cared nothing for that man assuredly she merited the stigma branding women as crackbrained yet she was not one of the fools she could govern a household and she liked work she had the capacity for devotedness so therefore she was a woman perverted by her position and she shook her bonds in revolt from marriage imagining a fall down some suddenly spied chasm of her nature she had a sisterly feeling for the women named sinful at the same time reflecting that they are sinful only with the sinful she knelt thankfully at the feet of the man who had saved her from such danger tears threatened they were a poor atonement for the burning of his younger letters but not heshe was the sufferer and she whipped up a sensation of wincing at the flames they fell to and at their void of existence committing sentimental idiocies worthy of a lovesick girl consciously to escape the ominous thought which her womans perception had sown in her that he too chafed at a marriage no marriage was true in fidelity not true through infidelity as she had come to be the thought implied misery for both she entered a black desolation with the prayer that he might not be involved for his own sake partly also on behalf of the sustaining picture the young schoolmaster at his task merry among his dear boys to trim and point them body and mind for their business in the world painted for her a weariful prospect of the life she must henceforth drag along is a woman of the plain wits common to numbers ever deceived in her perception of a mans feelings for her let her first question herself whether she respects him if she does not her judgement will go easily astray intuition and observation are equally at fault she has no key he has charmed her blood that is all but if she respects him she cannot be deceived respect is her embrace of a mans character amintas vision was clear she had therefore to juggle with the fact revealed that she might keep her heart from rushing out and the process was a disintegration of her feminine principle of docility under the worlds decrees at each pause of her mental activity she was hurled against the state of marriage compassion for her blameless fellow in misery brought a deluge to sweep away institutions and landmarks but supposing the blest worst to happen what exchange had she to bestow her beauty she was reputed beautiful it had made a madman of one man and in her poverty of endowments to be generous with she hovered over mr morsfield like a cruel vampire for the certification that she had a muchprized gift to bestow upon his rival but supposing it she would then be no longer in the shiny garden of the flowers of wealth and how little does beauty weigh as all aid to an active worker in the serious fighting world she would be a kind of potted rosetree under his arm of which he must eventually tire a very cold moment came when it seemed that even the above supposition in the case of a woman who has been married is shameful to her a sin against her lover and should be obliterated under floods of scarlet for if she has pride she withers to think of pushing the most noble of men upon his generosity and further if he is not delicately scrupulous is there not something wanting in him the very cold wave passed leaving the sentence better dream of being plain friends mrs pagnell had been quietly chewing her cud of the sullens as was the way with her after a snub she now resumed her gossip of the naughty world she knelt to and expected to see some day stricken by a bolt from overhead containing as it did such wicked members as that really indefensible brazen mrs amy may who was only the daughter of a halfpay naval captain and that marquis of collestou who would they say decorate her with his title tomorrow if her husband were but somewhere else she spread all sorts of report about mr morsfield and he was honour itself in his reserve about her depend upon it amintahe was not more than a boy then and they say she aimed at her enfranchisement by plotting the collision for his yorkshire revenues are immense and he is you know skilful in the use of arms and captain may has no resources whatever penury no one cares to speculate how they contrivebut while that dreadful duellingand my lord as bad as any in his dayexists depend upon it an unscrupulous goodlooking woman has as many lives for her look of an eye or lift of a finger as a throned ottoman turk on his divan aminta wished to dream she gave her aunt a second dose and the lady relapsed again power to dream had gone she set herself to look at roadside things cottage gardens old housewives in doorways gaffer goodman meeting his crony on the path groups of boys and girls she would take the girls matthew weyburn the boys she had lessons to give to girls she had sympathy pity anticipation that would be a life of happy service it might be a fruitful trial of the system he proposed to keep the boys and girls in company as much as possible both at lessons and at games his was the larger view her lords view appeared similar to that of her aunts throned ottoman turk on his divan matthew weyburn believed in the bettering of the world lord ormont had no belief like it presently mrs pagnell returned to the charge and once more she was nipped and irritated to declare she had never known her nieces temper so provoking aminta was launching a dream of a lass she had seen in a field near a white hawthorn standing upright her left arm aloft round the pole of a rake the rim of her bonnet tipped on her forehead an attitude of a rustic britannia with helmet heeling at dignity the girls eyes hung to the passing chariot without movement of her head it was aminta who looked back and she saw the girl looking away among the superior dames and damsels she had seen there was not one to match that figure for stately air gallant ease and splendour of pose matthew weyburn would have admired the girl aminta did better than envy she cast off the last vestiges of her bitter ambition to be a fine lady and winged into the bosom of the girl and not shyly said yes to matthew weyburn and to herself deep in herself a maid has no need to be shy hardly blushing she walks on into the new life beside him and hears him say i in my way you in yours we are equals the stronger for being equals and she quite agrees and she gives him the fuller heart for his not requiring her to be absorbedshe is the braver mate for him does not that read his meaning happiest of the girls of earth she has divined it at once from never having had the bitter ambition to be a slave that she might wear rich tissues and let herself be fettered that she might loll in idleness lose a soul to win a title escape commonplace to discover it ghastlier under cloth of gold and the animal crowned adored fattened utterly served in the class called by consent of human society the upper reason whispered a reminder of facts to her but i am not the countess of ormont she said she felt herself the girl her sensations were so intensely simple proceeding to an argument that the earl did not regard her as the countess of ormont or the ceremony at the british embassy as one serious and binding she pushed her reason too far sweet delusion waned she waited for some fresh scene to revive it aminta sat unwittingly weaving her destiny while she was thus engaged a carriage was rolling on the more westerly road down to steignton seated in it were lady charlotte eglett and matthew weyburn they had met at arthur abners office the previous day she went there straight from lord ormonts houseagent and upholsterer to have a queer bit of thunderous news confirmed that her brother was down at steignton refurnishing the house and not for letting she was excited she treated arthur abners closedvolume reticence as a corroboration of the houseagents report and hearing weyburn speak of his anxiety to see the earl immediately in order to get release from his duties proposed a seat in her carriage for down steignton way she meant to go if only as excuse for a view of the old place she kept asking what lord ormont wanted down at steignton refurnishing the house and not to let it her evasions of answers that plain speculation would supply were quaint he hasnt my feeling for steignton he could let iti couldnt sacrilege to me to have a tenant in my old home where i was born hes furnishing to raise his rent his country wont give him anything to do so he turns miser thats my brother rowsleys way of taking on old age her brother rowsley might also be showing another sign of his calamitous condition she said to weyburn in the carriage that her brother rowsley might like having his hair clipped by the philistine woman which is one of the ways of strong men to confess themselves ageing not said she with her usual keen justness not that ive a word against delilah i look upon her as a patriot she dallied and she used the scissors on behalf of her people she wasnt bound to samson in honourliked a strong man probably enough she proved she liked her country better the jews wrote the story of it so there she stands for posterity to pelt her poor wretch a tolerably good analogy for the story of men and women generally said weyburn ah well youve a right to talk you dont run miauling about women it s easy to be squashy on that subject as for the jews i dont go by their history but now they re down i dont side with the philistines or christians they re good citizens and they ve got samson in the brain too that comes of persecution a hard education they beat the world by counting in the head that s because they ve learnt the value of fractions napoleon knew it in war when he looked to the boots and greatcoats of his men those were his fractions lord ormont thinks he had too hardandfast a system for the battlefield a greater strategist than tactician my lady it may be said weyburn smiling at her skips massing his cannon to make a big hole for his cavalry my brother says and weeding his infantry for the imperial guard he postponed the moment to use at moskowa waterloo i believe lord ormont wouldthere his country s lost him and chose it they ll have their day for repentance yet what a rapture to have a thousand horsemen following you i suppose there never was a man worthy of the name who roared to be a woman i know i could have shrieked half my life through to have been born male it s no matter now when we come to this hateful old age we meet no we re no sex thenwe re dry sticks i ll tell you my olmer doctorthat s an impudent fellow who rode by staring into my carriage the windows down he could see without pushing his hat in weyburn looked out after a man cantering on a mr morsfield he said i thought it was he when i saw him go by ive met him at the fencingrooms he s one of the violent fencers good for making his point if one funks an attack that man morsfield is it i wonder what hes doing on the road here he goes over london boastinghum nothing to me but he ll find lord ormonts arm can protect a poor woman whatever she is hed have had it before only lord ormont shuns a scandal i was telling you my olmer doctor forbade horseriding and my husband raised a noise like one of my turkeycocks on the wing so i ve given up the saddle to quiet him i guessed i went yesterday morning to my london physician he sounded me pushed out his mouth and pulled down his nose recommended avoidance of excitement is it heart i said he said it was heart that was the best thing an old woman could hear he said when he saw i wasnt afraid it was likely to be quick no doctors no nurses and daily bulletins for inquirers but just the whites of the eyes the layingout the undertaker and the familyvault thats one reason why i want to see steignton before the blow that may fall any day whether my brother rowsleys there or no but that olmer doctor of mine causitt peter causitt shall pay me for being a liar or else an ignoramus when i told him he was to tell me bluntly the nature of my disease a horseman in whom they recognized mr morsfield passed clattering on the road behind them some woman here about lady charlotte muttered weyburn saw him joined by a cavalier and the two consulted and pointed whips right and left chapter xvii lady charlottes triumph one of the days of sovereign splendour in england was riding down the heavens and drawing the royal mantle of the goldfringed shadows over plain and wavy turf blue water and woods of the country round steignton a white mansion shone to a length of oblong lake that held the sunball suffused in mild yellow theres the place lady charlotte said to weyburn as they had view of it at a turn of the park she said to herselfwhere i was born and bred and her sight gloated momentarily on the house and side avenues a great plane standing to the right of the house the sparkle of a little river running near all the scenes she knew all young and lively she sprang on her seat for a horse beneath her and said but this is healthy excitement as in reply to her london physicians remonstrances and theres my brother rowsley talking to one of the keepers she cried you see lord ormont i can see a mile sight doesnt fail with me he s insisting ware poachers when rowsleys on his ground you smell the air here nobody dies round about steignton their legs wear out and they lie down to rest them it s the finest air in the world now look the third window left of the porch first floor that was my room before i married strangers have been here and called the place home it can never be home to any but me and rowsley he sees the carriage he little thinks hes dressed in his white corduroy and kneebreeches age he wont know age till hes ninety here he comes marching he cant bear surprises ill wave my hand and call she called his name in a few strides he was at the carriage window you charlotte home again rowsley bring down your eyebrows and let me hear youre glad i ve come what made you expect you would find me here anythingcats on the tiles at night you cant keep a secret from me heres mr weyburn good enough to be my escort i ll get out she alighted scorning help weyburn at her heels the earl nodded to him politely and not cordially he was hardly cordial to lady charlotte that had no effect on her a glorious day for steignton she said ah theres the buridon group of beeches grander trees than grow at buridon old timber now i knew them slim as demoiselles where s the ash we had a splendid ash on the west side dead and cut down long since replied the earl so we go she bent her steps to the spot a grasscovered heave of the soil dear old tree she said in a music of elegy and to weyburn looks like a stump of an arm lopped off a shoulder in bandages nature does it so all the tenants doing well rowsley about the same amount of trouble with them ours at olmer get worse its a process for the extirpation of the landlords then down goes the country they ve got their case their papers tell us i know they have but weve got the soil and well make a fight of it they can fight too they say i should be sorry to think they couldnt if theyre englishmen she spoke so like his old charlotte of the younger days that her brother partly laughed parliamentary fighting s not much to your taste or mine they ve lost their stomach for any other the battle they enjoy is the battle that goes for the majority gauge their valour by that to be sure said his responsive sister she changed her note but what i say is let the nobles keep together and stick to their class theres nothing to fear then they must marry among themselves think of the blood its their first duty or better a peasant girl middle courses dilute it to the stuff in a publicans tankard it s an adulterous beast who thinks of mixing old wine with anything hulloa said the earl and she drew up youll have me here till over tomorrow rowsley so that i may have one clear day at steignton he bowed you will choose your room mr weyburn is welcome weyburn stated the purport of his visit and was allowed to name an early day for the end of his term of service entering the house lady charlotte glanced at the armour and stag branches decorating corners of the hall and straightway laid her head forward pushing after it in the direction of the drawing room she went in stood for a minute and came out her mouth was hard shut at dinner she had tales of uxorious men of men who married mistresses of the fearful incubus the vulgar family of a woman of the inferior classes ever must be and her animadversions were strong in the matter of gewgaw modern furniture the earl submitted to hear she was however keenly attentive whenever he proffered any item of information touching steignton after dinner weyburn strolled to the points of view she cited as excellent for different aspects of her old home he found her waiting to hear his laudation when he came back and in the early morning she was on the terrace impatient to lead him down to the lake there at the boathouse she commanded him to loosen a skiff and give her a paddle between exclamations designed to waken louder from him and not so successful as her cormorant hunger for praise of steignton required she plied him to confirm with his opinion an opinion that her reasoning mind had almost formed in the close neighbourhood of the beloved and honoured person providing it for abstract ideas were unknown to her she put it however as in the abstract how is it we meet people brave as lions before an enemy and rank cowards where theres a botheration among their friends at home and tell me too if youve thought the thing over whats the meaning of this i ve met men in high places and theyve risen to distinction by their own efforts and they head the nation right enough youd say well i talk with them and i find theyve left their brains on the ladder that led them up theyve only the ideas of their grandfather on general subjects i come across a common peasant or craftsman and he down there has a mind more openhes wiser in his intelligence than his rulers and lawgivers up above him he understands what i say and i learn from him i dont learn much from our senators or great lawyers great doctors professors members of governing bodiesthat lot policy seems to petrify their minds when they ve got on an eminence now explain it if you can responsibility has a certain effect on them no doubt said weyburn eminent station among men doesnt give a larger outlook most of them confine their observation to their supports it happens to be one of the questions i have thought over here in england and particularly on a fortnights run in the lowlands of scotland once i have like you my lady come now and then across the people we call common men and women old wayside men especially slowminded but hard in their grasp of facts and ready to learn and logical large in their ideas though going a roundabout way to express them they were at the bottom of wisdom for they had in their heads the delicate sense of justice upon which wisdom is founded that is what their rulers lack unless we have the sense of justice abroad like a common air there s no peace and no steady advance but these humble people had it they reasoned from it and came to sound conclusions i felt them to be my superiors on the other hand i have not felt the same with our senators rulers and lawgivers they are for the most part deficient in the liberal mind ha good so far how do you account for it said lady charlotte i read it in this way that the world being such as it is at present demanding and rewarding with honours and pay special services the men called great who have risen to distinction are not men of brains but the men of aptitudes these men of aptitudes have a poor conception of the facts of life to meet the necessities of modern expansion they are serviceable in departments they go as they are driven or they resist in either case they explain how it is that we have a world moving so sluggishly they are not the men of brains the men of insight and outlook often enough they are foes of the men of brains aptitudes yes that flashes a light into me said lady charlotte i see it better it helps to some comprehension of their muddle a man may be a firstrate soldier doctor bankeras we call the usurer nowadaysor brewer orator anything that leads up to a figurehead and prove a foolish fellow if you sound him i ve thought something like it but wanted the word they say themselves get to know and you see with what little wisdom the world is governed you explain how it is i shall carry aptitudes away she looked straight at weyburn if i were a younger woman i could kiss you for it he bowed to her very gratefully remember my lady theres a good deal of the reformer in that definition i stick to my class but they shall hear a true word when theres one abroad i can tell them that reminds meyou ought to have asked let me tell you im friendly with the rev mr hamptonevey we had a wrestle for half an hour and i threw him and helped him up and he apologized for tumbling and i subscribed to one of his charities and gave up about the pew but had an excuse for not sitting under the sermon a poor good creature he s got the aptitudes for his office he wont do much to save his church i knew another who had his aptitude for the classics and he has mounted he was my tutor when i was a girl he was fond of declaiming passages from lucian and longus and ovid one day he was at it with a piece out of daphnis and chloe and i said now translate he fetched a gurgle to say he couldnt and i slapped his check will you believe it the man was indignant i told him if he would like to know why i behaved in that unmaidenly way he had better apply at home i had no further intimations of his classical aptitudes but he took me for a cleverer pupil than i was i hadnt a notion of the stuff he recited i read by his face that was my aptitudealways has been but think of the donkeys parents are when they let a man have a chance of pouring his barleysugar and sulphur into the ears of a girl lots of girls have no latent heckles and prickles to match his villanytheres my brother come back to breakfast from a round you and i ll have a drive before lunch and a ride or a stroll in the afternoon theres a lot to see i mean you to get the whole place into your head i ve ordered the phaeton and you shall take the whip with me beside you thats how my husband and i spent threequarters of our honeymoon each of the three breakfasted alone they met on the terrace it was easily perceived that lord ormont stood expecting an assault at any instant prepared also to encounter and do battle with his redoubtable sister only he wished to defer the engagement and he was magnanimous he was in the right she in the wrong he had no desire to grapple with her fling and humiliate the sphinx of mrs pagnell had been communing with himself unwontedly during the recent weeks what was the riddle of him that he did not read but expecting an assault and relieved by his sister charlottes departure with weyburn he went to the drawingroom where he had seen her sniff her strong suspicions of a lady coming to throne it charlotte could believe that he flouted the world with a beautiful young woman on his arm she would not believe him capable of doing that in his family home and native county so then her shrewd wits had nothing or little to learn but her vehement fighting against facts her obstinate aristocratic prejudices which he shared her stinger of a tongue these in ebullition formed a discomforting prospect the battle might as well be conducted through the post come it must even her writing of the pointed truths she would deliver was an unpleasant anticipation his ears heated undoubtedly he could crush her yet supposing her to speak to his ears she would say you married a young woman and have been foiling and fooling her ever since giving her half a title to the name of wife and allowing her in consequence to be wholly disfigured before the worldyour family naturally her chief enemies who would otherwise charlotte would proclaim it have been her friends what your intention was one could hear charlottes voice to smack the world in the face and you smacked your young wifes instead his intention had been nothing of the sort he had married in a foreign city a young woman who adored him whose features manners and carriage of her person satisfied his exacting taste in the sex and he had intended to cast gossipy england over the rail and be a traveller for the remainder of his days and at the first she had acquiesced tacitly accepted it as part of the contract he bore with the burden of an intolerable aunt of hers for her sake the two fell to work to conspire aminta tired of travelling aminta must have a london house she continually expressed a hope that she might set her eyes on steignton some early day in fact she as good as confessed her scheme to plot for the acknowledged position of countess of ormont in the english social world that was a distinct breach of the contract as to the babble of the london world about a very young wife he scorned it completely but it belonged to the calculation a very handsome young wife would lay commands on a sexagenarian vigilance while adding to his physical glory the latter he could forego among a people he despised it would however be an annoyance to stand constantly hand upon swordhilt there was besides the conflict with his redoubtable sister he had no dread of it in contemplation of the necessity he could crush his charlotte the objection was that his aminta should be pressing him to do it examine the situation at present aminta has all she needsevery luxury her title as countess of ormont is not denied her husband justly refuses to put foot into english society she choosing to go where she may be received dissociates herself from him and he does not complain she does complain there is a difference between the two he had always shunned the closer yoke with a woman because of these vexatious dissensions for not only are women incapable of practising they cannot comprehend magnanimity lord ormonts argumentative reverie to the above effect had been pursued over and over he knew that the country which broke his military career and ridiculed his newspaper controversy was unforgiven by him he did not reflect on the consequences of such an unpardoning spirit in its operation on his mind if he could but have passed the injury he would ultimatelyfor his claims of service were admittedhave had employment of some kind inoccupation was poison to him travel juggled with his malady of restlessness really a compression of the warriors natural forces his aminta pushed to it by the woman pagnell declined to help him in softening the virulence of the disease she would not travel she would fix in this london of theirs and scheme to be hailed the accepted countess of ormont she manoeuvred she threw him on the veteran soldiers instinct and it resulted spontaneously that he manoeuvred hence their game of pull which occupied him a little tickled him and amused the watching of her pretty infantile tactics amused him too much to permit of a sidethought on the cruelty of the part he played she had every luxury more than her station by right of birth would have supplied but he was astonished to find that his aminta proved herself clever though she had now and then said something pointed she was in awe of him notwithstanding which clearly she meant to win and pull him over he did not dislike her for it she might use her weapons to play her game and that she should bewitch mena man like morsfieldwas not wonderful on the other hand her conquest of mrs lawrence finchley scored tellingly that was unaccountably queer what did mrs lawrence expect to gain the sage lord asked he had not known women devoid of a positive practical object of their own when they bestirred themselves to do a friendly deed thanks to her conquest of mrs lawrence his aminta was gaining grounddaily she made an advance insomuch that he had heard of himself as harshly blamed in london for not having countenanced her recent and rather imprudent move in other words whenever she gave a violent tug at their game of pull he was expected to second it but the world of these english is too monstrously stupid in what it expects for any of its extravagances to be followed by interjections all the while he was trimming and rolling a field of armistice at steignton where they could discuss the terms he had a right to dictate having yielded so far would she be satisfied with the rule of his ancestral hall and the dispensing of hospitalities to the county no one may guess no woman is ever satisfied but she would have to relinquish her game counting her good round half of the honours somewhat more on the whole without beating she certainly had accomplished the miracle of bending him to time and a wife it is no disgrace for a man to bend it is the form of submission of the bulrush to the wind of courtesy in the cavalier to a lady oh here you are rowsley lady charlotte exclaimed at the drawing room door well and i dont like those louis quinze cabinets and that modern french mantelpiece clock is hideous you seem to furnish in downright contempt of the women you invite to sit in the room lord help the wretched woman playing hostess in such a pinchbeck bricabrac shop if there were one she s spared at all events he stepped at slow march to one of the five windows lady charlotte went to another near by she called to weyburn we had a regatta on that water when lord ormont came of age i took an oar in one of the boats and we won a prize and when i was landing i didnt stride enough to the springplank and plumped in some labourers of the estate passed in front lord ormont gave out a broken laugh see those fellows walk that s the raw material of the famous english infantry they bend their knees fiveandforty degrees for every stride and when you drill them out of that they re stiff as ramrods i gymnasticized them in my regiment id have challenged any french regiment to outwalk or outjump us or any crack tyrolese jagers to outclimb though we were cavalry yes my lord and exercised crack corps are wanted with us weyburn replied the english authorities are adverse to it but it s against natureon the supposition that all englishmen might enrol untrained in caesars pet legion virgil shows knowledge of men when he says of the rowboat straining in emulation possunt quia posse videntur he talked on rapidly he wondered that he did not hear lady charlotte exclaim at what she must be seeing from the nearest avenue a lady had issued she stood gazing at the house erecta gallant figure of a womanone hand holding her parasol the other at her hip he knew her she was a few paces ahead of mrs pagnell beside whom a gentleman walked the cry came its that man morsfield who brings that man morsfield here he hunted me on the road he seemed to be on the wrong scent who are those women rowsley are your grounds open every day of the week she threatens to come in lady charlotte had noted that the foremost and younger of those women understood how to walk and how to dress to her shape and colour she inclined to think she was having to do with an intrepid foreignbred minx aminta had been addressed by one of her companions and had hastened forward it looked like the beginning of a run to enter the house mrs pagnell ran after her she ran cowlike the earls gorge rose at the spectacle charlotte was observing with morsfield he could have settled accounts at any moment despatching aminta to her chamber for an hour he had though he was offended an honourable guess that she had not of her free will travelled with the man and brought him into the grounds it was the presence of the intolerable pagnell under charlottes eyes which irritated him beyond the common anger he felt at amintas pursuit of him right into steignton his mouth locked lady charlotte needed no speech from him for sign of the boiling she was too wary to speak while that went on he said to weyburn loud enough for his charlotte to heir do me the favour to go to the countess of ormont conduct her back to london you will say it is my command inform mr morsfield with my compliments i regret i have no weapons here i understand him to complain of having to wait i shall be in town three days from this date my lord said mr weyburn and actually he did mean to supplicate he could imagine seeing lord ormonts eyebrows rising to alpine heights lady charlotte seized his arm go at once do as you are told ill have your portmanteau packed and sent after youthe phaetons out in the yardto rowsley or ashead or dornton wherever they put up now go or we shall have hot work keep your head on and go he went without bowing lady charlotte rang for the footman the earl and she watched the scene on the sward below the terrace aminta listened to weyburn evidently there was no expostulation but it was otherwise with mrs pagnell she flung wild arms of a semaphore signalling national events she sprang before aminta to stop her retreat and stamped and gibbed for sign that she would not be driven she fell away to mr morsfield for simple hearing of her plaint he appeared emphatic there was a passage between him and weyburn i suspect youve more than your match in young weyburn mr morsfield lady charlotte said measuring them as they stood together they turned at last you shall drive back to town with me rowsley said the fighting dame she breathed no hint of her triumph chapter xviii a scene on the road back after refusing to quit the grounds of steignton in spite of the proprietor mrs pagnell burst into an agitation to have them be at speed that they might shake the dust of the place from the soles of their feet and she hurried past aminta and lord ormonts insolent emissary carrying mr morsfield beside her perforce of a series of imperiouslytoned vacuous questions to which he listened in rigid politeness with the ejaculation steaming off from time to time a scandal he shot glances behind him mrs pagnell was going too fast she however world not hear of a halt and she was his main apology for being present he was excruciatingly attached to the horrid woman weyburn spoke the commonplaces about regrets to aminta believe me its long since i have been so happy she said she had come out of her stupefaction and she wore no theatrical looks of cheerfulness i regret that you should be dragged away but if you say you do not mind it will be pleasant to me i can excuse lord ormonts anger i was ignorant of his presence here i thought him in paris i supposed the place empty i wished to see it once i travelled as the niece of mrs pagnell she is a little infatuated mr morsfield heard of our expedition through her i changed the route i was not in want of a defender i could have defended myself in case of need we slept at ashead two hours from steignton he and a friend accompanied us not with my consent lord ormont could not have been aware of that these accidental circumstances happen there may be pardonable intentions on all sides she smiled her looks were open and her voice light and spirited though the natural dark roseglow was absent from her olive cheeks weyburn puzzled over the mystery of so volatile a treatment of a serious matter on the part of a woman whose feelings he had reason to know were quick and deep she might be acting as women so cleverly do it could hardly be acting when she pointed to peeps of scenery with a just eye for landscape you leave us for switzerland very soon she said the reversion i have been expecting has fallen in besides my inheritance my mother was not to see the school but i shall not forget her counsels i can now make my purchase of the house and buildings and buy out my partner at the end of a year my boys are jumping to start i had last week a letter from emile dear little emile you like him i could use a warmer word he knew me when i was a girl she wound the strings of his heart suddenly tense and they sang to their quivering you will let me hear of you mr weyburn i will write oh certainly i will write if i am told you are interested in our doings lady ormont i will let you know that i am i shall be happy in writing full reports every detail i beg all concerning the school help me to feel i am a boarder i catch up an old sympathy i had for girls and boys for boys any boys the dear monkey boys cherub monkeys they are so funny i am sure i never have laughed as i did at selina colletts report through her brother of the way the boys tried to take to my name and their sneezing at it like a cat at a deceitful dish amintawas that their way somethingthe young rascals but please repeat it as you heard them aminta he subdued the mouthing it didnt offend me at all it is one of my amusements to think of it but after a time they liked the name and then how did they say it he had the beloved aminta on his lips he checked it or the power to speak it failed she drew in a sharp breath i hope your boys will have plenty of fun in them they will have you for a providence and a friend i should wish to propose to visit your school some day you will keep me informed whether the school has vacancies you will please keep me regularly informed she broke into sobs weyburn talked on of the school for a cover to the resuming of her fallen mask as he fancied it she soon recovered all save a steady voice for converse and begged him to proceed and spoke in the flow of the subject but the quaver of her tones was a cause of further melting the tears poured she could not explain why beyond assuring him that they were no sign of unhappiness winds on the great waters against a strong tidal current beat up the wave and shear and wing the spray as in amintas bosom only she could know that it was not her heart weeping though she had grounds for a womans weeping but she alone could be aware of her hearts running counter to the tears her agitation was untimely both mrs pagnell and mr morsfield observed emotion at work and who could wonder a wife denied the admittance to her husbands house by her husband the most beautiful woman of her time relentlessly humiliated ordered to journey back the way she had come they had reached the gate of the park and had turned a scandal mr morsfield renewed his interjection vehemently for an apology to his politeness in breaking from mrs pagnell joining the lady whose tears were of the nerves he made offer of his devotion in any shape and she was again in the plight to which a desperado can push a woman of the gentle kind she had the fear of provoking a collision if she reminded him that despite her entreaties he had compelled her seconded by her aunt as he had been to submit to his absurd protection on the walk across the park he seemed quite regardless of the mischief he had created and reflecting upon how it served his purpose he might well be intemperate lover of the ancient pattern that he was his aim to win the woman acknowledged no obstacle in the means her pitiable position appealed to the best of him his inordinate desire of her aroused the worst it was besides an element of his coxcombry that he should in apeing the utterly inconsiderate rush swiftly to impersonate it when his passions were cast on a die weyburn he ignored as a stranger an intruder an inferior amintas chariot was at the gate she had to resign herself to the chances of a clash of men and as there were two to one she requested help of weyburns hand that he might be near her a mounted gentleman smelling parasite in his bearing held the bridle of morsfields horse the ladies having entered the chariot morsfield sprang to the saddle and said you sir had better stretch your legs to the inn there is room for you mr weyburn said aminta mrs pagnell puffed i cant think weve room my dear i want that bit of seat in front for my feet morsfield kicked at his horses flanks and between weyburn and the chariot step cried back sir his reins were seized the horse reared the unexpected occurred weyburn shouted off to the postillion and jumped in morsfield was left to the shaking of a dusty coat while the chariot rolled its gentle course down the leafy lane into the highroad his friend had seized the horses bridlereins and he remarked i say dolf we dont prosper today he pays for it said morsfield foot in stirrup youll take him and trounce him at the inn i dont fight with servants better game one thing cumnock the fellows clever at the foils foils to the devil if i tackle the fellow it wont be with the buttons but how has he pushed in morsfield reported the scandal in sharp headings turned her away wont have her enter his housegrandest woman in all england sent his dog to guard think of it for an insult its insult upon insult i ve done my utmost to fire his marrow i did myself a good turn by following her up and entering that park with her i shall succeed there s a look of it all i havemy lifeis that womans i never knew what this devils torture was before i saw her his friend was concerned for his veracity amy a common spotted snake she caught me young and she didnt carry me off as i mean to carry off this glory of her sexshe is youve seen herand free her and devote every minute of the rest of my days to her i say i must win the woman if i stop at nothing or i perish and if it s a failure exit s my road i ve watched every atom she touched in a room and would have heaped gold to have the chairs tables cups carpets mine i have two short letters written with her hand i d give two of my estates for two more if i were a beggar and kept them i should be rich relieve me of that dog and i toss you a thousandpound note and thank you from my soul cumnock you know what hangs on it spur you dolt or shell be out of sight they cantered upon application of the spur captain cumnock was an impecunious fearless rascal therefore a parasite and a bully duellist a thickbuilt northcountryman a burly ape of the ultraelegant hunter gamester harddrinker man of pleasure his known readiness to fight was his trumpcard at a period when the declining custom of the duel taxed mens courage to brave the law and the puritan in the interests of a privileged and menaced aristocracy an incident like the present was the passion in the dicebox to cumnock morsfield was of the order of men who can be generous up to the pitch of their desires consequently the world accounted him openhanded and devoted when enamoured few men liked him he was a hero with some women the women he trampled on the men he despised to the lady of his choice he sincerely offered his fortune and his life for the enjoyment of her favour his ostentation and his offensive daring combined the characteristics of the peacock and the hawk always near upon madness there were occasions when he could eclipse the insane he had a ringing renown in his class chariot and horsemen arrived at the roebuck arms at the centre of the small town of ashead on the line from steignton through rowsley the pair of cavaliers dismounted and hustled weyburn in assisting the ladies to descend the ladies entered the inn they declined refection of any sort they had biscuits and sweetmeats and looked forward to tea at a farther stage captain cumnock stooped to their verdict on themselves with marvel at the quantity of flesh they managed to put on their bones from such dieting by your courtesy sir a word with you in the inn yard if you please he said to weyburn in the innporch weyburn answered half a minute and was informed that it was exactly the amount of time the captain could afford to wait weyburn had seen the steignton phaeton and coachman in the earls lightblue livery it was at his orders he heard he told the coachman to expect hire shortly and he followed the captain with a heavy trifle of suspicion that some brew was at work he said to aminta in the passage you have your settlement with the innkeeper dont i beg step into the chariot till you see me anything said she only prudence our posting horses will be harnessed soon i hope i burn to get away mrs pagnell paid the bill at the bar of the inn morsfield poured out for the injured countess or nocountess a dram of the brandy of passion under the breath deny that you singled me once for your esteem hardesthearted of the women of earth and dearest deny that you gave me reason to hopeand now i have ridden in your track all this way for the sight of you as you know and you kill me with frost yes i rejoice that we were seen together look on me i swear i perish for one look of kindness you have been shamefully used madam it seems to me i am being so said aminta cutting herself loose from the man of the close eyes that wavered as they shot the dart her action was too decided for him to follow her up under the observation of the inn windows and a staring street mrs pagnell came out she went boldly to morsfield and they conferred he was led by her to the chariot where she pointed to a small padded slab of a seat back to the horses turning to the bar he saidmy friend will look to my horse both want watering and a bucketful therehe threw silveri have to protect the ladies aminta was at the chariot door talking to her aunt inside but i say i have been insultedis the wordmore than enough by lord ormont today mrs pagnell exclaimed and i wont i positively refuse to ride up to london with any servant of his its quite sufficient that its his servant im not titled but i in not quite dirt mr morsfield kindly offers his protection and i accept he is company nodding and smirking at morsfields approach she entreated aminta to step up and in for the horses were coming out of the yard aminta looked round weyburn was perceived and morsfields features cramped at thought of a hitch in the plot possession mrs pagnell murmured significantly she patted the seat morsfield sprang to weyburns place that was witnessed by aminta and weyburn she stepped to consult him he said to the earls coachmana young fellow with a bright eye for orders drive as fast as you can pelt for dornton im doing my lords commands trust yourself to me madam his hand stretched for aminta to mount she took it without a word and climbed to the seat a clatter of hoofs rang out with the crack of the whip they were away behind a pair of steppers that could go the pace chapter xix the pursuers for promptitude the lady the gentleman and the coachman were in such unison as to make it a reasonable deduction that the flight had been concerted never did any departure from the roebuck leave so widemouthed a body of spectators mrs pagnells shrieks of stop oh stop to the backs of the coachman and aminta were continued until they were far down the street she called to the innkeeper called to the landlady and to invisible constables for help but her pangs were childish compared with morsfields who with the rage of a conceited schemer tricked and the fury of a lover beholding the rape of his beautiful bellowed impotently at weyburn and the coachman out of hearing stop you he was in the state of men who believe that there is a virtue in imprecations and he shot loud oaths after them shook his fist cursed his friend cumnock whose name he vociferated as a summons to himgenerally the baffled plotter misconducted himself to an extreme degree that might have apprised mrs pagnell of a more than legitimate disappointment on his part pursuit was one of the immediate ideas which rush forward to look back woefully on impediments and fret to fever over the tardiness of operations a glance at the thing of wrinkles receiving orders to buckle at his horses and pursue convinced them of the hopelessness and morsfield was pricked to intensest hatred of the woman by hearing the dire exclamation one night and her characters gone be quiet maam if you please or nothing can be done he cried i tell you mr morsfielddont you seehe has thrown them together it is lord ormonts wicked conspiracy to rid himself of her a secretary hell beat any one alive in plots she cant show her face in london after this if you dont overtake her and she might have seen lord ormonts plot to ruin her he tired of her and was ashamed of her inferior birth to his own after the first year except on the continent where she had her rights me he never forgave for helping make him the happy man he might have been in spite of his age for she is lovely but its worse for a lovely woman with a damaged reputation and that s his cunning how she could be so silly as to play into it she cant have demeaned herself to look on that secretary i said from the first he seemed as if thrown into her way for a purpose but she has pride my niece aminta has pride she might well have listened to flatterersshe had every temptationif it hadnt been for her pride it may save her yet however goodlooking she will remember her dignityunless hes a villain runnings away drivings together inns oh the story over london i do believe she has a true friend in you mr morsfield and i say as i have said before the sight of a devoted admirer would have brought any husband of more than sixty to his senses if he hadnt hoped a catastrophe and determined on it catch them we cant unless she repents and relents and prayers for that are our only resource now start man do the postillion had his foot in position to spring morsfield bawled cumnocks name and bestrode his horse captain cumnock emerged from the innyard with a dubitative step pressing a handkerchief to his nose blinking and scrutinizing the persistent fresh stains on it stableboys were at the rear these ducking and springing surcharged and copious exponents of the play they had seen related for the benefit of the town how that the two gentlemen had exchanged words in the yard which were about beastly pistols which the slim gentleman would have none of and then the big one trips up like dancing to the other one and flicks him a soft clap on the checkquite friendly you may say and before he can square to it the slim one he steps his hind leg half a foot back and he drives a straight left like lightning off the shoulder slick on to t other ones nob and over he rolls like a cart with the shafts up down a bank and he a been washing his chops and threatening bullets ever since the exact account of the captains framework in the process of the fall was graphically portrayed in our blunt and racy vernacular which a society nourished upon normanenglish and englishlatin banishes from print largely to its impoverishment some think by the time the primary narrative of the encounter in the inn yard had given ground for fancy and ornament to present it in yet more luscious dress lord ormonts phaeton was a good mile on the road morsfield and captain cumnockthe latter inquisitive of the handkerchief pressed occasionally at his nosetrotted on tired steeds along dusty wheeltracks mrs pagnell was the solitary of the chariot having a horrid couple of loaded pistols to intimidate her for her protection and the provoking back view of a regularly jogging mannikin under a big white hat with blue riband who played the part of time in dragging her along with worse than no countenance for her anxieties news of the fugitives was obtained at the rampant red lion in dudsworth nine miles on along the london road to the extent that the earl of ormonts phaeton containing a lady and a gentleman had stopped there a minute to send back word to steignton of their comfortable progress and expectations of crossing the borders into hampshire before sunset morsfield and cumnock shrugged at the bumpkin artifice they left their line of route to be communicated to the chariot and chose with practised acumen that very course which was the main road and rewarded them at the end of half an hour with sight of the steignton phaeton but it was returning a nearer view showed it empty of the couple morsfield bade the coachman pull up and he was readily obeyed answers came briskly although provincial acting is not of the high class which conceals the art this mans look beside him and behind him at vacant seats had incontestable evidence in support of his declaration that the lady and gentleman had gone on by themselves the phaeton was a box of flown birds where did you say they got out you dog said cumnock the coachman stood up to spy a point below down there at the bottom of the road to the right where theres a stile across the meadows making a short cut by way of a bridge over the river to busley and north tothill on the highroad to hocklebourne the lady and gentleman thought they d walk for a bit of exercise the remains of the journey cant prove the rascals a liar cumnock said to morsfield who rallied him savagely on his lucky escape from another knockdown blow and tossed silver on the seat and said we ll see if there is a stile youll see the stile sir rejoined the man and winked at their backs both cavaliers being famished besides baffled were in sour tempers expecting to see just the dead wooden stile and see it as a grin at them cumnock called on jove to witness that they had been donkeys enough to forget to ask the driver how far round on the road it was to the other end of the crosscut morsfield entirely objecting to asinine harness with him mocked at his invocation and intonation of the name of jove cumnock was thereupon stung to a keen recollection of the allusion to his knockdown blow and he retorted that there were some men whose wit was the parrots morsfield complimented him over the exhibition of a vastly superior and more serviceable wit in losing sight of his antagonist after one trial of him cumnock protested that the loss of time was caused by his friends dalliance with the venus in the chariot morsfields gall seethed at a flying picture of mrs pagnell coupled with the retarding reddened handkerchief business and he recommended cumnock to pay court to the old woman as the only chance he would have of acquaintanceship with the mother of love upon that cumnock confessed in humility to his not being wealthy morsfield looked a willingness to do the deed he might have to pay for in tenderer places than the pocket and named the head as a seat of poverty with him cumnock then yawned a town fops advice to a hustling street passenger to apologize for his rudeness before it was too late whereat morsfield certain that his parasitic thrasyleon apeing coxcomb would avoid extremities mimicked him execrably now this was a second breach of the implied convention existing among the exquisitely finebred silkenslender on the summits of our mundane sphere which demands of them all that they respect one anothers affectations it is commonly done and so the costly people of a single pattern contrive to push forth flatteringly to themselves luxuriant shoots of individuality in their orchidean glasshouse a violation of the rule is a really deadly personal attack captain cumnock was particularly sensitive regarding it inasmuch as he knew himself not the natural performer he strove to be and a mimicry affected him as a haunting check he burst out damned if i dont understand why youre hated by men and women both morsfield took a shock infernal hornet he muttered for his conquests had their secret history may and his wife have a balance to pay will trip you yet you ll find reserve your wrath sir for the man who stretched you on your back the batteries of the two continued exchangeing redhot shots with the effect that they had to call to mind they were looking at the stile a path across a buttercup meadow was beyond it they were damped to some coolness by the sight upon my word the trick seems neat said cumnock staring at the pastoral curtain whose trick he was asked sternly here or there s not much matter they re off unless they re under a hedge laughing an ache of jealousy and spite was driven through the lover who groaned and presently said i ride on that old woman can follow i dont want to hear her gibberish weve lost the gamethere s no reckoning the luck if theres a chance its this way it smells a trick he and sheby all the devils it has been done in my familymight have been done again tell the men on the plain they can drive home theres a hundredpound weight on your tongue for silence cumnock cried but we neednt be parting dolf stick together bad lucks not repeated every day keep heart for the good my hearts shattered cumnock i say its impossible she can love a husband twice her age who treats heryou ve seen contempt of that lady by heaven once in my power i swear she would have been sacred to me but she would have been compelled to face the public and take my hand i swear she would have been congratulated on the end of her sufferings worshipthats what i feel no woman ever alive had eyes in her head like that ladys i repeat her name ten

i ve lost her pro tem said the captain a plate of red beef and a glass of port wine alters the view too much in the breast too little in the belly capsizes lovers old story horses that ought to be having a mash between their ribs make riders despond say shall we back to the town behind us or on backs the safest if the chase is up morsfield declared himself incapable of turning and meeting that chariot he sighed heavily cumnock offered to cheer him with a song of captain chanters famous collection if he liked but morsfield gesticulated abhorrence and set out at a trot song in defeat was a hiss of derision to him he had failed having failed he for the first time perceived the wildness of a plot that had previously appeared to him as one of the yorkshire morsfields moves to win an object traditionally they stopped at nothing there would have been a sunburst of notoriety in the capture and carrying off of the beautiful countess of ormont she had eluded him during the downward journey to steignton he came on her track at the village at the junction of the roads above ashead and thence confiding in the halfconnivance or utter stupidity of the fair ones duenna despatched a mounted manservant to his coachman and footmen stationed ten miles behind with orders that they should drive forthwith to the great plain and be ready at a point there for two succeeding days that was the plot promptly devised upon receipt of mrs pagnells communication for the wealthy man of pleasure was a strategist fit to be a soldier in dexterity not far from rivalling the man by whom he had been outdone an ascetic on the road to success he dedicated himself to a term of hard drinking under a reverse and the question addressed to the chief towns in the sketch counties his head contained was which one near would be likely to supply the port wine for floating him through garlanding dreams of possession most tastily to blest oblivion he was a lover nevertheless honest in his fashion and meant not worse than to pull his lady through a mire and wash her with morsfield soap and crown her and worship she was in his blood about him above him he had plunged into her image as into deeps that broke away in phosphorescent waves on all sides reflecting every remembered every imagined aspect of the adored beautiful woman piercing him to extinction with that last look of her at the moment of flight had he been just a trifle more sincere in the respect he professed for his ladys duenna he would have turned on the road to dornton and a better fortune mrs pagnell had now become the ridiculous paggy of mrs lawrence finchley and her circle for the hypocritical gentleman and he remarked to captain cumnock when their mutual trot was established paggy enough for me for a monthgood lord i cant stand another dose of her by herself its a bird that wont roast or boil or stew said the captain they were observed trotting along below by lord ormonts groom of the stables on promotion as he surveyed the country from the chalkhill rise and brought the phaeton to a stand jonathan boon a sharp lad whose comprehension was a little muddled by the rights of it in this adventure he knew however that he did well to follow the directions of one who was in his lordships pay and stretched out the fee with the air of a shake of the hand and had a look of the winning side moreover a born countryman could see that boon watched the pair of horsemen trotting to confusion and clicked in his cheek the provincial of the period when coaches were beginning to be threatened by talk of newfangled rails was proud to boast of his outwitting londoners on material points and boon had numerous tales of how it had been done to have the laugh of fellows thinking themselves such razors they compensated him for the slavish abasement of his whole neighbourhood under the hectoring of the grand new manufacture of wit in londonthe inimitable metropolitan pun which came down to the country by fourinhand and stopped all other conversation wherever it was reported and would have the roarthere was no resisting it indeed to be able to see the thing smartly was an entry into community with the elect of the district and when the roaring ceased and the thing was examined astonishment at the cleverness of it and the wonderful shallowness of the seeming deep hole and the unexhausted bang it had to go off like a patent cracker fetched it out for telling over again and up went the roar and up it went at home and in stableyards and at the net puffing of churchwardens on a summers bench or in a cricketbooth after a feast or round the old inns taproom fine the pun the wonderful bopeep of double meanings darting out to surprise and smack one another from behind words of the same sound sometimes the same spelling overwhelmed the provincial mind with awe of londons occult and prolific genius yet down yonder you may behold a pair of london gentlemen trotting along on as fine a fools errand as ever was undertaken by nincompoops bearing a scaled letter marked urgent to a castle and the request in it that the steward would immediately upon perusal down with their youknowwhat and hoist them and birch them a jolly two dozen without parley boon smacked his leg and then drove ahead merrily for this had happened to his knowledge the gentleman accompanying the lady had refused to make anything of a halt at the red lion and had said he was sure there would be a small publichouse at the outskirts of the town for there always was one and he proved right and the lady and he had descended at the sign of the jolly cricketers and boon had driven on for half an hour by order this too had happened external to boons knowledge the lady and the gentleman had witnessed through the small diamond windowpanes of the jolly cricketers parlour the passingby of the two horsemen in pursuit of them and the gentleman had stopped the chariot coming on some fifteen minutes later but he did not do it at the instigation of the lady chapter xx at the sign of the jolly cricketers the passing by of the pair of horsemen who so little suspected the treasure existing behind the small inns narrow window did homage in amintas mind to her protectors adroitness their eyes met without a smile though they perceived the grisly comic of the incident their thoughts were on the chariot to follow aminta had barely uttered a syllable since the start of the flight from ashead she had rocked in a swing between sensation and imagination exultant rich with the broad valley of the plain and the high green waves of the downs at their giants bound in the flow of curves and sunny creases to the final flingoff of the dip on sky here was a twisted hawthorn carved clean to the way of the wind a sheltered clump of chestnuts holding their blossoms up as with a thousand cressetclasping hands here were grasses that nodded swept from green to grey flowers yellow white and blue significant of a marvellous unknown through the gates of colour and gorsecovers giving out the bird squares of young wheat a single fallow threaded by a hare and cottage gardens shadowy garths wayside flintheap woods of the mounds and the dells fluttering leaves clouds all were swallowed all were the one unworried significance scenery flew shifted returned again the line of the downs raced and the hollows reposed simultaneously they were the same in change to an eye grown older they promised as at the first happiness for recklessness the whole woman was urged to delirious recklessness in happiness and she drank the flying scenery as an indication a likeness an encouragement when her wild music of the blood had fallen to stillness with the stopped wheels she was in the musky small low room of the diamond windowpanes at her companions disposal for what he might deem the best he was her fate but the more she leaned on a man of selfcontrol the more she admired and an admiration that may not speak itself to the object present drops inward stirs the founts and if these are repressed the tenderness which is not allowed to weep will drown selfpity hardening the woman to summon scruples in relation to her unworthiness he might choose to forget but the more she admired the less could her feminine conscience permit of an utter or of any forgetfulness that she was not the girl browny whom he once lovedperhaps loved now under some illusion of his old passion for herdoes love now illomened as he is in that she read him by her startled reading of her own heart and she constrained her will to keep from doing saying looking aught that would burden without gracing his fortunes for as she felt a look a word a touch would do the mischief she had no resistance behind her cold face only the physical scruple which would become the moral unworthiness if in any way she induced him to break his guard and blow hers to shreds an honourable conscience before the world has not the same certificate in loves pure realm they are different kingdoms a girl may be of both a married woman peering outside the narrow circle of her weddingring should let her eyelids fall and the unseen fires consume her their common thought was now will the chariot follow what will he do if it comes was an unformed question with aminta he had formed and not answered it holding himself sincerely at the moment bound to her wishes near the end of ashead main street she had turned to him in her seat beside the driver and conveyed silently with the dental play of her tongue and pouted lips no title upon that sign waxen to those lips he had said to the driver you took your orders from lady charlotte and the reply her ladyship directed me sir exonerated lord ormont so far weyburn remembered then a passage of one of her steady looks wherein an oracle was mute he tried several of the diviners shots to interpret it she was beyond his reach she was in her blissful delirium of the flight and reproached him with giving her the little bit less to resentshe who had no sense of resentment except the claim on it to excuse their landlady entered the room to lay the cloth for tea and eggs she made offer of bacon as well homecured she was a hampshire woman and understood the rearing of pigs her husband had been a cricketer and played for his county he didnt often beat hampshire they had a good garden of vegetables and grassland enough for two cows they made their own bread their own butter but did not brew weyburn pronounced for a plate of her homecured she had children the woman told himtwo boys and a girl her husband wished for a girl her eldest boy wished to be a sailor and would walk miles to a pond to sail bits of wood on it though there had never been a seafaring man in her husbands family or her own she agreed with the lady and gentleman that it might be unwise to go contrary to the boys bent going to school or coming home a trickle of water would stop him aminta said to her companion in french have you money she chased his blood some sufficient i think it stamped their partnership i have but a small amount aunt was our paymaster we will buy the little boy a boat to sail you are pale i ve no notion of it something happened it ashead it would not have damaged my complexion he counted his money aminta covertly handed him her purse their fingers touched the very minor circumstance of their landlady being in the room dammed a flood her money and his amounted to seventeen pounds the sumtotal was a symbol of days that were a fiery wheel honour and blest adventure might travel together two days or three he thought if the chariot did not passlord ormont had willed it a man could not be said to swerve in his duty when acting to fulfil the masters orders and mrs pagnell was proved a hoodwinked duenna and morsfield was in the air the breathing aminta had now a common purse with her first lover for three days or more they were it would seem to journey together alone together the prosecution of his duty imposed it on him sooth to say weyburn knew that a spice of passion added to a bowl of reason makes a sophists mess but he fancied an absolute reliance on amintas dignity and his respect for her was another barrier he begged the landladys acceptance of two shillings for her boys purchase of a boat advising her to have him taught early to swim both he and aminta had a feeling that they could be helpful in some little things on the road if the chariot did not pass justification began to speak loudly against the stopping of the chariot if it did pass the fact that sweet wishes come second and not so loudly assured him they were quite secondary for the lover sunk to sophist may be selfbeguiled by the arts which render him the potent beguiler we are safe here he said and thrilled her with the we behind the curtaining leaded windowpanes what is it you propose her voice was lower than she intended to that she ascribed his vivid flush it kindled the deeper of her dark hue he mentioned her want of luggage and the purchase of a kit she said have we the means we can adjust the means to the ends we must be sparing of expenses will you walk part of the way i should like it we shall be longer on the journey we shall not find it tiresome i hope we can say so if we do we are not strangers the recurrence of the we had an effect of wedding it was fatalistic it would come but in truth there was pleasure in it and the pleasure was close to consciousness of some guilt when vowing itself innocent and no they were not strangers hardly a word could they utter without cutting memory to the quick their present breath was out of the far past love told them both that they were trembling into one anothers arms not voluntarily against the will with each of them they knew it would be for life and amintas shamed reserves were matched to make an obstacle by his consideration for her good name and her station for his own claim to honest citizenship also weyburn acted on his instinct at sight of the postillion and the chariot he flung the window wide and shouted then he said it is decided and he felt the rightness of the decision like a man who has given a condemned limb to the surgeon aminta was passive as a waterweed in the sway of the tide hearing it to be decided she was relieved what her secret heart desired she kept secret almost a secret from herself he was not to leave her so she had her permitted wish she had her companion plus her exclamatory aunt who was a protection and she had learnt her need of the smallest protection i can scarcely believe i see you my dear dear child mrs pagnell cried upon entering the small inn parlour and so genuine was her satisfaction that for a time she paid no heed to the stuffiness of the room the meanness of the place the unfitness of such a hostelry to entertain ladiesthe countess of ormont eat here mrs pagnell asked observing the preparations for the meal her pride quailed her stomach abjured appetite but she forbore from asking how it was that the countess of ormont had come to the place at a symptom of her intention to indulge in disgust aminta brought up mr morsfield by name whereupon mrs pagnell showed she had reflected on her conduct in relation to the gentleman and with the fear of the earl if she were questioned homemade bread and butter fresh eggs and sparkling fat of bacon invited her to satisfy her hunger aminta let her sniff at the teapot unpunished the tea had a rustic aroma of groundivy reminding weyburn of his mothers curiosity to know the object of an old mans plucking of hedgeside leaves in the environs of bruges one day and the simple reply to her french tea for the english a hint of an anecdote interested and enriched the stores of mrs pagnell so she capped it and partook of the infusion ruefully but the bread is really good she said and we are unlikely to be seen leaving the place by any person of importance unless mr morsfield should be advised to return this way said aminta her aunt proposed for a second cup she was a manageable woman the same scourge had its instant wholesome effect on her when she snubbed the secretary so she complimented his trenchermans knife of which the remarkably fine edge was proof enough that he had come heartwhole out of the trial of an hour or sos intimate companionship with a beautiful woman who had never been loved never could be loved by man as poor mr morsfield loved her he had sworn to having fasted three whole days and nights after his first sight of aminta once he said her eyes pierced him so that he dreamed of a dagger in his bosom and woke himself plucking at it that was love as a born gentleman connected with a baronetcy and richer than many lords took the dreadful passion a secretary would have no conception of such devoted extravagance at the most he might have attempted to insinuate a few absurd sheepish soft nothings and the countess of ormont would know right well how to shrivel him with one of her looks no lady of the land could convey so much either way to attract or to repel as aminta countess of ormont and the man the only man insensible to her charm or her scorn was her own wedded lord and husband old to be sure and haughty his pride might not allow him to overlook poor mr morsfields unintentional offence but the presence of the countesss aunt was a reply to any charge he might seek to establish unhappily the case is one between men on their touchiest point when women are pushed aside and justice and religion as well we might be living in a heathen land for aught that morality has to say mrs pagnell fussed about being seen on her emergence from the jolly cricketers aminta sent weyburn to spy for the possible reappearance of mr morsfield he reported a horseman a butcherboy clattered by aminta took the landladys hand under her aunts astonished gaze and said i shall not forget your house and your attention to us she spoke with a shake of her voice the landlady curtseyed and smiled curtseyed and almost whimpered the house was a poor one she begged to say they didnt often have such guests but whoever came to it they did their best to give good food and drink hearing from weyburn that the chariot was bound to go through winchester she spoke of a brother a baker there the last surviving member of her family and after some talk weyburn offered to deliver a message of health and greeting at the bakers shop there was a waving of hands much nodding and curtseying as the postillion resumed his demivoltsall to the stupefaction of mrs pagnell but she dared not speak she had morsfield on the mouth nor could she deny the excellent quality of the bread and butter and milk too at the sign of the jolly cricketers she admitted moreover that the food and service of the little inn belonged in their unpretentious honesty to the kind we call old english the dear old simple country english of the brotherly interchange in sight of heavengood stuff for good money a matter with a blessing on it but said she my dear aminta i do not and i cannot understand looks of grateful affection at a small innkeepers wife paid and i dont doubt handsomely paid for her entertainment of you i feel it said aminta tears rushed to her eyelids overflowing and her features were steady ah poor dear that i do understand her aunt observed any little kindness moves you today and well it may yes aunty said aminta and in relation to the cause of her tears she was the less candid of the two so far did she carry her thanks for a kindness as to glance back through her dropping tears at the signboard of the jolly cricketers where two brave batsmen cross for the second of a certain three runs if only the fellow wheeling legs face up after the ball in the clouds does but miss his catch a grand suspensory moment of the game admirably chosen by the artist to arrest the wayfarer and promote speculation for will he let her slip through his fingers when she comes down or will he have her fast and tight and in the former case the bats are tearing their legs off for just number nought and in the latter there s a wicket down and what you may call a widower walking it bat on shoulder parted from his mate for that mortal innings and likely to get more chaff than consolation when he joins the booth chapter xxi undercurrents in the minds of lady charlotte and lord ormont another journey of travellers to london in the rear of the chariot was not diversified by a single incident or refreshed by scraps of dialogue lady charlotte had her brother rowsley with her and he might be taciturnshe drove her flocks of thoughts she was busily and contentedly occupied although separation from him stirred her mind more excitedly over their days and deeds of boy and girl her having him near and having now won him to herself struck her as that old times harvest about as much as can be hoped for us from life when we have tasted it the scene of the invasion of steignton by the woman and her aunt and that man morsfield was a steel engraving among her many rapid and featureless cogitations she magnified the rakishness of the womans hand on hip in view of the house and she magnified the womans insolence in bringing that man morsfieldto share probably the hospitality of steignton during the masters absence her trick of caricature whenever she dealt with adversaries was active upon the three persons under observation of the windows it was potent to convince her that her brother rowsley had cast the woman to her native obscurity however lady charlotte could be just the womans figure and as far as could be seen of her face accounted for rowsleys entanglement why chastize that man morsfield at all calling him out would give a further dip to the name of ormont a pretty idea to be punishing a roan for what you thank him for he did a service and if hes as mad about her as he boasts he can take her and marry her now rowsley s free of her morsfield says he wants to marry herwants nothing better then let him rowsley has shown him there s no legal impediment pity that young weyburn had to be sent to do watchdog duty but rowsley would not have turned her back to travel alone that is without a man to guard he s too chivalrous the sending of weyburn she now fancied was her own doing and lady charlotte attributed it to her interpretation of her brothers heart of chivalry though it would have been the wiser course tending straight and swift to the natural end if the two women and their morsfield had received the dismissal to travel as they came one sees it after the event yes only rowsley would not have dismissed her without surety that she would be protected so it was the right thing prompted on the impulse of the moment and young weyburn would meet some difficulty in protecting his lady ormont if she had no inclination for it analyzing her impulse of the moment lady charlotte credited herself not unjustly with a certain considerateness for the woman notwithstanding the womans violent intrusion between brother and sister knowing the world and knowing the upper or beanstalk world intimately she winked at natures passions but when the legitimate affection of a brother and sister finds them interposing they are as little parsonically as possible reproved if persistently intrusive they are handed to the constable how supposing the case of a wife well then comes the contest and it is with an inferior because not a born legitimacy of union which may be which here and there is affection is generally the habit of partnership it is inferior from not being the union of the blood it is a matter merely of the laws and the tastes no love she reasoned is equal to the love of brother and sister not even the love of parents for offspring or of children for mother and father brother and sister have the holy young days in common they have lastingly the recollection of their youth the golden time when they were themselves or the best of themselves a wife is a stranger from the beginning she is necessarily three parts a stranger up to the finish of the history she thinks she can absorb the husband not if her husband has a sister living she may cry and tear for what she calls her own she will act prudently in bowing her head to the stronger tie is there a wife in europe who broods on her husbands merits and his injuries as the sister of thomas rowsley earl of ormont does or one to defend his good name one to work for his fortunes as devotedly over and over lady charlotte drove her flocks of much the same pattern like billows before a piping gale they might be similara puffed iteration and might be meaningless and wearisome the gale was a power in earnest her brother sat lockedup she did as a wife would not have done and held her peace he spoke she replied in a few wordsblunt to the point as no wife would have done her dear warmhearted rowsley was shaken by the blow he had been obliged to deal to the womanpoor womanif she felt it he was always the principal sufferer where the feelings were concerned he was never for hurting any but the enemy his ha here we dine an exclamation of a man of imprisoned yawns at the apparition of the turnkey was delightful to her for a proof of health and sanity and enjoyment of the journey yes and ive one bottle left in the hamper of the hock you like she said that mr weyburn likes it too he drank a couple coming down she did not press for talk his ready appetite was the flower of conversation to her and he slept well he said her personal experience on that head was reserved london enfolded them in the late evening of a day brewing storm my lord heard at the door of his house that lady ormont had not arrived yet she had started a day in advance of him he looked down up and round at charlotte he looked into an empty hall pagnell was not there a sight of pagnell would strange to say have been agreeable storm was in the air and aminta was on the road lightning has before now frightened carriagehorses she would not misconduct herself she would sit firm no woman in england had stouter nervefew men but the carriage might be smashed he was ignorant of the road she had chosen for her return out of wiltshire there would be no cliffs quarries riverbanks presenting dangers those dangers however spring up when horses have the frenzy charlotte was nodded at for a signal to depart and she drove off speculating on the bullet of a grey eye which was her brothers adieu to her the earl had apparently a curiosity to inspect vacant rooms his amintas drawingroom her boudoir her bedchamber were submissive in showing bed knickknacks furniture they told the tale of a corpse he washed and dressed and went out to his club to dine hating the faces of the servants of the house just able to bear with the attentions of his valet thunder was rattling at ten at night the house was again the tomb she had high courage that girl she might be in a bed with her windowblind up calmly waiting for the flashes lightning excited her he had seen her lying at her length quietly her black hair scattered on the pillow like shadow of twigs and sprays on moonlit grass illuminated intermittently smiling to him but her heart out and abroad wild as any witchs if on the road she would not quail but it was necessary to be certain of her having a trusty postillion he walked through the drench and scream of a burst cloud to the postingoffice there after some trouble he obtained information directing him to the neighbouring mews he had thence to find his way to the neighbouring pothouse the report of the postillion was on the whole favourable the man understood horseswas middleagedno sot he was also a man with an eye for weather proverbially in the stables a cautious handslow old slowandsure he was called by name joshua abnett oh joshua abnett said the earl and imprinted it on his memory for the service it was to do during the night slowandsure joshua abnett would conduct her safely barring accidents for accidents we must all be prepared she was a heroine in an accident the earl recalled one and more her calm face brightened eyes easy laughter hysterics were not in her family she did wrong to let that fellow morsfield accompany her possibly he had come across her on the road and she could not shake him off judging by all he knew of her the earl believed she would not have brought the fellow into the grounds of steignton of her free will she had always a particular regard for decency according to the rumour morsfield and the woman pagnell were very thick together he barked over london of his being a bitten dog he was near to the mad dogs fate as soon as a convenient apology for stopping his career could be invented the thinking of the lesson to morsfield on the one hand and of the slowandsure postillion joshua abriett on the other lulled lord ormont to a short repose in his desolate house of weyburn he had a glancing thought that the young man would be a good dog to guard the countess from a mad dog as he had reckoned in commissioning him next day was the day of sunlight aminta loved it happens with the men who can strike supposing them of the order of civilized creatures that when they have struck heavily however deserved the blow a liking for the victim will assail them if they discover no support in hatred and no sooner is the spot of softness touched than they are invaded by hosts of the stricken persons qualities which plead to be taken as virtues and are persuasive the executioner did rightly but it is the turn for the victim to declare the blow excessive now a just man who has overdone the stroke will indemnify and console in every way short of humiliating himself he had an unusually clear vision of the scene at steignton surprise and wrath obscured it at the moment for reflection to bring it out in sharp outline and he was able now to read and translate into inoffensive english the inherited spanish of it which violated nothing of amintas native donayre though it might look on english soil outlandish or stagey aminta stood in sunlight on the greensward she stood hand on hip gazing at the house she had so long desired to see without a notion that she committed an offence implicitly upon all occasions she took her husbands word for anything he stated and she did not consequently imagine him to be at steignton so then she had no thought of running down from london to hunt and confound him as at first it appeared the presence of that whitefaced morsfield vindicated her sufficiently so far and let that fellow hang till the time for cutting him down not she but pagnell seems to have been the responsible party and by the way one might prick the affair with morsfield by telling him publicly that his visit to inspect steignton was waste of pains for he would not be accepted as a tenant in the kennels et caetera well poor girl she satisfied her curiosity not aware that a few weeks farther on would have done it to the full as to morsfield never once either in vienna or in paris had she warmly admired though she was all eyes telescoping and sunglassing on her given her husband an hour or half an hour or two minutes of anxiety letters came the place getting hot she proposed to leave it she had been rather hardly tried there are flowers we cannot keep growing in pots her fault was that instead of flinging down her glove and fighting it out openly she listened to pagnell and began the game of pull if he had a zest for the game it was to stump the woman pagnell so the veteran fancied in his amended mind this intrusive sunlight chased him from the breakfasttable and out of the house she would be enjoying it somewhere but the house empty of a person it was used to contain had an atmosphere of the vaults and inside it the sunlight she loved had an effect of taunting him singularly he called on his upholsterer and heard news to please her the house hired for a month above great marlow was ready her ladyship could enter it tomorrow it pleased my lord to think that she might do so and not bother him any more about the presentation at court during the current year in spite of certain overtures from the military authorities and roused eulogistic citations of his name in the newspapers and magazines he was not on friendly terms with his country yet having contracted the fatal habit of irony which whether hitting or musing its object stirs old venom in our wound twitches the feelings unfortunately for him they had not adequate expression unless he raged within so he had to shake up wrath over his grievances that he might be satisfactorily delivered and he was judged irreconcilable when he had subsided into the quietest contempt from the prospective seat of a country estate in the society of a young wife who adored him an exile from the sepulchre of that house void of the consecration of ashes he walked the streets and became reconciled to street sunlight there were no carriage accidents to disturb him with apprehensions besides the slowness of the postillion joshua abnett which probably helped to the delay was warrant of his sureness and in an accident the stringy fellow young weyburn could be trusted for giving his attention to the ladiesespecially to the younger of the two taking him for the man his elders were at his age as for pagnell a providence watches over the pagnells mortals have no business to interfere an accident on water would be a frolic to his girl swimming was a gift she had from nature pagnell vowed she swam out a mile at dover when she was twelve he had seen her in blue water he had seen her readiness to jump to the rescue once when a marketwoman stepping out of a boat to his yacht on the tabus plumped in she had the two kinds of couragethe impulsive and the reasoned what is life to man or woman if we are not to live it honourably men worthy of the name say this the woman who says and acts on it iswell she is fit company for them but only the woman of natural courage can say it and act on it would she come by winchester or choose the lower road by salisbury and southampton to smell the sea perhapslike herdismissing the chariot and hiring a yacht for a voyage round the coast and up the thames she had an extraordinary love of the sea yet she preferred soldiers to sailors a woman never one of them more a woman but it came of her quickness to take the colour and share the tastes of the man to whom she gave herself my lord was beginning to distinguish qualities in a character he was informed at the mews that joshua abnett was on the road still joshua seemed to be a roadster of uncommon unprogressiveness proper to a framed picture while debating whether to lunch at his loathed club or at a home loathed more but open to bright enlivenment any instant lord ormont beheld a hat lifted and captain may saluting him they were near a famous gamblinghouse in st jamess street good i am glad to see you he said tell me you know mr morsfield pretty well im speaking of my affair he has been trespassing down on my grounds at steignton and i think of taking the prosecution of him into my own hands is he in town i ve just left his lame devil cumnock my lord said may after a slight grimace they generally run in tandem will you let me know at once when i hear you will call on me before noon any service required my respects to your wife your lordship is very good captain may bloomed at a civility paid to his wife he was a smallish springy firmfaced man devotee of the lady bearing his name and wielding him in the days when duelling flourished on our land frail women could be powerful the earl turned from him to greet lord adderwood and a superior officer of his profession on whom he dropped a frigid nod he held that all but the rank and file and a few subalterns of the service had abandoned him to do homage to the authorities the club he frequented was not his military club indeed lunching at any club in solitariness that day with aminta away from home was bitter penance he was rejoiced by lord adderwoods invitation and hung to him after the lunch for a horrible prospect of a bachelor dinner intimated astonishingly that he must have become unawares a domesticated man the solitary later meal of a bachelor was consumed if the word will suit a rabbits form of feeding he fatigued his body by walking the streets and the bridge of the houses of parliament and he had some sleep under a roof where a life like death or death apeing life would have seemed to him the joshua abnett if he had been one to take up images next day he was under the obligation to wait at home till noon shortly before noon a noise of wheels drew him to the window a young lady in whom he recognized amintas little school friend of some name stepped out of a fly he met her in the hall she had expected to be welcomed by aminta and she was very timid on finding herself alone with the earl he however treated her as the harbinger bird wryneck of the nightingale sure that aminta would keep her appointment unless an accident delayed he had forgotten her name but not her favourite pursuit of botany and upon that he discoursed and he was interested not quite independently of the sentiment of her being there as a guarantee of amintas return still he knew his english earth and the counties and soil for particular wildflowers grasses mosses and he could instruct her and inspire a receptive pupil on the theme of birds beasts fishes insects in england and other lands he remained discoursing without much weariness till four of the afternoon then he had his reward the chariot was at the door and the mounted figure of joshua abnett on which he cast not a look or a thought aminta was alone she embraced selina collett warmly and said in friendly tones ah my lord you are in advance of me she had dropped mrs pagnell and mr weyburn at two suburban houses working upon her aunts dread of the earls interrogations as regarded mr morsfield she had she said chosen to take the journey easily on her return and enjoyed it greatly my lord studied her manner more than her speech he would have interpreted a mans accurately enough he read hers to signify that she had really enjoyed her journey made the best of it and did not intend to be humble about her visit to steignton without his permission but that if hurt at the time she had recovered her spirits and was ready for a shot or twoto be nothing like a pitched battle and she might fire away to her hearts content wordy retorts would not come from him he had material surprises in reserve for her his question concerning morsfield knew its answer and would only be put under pressure comparison of the friends aminta and selina was forced by their standing together and the representation in little selina of the inferiority of the world of women to his aminta he thought of several and splendid women foreign and english the comparison rose sharply now with amintas novel airy homely unchallengeing assumption of an equal footing beside her lord in looks and in tones that had cast off constraint of the adoring handmaid to show the fullblown woman rightful queen of her half of the dominion between the aminta of then and now the difference was marked as between northern and southern women the frozenmouthed northerner and the pearl and rosenipped southerner those who smirk in dropping congealed monosyllables and those who radiantly laugh out the voluble chatter conceiving this to the full in a mind destitute of imagery but indicative of the thing as clearly as the planed unpolished woodwork of a cabinet in a carpenters shop lord ormont liked her the better for the change though she was not the woman whose absence from his house had caused him to go mooning half a night through the streets and though it forewarned him of a tougher bit of battle if battle there was to be he was a close reader of surfaces but in truth the change so notable came of the circumstance that some little way down below the surface he perused where heart weds mind or nature joins intellect for the two to beget a resolution the battle of the man and the woman had been fought and the man beaten chapter xxii treats of the first day of the contention of brother and sister in the contest rageing at midsea still between the man and the woman it is the one who is hard to the attractions of the other that will make choice of the spot and have the advantages a short time earlier lord ormont could have marked it out at his leisure he would have been unable to comprehend why it was denied him to do so now for he was master of himself untroubled by conscience unaware since he was assured of his amintas perfect safety and his restored sense of possession that any taint of softness in him had reversed the condition of their alliance he felt benevolently the much he had to bestow and was about to bestow meanwhile without complicity on his part without his knowledge yet absolutely involving his fate the battle had gone against him in amintas breast like many of his class and kind he was thoroughly acquainted with the physical woman and he took that first and very engrossing volume of the great book of mulier for all the history a powerful wing of imagination strong as the flappers of the great roc of arabian story is needed to lift the known physical woman even a very little way up into azure heavens it is far easier to take a snapshot at the psychic and tumble her down from her fictitious heights to earth the mixing of the two make nonsense of her she was created to attract the man for an excellent purpose in the main we behold her at work incessantly one is a fish to her hook another a moth to her light by the various arts at her disposal she will have us unless early in life we tear away the creatures coloured gauzes and penetrate to her absurdly simple mechanism that done we may if we please dominate her high priests of every religion have successively denounced her as the chief enemy to subdue and bid her minister to our satisfaction is therefore a right employment of mans unperverted superior strength of course we keep to ourselves the woman we prefer but we have to beware of an uxorious preference or we are likely to resemble the irishman with his wolf and dance imprisoned in the hug of our captive for it is the creatures characteristic to be lastingly awake in her moments of utmost slavishness most keenly awake to the chances of the snaring of the stronger be on guard then lord ormont had been on guard then and always his instinct of commandership kept him on guard he was on guard now when his aminta played not the indignant and the frozen but the genially indifferent she did it well he admitted had it been the indignant she played he might have stooped to cajole the handsome queen of gypsies she was without acknowledgement of her right to complain feeling that he was about to be generous he shrugged he meant to speak in deeds lady charlottes house was at the distance of a strollers halfhour across hyde park westward from his own thither he walked a few minutes after noon prepared for cattishness he could fancy that he had hitherto postponed the visit rather on her account considering that he would have to crush her if she humped and spat and he hoped to be allowed to do it gently there would certainly be a scene lady charlotte was at home always at home to you rowsley at any hour mr eglett has driven down to the city there s a doctor in a square theres got a reputation for treating weak children and he has taken down your grandnephew bobby to be inspected poor boy comes of a poor stock on the fathers side mr eglett would have that marriage now he sees wealth isnt everything those benlews are rushlights however elizabeth stood with her father to have robert benlew and this poor child s the result i wonder whether they have consciences my lord prolonged the sibilation of his yes in the way of absentminded men he liked little bobby but had to class the boy second for the present you have our family jewels in your keeping charlotte no i haventand you know i havent rowsley she sprang to arms the perfect porcupine at his opening words as he had anticipated where are the jewels theyre in the cellars of my bankers and safe there you may rely on it i want them i want to have them safe and there they stop you must get them and hand them over to whom to me what for they will be worn by the countess of ormont who s she the lady who bears the title the only countess of ormont i know of is your mother and mine rowsley and shes dead the countess of ormont i speak of is alive lady charlotte squared to him who gives her the title she bears it by right do you mean to say rowsley you have gone and married the woman since we came up from steignton she is my wife anyhow she wont have our family jewels if you had swallowed them youd have to disgorge i dont give up our family jewels to such people do you decline to call on her i do i respect our name and blood you will send the order to your bankers for them to deliver the jewels over to me at my house this day look here rowsley youre gone cracked or senile you re in the hands of one of those clever wenches who catch men of your age she may catch you she shant lay hold of our family jewels they stand for the honour of our name and blood they are to be at my housedoor at four oclock this afternoon theyll not stir then i go down to order your bankers and give them the order my bankers wont attend to it without the order from me you will submit to the summons of my lawyers youre bent on a public scandal are you i am bent on having the jewels they are not yours you ve no claim to them they are heirlooms in our family things most sacred to us are attached to them they belong to our history there s the tiara worn by the first countess of ormont there s the big emerald of the necklacependantyou know the story of it two rubies not counted second to any in england all those diamonds i wore the cross and the two pins the day i was presented after my marriage the present lady ormont will wear them the day she is presented she wont wear them at court she will dont expect the lady ormont of tradesmen and footmen to pass the lord chamberlain that matter will be arranged for next season now i ve done so have i and you have my answer rowsley they quitted their chairs you decline to call on my wife said the earl lady charlotte replied understand me now if the woman has won you round to legitimize the connection first ive a proper claim to see her marriage lines i must have a certificate of her birth i must have a testified account of her life before you met her and got the worst of it then as the case may be i ll call on her you will behave yourself when you call but she wont have our family jewels that affair has been settled by me i should be expecting to hear of them as decorating the person of one of that man morsfields mistresses the earls brow thickened charlotte i smacked your cheek when you were a girl i know you did you might again and i wouldnt cry out she travels with that morsfield you ve seen it he goes boasting of her gypsy or not she s got queer ways i advise you you had better learn at once to speak of her respectfully i shall have enough to go through if what you says true with questions of the womans antecedents and her people and the date of the day of this marriage when was the day you did it i shall have to give an answer you know cousins of ours and the way they ll be pressing and comparing ages and bawling rumours none of them imagined my brother such a fool as to be wheedled into marrying her you say its done rowsley was it done yesterday or the day before lord ormont found unexpectedly that she struck on a weak point married from the first why not tell me of it he could hear her voice as if she had spoken the words and how communicate the pellmell of reasons youre running vixen the demand i make is for the jewels he said you wont have them rowsleynot for her you think of compelling me to use force try it you swear the jewels are with your bankers i left them in charge of my bankers and theyve not been moved by me well it must be force nothing short of it when the honour of our familys concerned it was rather worse than the anticipated struggle with this charlotte though he had kept his temper the error was in supposing that an hours sharp conflict would settle it as he saw the jewels required a siege when does eglett return he asked back to lunch you stay and lunch here rowsley we dont often have you the earl contemplated her measuring her powers of resistance for a prolonged engagement odd that the pride which had withdrawn him from the service of an offending country should pitch him into a series of tussles with women for its own confusion he saw that too in his dim reflectiveness and held the country answerable for it mr eglett was taken into confidence by him privately after lunch mr egletts position between the brother and sister was perplexing habitually he thought his wife had strong good sense in spite of the costliness of certain actions at law not invariably confirming his opinion he thought also that the earls demand must needs be considered obediently at the same time his wifes objections to the new countess of ormont unmasked upon the world seemed very legitimate though it might be asked why the earl should not marry marrying the lady who pleased him but if in the words of his wife the lady had no claim to be called a lady the marriage was deplorable on the other hand lord ormont spoke of her in terms of esteem and he was no fondling dotard how to compromise the matter for the sake of peace the man perpetually plunged into strife by his combative spouse cried the familiar question again and at every suggestion of his on behalf of concord he heard from lady charlotte that he had no principles or else from lord ormont that his head must be off his shoulders the man for peace had the smallest supply of language and so unless he took a side and fought his active part was football between them it went on through the afternoon up to five oclock no impression was betrayed by lady charlotte she congratulated her brother on the recruit he had enlisted he smiled his grimmest of the lips drawn in a combat perceptibly of some extension would soon give him command of the man of peace and energy to continue attacks will break down the energies of any dogged defensive stand he deferred the discussion with his unreasonable sister until the next day at halfpast twelve oclock lady charlotte nodded to the appointment she would have congratulated herself without irony on the result of the first days altercation but for her brother rowsleys unusual and ominous display of patience twice during the wrangle she had to conceal a difficult breathing she felt a numbness in one arm now it was over and mentally complimented her london physician on the unerringness of his diagnosis her heart however complained of the cruelty of having in the end perhaps if the wrangle should be protracted to yield for sheer weakness without ceasing to beat chapter xxiii the ormont jewels at halfpast twelve of the noon next day lord ormont was at lady charlottes house door she welcomed him affectionately as if nothing were in dispute he nodded an acceptance of her greetings with a blunt intimation of the business to be settled she put on her hump of the feline defensive then his batteries opened fire and hers barked back on him each won admiration of the others tenacity all the more determined to sap or split it they had known one anothers character but they had never seen it in such strong light never had their mutual and similar though opposed resources been drawn out so copiously and unreservedly this was the shining scrawl of all that each could do to gain a fight they admired one anothers contemptibly justifiable evasions changes of front statements bordering the lie even to meanness in the withdrawal of admissions and the denial of the same ever having been made that was charlotte that was rowsley anything to beat down the adversary as to will the womans will of these two equalled the mans they were matched in obstinacy and unscrupulousness her ingenuitics of the defence eluded his attacks and compelled him to fall on heavy iteration of his demand for the jewels an immediate restitution of the jewels why immediate cried she he repeated it without replying to her but you tell me rowsley why immediate if youre in want of money for her you come to me tell me you shall have thousands ill drive down to the city tomorrow and sell out stock mr eglett wont mind when he hears the purpose i shall call five thousand cheap and dont ask to see the money again ah double the sum to have your own way said he she protested that she valued her money she furnished instances of her carefulness of her money all along up to the present period of brutal old age yet she would willingly part with five thousand or more to save the family honour mr eglett would not only approve he would probably advance a good part of the money himself money who wants money thundered the earl and jumped out of her trap of the further diversion from the plain request tomorrow when i am here i shall expect to have the jewels delivered to me that you may hand them over to her where are they likely to be this time next year and what do you know about jewels you may look at them when you ask to see them and not know imitation pastelike the stuff lady beltus showed her old husband our mother wore them and she prized them im not sure i wouldnt rather hear they were exhibited in a bond street jewellers shop or a piccadilly pawnbrokers than have them on that woman you speak of my wife for a season perhaps and off theyre likely to go to pay bills if her adderwoods and her morsfields are out of funds as they call it you are aware you are speaking of my wife charlotte you darent say my sisterinlaw he did not choose to say it and once more she dared him she could imagine she scored a point they were summoned to lunch by mr eglett and there was an hours armistice following which the earl demanded the restitution of the jewels and heard the singular question childishly accentuated what for patience was his weapon and support so he named his object with an air of inveteracy in tranquillity they were for his wife to wear lady charlotte dared him to say they were for her sisterinlaw he despised the transparent artifice of the challenge but you have to own the difference she said you havent lost respect for your family thank god no it s one thing to say she s a wife you hang fire when it s to say she s my sisterinlaw youll have to admit the fact charlotte how long is it since i should have had to admit the fact from the date of my marriage tell me the date no you dont wear a wig charlotte but you are fit to practise in the lawcourts he said exasperatedly jocular she had started a fresh diversion and she pressed him for the date i m supposed to have had a sisterinlawhow many weeksmonths years married years and if youve been married years where were you married not in a church that womans no churchbride there are some clever women made idiots of by their trullish tempers abuse away ive asked you where you were married rowsley go to madrid go to the embassy apply to the chaplain married in madrid whos ever married in madrid you flung her a yellow handkerchief and she tied it round her neckthat s your ceremony now you tell me youve been married years and shes a young woman you fetch her over from madrid set her in a place where those morsfields and other fungifellows grow and she has to think herself lucky to be received by a lady staines and a mrs lawrence finchley and she the talk of the town refused at court for all an honourableenough old woman countenanced her in pity and i m asked to believe she was my brothers wife sisterinlaw of mine all the while i wont lady charlotte dilated on it for a length of time merely to show she declined to believe it pouring morsfield over him and the talk of the town the gypsy caught in spainnow to be foisted on her as her sisterinlaw she could fancy she produced an effect she did indeed unveil to him a portion of the sufferings his aminta had undergone as visibly too the good argumentative reasons for his previous avoidance of the deadly dismal wrangle here forced on him a truly dismal profitless wrangle but the finish of it would be the beginning of some solace to his aminta the finish of it must be tomorrow he refrained from saying so and simply appointed tomorrow for the resumption of the wrestle departing in his invincible coat of patience which one has to wear when dealing with a woman like charlotte he informed mr eglett on his way out at a later hour than on the foregone day mr eglett was of his opinion that an introduction of lawyers into a family dispute was rats in the pantry and he would have joined him in his gloomy laugh if the thought of charlotte in a contention had not been so serious a matter she might be beaten she could not be brought to yield she retired to her bedroom and laid herself flat on her bed immoveable till her maid undressed her for the night a cup of broth and strip of toast formed her sole nourishment as for her doctors possible reproaches the symptoms might crowd and do their worst she fought for the honour of her family at midday of the third day lady charlotte was reduced to the condition of those fortresses which wave defiantly the flag but deliver no further shot awaiting the assault her body affected by hideous old age succumbed her will was unshaken she would not write to her bankers mr eglett might go to them if he thought fit rowsley was to understand that he might call himself married she would have no flowerbasket bunch of a sisterinlaw thrust upon her lord ormont and mr eglett walked down to her bankers in the afternoon as a consequence of express injunctions given by my lady five years previously the assistantmanager sought an interview with her the jewels were lodged at her house the day ensuing they were examined verified by the list in lady charlottes family recordbook and then taken awayforcibly of courseby her brother he laughed in his dry manner but the reminiscent glimpses helping him to see the humour of it stirred sensations of the tug it had been with that combative charlotte and excused him for having shrunk from the encounter until he conceived it to be necessary settlement of the affair with morsfield now claimed his attention the ironical tolerance he practised in relation to morsfield when aminta had no definite station before the world changed to an angry irritability at the mans behaviour now that she had stepped forth under his acknowledgement of her as the countess of ormont he had come round to a rather healthier mind regarding his country and his introduction of the countess of ormont to the world was his peaceoffering as he returned home earlier on the third day he found his diligent secretary at work the calling on captain may and the writing to the sort of man were acts obnoxious to his dignity so he despatched weyburn to the captains house one in a small street of three narrow tenements abutting on aristocracy and terminating in mews weyburns mission was to give the earls address at great marlow for the succeeding days and to see captain may if the captain was at home during his absence the precious family jewelbox was locked in safety aminta and her friend little miss collett were out driving by the secretarys report the earl considered it a wholesome feature of amintas character that she should have held to her modest schoolmate the fact spoke well for both of them a look at the papers to serve for memoirs was discomposing and led him to think the secretary could be parted with as soon as he pleased to go say a week hence the memoirs were no longer designed for issue he had the impulse to treat them on the spot as the plan for the defence of the country had been treated and for absolutely obverse reasons the secretary and the memoirs were associated one had sprung out of the other moreover the secretary had witnessed a scene at steignton the young man had done his duty and would be thanked for that and dismissed with a touch of his employers hand the young man would have made a good soldiera better soldier good as he might be as a scribe he ought to have been in his fathers footsteps and he would then have disciplined or quashed his fantastical ideas perhaps he was right on the point of toning the memoirs here and there since the scene at steignton lord ormonts views had changed markedly in relation to everybody about him and most things weyburn came back at the end of an hour to say that he had left the address with mrs may whom he had seen a handsome person the earl observed she must have been very handsome said weyburn ah we fall into their fictions or life would be a bald business upon my word lord ormont had not uttered it before the sentiment of his greater luck with one of that queer world of the female lottery went through him on a swell of satisfaction just a wave an oldworld eye upon women it seemed to weyburn but the man who could crown a long term of cruel injustice with the harshness to his wife at steignton would naturally behold women with that eye however he was allowed only to generalize he could not trust himself to dwell on lady ormont and the aminta inside the shell aminta and lady ormont might think as one or diversely of the executioners blow she had undergone she was a married woman and she probably regarded the wedding by law as the end a woman has to aim at and is annihilated by hitting one flash of success and then extinction like a boys cracker on the pavement not an elevated image but closely resembling that which her alliance with lord ormont had been at the same time no true lover of a woman advises herimploring is horrible treasonto slip the symbolic circle of the law from her finger and have in an instant the world for her enemy she must consent to be annihilated and must have no feelings particularly no mind the mind is the danger for her if she has a mind alive she will certainly push for the position to exercise it and run the risk of a classing with natures created mates for reptile men besides lady ormont appeared in the company of her friend selina collett not worse than rather too thoughtful not distinctly unhappy and she was conversable smiling she might have had an explanation with my lord accepting excusesor who knows taking the blame and offering them weakness is pliable so pliable is it that it has been known for a crack of the masterly whip to fling off the victim and put on the culprit ay but let it be as it may with lady ormont aminta is of a different composition amintas eyes of the return journey to london were haunting lights and lured him to speculate and for her sake he rejected the thought that for him they meant anything warmer than the passing thankfulness though they were a novel assurance to him of her possession beneath her smothering cloud of the power to resolve and show forth a brilliant individuality the departure of the ladies and my lord in the travelling carriage for the house on the upper thames was passably sweetened to weyburn by the command to him to follow in a day or two and continue his work there until he left england aminta would not hear of an abandonment of the memoirs she spoke on the subject to my lord as to a husband pardoned she was not less affable and pleasant with him out of weyburns hearing my lord earned her gratitude for his behaviour to selina collett to whom he talked interestedly of her favourite pursuit as he had done on the day when as he was not the man to forget her arrival relieved him of anxiety aminta noticed the box on the seat beside him they drove up to their country house in time to dress leisurely for dinner nevertheless the dinnerhour had struck several minutes before she descended and the earl as if not expecting her was out on the garden path beside the river bank with selina she beckoned from the step of the open french window he came to her at little selinas shuffling pace conversing upon waterplants no jewelry today he said and aminta replied carstairs has shown me the box and given the key i have not opened it time in the evening or tomorrow you guess the contents i presume i do she looked feverish and shadowed he murmured kindly anything not now we will dine she had missed had lost she feared her own jewelbox a casket of no great treasure to others but of a largely estimable importance to her after the heavy ceremonial entrance and exit of dishes she begged the earl to accompany her for an examination of the contents of the box as soon as her chamberdoor was shut she said in accents of alarm mine has disappeared carstairs i know is to be trusted she remembers carrying the box out of my room she believes she can remember putting it into the fly she had to confess that it had vanished without her knowing how when my boxes were unpacked is she very much upset said the earl carstairs why yes poor creature you can imagine i have no doubt she feels for me and her own reputation is concerned what do you think is best to be done to be done overhaul the baggage again in all the rooms weve not failed to do that control yourself my dear if by bad luck theyre lost we can replace them the contents of this box now we could not replace open it and judge i have no curiosityforgive me i beg and the servants fly has been visited ransacked inside and out footmen questioned we have not left anything we can conceive of undone my lord will you suggest the intrinsic value of the gems would not be worthnot worth amintas one beat of the heart upon my wordnot one an amatory knightly compliment breasting her perturbation roused an unwonted spite and a swift reflection on it startled her with a suspicion she cast it behind her he could be angler and fish he would not be cat and mouse she said however more temperately it is not the value of the gems we are losing precious minutes association of them with the giver is it that if that has a value for you he is flattered this betrayed him to the woman waxing as intensely susceptible in all her being as powder to sparks there is to be no misunderstanding my lord she said i likei value my jewels buti am alarmed lest the box should fall into handsinto strange hands the box he exclaimed with an outline of a comic grimace and if proved a voluptuary in torturing he could instance half a dozen points for extenuation her charm of person withheld from him and to be embraced her innocent naughtiness compensation coming to her in excess for a transient infliction of pain your anxiety is about the box yes the box aminta said firmly it contains no false jewels a thief might complain it contains letters my lord blackmail you would be at liberty to read them i would rather they were burnt ah the earl heaved his chest prodigiously blackmail letters are better in a husbands hands if they can be laid there if there is a necessity for him to read themyes there may be a necessity there cant be a gratificationthough there are dogs of thick blood that like to scratch their sores he murmured to himself you used to show me these declaration epistles not the names not the namesno when we had left the country i showed you why it had been my wish to go xarifa was and is female honour take the key open that box i will make inquiries but my dear you guess everything your little box was removed for the bigger impression to be produced by this one a flash came out of her dark eyes no you guess wrong this time you clever shrew i wormed nothing from you said he i knew you kept particular letters in that receptacle of things of price aminta cant conceal the man has worried you why not have come to me oblige me my lord by restoring me my box this is your box her bosom lifted with the words oh no unspoken he took the key and opened the box a dazzling tray of stones was revealed underneath it the constellations in cases very heavens for the worldly eve and he doubted that eve could have gone completely out of her but she had as observation instructed him set her womans mind on something else and must have it before letting her eyes fall on objects impossible for any of her sex to see without coveting them he bowed i will fetch it he said magnanimously her own box was brought from his room she then consented to look womanly at the ormont jewels over which the battle whereof she knew nothing and nothing could be told her had been fought in her interests for her sovereign pleasure she looked and admired they were beautiful jewels the great emerald was wonderful and there were two rubies to praise she excused herself for declining to put the circlet for the pendant round her neck or a glittering ring on her finger her remarks were encomiums not quite so cold as those of a provincial spinster of an ascetic turn at an exhibition of the worlds flycatcher gewgaws he had divided aminta from the countess of ormont and it was the wary aminta who set a guard on looks and tones before the spectacle of his noble bounty lest any the smallest payment of the dues of the countess should be demanded rightly interpreting him to be by nature incapable of asking pardon or acknowledging a wrong done by him however much he might crave exemption from blame and seek for peace she kept to her mask of injury though she hated unforgivingness and she felt it little she did it easily because her heart was dead to the man my lords hand touched her on her shoulder propitiatingly in some degree in his dumb way offended women can be emotional to a towering pride that bends while it assumes unbendingness it must come to their sensations as it were a sign of humanity in the majestic speechless king of beasts and they are pathetically melted abjectly hypocritical a nice confusion of sentiments traceable to a tender bosoms appreciation of strength and the perceptive compassion for its mortality in a case of the alienated wife whose blood is running another way no foul snakes bite is more poisonous than that indicatory touch however simple and slight my lords hand lightly laid on amintas shoulder became sensible of soft warm flesh stiffening to the skeleton chapter xxiv lovers mated he was benevolently martial to the extent of paternal in thinking his girl of whom he deigned to think now as his countess pardonably foolish woman for woman she was of a pattern superior to the worlds ordinary and might run the worlds elect a race but she was pitifully womanlike in her increase of dissatisfaction with the more she got women are happier enslaved men too if their despot is an ormont colonel of his regiment he proved that his men would follow him anywhere do anything grand old days before he was condemned by one knows not what extraordinary round of circumstances to cogitate on women as fluids and how to cut channels for them that they may course along in the direction good for them imagining it their pretty wanton will to go that way napoleons treatment of women is excellent example peterboroughs can be defended his aminta could not reason she nursed a rancour on account of the blow she drew on herself at steignton and she declined consolation in her being pardoned the reconcilement evidently was proposed as a finale of one of the detestable feminine storms enveloping men weak enough to let themselves be dragged through a scene for the sake of domestic tranquillity a remarkable exhibition of aminta the woman was her entire change of front since he had taken her spousal chill formerly she was passive merely stately the chiselled grande dame deferential in her bearing and speech even when argumentative and having an opinion to plant she had always the independent eye and step she now had the tongue of the graceful and native great lady fitted to rule her circle and hold her place beside the proudest of the ormonts she bore well the small shuffle with her jewelboxheld herself gallantly there had been no female feignings either affected misapprehensions gapy ignorances and snaky subterfuges and the like familiar to men who have the gentle twister in grip straight on the line of the thing to be seen she flew and struck on it and that is a womans martial action he would right heartily have called her comrade if he had been active himself a warrior pulled off his horse to sit in a chair and contemplate the minute evolutions of the sex is pettish with his part in such battlefields at the stage beyond amusement seen swimming she charmed him abstract views of a woman summon opposite advocates one can never say positively that is she but the visible fair form of a woman is hereditary queen of us we have none of your pleadings and counterpleadings and judicial summaries to obstruct a ravenous loyalty my lord beheld aminta take her three quick steps on the plank and spring and dive and ascend shaking the ends of her bound black locks and away she went with shut mouth and broad stroke of her arms into the sunny early morning river brave to see although he had to flick a bee of a question why he enjoyed the privilege of seeing and was not beside her the only answer confessed to a distaste for all exercise once pleasurable she and her little friend boated or strolled through the meadows during the day he fished when he and aminta rode out for the hour before dinner she seemed pleased she was amicable conversable all that was agreeable as a woman and she was the chillest of wives my lords observations and reflections came to one conclusion she pricked and challenged him to lead up to her desired stormy scene he met her and meant to vanquish her with the dominating patience charlotte had found too much for her women cannot stand against it to be patient in contention with women however one must have a continuous and an exclusive occupation and the tax it lays on us conduces usually to impatience with men my lord did not directly connect amintas chillness and morsfields impudence yet the sensation roused by his aminta participated in the desire to punish morsfield speedily without wishing for a duel he was moved by the social sanction it had to consider whether green youths and women might not think a grey head had delayed it too long the practice of the duel begot the peculiar animal logic of the nobler savage which tends to magnify an offence in the ratio of our vanity and hunger for a blood that is not demanded by the appetite moreover a waning practice in disfavour with the new generation will be commended to the conservative barbarian as partaking of the wisdom of his fathers further too we may have grown slothful fallen to moodiness done excess of service to omphale our tyrant lady of the glow and the chill and then undoubtedly the duel braces he left aminta for london submissive to the terms of intimacy dictated by her demeanour his unacknowledged seniority rendering their harshness less hard to endure she had not gratified him with a display of her person in the glitter of the ormont jewels and since he was under common conditions a speechless man his ineptitude for amorous remonstrances precipitated him upon deeds that he might offer additional proofs of his esteem and the assurance of her established position as his countess he proposed to engage lady charlotte in a conflict severer than the foregoing until he brought her to pay the ceremonial visit to her sisterinlaw the count of time for this final trial of his masterfulness he calculated at a week it would be an occupation miserable occupation though it was he hailed the prospect of chastising morsfield for a proof that his tussels with women prolonged study of their tricks manoeuvrings and outwittings of them had not emasculated him aminta willingly promised to write from day to day her senses had his absence insured to them by her anticipation of the task she did not conceive it would be so ponderous a task what to write to him when nothing occurred nothing did occur unless the arrival of mr weyburn was to be named an event she alluded to it mr weyburn has come expecting to find you here the dispatchbox is here is he to await you that innocent little question was a day gained one day of boating on the upper reaches of the pastoral river and walks in woods and golden meadows was felicity fallen on earth the ripe fruit of dreams a dread surrounded it as a belt not shadowing the horizon and she clasped it to her heart the more passionately like a mother her rosy infant which a dark world threatens and the universal fate love as it will be at her june of life was teaching her to know the good and bad of herself women educated to embrace principles through their timidity and their pudency discover amazed that these are not lasting qualities under loves influence the blushes and the fears take flight the principles depend much on the beloved is he a man whose contact with the world has given him understanding of lifes laws and can hold him firm to the right course in the strain and whirling of a torrent they cling to him deeply they worship and if they tempt him it is not advisedly done nature and love are busy in conjunction the timidities and pudencies have flown they may hover they are not present you deplore it you must not blame you have educated them so muscular principles are sown only out in the world and on the whole with all their errors the worldly men are the truest as well as the bravest of men her faith in his guidance was equal to her dependence the retrospect of a recent journey told her how he had been tried she could gaze tenderly betray her heart and be certain of safety can wine match that for joy she had no schemes no hopes but simply the desire to bestow the capacity to believe any wish to be enfolded by him was shapeless and unlighted unborn though now and again for some chance word or undefined thought she surprised the strange tenant of her breast at an incomprehensibly faster beat and knew it for her own and not her own the familiar the strangeran utter stranger as one who had snared her in a wreath and was pulling her off her feet she was not so guileless at the thought of little selina collett here and of selina as the letterbearer of old and the marvel that matey and browny and selina were together after all was it not a kind of summons to her to call him matey just once only once in play she burned and ached to do it she might have taxed her ingenuity successfully to induce little selina to the boldness of calling him mateyand she then repeating it as the woman who revived with a meditative effort recollections of the girl ah frightful hypocrite thoughts of the pleasure of his name aloud on her lips in his hearing dissolved through her veins and were met by matthew weyburns open face before which hypocrisy stood rent and stripped she preferred the calmer the truer pleasure of seeing him modestly take lessons in the nomenclature of weeds herbs grasses by hedge and ditch selina could instruct him as well in entomology but he knew better the swiss tyrolese and italian valleyhomes of beetle and butterfly species their simple talk was a cool zephyr fanning aminta the suggestion to unite the two came to her of course but their physical disparity denied her that chance to settle her own difficulty and a whisper of one physically the match for him punished her in stature in healthfulness they were equals perhaps not morally or intellectually and she could claim headship of him on one little point confided to her by his mother who was bearing him and startled by the boom of guns under her pillow when her husband fronted the enemy matthew weyburn the fencer boxer cricketer hunter all things manly rather shrank from firearmsat least one saw him put on a screw to manipulate them in dangeramong brigands or mutineers for exampleshe could stand by him and prove herself his mate intellectually morally she had to bow humbly nor had she nor could she do more than lean on and catch example from his prompt spiritual valiancy it shone out from him and a crisis fulfilled the promise who could be his mate for cheerful courage for skill the ready mind easy adroitness and for selfcommand to imitate was a womans utmost matthew weyburn appeared the very matey of the first of may cricketing day among cupers boys the next morning when seen pacing down the gardenwalk he wore his white trousers of that happiest of old daysthe white ducks aminta and selina remembered selina beamed yes he did he always wore them but now its a frockcoat instead of a jacket but now he will be a master instead of a schoolboy said aminta let us hope he will prosper he gives me the idea of a man who must succeed selina said and she was patted rallied asked how she had the idea and kissed aminta saying she fancied it might be thought for he looked so confident only not what the boys used to call cocky said selina he wont be contemptuous of those he outstrips his choice of the schoolmasters profession points to a modesty in him does it not little woman he made me tell him while you were writing your letters yesterday all about my brother and his prospects yes that is like him and i must hear of your brother little collett dont forget sely little collett was our postman the countess of ormonts humorous reference to the circumstance passed with selina for a sign of a poetic love of the past and a present social elevation that allowed her to review it impassively she admired the great lady and good friend who could really be interested in the fortunes of a mere schoolmaster and a merchants clerk to her astonishment by some agency beyond her fathoming she found herself and hardly for her own pleasure pushing the young schoolmaster animatedly to have an account of his aims in the establishment of the foreign school weyburn smiled he set a short look at aminta and she conscious of her detected diplomacy had an inward shiver mixed of the fascination and repugnance felt by a woman who knows that under one mans eyes her character is naked and anatomized her characterher soul he held it in hand and probed it mercifully she had felt the sweet sting again and again and had shrunk from him and had crawled to him the love of him made it all fascination how did he learn to read at any moment right to the soul of a woman did experience teach him or sentimental sympathy he was too young he was too manly it must be because of his being in heart and mind the brother to the sister with women thames played round them on his pastoral pipes beenote and woodside blackbird and meadow cow and the fish of the silver rolling rings composed the leap of the music she gave her mind to his voice following whither it went half was in air higher than the swallows exalting him how is it he is the brother of women they are sisters for him because he is neither sentimentalist nor devourer he will not flatter to feed on them the one he chooses she will know love there are women who go through life not knowing love they are inanimate automatic machines who lay them down at last inquiring wherefore they were caused to move she is not of that sad flock she will be mated she will have the right to call him matey a certain browny called him matey she lived and died a certain woman apes brownys features and inherits her passion but has forfeited her rights were she under happiest conditions to put her hand in his shame would burn her for he is justhe is justice and a woman bringing him less than his due she must be a creature of the slime this was the shadowy sentiment that made the wall of division between them there was no other lord ormont had struck to fragments that barrier of the conventional oath and ceremonial union he was unjusthe was injustice the weak may be wedded they cannot be married to injustice and if we have the world for the buttress of injustice then is nature the flaring rebel there is no fixed order possible laws are necessary instruments of the majority but when they grind the sane human being to dust for their maintenance their enthronement is the rule of the savages old deity sniffing bloodsacrifice there cannot be a based society upon such conditions an immolation of the naturally constituted individual arrests the general expansion to which we step decivilizes more and is more impious to the god in man than temporary revelries of a licence that nature soon checks arrows of thoughts resembling these shot over the half of amintas mind not listening her lovers head was active on the same theme while he spoke they converged to it from looks crossing or catching profiles or from tones from a motion of hand from a chance word insomuch that the third person present was kept unobservant only by her studious and humble speculations on the young schoolmasters grand project to bring the nationalities together and teach old england to the continentthe continent to old england our healthy games our scorn of the lie manliness their intellectual valour diligence considerate manners just to name a few of the things for interchange said weyburn as to method we shall be their disciples but i look forward to our fellows getting the lead no hurry why will they you ask in petto well they re emulous and they take a thrashing kindly that s the way to learn a lesson i ve seen our fellows beaten and beatennever the courage beaten out of them in the end they won and kept the field they have a lot to learnprincipally not to be afraid of ideas they lose heaps of time before they can feel at home with ideas they call themselves practical for having an addiction to the palpable it is a pretty wreath they clap on their deficiencies practical dogs are for bones horses for corn i want the practical englishman to settle his muzzle in a nosebag of ideas when he has once got hold of them he makes good stuff of them on the continent ideas have wings and pay visits here theyre stayathome then i want our fellows to have the habit of speaking from the chest they shall return to england with the whoop of the mountains in them and ready to jump out they shall have an achillean roar and they shall sing by second nature dont fear theyll give double for anything they take ive known italians to whom an englishmans honesty of mind and dealing was one of the dreams of a better humanity they had put in a box frenchmen too who when they came to know us were astonished at their epithet of perfide and loved us emile said aminta you remember emile selina the dear little french boy at mr cupers oh i do selina responded he will work with mr weyburn in switzerland oh that will be nice the girl exclaimed aminta squeezed selinas hand a shower of tears clouded her eyes she chose to fancy it was because of her envy of the modest busy peaceful girl who envied none conquers also sincerity in the sincerest she was vexed with her full breast and had as little command of her thoughts as of her feelings mr weyburn has ideas for the education of girls too she said theres the task said he its to separate them as little as possible all thepassezmoi le motdevilry between the sexes begins at their separation they re foreigners when they meet and their alliances are not always binding the chief object in life if happiness be the aim and the growing better than we are is to teach men and women how to be one for if they re not then each is a morsel for the other to prey on lady charlotte egletts view is that the greater number of them on both sides hate one another hate exclaimed selina and aminta said is lady charlotte eglett an authority she has observed and she thinks she has in the abstract the justest of minds and that is the curious point about her but one may say they are trained at present to be hostile some of them fall in love and strike a truce and still they are foreigners they have not the same standard of honour they might have it from an education in common but there must be also a lady to govern the girls selina interposed ah yes she is not yet found would it increase their mutual respector show of respect if you like said aminta with his last remark at work as the shattering bell of a citys insurrection in her breast in time under management catching and grouping them young a boy who sees a girl do what he cant and would like to do wont take refuge in his muscular superioritywhich by the way would be lessened you suppose their capacities are equal things are not equal i suppose their excellencies to make a pretty nearly equal sum in the end but we re not weighing them each the question concerns the advantage of both that seems just aminta threw no voice into the word just it was the word of the heavens assuaging earths thirst and she was earth to him her soul yearned to the man whose mind conceived it she said to selina we must plan an expedition next year or the year after and see how the school progresses all three smiled and selina touched and held amintas hand shyly visions of the unseen switzerland awed her weyburn named the spring holiday time the season of the flowering alpine robes he promised welcome pressed for a promise of the visit warmly it was given we will we will indeed i shall look forward he said there was nothing else for him or for her except to doat on the passing minute that slipped when seized the looking forward turned them to the looking back at the point they had flown from and yielded a momentary pleasure enough to stamp some section of a picture on their memories which was not the burning now love lives for in the clasp if but of hands desire of it destroyed it they swung to the future swung to the present it made the past sensible to the quick of the now they could not hold they were lovers divided lovers in presence they thought and they felt in pieces feelings and thoughts were forbidden to speech she dared look the very little of her hearts fulness without the disloyalty it would have been in him to let a small peep of his heart be seen while her hand was not clasped she could look tenderly and her fettered state her sense of unworthiness muffled in the deeps would keep her from the loosening to passion he who read through her lustrous transiently dwelling eyes had not that security his part besides the watch over the spring of his hot blood was to combat a host insidious among which was unreason calling her browny urging him to take his own to snatch her from a possessor who forfeited by undervaluing her this was the truth in a betterordered world she belonged to the man who could help her to grow and to do her work but in the world we have around us it was the distorted truth and keeping passion down he was able to wish her such happiness as pertained to safety from shipwreck and for himself that he might continue to walk in the ranks of the sober citizens oh true and right but she was gloriously beautiful day by day she surpassed the wondrous browny of old days all women were eclipsed by her she was that fire in the night which lights the night and draws the night to look at it and more this queen of women was beginning to have a mind at work one saw already the sprouting of a mind repressed she had a distinct ability the good ambition to use her qualities she needed life and airthat is comprehension of her encouragement the companion mate with what strength would she now endow him the pride in the sharp imagination of possessing her whispered a boast of the strength her mate would have from her his need and her need rushed together somewhere down the skies they could not he argued be separated eternally he had to leave her selina shocked at a boldness she could not understand in herself begged him to stay and tell her of switzerland and alpine flowers and herbs and the valleys for the gold beetle and the apollo butterfly aminta hinted that lord ormont might expect to find him there if he came the next morning but she would not try to persuade and left the decision with him loving him for the pain he inflicted by going why indeed should he stay both could ask they were one in asking anguish balanced pleasure in them both the day of the pleasure was heaven to remember heaven to hope for not so heavenly to pray for the praying for it each knew implored their joint will to decree the perilous blessing a shadowy sentiment of duty and rectitude born of what they had suffered hung between them and the prayer for a renewal that would renew the tempting they were conscious of when the sweet the strained throbbing day was over they could hope for chance to renew it and then they would be irresponsible then they would think and wish discreetly so as to have it a happiness untainted in refusing now to take another day or pray for it they deserved that chance should grant it aminta had said through selina the utmost her selfdefences could allow but the idea of a final parting cut too cruelly into her life and she murmured i shall see you before you go for good i will come here or in london i can trust quite certain a meeting of a few hasty minutes involved none of the dangers of a sunny long summer day and if it did the heart had its claims the heart had its powers of resistance otherwise we should be base verily he turned on a bow to leave her before there was a motion for the offer of her hand after many musings and frettings she reached the wisdom of that wisdom was her only nourishment now a cold lean dietary it is but he dispensed it and it fed her or kept her alive it became a proud feeling that she had been his fellow in the achievement of a piece of wisdom though the other feeling that his hands kind formal touching without pressure of hers would have warmed her to go through the next interview with her lord mocked at pure satisfaction did he distrust himself or was it to spare her but if so her heart was quite bare to him but she knew it was aminta drove her questioning heart as a vessel across blank circles of sea where there was nothing save the solitary heart for answer it answered intelligibly and comfortingly at last telling her of proof given that she could repose under his guidance with absolute faith was ever loved woman more blest than she in such belief she had it firmly and a blessedness too in this surety wavering beneath shadows of the uncertainty her eyes knew it her ears were empty of the words her heart knew it and it was unconfirmed by reason as for his venturing to love her he feared none and no sooner did that reflection surge than she stood up beside him in revolt against her lion and lord her instinct judged it impossible she could ever have yielded her heart to a man lacking courage hencewhat when cowardice appeared as the sole impediment to happiness now he had gone and the day lived again for both of thema day of sheer gold in the translation from troubled earth to the mind one anothers beauty through the visage into the character was newly perceived and worshipped and the beauties of pastoral thames the temple of peace hardly noticed in the passing of the daytaken as air to the breather until some chip of the scene round which an emotion had curled was vivid foreground and gateway to shrouded romance it might be the streams white face browning into willowdroopers or a wagtail on a waterlily leaf or the forehorse of an upriver barge at strain of legs a redfinned perch hung a foot above the pebbles in sunveined depths a kingfisher on the scud under alders the forest of the bankside weeds chapter xxv preparations for a resolve that day receded like a spent billow and lapsed among the others advancing but it left a print deeper than events would have stamped amintas pen declined to run to her lord and the dipping it in ink was no acceleration of the process a sentence bearing likeness to an artless infants trot of the halfdozen steps to mothers lap stumbled upon the full stop midway desperate determination pushed it along and there was in consequence a dead stop at the head of the next sentence a woman whose nature is insurgent against the majesty of the man to whom she must among the singular injunctions binding her regularly write sees no way between hypocrisy and rebellion for rebellion she with the pen in her hand is avowedly not yet ripe hypocrisy is abominable if she abstained from writing he might travel down to learn the cause a similar danger or worse haunted the writing frigidly she had to be the hypocrite or elseleap but an honest woman who is a feeling woman when she consents to play hypocrite cannot do it by halves from writing a short cold letter aminta wrote a short warm one or very friendly length she could avoid because she was unable to fill a page it seemed that she could not compose a friendly few lines without letting her sex be felt in them what she had put away from her so as not to feel it herself the simulation of ever so small a bit of feeling brought prominently back and where she had made a cast for flowing independent simplicity she was feminine ultrafeminine to her reading of it better take the leap than be guilty of doubledealing even on paper the nature of the leap she did not examine her keen apprehension of the price payable for his benevolent intentions caught scent of them in the air those ormont jewels shone as emblems of a detested subjection the penalty for being the beautiful woman rageing men proclaimed was there no scheme of some other sort and far less agreeable to make amends for steignton she was shrewd at divination she guessed her lords design rather than meet lady charlotte she proposed to herself the leap immediately knowing it must be a leap in the dark hoping it might be into a swimmers water she had her own pinmoney income and she loathed the chain of her title so the leap would at least be honourable as it assuredly would be unregretted whatever ensued while amintas heart held on to this debate and in her bed in her boat across the golden valley meadows beside her peaceful little friend she gathered a gradual resolution without sight of agencies or consequences lord ormont was kept from her by the struggle to master his charlotte a second timecompared with which the first was insignificant and this time it was curious he could not subdue her physique as he did before she was ready for him each day and she was animated much more voluble she was ready to jest the reason being that she fought now on plausibly good grounds on behalf of her independent action previously her intelligence of the ultimate defeat hanging over the more stubborn defence of a weak position had harassed her to deaths door she had no right to retain the family jewels she had the most perfect of established rights to refuse doing an ignominious thing she refused to visit the socalled countess of ormont or leave her card or take one step to warrant the woman in speaking of her as her sisterinlaw and noit did not signify that her brother rowsley was prohibited by her from marrying whom he pleased it meant that to judge of his acts as those of a reasoning man he would have introduced his wife to his relativesthe relatives he had not quarrelled withimmediately upon his marriage unless he was ashamed of the woman and a wife he was ashamed of was no sisterinlaw for her nor aunt for her daughters nor should she come playing the black venus among her daughters husbands lady charlotte had it in her bosom to say additionally lord ormont was disconcerted by her manifest pleasure in receiving him every day evidently she consented to the recurrence of a vexatious dissension for the enjoyment of having him with her hourly her dialectic too was cunning impetuous with meaning she forced her way to get her meaning out in a manner effective to strike her blow anything for a diversion or a triumph of the moment he made no way she was the better fencer at the tongue yet there was not any abatement of her deference to her brother and this little misunderstanding put aside he was the rowsley esteemed by her as the chief of men she foiled him it might seem to exalt him the more after he had left the house visibly annoyed and somewhat stupefied she talked of him to her husband of the soul of chivalry rowsley was the loss to his country mr eglett was a witness to one of the altercations when she having as usual the dialectical advantage praised her brother to his face for his magnanimous nature regretting only that it could be said he was weak on the woman side of himwhich was she affirmed a side proper to every man worth the name but in his case his country might complain of whatwell of a womanwhat had she done for the country to complain of herwhy then arts or graces she had bewitched and weaned him from his public duty his military service his patriotic ambition lord ormonts interrogations heightening the effect of charlottes charge appeared to mr eglett as a giving of himself over into her hands but the earl after a minute of silence proved he was a tricky combatant it was he who had drawn on charlotte that he might have his opportunity to eulogizethis lady whom you continue to call the woman after i have told you she is my wife according to him her appeals her entreaties that he should not abandon his profession or let his ambition rust had been at one period constant he spoke fervently for him eloquently and he gained his point he silenced lady charlottes tongue and impressed mr eglett when the latter and his wife were alone he let her see that the countess of ormont was becoming a personage in his consideration lady charlotte cried out hear these men where its a goodlooking woman between the winds do you take anything rowsley says for earnest you ought to know he stops at no trifle to get his advantage over you in a dispute that s the soldier in him it s victory at any costand i like him for it do you tell me you think it possible my brother rowsley would keep smothered years under a bushel the woman he can sit here magnifying because he wants to lime you and me you to take his part and me to go and call the noble creature decked out in his fine fiction my sisterinlaw nothing ll tempt me to believe my brother could behave in such a way to the woman he respected so mr eglett opined but he had been impressed he relieved his mind on the subject in a communication to lord adderwood who habitually shook out the contents of his to mrs lawrence finchley and she deeming it good for aminta to have information of the war waging for her behoof obtained her country address with the resolve to drive down a bearer of good news to the dear woman she liked to think of look at and occasionally caress besides rather tenderly pitying her now that a change of fortune rendered her former trials conspicuous an incident considered grave even in the days of the duel and the kicks against a swelling public reprehension of the practice occurred to postpone her drive for fourandtwenty hours london was shaken by rumours of a tragic mishap to a socially wellknown gentleman at the chiallo fencing rooms the rumours passing from mouth to mouth acquired in the nature of them sinister colours as they circulated lord ormont sent aminta word of what he called a bad sort of accident at chiallos without mentioning names or alluding to suspicions he treated it lightly he could not have written of it with such unconcern if it involved the secretary yet aminta did seriously ask herself whether he could and she flew rapidly over the field of his character seizing points adverse points favourably advocative balancing dubiouslymost unjustly she felt she was unjust but in her condition the heart of a woman is instantly planted in jungle when the spirits of the two men closest to her are made to stand opposed by a sudden excitement of her fears for the beloved one she cannot see widely and is one of the wild while the fit lasts and after it that savage narrow vision she had of the unbeloved retains its vivid print in permanence was she unjust aminta cited corroboration of her being accurate such was lord ormont and although his qualities of gallantry courtesy integrity honourable gentleman presented a fair lowlevel account on the other side she had so stamped his massive selfishness and icy inaccessibility to emotion on her conception of him that the repulsive figure formed by it continued towering when her mood was kinder love played on love in the womans breast her love had taken a fever from her lords communication of the accident at chiallos and she pushed her alarm to imagine the deadliest and plead for the right of confession to herself of her unrepented regrets she and matey weyburn had parted without any pressure of hands without a touch they were then unplighted if now the grave divided them no touch mere glances and she sighed not as she pleaded for the touch but for the plighting it would have been if now she had lost him he could never tell herself that since the dear old buried and nightwalking schooldays she had said once matey to him named him once to his face matey weyburn a sigh like the roll of a great wave breaking against a wall of rock came from her for the possibly lost chance of naming him to his face mateyoh and seeing his look as she said it the boldness might be fancied it could not be done agreeing with the remote inner voice of her reason so far she toned her exclamatory foolishness to question in reasons plain deep bassoprofundo accompaniment tone how much the most blessed of mortal women could do to be of acceptable service to a young schoolmaster there was no reply to the question but it became a nestling centre for the skiey flock of dreams and for really temperate soundings of her capacities tending to the depreciatory she could do little she entertained the wish to work not only for the sake of somebody as her favourite poet sang but for the sake of working and servingproving that she was helpfuller than a countess of ormont ranged with all the other countesses in china and dresden on a drawingroom mantelpiece for show she could organize manage a household manage people too she thought manage a husband the word offends perhaps invigorate him here and there perhaps inspire him if he would let her breathe husbands exist who refuse the right of breathing to their puppet wives above all as it struck her she could assist and be more than an echo of one nobler in breathing manliness high spirit into boys with that idea she grazed the shallows of reality and her dreams whirred from the nest and left it hungrily empty selina collett was writing under the verandah letters to her people in suffolk performing the task with marvellous ease aminta noted it as a mark of superior ability and she had the envy of the complex nature observing the simple it accused her of some guiltiness uncommitted and indefensible she had pushed her anxiety about the accident at chiallos to an extreme that made her the creature of her sensibilities in the midst of this quiet country life and landscape these motionless garden flowers headed by the smooth white river and her gentle little friend so homely here the contemplation of herself was like a shriek in music worse than discordant she pronounced herself inferior unfit mentally as well as bodily for the dreams of companionship with any noble soul who might have the dream of turning her into something better there are couples in the world not coupled by priestly circumstance who are close to the true union by reason of generosity on the one part grateful devotion as for the gift of life on the other for instance mrs lawrence finchley and lord adderwood which was an instance without resemblance but amintas heart beat thick for what it wanted and they were the instance of two that did not have to snap false bonds of a marriagetie in order to walk together composedly outside itin honour oh yes yes she insisted on believing it was in honour she saw the couple issue from the boathouse she had stepped into the garden full of a presentiment so she fancied the moment they were seen she had in fact heard a noise in the boathouse while thinking of them and the effect on her was to spring an idea of mysterious interventions at the sight mrs lawrence rushed to her and was embraced you re not astonished to see me adder drove me down and stopped his coach at the inn and rowed me the halfmile up we will lunch if you propose but presently my dear i have to tell you things you have heard the accident aminta tried to read in mrs lawrences eyes whether it closely concerned her those pretty eyes their cut of lids hinting at delicate affinities with the ricepaper lady of the court of china were trying to peer seriously poor man one must be sorry for him he who you ve not heard then mrs lawrence dropped her voice morsfield aminta shivered all i have heardhalf a line from my lord this morning no name it was at the fencingrooms he said yes he wouldnt write more said mrs lawrence nodding you know he would have had to do it himself if it had not been done for him adder saw him some days back in a brown consultation near his club with captain may oh but of course it was accident did he call it so in his letter to you one word of mr morsfield he is wounded past cure he has the thing he cried for spoilt boy as he was from his birth i tell you truth m aminta i grieve to lose him what with his airs of the foreigntinted punctilious courtly gentleman covering a survival of the ancient british forest boar or bear he was a picture in our modern set and piquant and he was devoted to our sex we must admit after the style of the bears they are for honey and they have a hug if he hadnt been so much of a madman i should have liked him for his courage he had plenty of that nothing to steer it a second cousin comes in for his estates he is dead aminta cried yes dear he is gone what the women think of it i cant say the general feeling among the men is that some one of them would have had to send him sooner or later the curious point adder says is his letting it be done by steel he was a dead shot dangerous with the small sword as your mr weyburn said only soon off his head but i used to be anxious about the earls meeting him with pistols he did his best to provoke it here addershe spoke over her shouldertell lady ormont all you know of the morsfieldmay affair lord adderwood bowed compliance his coolness was the masculine of mrs lawrences hardly feminine in treating of a terrible matter so that the dull red facts had to be disengaged from his manner of speech before they sank into amintas acceptance of them as credible they fought with foils buttons off preliminary ceremonies perfect salute in due order guard and at it odd thing was nobody at chiallos had a notion of the business till morsfield was pinked he wouldnt be denied went to work like a fellow meaning to be skewered if he couldnt do the trick and he tried it may had been practising some weeks hes well on the continent by this time itll blow over button off sheer accident i wasnt lucky enough to see the encounter came in just when chiallo was lashing his poll over morsfield flat on the ground he had it up to the hilt we put a buttoned foil by the side of morsfield and all swore to secrecy as it is it ll go badly against poor chiallo taste for fencing wont be much improved by the affair they quarrelled in the dressing room and fetched the foils and knocked off the buttons there a big rascal toady squire of morsfields did it for him morsfield was just up from yorkshire he said he was expecting a summons elsewhere bound to await it declined provocation for the present may filliped him on the cheek adder conveyed the information of her husbands flight to the consolable amy said mrs lawrence he had to catch the coach for dover adderwood explained his wife was at a dinnerparty i saw her at midnight fair amy was not so very greatly surprised quite the soldiers wife she said she was used to these little catastrophes but adder what did she say of her husband said she was never anxious about him for nothing would kill him mrs lawrence shook a doleful head at aminta you see my dear aminta heres another and probably her last chance of sharing the marquisate gone who can fail to pity her except old time and i m sure she likes her husband well enough she ought no woman ever had such a servant but the captain has not been known to fight without her sanction and the inference isalas woe fair amy is doomed to be the fighting captains bride to the end of the chapter adder says she looked handsome a dinnerparty suits her cosmetic complexion better than a ball the account of the inquest is in the days papers and we were tolerably rejoiced we could drive out of london without having to reply to coroners questions he diedsoon amintas voice was shaken mrs lawrence touched at her breast it might be for heart or lungs judging by amintas voice and face one could suppose she was harking back in womans way to her original sentiment for the man now that he lay prostrate aminta read the unreproachful irony in the smile addressed to her she was too convulsed by her many emotions and shouting thoughts to think of defending herself selina in the drawingroom diligently fingered and classed brownblack pressed weeds of her neophytes botanyfolios the sight of her and her occupation struck aminta as that of a person in another world beyond this world of blood strangely substantial to view and one heard her speak guiltyno but she had wished to pique her lord after the term of a length of months could it be that the unhappy man and she were punished for the halfminutes acting of some interest in him and lord ormont had been seen consulting captain may or was it giving him directions her head burned all the barren interrogations were up running and knocking for hollow responses and saving a paleness of face she cloaked any small show of the riot she was an amiable hostess she had ceased to comprehend mrs lawrence even to the degree of thinking her unfeminine she should have known that the angelical chimpanzee as a friend once told of his being a favourite with the lady had called her could not simulate a feeling and had not the slightest power of pretence to compassion for an illfated person who failed to quicken her enthusiasm in that too she was a downright boy morsfield was a kind of bedlamite to her amusing in his antics and requiring to be manoeuvred and eluded while he lived once dead just a tombstone of interest only to his family she beckoned aminta to follow her and with a smirk of indulgent fun commended lord adderwood to a study of selina colletts botanyfolios which the urbanest of indifferent gentlemen had slid his eyes over his nose to inspect before the lunch you ought to know what is going on in town my dear aminta you have won the earl to a sense of his duty and he s at work on the harder task of winning lady charlotte eglett to a sense of hers it s tremendous has been forward some days and no sign of yielding on either side mr eglett good man is between them catching it right and left and he deserves his luck for marrying her vows she makes him the best of wives if he s content i ve nothing to complain of you must be ready to receive her my lord is sure to carry the day you gulp you wont be seeing much of her i m glad to say he is condescending to terms of peace with the horse guards we hear so you may be throning it officially somewhere next year and all s well that ends well say that to me it is when the end comes aminta replied mrs lawrences cool lips were pressed to her cheek the couple and their waterman rowed away to the party they had left with the fourinhand at their inn a wind was rising the trees gave their swish of leaves the river darkened the patch of wrinkles the bordering flags amid the reedblades dipped and streamed surcharged with unassimilated news of events that made a thunder in her head aminta walked down the garden path meeting selina and bearing her on she had a witchs will to rouse gales hers was not the womans nature to be driven cowering by stories of mens bloody deeds she took the field revolted dissevering herself from the class which tolerated themactuated by a reflective moralty she believed and loathed herself for having aspired schemed to be a member of the class but it was not the class it was against her lord as representative of the class that she was now the rebel neither naming him nor imaging him her enveloping mind was black on him such as one of those hard slaughtering men could call her his own she breathed short and breathed deep her bitter reason had but the common pity for a madman despatched to his rest yet she knew hatred of her lord in his being suspected as instigator or accomplice of the hand that dealt the blow he became to her thought a python whose coils were about her person insufferable to the gaze backward moments like these are the mothers in travail of a resolve joylessly conceived undesired to clasp necessitys offspring thunderclouds have as little love of the lightnings they fling aminta was aware only of her torment the trees were bending the water hissing the grasses all this way and that like hands of a delirious people in surges of wreck she scorned the meaningless shake of the garments of earth and exclaimed if we were by the sea tonight i shall be tomorrow night said selina i shall think of you oh would you come with me would you have me my mother will indeed be honoured by your consenting to come write to her before the post is out we shall travel down together aminta nodded and smiled and selina kissed her hand in joy saying that down home she would not be so shy of calling her aminta she was bidden to haste chapter xxvi visits of farewell the noise in london over adolphus morsfields tragical end disturbed lord ormont much less than the cessation of letters from his aminta and that likewise considering his present business on her behalf he patiently shrugged at and pardoned foreseeing her penitent air he could do it lightly after going some way to pardon his offending country for aminta had not offended his robust observation of her was moved to the kindly humorous by a reflective view here and there of the downright woman her clever little shuffles exposed her to be not worse it was her sex that made her one of the gliders in grasses some of whom are venomous but she belonged to the order only as an innocuous blindworm he could pronounce her small byplay with morsfield innocent her efforts to climb the stairs into society quite innocent judging her of course by her title of woman a womans innocence has a rainbow skin set this one beside other women she comes out well fairly well well enough now that the engagement with charlotte assumed proportions of a series of battle properly to be entitled a campaign he had in his loneliness fallen into the habit of reflecting at the close of his days work and the rubbing of that unused opaque mirror hanging inside a man of action had helped him piecemeal to perceive bits of his conduct entirely approved by him which were intimately connected nevertheless with a train of circumstances that he disliked and could not charge justly upon any other shoulders than his own what was to be thought of it he would not be undergoing this botheration of the prolonged attempt to bring a stubborn woman to a sense of her duty if he had declared his marriage in the ordinary style and given his young countess her legitimate place before the world what impeded it the shameful ingratitude of his countrymen to the soldier who did it eminent service at a crisis of the destinies of our indian empire he could not condone the injury done to him by entering among them again too like the kicked cur that he retiredcall it sulked in his tent if you like his wife had to share his fortunes he being slighted she necessarily was shadowed for a while she bore it contentedly enough then began her mousy scratches to get into the room off the wainscot without blame from him she behaved according to her female nature yes but the battles with charlotte forced on his recognition once more and violently the singular consequences of his retirement and coriolanus quarrel with his countrymen he had doomed himself ever since to a contest with women first it was his queen of amazons who if vanquished was not so easily vanquished and in fact doubtfullyfor now to propitiate her he had challenged and must overcome or be disgraced the toughest amazonian warrior man could stand against at cast of dart or lock of arms no day scored an advantage and she did not apparently suffer fatigue he did that is to say he was worried and hurried to have the wrangle settled and charlotte at amintas feet he gained not an inch of ground his principle in a contention of the sort was to leave the woman to the practice of her obvious artifices and himself simply hammer incessantly hammer but charlotte hammered as well the modest position of the defensive negative was not to her taste the moment he presented himself she flew out upon some yesterdays part of the argument and carried the war across the borders in attacks on his character and qualitieshis weakness regarding women his incapacity to forgive and the rest she hammered on that head as for any prospect of a termination of the strife he could see none in her joyful welcome to him and regretful parting and pleased appointment of the next meeting day after day the absurdest of her devices for winding him off his aim was to harp on some new word she had got hold of as for example to point out to him his aptitudes compliment him on his aptitudes recommend him to study and learn the limitations of his aptitudes she revelled in something the word unfolded to her however here was the point she had to be beaten so if she too persisted in hammering he must employ her female weapon of artifice with her one would gladly avoid the stooping to it in a civil dispute in which one is not so gloriously absolved for lying and entrapping as in splendid war weyburns name was announced to him at an early hour on thursday morning my lord nodded to the footman he nodded to himself over a suggestion started in a tactical intelligence by the name ah you re off he accosted the young man i have come to take my leave my lord nothing new in the morning papers a report that captain may intends to return and surrender not before a month has passed if he follows my counsel to defend his character he has none his reputation he has too much these charges against him must be intolerable was he not a bit of a pupil of yours we practised two or three timesnothing more morsfield was a wasp at a feast somebody had to crush him i ve seen the kind of man twice in my life and exactly the kind of man if their law puts down duelling he rules the kingdom my lord i should venture to say the kind of man can be a common annoyance because the breach of the law is countenanced bad laws are best broken a society that cant get a scouring now and then will be a dirty set with a bend of the head in apology for speaking of himself weyburn said i have acted on my view i declined a challenge from a sort of henchman of his oh a poachers lurcher you did right fight such fellows with constables you have seen lady charlotte i am on my way to her ladyship do me this favour fourteen doors up the street of her residence my physician lives i have to consult him at once dr rewkes weyburn bowed lady charlotte could not receive him later than halfpast ten of the morning he said this morning she can said my lord you will tell dr rewkes that it is immediate i rather regret your going i shall be in a controversy with the horse guards about our cavalry saddles it would be regiments of raw backs the first fortnight of a campaign the earl discoursed on saddles and passed to high eulogy of our hanoverian auxiliary troopers in the peninsula good husbands he named them quaintly speaking of their management of their beasts thence he diverged to frederics cavalry rarely matched for shrewdness and endurance to the deeds of the liechtenstein hussars to the great things blucher did with his horsemen the subject was interesting but weyburn saw the clock at past the half after ten he gave a slight sign of restiveness and was allowed to go when the earl had finished his pro and con upon arab horses and mameluke saddles lord ormont nicked his head just as at their first interview he was known to have an objection to the english shaking of hands goodmorning he said adding a remark or two of which et cetera may stand for an explicit rendering it concerned the young mans prosperity my lords conservative plain sense was in doubt of the prospering of a giddy pate however good a worker his last look at the young man who had not served him badly held an anticipation of possibly some day seeing a tatterdemalion of shipwreck a rueful exhibition of ideas put to the business of life weyburn left the message with dr rewkes in person it had not seemed to him that lord ormont was one requiring the immediate attendance of a physician by way of accounting to lady charlotte for the lateness of his call he mentioned the summons he had delivered oh thats why he hasnt come yet said she well sit and talk till he does come i dont wonder if his bile has been stirred he cant oil me to credit what he pumps into others his lady ormont i believe in it less than ever i did morsfield or no morsfieldand now the poor wretch has got himself pinned to the plank like my grandson bobbys dragonflies i dont want to say anything further of himshe doesnt have much of a welcome at steignton if i were a woman to wager as men do i d stake a thousand pounds to five on her never stepping across the threshold of steignton all very well in london and that place he hires up at marlow he respects our home that s how i know my brother rowsley still keeps a sane man a fortune on itand so says mr eglett any reasonable person must think it he made a fool of some hamptonevey at madrid if he went through any ceremonyand that i doubt but she and old what do they call her may have insisted upon the title as much as they could he sixty she under twenty im told pagnell s the name that aunt of a goodlooking young woman sees a noble man of sixty admiring her five feet seven or soshes tallof marketable merchandise and she doesnt need telling that at sixty hell give the world to possess the girl but not his family honour he stops at that why lord ormont s made of pride hell be kind to her hell be generous he wont forsake her shell have her portion in his will and by the course of things in nature shell outlive him and marry and be happy i hope only she wont enter steignton you remember what i say you ll live when i m gone it s the thirst of her life to be mistress of steignton not shethough lord ormont would have us all open our doors to her mine too now he s about it he sets his mind on his plan and he forgets rights and dueseverything he must have it as his will dictates that s how he made such a capital soldier you know the cavalry leader he was if theyd given him a field in europe his enemies admit that twelve and my clocks five minutes or more slow what can rowsley be doing she rattled backward on the scene at steignton and her brothers handsome preservation of his dignity stood it like the king he is and to the morsfieldmay encounter which had prevented another and mrs may was rolled along in the tide with a hint of her good reason for liking lord ormont also the change of opinion shown by the press as to lord ormonts grand exploit referring to it she flushed and jigged on her chair for a saddle beneath her and that glorious indian adventure warmed her to the man who had celebrated it among his comrades when a boy at school you re to teach latin and greek you said for you re right we english cant understand the words we re speaking if we dont know a good deal of latin and some greek conversing in tokens not standard coin you said i remember and therell be a general rabble tongue unless we english are drilled in the languages we filched from lots of lords and ladies want the drilling then ill send some over to you for swiss air and roots of the english tongue oh and you told me you supported lord ormont on his pet argument for corps delite and you quoted virgil to back it let me have that line againin case of his condescending to write to the papers on the subject weyburn repeated the halfline good i wont forget now and you said the french act on that because they follow human nature and the english dont we bully it you said that was on our drive down to steignton i hope you ll succeed you ll be visiting england call on me in london or at olmeronly mind and give me warning i shall be glad to see you i ve got some ideas from you if i meet a man who helps me to read the world and men as they are i m grateful to him and most people are not you ll find they want you to show them what they d like the world to be we dont agree about a lady you re in the lists lance in rest all for chivalry you re a man and a young man have you taken your leave of her yet shell expect it as a proper compliment i propose running down to take my leave of lady ormont tomorrow replied weyburn she is handsome she is very handsome beautiful do you mean oh my lady it would only be a mans notion now that s as good an answer as could be made you re sure to succeed i m not the womans enemy but let her keep her place why rowsley cant be coming today did lord ormont look ill it did not strike me so he s between two fires a man gets fretted but i shant move a step i dare say she wont especially with that morsfield out of the way you do mean you think her a beauty well then therell soon be a successor to morsfield beauties will have their weapons and they can hit on plenty and it s nothing to me as long as i save my brother from their arts weyburn felt he had done his penance in return for kindness he bowed and rose lady charlotte stretched out her hand we shall be sending you a pupil some day she said and smiled forward your address as soon as you re settled her face gave a glimpse of its youth in a cordial farewell smile lord ormont had no capacity to do the like although they were strictly brother and sister in appearance the smallest difference in character rendered her complex and kept him simple she had a thirsting mind weyburn fancied that a close intimacy of a few months would have enabled him to lift her out of her smirching and depraving mean jealousies he speculated as he trod the street on little plots and surprises which would bring lady charlotte and lady ormont into presence and end by making friends of them supposing that could be done lady ormont might be righted by the intervention of lady charlotte after all weyburn sent his dream flying with as dreamy an afterthought funny it will be then for lady charlotte to revert to the stuff she has been droning in my ear half an hour agolook well behind and we see spots where we buzzed lowed bit and tore and not until we have cast that look and seen the brute are we human creatures a crumb of reflection such as this could brace him adding its modest maravedi to his prized storehouse of gain fortifying with assurances of his having a concrete basis for his business in life his great youthful ambition had descended to it but had sunk to climb on a firmer footing arthur abner had his next adieu they talked of lady ormont as to whose position of rightful countess of ormont mr abner had no doubt he said of lady charlotte she has a clear head but she loves her brother rowsley excessively and any excess pushes to craziness he spoke to weyburn of his prospects in the usually perhaps necessarily cheerless tone of men who recognize by contrast the one mouses nibbling at a mountain of evil to harmonize the nationalities my dear boy teach christians to look fraternally on jews david was a harper but the setting of him down to roll off a fugue on one of your cathedral organs would not impose a heavier task than you are undertaking you have my best wishes whatever aid i can supply but we re nearer to king johns time than to your ideal as far as the jews go not in england less in england abner shrugged you have beaten the christians on the field they challenged you to enter for a try they feel the pinch in their interests and their vanity that will pass i m for the two sides under the name of justice and i give the palm to whichever of the two first gets hold of the idea of justice my old schoolmates well always asking after matey weyburn he shall have my address in switzerland you and i will be corresponding now rose to view the visit to the lady who was lady ormont on the tongue aminta at heart never to be named aminta even to himself his heart broke loose at a thought of it he might say browny for that was not serious with the intense present signification the name aminta had browny was queen of the old schooltimeenclosed it in her name and that sphere enclosed her not excluding him and the dear name of browny played gently humorously fervently too with life not pathetically as that of aminta did when came a whisper of her situation her isolation her friendlessness hardly dissimilar to what could be imagined of a gazelle in the streets of london city the morsfields were not all slain the weyburns would be absent at the gate of his cottage garden weyburn beheld a short unfamiliar figure of a man with dimly remembered features little collett he still was in height the schoolmates had not met since the old days of cupers little collett delivered a message of invitation from selina begging mr weyburn to accompany her brother on the coach to harwich next day and spend two or three days by the sea but weyburns mind had been set in the opposite directionup thames instead of down he was about to refuse but he checked his voice and hummed words of selinas letter jumped in italics he perceived lady ormonts hand for one thing would she be at great marlow alone and he knew that handhow deftly it moved and moved others selina collett would not have invited him with underlinings merely to see a shoreside house and garden her silence regarding a particular name showed her to be under injunction one might guess at worst it would be the loss of a couple of days worth the venture they agreed to journey by coach next day facing eastward in the morning on a seat behind the coachman weyburn had a seafaring man beside him bound for the good port of harwich where his family lived and thence by his own boat to flushing weyburn set him talking of himself as the best way of making him happy for it is the theme which pricks to speech and so liberates an uncomfortably lockedup stranger who if sympathetic to human proximity is thankful they exchanged names delighted to find they were both matthews whereupon matthew of the sea demanded the paw of matthew of the land and there was a squeeze the same with little collett after hearing of him as the old schoolmate of the established new friend then there was talk little collett named felixstowe as the village of his mothers house and garden sloping to the sands that s ityou have it said the salted matthew peace is in that spot and there i ve sworn to pitch my tent when i m incapacitated for further exerciseprofitable so to speak my eldest girl has a bar of amber she picked up one wash of the tide at felixstowe and there it had been lying sparkling unseen hours the shore is that solitary what i likea quiet shore and a peopled sea ever been to brighton there it s t other way not long after he had mentioned the time of early evening for their entry into his port of harwich the coach turned quietly over on a bank of the roadside depositing outside passengers quite safely in so matterofcourse a way that only the screams of an uninjured lady inside repressed their roars of laughter one of the wheels had come loose half a mile off the nearest town their entry into harwich was thereby delayed until halfpast nine at night full of consideration for the new mates now fast wedded to his heart by an accident matthew shale proposed to matthew weyburn instead of the bother of crossing the ferry with a portmanteau and a bag at that late hour to sup at his house try the neighbouring inn for a short sleep and ship on board his yawl the honest susan to be rowed ashore off the swin to felixstowe sands no later than six oclock of a summers morning in time for a bath and a swim before breakfast it sounded wellit sounded sweetly weyburn suggested the counter proposal of supper for the three at the inn but the other matthew said i married a cook she expects a big appetite and she always keeps warm when i m held away no matter how late sure to be enough beds were secured at the inn after which came the introduction to mrs shale the exhibition of susan shales bar of amber the dish of freshfried whiting the steak pudding a grog tobacco rest at the inn and a rousing bang at the sleepers doors when the unwonted supper in them withheld an answer to the intimating knock young matthew shale who had slept on board the susan conducted them to her boat his glance was much drawn to the very white duck trousers weyburn had put on for a souvenir of the approbation they had won at marlow they were on and so it was of no use for young matthew to say they were likely to bear away a token from the susan she was one among the damsels of colour and free of her tokens especially to the spotless how it occurred nobody saw though everybody saw how naturally it must occur for the white ducks to have it in the eye by the time they had been on board a quarter of an hour weyburn got some fun out of them for a counterbalance to a twitch of sentimental regret scarcely decipherable as that the last view of him should bear a likeness of brownys recollection of her first a glorious morning of flushed open sky and sun on sea chased all small thoughts out of it the breeze was from the west and the susan lightly laden took the heave of smooth rollers with a flowing currentcurtsey in the motion of her speed foresail and aft were at their gentle strain her shadow rippled fragmentarily along to the silver rivulet and boat of her wake straight she flew to the ball of fire now at spring above the waters and raining red gold on the line of her bows by comparison she was an ugly yawl and as the creature of wind and wave beautiful they passed an english defensive fort and spared its walls in obedience to matthew shales good counsel that they should forbear from sneezing little collett pointed to the roof of his mothers house twenty paces rearward of a belt of tamarisks green amid the hollowed yellows of shorebanks yet in shade crumbling to the sands weyburn was attracted by a diminutive white tent of sentrybox shape evidently a bathers quite as evidently a fair bathers he would have to walk on some way for his dip he remarked to little collett that ladies going into the water halfdressed never have more than half a bath his arms and legs flung out contempt of that style of bathing exactly in old mateys wellremembered way half a mile off shore the susan was put about to flap her sails and her boat rocked with the passengers turning from a final cheer to friendly matthew weyburn at the rudder espied one of those unenfranchised ladies in marine uniform issuing through the tentslit she stepped firmly as into her element a plain look at her and a curious look and an intent look fixed her fast and ran the shock on his heart before he knew of a guess she waded she dipped a head across the breast of the waters was observed this one of them could swim she was making for sea a stones throw off the direction of the boat before his wits had grasped the certainty possessing them fiery envy and desire to be alongside her set his fingers fretting at buttons a grand smooth swell of the waters lifted her and her head rose to see her world she sank down the valley where another wave was mounding for its onward roll a gentle scene of weyburns favourite sophoclean chorus now she was given to himit was she how could it ever have been any other he handed his watch to little collett and gave him the ropes pitched coat and waistcoat on his knees stood free of boots and socks and singing out truly enough the words of a popular cry white ducks want washing went over and in chapter xxvii a marine duet she soon had to know she was chased she had seen the dive from the boat and received all illumination with a chuckle of delighted surprise like a blackbird startled she pushed seaward for joy of the effort thinking she could exult in imagination of an escape up to the moment of capture yielding then only to his greater will and she meant to try it the swim was a holiday all was newnothing came to her as the same old thing since she took her plunge she had a seamindhad left her earthmind ashore the swim and matey weyburn pursuing her passed up out of happiness through the spheres of delirium into the region where our life is as we would have it be a home holding the quiet of the heavens if but midway thither and a home of delicious animation of the whole frame equal to wings he drew on her but he was distant and she waved an arm the shout of her glee sprang from her matey he waved she heard his voice was it her name he was not so drunken of the sea as she he had not leapt out of bondage into buoyant waters into a youth without a blot without an aim satisfied in tasting the dream of the long felicity a thought brushed by her how if he were absent it relaxed her stroke of arms and legs he had doubled the salt seas rapture and he had shackled its gift of freedom she turned to float gathering her knees for the funny sullen kick until she heard him near at once her stroke was renewed vigorously she had the foot of her pursuer and she called adieu matey weyburn her bravado deserved a swifter humiliation than he was able to bring down on her she swam bravely and she was divine to see ahead as well as overtake darting to the close parallel he said what sea nymph sang me my name she smote a pang of her ecstasy into him ask mine browny they swam neither of them panted their heads were waterflowers that spoke at ease we ve run from school we wont go back we ve a kingdom heres a big wave going to be a wall off he rolls hes like the high brent broad meadow under elling wood dont let miss vincent hear you they re not waves they re sighs of the deep a poet i swim with he fell into the deep in his first of may morning ducks we used to expect him i never expected to owe them so much pride of the swimmer and the energy of her joy embraced aminta that she might nerve all her powers to gain the halfminute for speaking at her ease who d have thought of a morning like this you were looked for last night a lucky accident to our coach i made friends with the skipper of the yawl i saw the boat who could have dreamed anything may happen now for nothing further would astonish her as he rightly understood her but he said you re prepared for the rites old triton is ready float and tell me they spun about to lie on their backs her right hand at pianowork of the octaveshake was touched and taken and she did not pull it away her eyelids fell old triton waits why we re going to him yes customs of the sea tell me he joins hands we say brownymatey and it s done she splashed crying swim and after two strokes you want to beat me matey weyburn how not fair say what take my breath but yes well be happy in our own way we re seabirds we ve said adieu to land not to one another we shall be friends always this is going to last ever so long they had a spell of steady swimming companionship to inspirit it browny was allowed place a little foremost and she guessed not wherefore in her flattered emulation i m bound for france slew a point to the right southeast by south we shall hit dunkerque i dont mean to be picked up by boats well decline you see i can swim i was sure of it they stopped their talkfor the pleasure of the body to be savoured in the mind they thought and so took natures counsel to rest their voices awhile considering that she had not been used of late to long immersions and had not broken her fast and had talked much for a seanymph weyburn spied behind him on a shore seeming flat down far removed france next time he said well face to the rear now said she big with blissful conceit of her powers and incredulous of such a command from him you may be feeling tired presently the musical sincerity of her oh no not i sped through his limbs he had a willingness to go onward still some way but his words fastened the heavy land on her spirit knocked at the habit of obedience her stroke of the arms paused she inclined to his example and he set it shoreward they swam silently high low creatures of the smooth green roller he heard the watersong of her swimming she though breathing equably at the nostrils lay deep the water shocked at her chin and curled round the under lip he had a faint anxiety and not so sensible of a weight in the sight of land as she was he chattered by snatches rallied her encouraged her to continue sportive for this once letting her feel it was but a once and had its respected limit with him so it was not out of the world ah friend matey and that was right and good on land but rightness and goodness flung earths shadow across her brilliancy here and any stress on this once withdrew her liberty to revel in it putting an end to perfect holiday and silence too might hint at fatigue she began to think her muteness lost her the bloom of the enchantment robbing her of her heavenly frolic lead since friend matey resolved to be as eminently good in salt water as on land was he unaware that they were boy and girl againshe washed pure of the intervening years new born by blessing of the sea worthy of him herethat is a swimmer worthy of him his comrade in salt water youre satisfied i swim well she said it would go hard with me if we raced a long race i really was out for france i was ordered to keep you for england she gave him brownys eyes weve turned our backs on triton the ceremony was performed when the minute i spoke of it and you splashed matey matey weyburn browny farrell oh matey shes gone shes here try to beguile me then that our holidays not over you wont forget this hour no time of mine on earth will live so brightly for me i have never had one like it i could go under and be happy go to old triton and wait for you teach him to speak your proper christian name he hasnt heard it yetheard mateynever yet has been taught matthew aminta oh my friend my dear she cried in the voice of the wounded like a welling of her blood my strength will leave me i may playnot you you play with a weak vessel swim and be quiet how far do you count it under a quarter of a mile dont imagine me tired if you are hold on to me matey im for a dive he went after the ball of silver and bubbles and they came up together there is no history of events below the surface she shook off her briny blindness and settled to the full sweep of the arms quite silent now some emotion or exhaustion from the strain of the swimmers breath in speech stopped her playfulness the pleasure she still knew was a recollection of the outward swim when she had been privileged to cast away sex with the push from earth as few men will believe that women beautiful women ever wish to do and often and ardently during the run ahead they yearn for nature to grant them their one short holiday truce but aminta forgave him for bringing earth so close to her when there was yet a space of salt water between her and shore and she smiled at times that he might not think she was looking grave chapter xxviii the plighting they touched sand at the first draw of the ebb and this being earth matey addressed himself to the guardian and absolving genii of matteroffact by saying did you inquire about the tides her head shook stunned with what had passed she waded to shore after motioning for him to swim on men in comparison beside their fair fellows are so little sensationally complex that his one feeling now as to what had passed was relief at the idea of his presence having been a warrantable protectorship amintas return from the seanymph to the state of woman crossed annihiliation on the way back to sentience and picked up meaningless pebbles and shells of life between the seas verge and her tents shelter hardly her own life to her understanding yet except for the hammer memory became to strike her insensible at here and there a recollected word or nakedness of her soul he swam along by the shore to where the boat was paddled spying at her bare feet on the sand her womans form he waved and the figure in the striped tunic and trousers waved her response apparently the same person he had quitted dry and clad and decently formal under the transformation they met at mrs colletts breakfasttable and in each hung the doubt whether land was the dream or sea both owned to a swim both omitted mention of the tale of white ducks little collett had brought mateys and his portmanteau into the house by favour of the cook through the scullery he who could have been a pictorial and suggestive narrator carried a spinning head off his shoulders from this wonderful countess of ormont to matey weyburns darkeyed browny at high brent and the sunday walk in sir peter wensells park away and back his head went browny was not to be thought of as browny she was this grand countess of ormont she had married matey weyburns hero she would never admit she had been browny only she was handsome then and she is handsome now and she looks on matey weyburn now just as she did then how strange is the world or how if we are the particular person destined to encounter the strange things of the world and fancy j masner and pinnett major and young oakes liked nothing better than a pretty girl he strutted boasting at thirteen and the frenchy and the lot all popping down at the table and asked the name of the lady sitting like queen estherhow they would roar out boys of coursebut men toovery few men have a notion of the extraordinary complications and coincidences and crackersurprises life contains here s an instance matey weyburn positively will wear white ducks to play before aminta farrell on the first of may cricketingday he happens to have his white ducks on when he sees the countess of ormont swimming in the sea and so he can go in just as if they were allright bathingdrawers in he goes has a good long swim with her and when he comes out says of his dripping ducks tabula votiva avida vestimenta to remind an old schoolmate of his hopping to the booth at the end of a showery may day and dedicating them to the laundry in these words it seems marvellous it was a quaint revival an hour after breakfast for little collett to be acting as intermediary with selina to request lady ormonts grant of a fiveminutes interview before the churchbell summoned her she was writing letters and sent the message tell mr weyburn i obey selina delivered it uttering obey in a demurely comical way as a word of which the humour might be comprehensible to him aminta stood at the drawingroom window she was asking herself whether her recent conduct shrieked coquette to him or any of the abominable titles showered on the women who take free breath of air one day after long imprisonment she said does it mean you are leaving us the moment he was near not till evening or tomorrow as it may happen he answered i have one or two things to say if you will spare the time all my time said she smiling to make less of the hearts reply and he stepped into the room they had not long back been matey and browny and though that was in another element it would not sanction the lady ormont and mr weyburn now as little could it be aminta and matthew brother and sister they were in the spirits world but in this world the titles had a sound of imposture and with a great longing to call her by some allying name he rejected friend for its insufficiency and commonness notwithstanding the entirely friendly nature of the burden to be spoken friend was a title that ran on quicksands an excuse that tried for an excuse he distinguished in himself simultaneously that the hesitation and beating about for a name had its origin in an imperfect frankness when he sent his message the fretful desire to be with her close to her hearing her seeing her besides the true wish to serve her he sent it after swinging round abruptly from an outlook over the bordering garden tamarisks on a sea now featureless desolately empty however perceptibly silence was doing the work of a scourge and he said i have been thinking i may haveand i dont mind fighting hard to try it before i leave england on tuesday or wednesdaysome influence with lady charlotte eglett she is really one of the true women living and the heartiest of backers if she can be taught to see her course i fancy i can do that she s narrow but she is not one of the class who look on the working world below them as well say the scavenger dogs on the plains of ilium were seen by the achaeans and my failure would be no loss to you your name shall not be alluded to as empowering me to plead for her help but i want your consent or i may be haunted and weakened by the idea of playing the busybody one has to feel strong in a delicate position well you know what my position with her has beenone among the humble and she has taken contradictions accepted views from me shown me she has warmth of heart to an extreme degree aminta slightly raised her hand i will save you trouble i have written to lord ormont i have left him their eyes engaged on the thunder of this the letter has gone it was posted before my swim posted yesterday you have fully and clearly thought it out to a determination bit by biti might say blow by blow it is no small matter to break a marriagetie i have conversed with your mother yes she and the woman happiest in marriage i know it was hatred of injustice noble sympathy and she took me for one of the blest among wives she loved god she saw the difference between mens decrees for their convenience and gods laws she felt for women you have had a hard trial aminta oh my name you mean it you heard it from me this morning yes there i try to forget i lost my senses you may judge me harshly on reflection judge myself worse then you had a thousand excuses i had only my love of you theres no judgement against either of us for us to see if i read rightly we elect to be tried in the courts of the seagod now we ll sit and talk it over the next ten minutes will decide our destinies his eyes glittered otherwise he showed the coolness of the man discussing business and his blunt soberness refreshed and upheld her as a wild burst of passion would not have done side by side partly facing they began their interchange you have weighed what you abandon it weighs little that may be error you have to think into the future my sufferings and experiences are not bad guides they count how can you be sure you have all the estimates was i ever a wife you were and are the countess of ormont not to the world an unacknowledged wife is a slave surely you step down if you take the step from what once i did desire that stationhad an idea it was glorious i despise it or rather the woman who had the desire but the step down is into the working world i have means to live humbly i want no more except to be taught to work so says the minute years are before you you have weighed well that you attract she reddened and murmured how small her pout of spite at her attractions was little simulated beauty and charm are not small matters you have the gift called fatal thenlooking right forwardyou have faith in the power of resistance of the woman living alone he had struck at her breast from her breast she replied hear this of me i was persecuted with letters i read them and did not destroy them perhaps you saved me looking back i see weakness nothing worse but it is a confession yes you have courage and that comes of a great heart and therein lies the danger advise me of what is possible to a lonely woman you have resolved on the loneliness it means breathing to me you are able to see that lord ormont is a gentleman a chivalrous gentleman up to the bounds of his intelligence the bounds of his intelligence closed their four walls in a rapid narrowing slide on amintas mind and she exclaimed if only to pluck flowers in fields and know their names i must be free i say what one can laugh at and you are good and dont is the interrogatory exhausted aminta my beloved if you are free i claim you have you thought the sense of a dissolving to a fountain quivered through her veins turn the tables and examine me but have you thoughtoh i am not the girl you loved i would go through death to feel i was and give you one worthy of you that means what i wont ask you to speak at present but i must have proof he held out a hand and hers was laid in his there was more for her to say she knew it came and fled lightened and darkened she had yielded her hand to him here on land not with the licence and protection of the great holiday salt water and she was trembling from the run of his blood through hers at the pressure of hands when she said in undertones could wewe might be friends meet and part as friends you and i he replied his voice carried the answer for her his intimate look had in it the unfolding of the full flower of the woman to him as she could not conceal from such eyes and feeling that she was all avowal it is for life matthew my own words to myself when i first thought of the chance but the school i shall not consider that we are malefactors we have the world against us it will not keep us from trying to serve it and there are hints of humaner opinions its not all a huge rolling block of a juggernaut our case could be pleaded before it i dont think the just would condemn us heavily i shall have to ask you to strengthen me complete me if you love me it is your leap out of prison and without you i am from this time no better than onethird of a man i trust you to weigh the position you lose and the place we choose to take in the world it s thisi think this describes it you know the man who builds his house below the seas level has a sleepless enemy always threatening his house must be firm and he must look to the dykes we commit this indiscretion with a world against us our love and labour are constantly on trial we must have great hearts and if the world is hostile we are not to blame it in the nature of things it could not be otherwise my own soul we have to see that we dothough not publicly not insolently offend good citizenship but we believei with my whole faith and i may say it of youthat we are not offending divine law you are the woman i can help and join with think whether you can tell yourself that i am the man so then our union gives us powers to make amends to the world if the world should grant us a term of peace for the effort that is our risk consider it aminta between now and tomorrow deliberate we dont go together into a garden of roses i know i should feel shame i wish it to look dark said aminta her hand in his and yet with a fairsailing mind on the stream of the blood rationally and irrationally the mixed passion and reason in two clear heads and urgent hearts discussed the stand they made before a world defied neither of them quite perceiving what it was which coloured reason to beauty or what so convinced their intellects when passion spoke the louder i am to have a mate she will pray she may be one she is my first love amintas lips formed mine without utterance meanwhile his hand or a wizardry subdued her will allured her body she felt herself being drawn to the sign and seal of their plighting for life she said matthew softly in protest and he said never once yet she was owing to his tenderness her deepened voice murmured is this to deliberate colour flooded the beautiful dark face as of the funeral hues of a sun suffusing all the heavens firing earth chapter xxix aminta to her lord on friday on saturday on sunday lady charlotte waited for her brother rowsley until it was a diminished satisfaction that she had held her ground and baffled his mighty will to subdue her she did not sleep for thinking of him on the sunday night toward morning a fit of hazy horrors which others would have deemed imaginings drove her from her bed to sit and brood over rowsley in a chair what if it was a case of heart with him too heart disease had been in the family a man like rowsley still feeling the world before him as a man of his energies and aptitudes her humour added in the tide of his anxieties had a right to feel would not fall upon resignation like a woman she was at the physicians door at eight oclock dr rewkes reported reassuringly it was a simple disturbance in lord ormonts condition of health and he conveyed just enough of disturbance to send the impetuous lady knocking and ringing at her brothers door upon the hour of nine the announcement of lady charlottes early visit informed my lord that dr rewkes had done the spiriting required of him he descended to the library and passed under scrutiny you dont look ill rowsley she said reluctantly in the sound i am the better for seeing you here charlotte shall i order breakfast for you i am alone i know you are ive eaten rewkes tells me youve not lost appetite have i the appearance of a man who has lost anything prouder man and heartier and ruddier could not be seen she thought youre winning the country to right you that i know i dont ask it the country wants your services i have heard some talk of it that lout comes to a knowledge of his wants too late if they promoted and offered me the command in india tomorrowmy lord struck the arm of his chair i live at steignton henceforth my wife is at a seaside place eastward she left the jewelcase when on her journey through london for safety she is a particularly careful person forethoughtful i take her down to steignton two days after her return we entertain there in the autumn you come i dont i prefer decent society you are in her house now maam if i have to meet the person you mean i shall be

serving your country she s your countrys enemy hear my answer the lady who is my wife has had to suffer for what you call my countrys treatment of me it s a choice between my country and her i give her the rest of my time thats dotage fire away your epithets sheer dotage i dont deny shes a handsome young woman youll have to admit that lady ormont takes her place in our family with the best we can name you insult my ears rowsley the world will say it when it has the honour of her acquaintance an honour suspiciously deferred thats between the world and me set your head to work youll screw the world to any pitch you likethat i dont need telling lord ormonts head approved the remark now said lady charlotte you wont get the danmores the dukerlys the carminters the oxbridges any more than you get me you are wrong maam i had yesterday a reply from lady danmore to a communication of mine it s thickening but while i stand i stand for the family and i m not in it and while i stand out of it there s a doubt either of your honesty or your sanity theres a perfect comprehension of my sister i put my character in the scales against your conduct and your countess of ormonts reputation into the bargain you have called at her house it s a step you ll be running at her heels next she s not obdurate when you see me running at her heels itll be with my head off stir your hardest and let it thicken that man morsfields name mixed up with a sham countess of ormont in the stories flying abroad cant hurt anybody a true countess of ormontwe re cut to the quick we re cut your quick charlotte is known to court the knife letters of the mornings post were brought in the earl turned over a couple and took up a third saying i ll attend to you in two minutes and thinking once more queer world it is where when you sheath the sword you have to be at play with bodkins lady charlotte gazed on the carpet effervescent with retorts to his last observation rightly conjecturing that the letter he selected to read was from his aminta the letter apparently was interesting or it was of inordinate length he seemed still to be reading he reverted to the first page at the sound of the paper she discarded her cogitations and glanced up his countenance had become stony he read on some way with a sudden drop on the signature a recommencement a sound in the throat as when men grasp a comprehensible sentence of a muddled rigmarole and begin to have hopes of the remainder but the eye on the page is not the eye which reads no bad news rowsley the earls breath fell heavily lady charlotte left her chair and walked about the room rowsley i d like to hear if i can be of use maam he said and pondered on the word use staring at her i dont intend to pry i cant see my brother look like that and not ask the letter was tossed on the table to her she read these lines dated from felixstowe my dear lord the courage i have long been wanting in has come at last to break a tie that i have seen too clearly was a burden on you from the beginning i will believe that i am chiefly responsible for inducing you to contract it the alliance with an inexperienced girl of inferior birth and a perhaps immoderate ambition has taxed your generosity and though the store may be inexhaustible it is not truly the married state when a wife subjects the husband to such a trial the release is yours the sadness is for me i have latterly seen or suspected a design on your part to meet my former wishes for a public recognition of the wife of lord ormont let me now say that these foolish wishes no longer exist i rejoice to think that my staying or going will be alike unknown to the world i have the means of a livelihood in a modest way and shall trouble no one i have said the sadness is for me that is truth but i have to add that i too am sensible of the release my confession of a change of feeling to you as a wife writes the close of all relations between us i am among the dead for you and it is a relief to me to reflect on the little pain i give has she something on her conscience about that man morsfield lady charlotte cried lord ormonts prolonged ah of execration rolled her to a bundle nevertheless her human nature and her knowledge of womans would out with the words theres a man she allowed her brother to be correct in repudiating the name of the dead morsfieldchivalrous as he was on this amintas behalf to the lastand struck along several heads adderwoods weyburns randellers for the response to her suspicion a man there certainly was he would be probably a young man he would not necessarily be a handsome man or a titled or a wealthy man she might have set eyes on a gypsy somewhere round great marlowblood to blood such things have been imagining a wildish man for her rather than a handsome one and one devoted staidly to the founding of a school she overlooked weyburn or reserved him with others for subsequent speculation the remainder of amintas letter referred to her delivery of the ormont jewelcase at lord ormonts london house under charge of her maid carstairs the affairs of the household were stated very succinctly the drawer for labelled keys whatever pertained to her management in london or at great marlow she s cool lady charlotte said after reading out the orderly array of items in a tone of rasping irony to convince her brother he was well rid of a heartless wench amintas written statement of those items were stabs at the home she had given him a flashed picture of his loss nothing written by her touched him to pierce him so shrewdly nothing could have brought him so closely the breathing image in the flesh of the woman now a phantom for him will she be expecting you to answer rowsley will that forked tongue cease hissing he shouted in the agony of a strong man convulsed both to render and conceal the terrible shameful unexampled gush of tears lady charlotte beheld her bleeding giant she would rather have seen the brother of her love grimace in womans manner than let loose those rolling big drops down the face of a rock the big sob shook him and she was shaken to the dust by the sight now she was advised by her deep affection for her brother to sit patient and dumb behind shaded eyes praising in her heart the incomparable force of the mans love of the woman contrasted with the puling inclinations of the woman for the man neither opened mouth when they separated she pressed and kissed a large nerveless hand lord ormont stood up to bow her forth his ruddied skin had gone to pallor resembling the berg of ice on the edge of arctic seas when sunlight has fallen away from it chapter xxx conclusion the peaceful little home on the solitary sandy shore was assailed unwarned beneath a quiet sky some hours later by a whirlwind a duststorm and rattling volleys miss vincents discovery in the past schooldays of selina colletts wicked complicity in a clandestine correspondence had memorably chastened the girl who vowed at the time when her schoolmistress using the rod of johnsonian english for the purpose exposed the depravity of her sinfulness that she would never again be guilty of a like offence her dear and lovely countess of ormont for whom she then uncomplainingly suffered who deigned now to call her friend had spoken the kind goodbye and left the house after mr weyburns departure that same day she of course to post by harwich to london he to sail by packet from the port of harwich for flushing the card of an unknown lady a great lady the lady charlotte eglett was handed to her mother at eight oclock in the evening lady charlotte was introduced to the innocent country couple the mother knitting the daughter studying a book of the botany of the swiss alps dreaming a distant days journey over historic lands of various hues to the unimaginable spectacle of earths grandeur her visit lasted fifteen minutes from the moment of her entry the room was in such turmoil as may be seen where a watermill wheels paddles are suddenly set rounding to pour streams of foam on the smooth pool below a relentless catechism bewildered their hearing mrs collett attempted an opposition of dignity to those vehement attacks for answers it was flooded and rolled over she was put upon her honour to reply positively to positive questions whether the countess of ormont was in this house at present whether the countess of ormont left the house alone or in company whether a gentleman had come to the house during the stay of the countess of ormont whether lady ormont had left the neighbourhood the exact time of the day when she quitted the house and the stated point of her destination ultimately protesting that they were incapable of telling what they did not knowwhich lady charlotte heard with an incredulous shrugthey related piecemeal what they did know and weyburns name gave her scent she paid small heed to the tale of mr weyburns having come there in the character of young mr colletts old schoolmate mr weyburn had started for the port of harwich this day and not long subsequently lady ormont had started for the port of harwich on her way to london if we like to think it further corroboration was quite superfluous is there a night packetboat from this port of yours lady charlotte asked the household servants had to be consulted and she hurriedly craving the excuse of their tedious mistress elicited as far as she could understand them that there might be and very nearly was a night packetboat starting for flushing the cook a native of harwich sent up word of a night packetboat starting at about eleven oclock last year lady charlotte saw the chance as a windblown beaconfire under press of shades changeing her hawkish manner toward the simple pair she gave them view of a smile magical by contrast really beautifulthe smile she had in reserve for serviceable persons whom she trustedwhile thanking them and saying that her anxiety concerned lady ormonts welfare her brother had prophesied she would soon be running at his wifes heels and so she was but not with her head off as she had rejoined she might prove by intercepting his aminta that her head was on the windy beaconfire of a chance blazed at the rapid rolling of her carriagewheels and sank to stifling smoke at any petty obstruction let her but come to an interview with his aminta she would stop all that nonsense of the womans letter carry her offand her weyburn plucking at her other hand to keep her why naturally treated as she was by rowsley she dropped soft eyes on a goodlooking secretary any woman wouldconfound the young fellow but all s right yet if we get to harwich in time unless as a certain coldfish finale tone of the letter playing on the old string the irrevocable peculiar to women who are novices in situations of the kind appeared to indicate they see in their conscienceblasted minds a barrier to a return home high as the archangelical gate behind mother eve and they are down on their knees blubbering gratitude and repentance if the gate swings open to them it is just the instant granting the catastrophe to have a woman back to her duty she has only to learn she has a magnanimous husband if she learns into the bargain how he suffers how he loves herwell she despises a man like that lawrence finchley all the more for the magnanimity she has the profit of and perceives to be feebleness but there s woman in her good and her bad shell trick a man of age and if he forgives her owning his own faults in the case she wont scorn him for it the likelihood is she ll feel bound in honour to serve him faithfully for the rest of their wedded days a sketch to her of rowsleys deep love lady charlotte wandered into an amazement at it a sentence of her brothers recent speaking danced in her recollection he said of his country that lout comes to a knowledge of his wants too late true old england is always louting to the rear and has to be pricked in the rear and pulled by the neck before she s equal to the circumstances around her but what if his words were flung at him in turn short of lout it rang correctly too late we hope to clip from the end of the sentence likewise we have then if you stress itcomes to a knowledge of his wantsa fair example of the creatures men are the greatest of men who have to learn from the loss of the womanor a fear of the losshow much they really do love her well and she may learn the same or something sufficiently like it if she s caught in time called to her face countess of ormont sisterinlaw and smoothed petted made believe she s now understood and wont be questioned on a single particularin fact she marches back in a sort of triumph and all the past in a cupboard locked up without further inquiry her brother rowsleys revealed human appearance of the stricken manstricken right into his big heartprecipitated lady charlottes reflections and urged her to an unavailing fever of haste during the circuitous drive in moonlight to the port she alighted at the principal inn and was there informed that the packetboat with a favouring breeze and tide had started ten minutes earlier she summoned the landlord and described a lady as probably one of the passengers dark holds herself up high some such lady had dined at the inn on tea and gone aboard the boat soon after lady charlotte burned with the question alone she repressed her feminine hunger and asked to see the book of visitors but the lady had not slept at the inn so had not been requested to write her name the track of the vessel could be seen from the pier on the line of a bar of moonlight and thinking that the abominable woman if aboard she was had coolly provided herself with a continental passportor had it done for two by her accomplice that weyburn before she left londonlady charlotte sent a loathing gaze at the black figure of the boat on the water untroubled by any reminder of her share in the conspiracy of events which was to be her brothers chastisement to his end years are the teachers of the great rocky natures whom they round and sap and pierce in caverns having them on all sides and striking deep inward at moments there is no resisting the years if we have a heart and a common understanding they constitute in the sum of them the selfexamination whence issues acknowledged or not a belated selfknowledge to direct our final actions she had the heart sight of the highminded proud speechless man suffering for the absence of a runaway woman not ceasing to suffer never blaming the woman and consequently it could be fancied blaming himself broke down lady charlottes defences and moved her to review her part in her brother rowsleys unhappiness for supposing him to blame himself her power to cast a shadow of blame on him went from her and therewith her vindication of her conduct he lived at olmer she read him by degrees as those who have become absolutely tongueless have to be read and so she gathered that this mortally or lastingly wounded brother of hers was pleased by an allusion to his aminta he ran his finger on the lines of a map of spain from barcelona over to granada and impressed his nail at a point appearing to be mountainous or woody lady charlotte suggested that he and his aminta had passed by there he told a story of a carriage accident added she was very brave one day when he had taken a keepsake book of englands beauties off the drawingroom table his eyes dwelt on a face awhile and he handed it with a nod followed by a slight depreciatory shrug like her not so handsome lady charlotte said he nodded again she came to a knowledge of amintas favourite colours through the dwelling of his look on orange and black deepest rose light yellow light blue her granddaughters won the satisfied look if they wore a combination touching his memory the rocky are not imaginative and have to be struck from without for a kindling of them submissive though she was to court and soothe her brother rowsley a spur of jealousy burned in the composition of her sentiments to set her going he liked visiting mrs lawrence finchley at her effaced good mans country seat brockholm in berkshire and would stay there a month at a time lady charlotte learnt why the enthusiast for aminta without upholding her to her late lord whom she liked well talked of her openly with him confessed to a fondness for her how much mrs lawrence ventured to say lady charlotte could not know but rivalry pushed her to the extreme of making aminta partially a topic and so ready was he to follow her lead in the veriest trifles recalling the handsome runaway that she had to excite his racy diatribes against the burgess english and the pulp they have made of a glorious nation in order not to think him inclining upon dotage philippas occasional scoff in fun concerning grandmamas tutor hurt lady charlotte for more reasons than one notwithstanding the justification of her forethoughtfulness the girl however was privileged she was bobby benlews dearest friend and my lord loved the boy with whom nothing could be done at school nor could a tutor at olmer control him in fine bobby saddened the family and gained the earls anxious affection by giving daily proofs of his being an ormont in a weak frame patently an ormont recurrently an invalid his moral qualities hurled him on his physical deficiencies the local doctor and dr rewkes banished him twice to the seashore where he began to bloom the first week and sickened the next for want of playfellows jolly fights and friendships ultimately they prescribed mountain air swiss air easy travelling to switzerland and several weeks of excursions at the foot of the alps bobby might possibly get an aged tutor or find an english clergyman taking pupils on the way thus it happened that seven years after his bereavement lord ormont and philippa and bobby were on the famous bernese terrace grandest of terrestrial theatres where soul of man has fronting him earths utmost majesty sublime but five minutes of it fetched sounds as of a plug in an empty phial from bobbys bosom and his heels became electrical he was observed at play with a gentleman of italian complexion past guessing how it had come about for the gentleman was an utter stranger he had at any rate the tongue of an englishman he had the style too the slang and cries and tricks of an english schoolboy though visibly a foreigner and he had the art of throwing his heart into that bit of improvised game or he would never have got hold of bobby shrewd to read a masker luggedup by the boy to my lord and the young lady he doffed and bowed forgive me pray he said i cant see an english boy without having a spin with him and i make so bold as to speak to english people wherever i meet them if they give me the chance bad manners better than that you are of the military profession sir i see i am a soldier fresh from monte video italian it is evident under an italian chief there a clerk on a stool and hey presto plunged into the war a month after shouldering a gun and marching fifteen battles in eighteen months and death a lady at a balcony we kiss hands to on the march below not a bit more terrible ah but your pardon sir he hastened to say observing rigidity on the features of the english gentleman would i boast not i accept it as my preface for why i am moved to speak the english wherever i meet themuruguay buenos ayres la plata or europe i cannot resist it at least he bent gracefully i do not we come to the grounds of my misbehaviour i have shown at every call i fear nothing kiss hand of welcome or adieu to death and i a boy of the age of this youngsterhe s not like me i can declarei was a sneak and a coward it follows i was a liar and a traitor who cured me of that vileness that scandal i will tell youan englishman and an englishwoman my schoolmaster and his wife my schoolmastermy friend he is the comrade of his boys english french germans italians a spaniard in my timea south american i have sent himtwo from boston massachusettsand cleverall emulous to excel none boasting but to myself i was that mean fellow i didi could let you know before this young ladyshe would wither me with her scorn enough i sneaked i lied i let the blame fall on a schoolfellow and a housemaid oh a small thing but i coveted ita scarf it reminded me of rome enough there at the bottom of that pit behold me it was not discovered but my schoolfellow was unpunished the housemaid remained in service i thought i thought and i thought until i could not look in my dear friend matthews face he said to me one day have you nothing to tell me giulio as if to ask the road to right or left out it all came and no sermon no he set me the hardest task i could have that was a penanceto go to his wife and tell it all to her then i did think it an easier thing to go and face deathand death had been my nightmare i went she listened she took my hand she said you will never do this again i know giulio she told me no english girl would ever look on a man who was a coward and lied from that day i have made truth my bride and what the consequence i know not fear i could laugh knowing i was to lie down in my sixfoot measure tomorrow if i have done my duty and look in the face of my dear matthew and his wife ah those two they are loved they will be loved all over europe he works for europe and americaall civilized peopleto be one country he is the comrade of his boys out of school hours it is christian names all roundmatthew emile adolf emilio giulio robert marcel franz et caetera games or lessons a boy cant help learning with him he makes happy fellows and brave soldiers of them without drill sir do i presume when i say i have your excuse for addressing you because you are his countryman i drive to the old school in half an hour and next week he and his dear wife and a good half of the boys will be on the tramp over the simplon by lago maggiore to my uncles house in milan for a halt i go to matthew before i see my own people he swept another bow of apology chiefly to philippa as representative of the sex claiming homage lord ormont had not greatly relished certain of the flowery phrases employed by this young foreigner truth his bride was damnable and if a story had to be told he liked it plain without jerks and evolutions many offences to our taste have to be overlooked in foreignersitalians considered before they were proved in fire a people classed by nature as operatic declaimers bobby had shown himself on the road out to bern a difficult boy and stupefyingly ignorant my lord had two or three ideas working to cloudy combination in his head when he put a question referring to the management of the dormitories at the school whereupon the young italian introduced himself as giulio calliani and proposed a drive to inspect the old school with its cricket and football fields lake for rowing and swimming gymnastic fixtures carpenters shed bowling alley and four european languages in the air by turns daily and the boys too all the boys rosy and jolly according to the last report received of them from his friend matthew enthusiasm struck and tightened the loose chord of scepticism in lord ormont somewhat as if a dancing beggar had entered a kenneldogs yard designing to fascinate the faithful beast it is a chord of one note that is tightened to sound by the violent summons to accept which is a provocation to deny at the same time the enthusiasts dance is rather funny he is not an ordinary beggar to see him trip himself in his dance would be rather funnier this is to say inspect the trumpeted school and retire politely my lord knew the bern of frequent visits the woman was needed beside him to inspire a feeling for scenic mountains philippas admiration of them was like a newpressed grapejuice after a draught of the ripe vintage moreover bobby was difficult the rejected of his english schools was a stiff ormont at lessons a wheezy benlew in the playground exactly the reverse of what should have been a school of four languages in bracing air if a school with healthy dormitories and a school of the trained instincts we call gentlemanly might suit master bobby for a trial an eye on the boys of the school would see in a minute what stuff they were made of supposing this young italianissimo with the english tongue to be tolerably near the mark with a deduction of twothirds of the enthusiasm bobby might stop at the school as long as his health held out or the master would keep him supposing half a dozen things and more the meeting with this mr calliand was a lucky accident but lucky accidents are anticipated only by fools lord ormont consented to visit the school he handed his card and invited his guest he had a carriage in waiting for the day he said and obedient to lady charlottes injunctions he withheld philippa from the party she and her maid were to pass the five hours of his absence in efforts to keep their monkey bobby out of the well of the solicitious bears my lord left his carriage at the inn of the village lying below the schoolhouse on a green height the young enthusiast was dancing him into the condition of livid taciturnity which could if it would flash out pungent epigrams of the actual world at operatic recitative theres the old schoolclock just in time for the halfhour before dinner said calliani chattering two hundred to the minute of the habits and usages of the school and how all had meals together the master his wife the teachers the boys and sheas for her calliani kissed finger up to the furthest skies into which a selfrespecting sober northener of the isles could imagine himself to kick enthusiastic gesticulators if it were polite to do so the schoolhouse faced the masters dwelling house and these with a block of building formed a threesided enclosure like barracks forth from the schoolhouse door burst a dozen shouting lads as wasps from the hole of their nest from a charge of powder out they poured whizzing and the frog he leaped and pussy ran and doubled before the hounds and hockeysticks waved and away went a ball cracks at the ball anyhow was the game for the twentyfive minutes breather before dinner french day said calliani hearing their cries then he bellowed matthewgiulio a lusty inversion of the order of the names and an oberland jodel returned his hail the school retreating caught up the alpine cry in the distance here were lungs here were sprites lord ormont bethought him of the name of the master mr matthew i think you said sir he was observing to calliani as the master came nearer and calliani replied his christian name but if the boys are naughty boys it is not the privilege mr weyburn there was not any necessity to pronounce that name calliani spoke it on the rush to his friend lord ormont and weyburn advanced the steps to the meeting neither of them flinched in eye or limb at a corridor window of the dwellinghouse a lady stood her colour was the last of a summer day over western seas her thought it has come her mind was in her sight her other powers were frozen the two men conversed there was no gesture this is one of the lightning moments of life for the woman at the meeting of the two men between whom her person has been in dispute may still be her soul being with one and that one dearer than the blood of her body imperilled by her she could ask why she exists if a question were in her grasp she would ask for the meaning of the gift of beauty to the woman making her desireable to those two men making her a cause of strife a thing of doom an incessant clamour dinned about her it has come the two men walked conversing into the schoolhouse she was unconscious of the seeing of a third though she saw and at the back of her mind believed she knew a friend in him the two disappeared she was insensible stone except for the bellclang it has come until they were in view again still conversing and the first of her thought to stir from petrifaction was life holds no secret she tried in shame of the inanimate creature she had become to force herself to think and had for a chastising result a series of geometrical figures shooting across her brain mystically expressive of the situation not communicably the most vivid and persistent was a triangle interpret who may the one beheld the two pass from view again still conversing they are on the gravel they bow they separate he of the grey
