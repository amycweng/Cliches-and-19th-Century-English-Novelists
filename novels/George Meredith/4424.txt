night before xxxvi edward meets his match xxxvii edward tries his eloquence xxxviii too late chapter xxx those two in the open carriage one of whom had called out sedgetts name were robert and major waring when the cab had flown by they fell back into their seats and smoked the original stipulation for the day having been that no harassing matter should be spoken of till nightfall true to this robert tried to think hard on the scene of his recent enjoyment horses were to him what music is to a poet and the glory of the races he had witnessed was still quick in heart and partly counteracted his astonishment at the sight of his old village enemy in company with algernon blancove it was not astonishing at all to him that they should have quarrelled and come to blows for he knew sedgett well and the imperative necessity for fighting him if only to preserve a mans selfrespect and the fair division of peace when once he had been allowed to get upon terms sufficiently close to assert his black nature but how had it come about how was it that a gentleman could consent to appear publicly with such a fellow he decided that it meant something and something ominousbut what whom could it affect was algernon blancove such a poor creature that feeling himself bound by certain dark dealings with sedgett to keep him quiet he permitted the bullying dog to hang to his coattail it seemed improbable that any young gentleman should be so weak but it might be the case and if so thought robert and i let him know i bear him no illwill for setting sedgett upon me i may be doing him a service he remembered with pain algernons glance of savage humiliation upward just before he turned to follow sedgett into the cab and considered that he ought in kindness to see him and make him comfortable by apologizing as if he himself had no complaint to make he resolved to do it when the opportunity should come meantime what on earth brought them together how white the hedges are he said theres a good deal of dust major waring replied i wasnt aware that cabs came to the races they do you see robert perceived that percy meant to fool him if he attempted a breach of the bond but he longed so much for percys opinion of the strange alliance between sedgett and algernon blancove that at any cost he was compelled to say i cant get to the bottom of that that squabble in the road said percy we shall see two or three more before we reach home no whats the meaning of a gentleman consorting with a blackguard robert persisted one or the other has discovered an assimilation i suppose percy gave answer thats an odd remark on returning from epsom those who jump into the same pond generally come out the same colour robert spoke low has it anything to do with the poor girl do you think i told you i declined to think till we were home again confound it man have you no idea of a holiday robert puffed his tobaccosmoke lets talk of mrs lovell he said thats not a holiday for me percy murmured but roberts mind was too preoccupied to observe the tone and he asked is she to be trusted to keep her word faithfully this time come said percy we havent betted today ill bet you she will if you like will you bet against it i wont i cant nibble at anything bettings like drinking but you can take a glass of wine this sort of bet is much the same however dont for you would lose there said robert ive heard of being angry with women for fickleness changeableness and all sorts of other things shes a lady i couldnt understand being downright angry with and heres the reason it aint a matter of reason at allshe fascinates me i do i declare clean forget rhoda i forget the girl if only i see mrs lovell at a distance hows that im not a fool with nonsensical fancies of any kind i know what loving a woman is and a man in my position might be ass enough toall sorts of things it isnt that its fascination im afraid of her if she talks to me i feel something like having gulped a bottle of wine some women you have a respect for some you like or you love some you despise with her i just feel im intoxicated major waring eyed him steadily he said ill unriddle it if i can to your comprehension she admires you for what you are and she lets you see it i dare say shes not unwilling that you should see it she has a worship for bravery its a deadly passion with her robert put up a protesting blush of modesty as became him then why if she does me the honour to think anything of me does she turn against me ah now you go deeper she is giving you what assistance she can at present be thankful if you can be satisfied with her present doings perhaps ill answer the other question byandby now we enter london and our day is over how did you like it roberts imagination rushed back to the downs the race was glorious i wish we could go at that pace in life i should have a certainty of winning how miserably dull the streets look and the people creep alongthey creep and seem to like it horsebacks my element they drove up to roberts lodgings where since the winter he had been living austerely and recklessly exiled by his sensitiveness from his two homes warbeach and wrexby and seeking over london for dahliaa pensioner on his friends bounty and therein had lain the degrading misery to a man of his composition often had he thought of enlisting again and getting drafted to a foreign station nothing but the consciousness that he was subsisting on money not his own would have kept him from his vice as it was he had lived through the months between winter and spring like one threading his way through the tortuous lengths of a cavern never coming to the light but coming upon absurd mishaps in his effort to reach it his adventures in london partook somewhat of the character of those in warbeach minus the victim for whom two or three gentlemen in public thoroughfares had been taken these misdemeanours in the face of civil society robert made no mention of in his letters to percy but there was light now though at first it gave but a faint glimmer in a ladys coloured envelope lying on the sittingroom table robert opened it hurriedly and read it seized dahlias address with a brain on fire and said its signed margaret lovell this time she calls me dear sir she could hardly do less percy remarked i know but there is a change in her theres a summer in her writing now she has kept her word percy shes the dearest lady in the world i dont ask why she didnt help me before you acknowledge the policy of mild measures said major waring shes the dearest lady in the world robert repeated he checked his enthusiasm lord in heaven what an evening i shall have the thought of his approaching interview with dahlia kept him dumb as they were parting in the street major waring said i will be here at twelve let me tell you this robert she is going to be married say nothing to dissuade her its the best she can do take a manly view of it goodbye robert was but slightly affected by the intelligence his thoughts were on dahlia as he had first seen her when in her bloom and the sister of his darling now miserable a thing trampled to earth with him pity for a victim soon became lost in rage at the author of the wrong and as he walked along he reflected contemptuously on his feeble efforts to avenge her at warbeach she lived in a poor row of cottages striking off from one of the main southwestern suburb roads not very distant from his own lodgings at which he marvelled as at a cruel irony he could not discern the numbers and had to turn up several of the dusky little strips of garden to read the numbers on the doors a faint smell of lilac recalled the country and old days and some church bells began ringing the number of the house where he was to find dahlia was seven he was at the door of the house next to it when he heard voices in the garden beside him a man said then i have your answer a woman said yes yes you will not trust to my pledged honour pardon me not that i will not live in disgrace when i promise on my soul that the moment i am free i will set you right before the world oh pardon me you will no no i cannot you choose to give yourself to an obscure dog wholl illtreat you and for whom you dont care a pinshead and why that you may be fenced from gossip and nothing more i thought you were a woman above that kind of meanness and this is a common countryman how will you endure that kind of life you were made for elegance and happiness you shall have it i met you before your illness when you would not listen to me i met you after i knew you at once am i changed i swear to you i have dreamed of you ever since and love you be as faded as you like be hideous if you like but come with me you know my name and what i am twice i have followed you and found your name and address twice i have written to you and made the same proposal and you wont trust to my honour when i tell you i love you tenderly when i give you my solemn assurance that you shall not regret it you have been deceived by one man why punish me i knowi feel you are innocent and good this is the third time that you have permitted me to speak to you let it be final say you will trust yourself to metrust in my honour say it shall be tomorrow yes say the word tomorrow my sweet creature do the man spoke earnestly but a third person and extraneous hearer could hardly avoid being struck by the bathetic conclusion at least in tone it bordered on a fall but the woman did not feel it so she replied you mean kindly to me sir i thank you indeed for i am very friendless oh pardon me i am quitequite determined gopray forget me this was dahlias voice robert was unconscious of having previously suspected it heartily ashamed of letting his ears be filled with secret talk he went from the garden and crossed the street he knew this to be one of the temptations of young women in london shortly after the man came through the iron gateway of the garden he passed under lamplight and robert perceived him to be a gentleman in garb a light appeared in the windows of the house now that he had heard her voice the terrors of his interview were dispersed and he had only plain sadness to encounter he knocked at the door quietly there was a long delay after he had sent in his name but finally admission was given if i had loved her groaned robert before he looked on her but when he did look on her affectionate pity washed the selfish man out of him all these false sensations peculiar to men concerning the soiled purity of woman the lost innocence the brand of shame upon her which are commonly the foul sentimentalism of such as can be too eager in the chase of corruption when occasion suits and are another side of pruriency not absolutely foreign to the best of us in our youthall passed away from him in dahlias presence the young man who can look on them we call fallen women with a noble eye is to my mind he that is most nobly begotten of the race and likeliest to be the sire of a noble line robert was less than he but dahlias aspect helped him to his rightful manliness he saw that her worth survived the creatures soul had put no gloss upon her sin she had sinned and her suffering was manifest she had chosen to stand up and take the scourge of god after which the stones cast by men are not painful by this i mean that she had voluntarily stripped her spirit bare of evasion and seen herself for what she was pleading no excuse his scourge is the truth and she had faced it innumerable fanciful thoughts few of them definite beset the mind at interviews such as these but robert was distinctly impressed by her look it was as that of one upon the yonder shore though they stood close together he had the thought of their being separatea gulf between the colourlessness of her features helped to it and the odd little closefitting white linen cap which she wore to conceal the stubborntwisting clipped curls of her shorn head made her unlike women of our world she was dressed in black up to the throat her eyes were still luminously blue and she let them dwell on robert one gentle instant giving him her hand humbly dahliamy dear sister i wish i could say but the lucks against me robert began she sat with her fingers locked together in her lap gazing forward on the floor her head a little sideways bent i believe he went oni havent heard but i believe rhoda is well she and father are well i know said dahlia robert started are you in communication with them she shook her head at the end of some days i shall see them and then perhaps youll plead my cause and make me thankful to you for life dahlia rhoda does not love you thats the fact if a young womans to be trusted to know her own mind in the first place and to speak it in the second dahlia closed her lips the longlined underlip was no more very red her heart knew that it was not to speak of himself that he had come but she was poorwitted through weakness of her blood and out of her own immediate line of thought could think neither far nor deep he entertained her with talk of his notions of rhoda finishing but at the end of a week you will see her and i dare say shell give you her notions of me dahlia how happy thisll make them i do say thank god from my soul for this she pressed her hands in her lap trembling if you will please not speak of it mr robert say only you do mean it dahlia you mean to let them see you she shivered out a yes thats right because a father and a sisterhavent they a claim think a while theyve had a terrible time and its true that youve consented to a husband dahlia im glad if it is and hes good and kind right soulglad i am while he was speaking her eyelids lifted and her eyes became fixed on him in a stony light of terror like a creature in anguish before her executioner then again her eyelids dropped she had not moved from her still posture you love him he asked in some wonderment she gave no answer dont you care for him there was no reply because dahlia if you do not i know i have no right to fancy you do not how is it tell me marriage is an awful thing where theres no love and this man whoever he isis he in good circumstances i wouldnt speak of him but you see i must as your friendand im that come he loves you of course he does he has said so i believe it and hes a man you can honour and esteem you wouldnt consent without im sure what makes me anxiousi look on you as my sister whether rhoda will have it so or not im anxious becauseim anxious it should be over for then rhoda will be proud of the faith she had in you and it will lighten the old mans heart once more the inexplicable frozen look struck over him from her opened eyes as if one of the minutes of time had yawned to show him its deep mute tragic abyss and was extinguished when does it take place dahlia her long underlip white almost as the row of teeth it revealed hung loose when he asked leaning forward to hear and the word was saturday uttered with a feeble harshness not like the gentle voice of dahlia this coming saturday no saturday week she fell into a visible trembling you named the day he pushed for an indication of cheerful consent to the act she was about to commit or of reluctance possibly she saw this for now she answered i did the sound was deep in her throat saturday week said robert i feel to the man as a brother already do you liveyoull live in the country abroad not in old england im sorry for that butwell things must be as theyre ordered heigho ive got to learn it dahlia smiled kindly rhoda will love you she is firm when she loves when she loves wheres the consolation to me do you think she loves me as muchas much as much as ever she loves her sister with all her heartall for i havent a bit of it it is because said dahlia slowly it is because she thinks i am here the poor creatures bosom heaved piteously what has she said of me i wish her to have blamed meit is less pain listen said robert she does not and couldnt blame you for its a sort of religion with her to believe no wrong of you and the reason why she hates me is that i knowing something more of the world suspected and chose to let her know iti said it in factthat you had been deceived by abut this isnt the time to abuse others she would have had me if i had thought proper to think as she thinks or play hypocrite and pretend to ill tell you openly dahlia your father thinks the worst ah you look the ghost again its hard for you to hear but you give me a notion of having got strength to hear it its your fathers way to think the worst now when you can show him your husband my dear hell lift his head hes old english he wont dream of asking questions hell see a brave and honest young man who must love you orhe does love you thats settled your fatherll shake his hand and as for rhoda shell triumph the only person to speak out to is the man who marries you and that youve done robert looked the interrogation he did not utter i have said dahlia good if i may call him brother some day all the better for me now you wont leave england the day youre married soon i pray that it may be soon yes well on that morning ill have your father and rhoda at my lodgings not wide from here if id only known it earlierand you and your husband shall come there and join us itll be a happy meeting at last dahlia stopped her breathing will you see rhoda ill go to her tomorrow if you like if i might see her just as i am leaving england not before thats not generous said robert isnt it she asked like a child fancyto see you shes been longing for and the ship that takes you off perhaps everlastingly as far as this worlds concerned mr robert i do not wish to deceive my sister father need not be distressed rhoda shall know i will not be guilty of falsehoods any moreno more will you go to her tell hertell rhoda what i am say i have been ill it will save her from a great shock she covered her eyes i said in all my letters that my husband was a gentleman it was her first openly penitential utterance in his presence and her cheeks were faintly reddened it may have been this motion of her blood which aroused the sunken humanity within her her heart leaped and she cried i can see her as i am i can i thought it impossible oh i can will she come to me my sister is a christian and forgives oh let me see her and go to her dear mr robert and ask hertell her all and ask her if i may be spared and may work at somethinganything for my livelihood near my sister it is difficult for women to earn money but i think i can i have done so since my illness i have been in the hospital with brain fever he was lodging in the house with me before he found me at the hospital when i came out he walked with me to support me i was very weak he read to me and then asked me to marry him he asked again i lay in bed one night and with my eyes open i saw the dangers of women and the trouble of my father and sister and pits of wickedness i saw like places full of snakes i had such a yearning for protection i gave him my word i would be his wife if he was not ashamed of a wife like me i wished to look once in fathers face i had fancied that rhoda would spurn me when she discovered my falsehood shesweet dear would she ever go to her say i do not love any man i am heartdead i have no heart except for her i cannot love a husband he is good and it is kind but oh let me be spared his face she pressed her hands tight into the hollow of her eyes no it cant be meant am i very ungrateful this does not seem to be what god orders only if this must be only if it must be if my sister cannot look on me without he is good and it is unselfish to take a moneyless disgraced creature but my miseryif my sister will see me without my doing thisgo to her mr robert say dahlia was false and repents and has worked with her needle to subsist and can and will for her soul strives to be clean try to make her understand if rhoda could love you she would know she is locked upshe is only ideas my sweet is so proud i love her for her pride if she will only let me creep to her feet kiss her feet dear mr robert help me help me i will do anything she says if she says i am to marry him i will dont mind my tearsthey mean nothing now tell my dear i will obey her i will not be false any more to her i wish to be quite stripped and rhoda may know me and forgive me if she can andoh if she thinks for fathers sake i ought i will submit and speak the words i will i am ready i pray for mercy robert sat with his fist at his temples in a frowning meditation had she declared her reluctance to take the step in the first moments of their interview he might have been ready to support her but a project fairly launched becomes a reality in the braina thing once spoken of attracts like a living creature and does not die voluntarily robert now beheld all that was in its favour and saw nothing but flighty flimsy objections to it he was hardly moved by her unexpected outburst besides there was his own position in the case rhoda would smile on him if he brought dahlia to her and brought her happy in the worlds eye it will act as a sort of signal for general happiness but if he had to go and explain matters base and mournful to her there would be no smile on her face and not much gratitude in her breast there would be none for a time certainly proximity to her faded sister made him conceive her attainable and thrice precious by contrast he fixed his gaze on dahlia and the perfect refinement of her simplicity caused him to think that she might be aware of an inappropriateness in the contemplated union is he a clumsy fellow i mean do you read straight off that he has no pretension to any manners of a gentlemannothing near it to this question put with hesitation by robert dahlia made answer i respect him she would not strengthen her prayer by drawing the mans portrait speedily she forgot how the doing so would in any way have strengthened her prayer the excitement had left her brain dull she did little more than stare mildly and absently bend her head while robert said that he would go to rhoda on the morrow and speak seriously with her but i think i can reckon her ideas will side with mine that it is to your interest my dear to make your feelings come round warm to a man you can respect and who offers you a clear path he said whereat dahlia quietly blinked her eyes when he stood up she rose likewise am i to take a kiss to rhoda he said and seeing her answer bent his forehead to which she put her lips and now i must think all night long about the method of transferring it goodbye dahlia you shall hear from your sister the morning after tomorrow goodbye he pressed her hand and went to the door theres nothing i can do for you dahlia not anything god bless you my dear robert breathed with the pleasant sense of breathing when he was again in the street amazement that what he had dreaded so much should be so easily over set him thinking in his fashion on the marvels of life and the naturalness in the aspect of all earthly things when you look at them with your eyes but in the depths of his heart there was disquiet its the best she can do she can do no better he said and said it more frequently than it needed by a mind established in the conviction gradually he began to feel that certain things seen with the eyes natural as they may then appear and little terrible leave distinct solid and grave impressions something of what our human tragedy may show before high heaven possessed him he saw it bare of any sentiment in the person of the girl dahlia he could neither put a halo of imagination about her nor could he conceive one degraded thought of the creature she stood a naked sorrow haunting his brain and still he continued saying its the best she can do its best for all she can do nothing better he said it unaware that he said it in selfdefence the pale nunlike ghostly face hung before him stronger in outline the farther time widened between him and that suffering flesh chapter xxxi the thousand pounds were in algernons hands at last he had made his escape from boynes bank early in the afternoon that he might obtain the cheque and feel the money in his pocket before that days sun was extinguished there was a note for five hundred four notes for a hundred severally and two fifties and all had come to him through the mere writing down of his name as a recipient of the sum it was enough to make one in love with civilization money when it is once in your pocket seems to have come there easily even if you have worked for it but if you have done no labour whatever and still find it there your sensations supposing you to be a butterfly youththe typical child of a wealthy country exult marvellously and soar above the conditions of earth he knew the very features of the notes that gallant old five hundred who might have been a thousand but that he had nobly split himself into centurions and skirmishers stood in his imaginative contemplation like a grand whiteheaded warrior clean from the slaughter and in courtrufflessay blucher at the court of the waterloo regent the hundreds were his generals the fifties his captains and each one was possessed of unlimited power of splitting himself into serviceable regiments at the call of his lord algernon he scarcely liked to make the secret confession that it was the largest sum he had ever as yet carried about but as it heightened his pleasure he did confess it for half an instant five hundred in the bulk he had never attained to he felt it as a fortification against every mishap in life to a young man commonly in difficulties with regard to the paying of his cabman and latterly the getting of his dinner the sense of elevation imparted by the sum was intoxicating but thinking too much of the five hundred waxed dangerous for the fifties it dwarfed them to such insignificance that it made them lose their selfrespect so algernon pursuing excellent tactics set his mind upon some stray shillings that he had a remainder of five pounds borrowed from old anthony when he endeavoured to obtain repayment of the one pound and interest dating from the night at the theatre algernon had stopped his mouth on that point as well as concerning his acquaintance with dahlia by immediately attempting to borrow further whenever anthony led the way for a word in private a onepound creditor had no particular terrors for him and he manoeuvred the old man neatly saying as previously really i dont know the young person you allude to i happened to meet her or some one like her casually and dropping his voice im rather shortwhat do you think could youa trifling accommodation from which anthony fled but on the day closing the epsom week he beckoned anthony secretly to follow him out of the office and volunteered to give news that he had just heard of dahlia oh said anthony ive seen her i havent said algernon upon my honour yes ive seen her sir and sorry to hear her husbands fallen a bit low anthony touched his pocket what they calls nip tides aint it algernon sprang a compliment under him which sent the vain old fellow up whether he would or not to the effect that anthonys tides were not subject to lunar influence now mr blancove you must change them notions o me i dont say i shouldnt be richer if id got whats owing to me youd have to be protected youd be bullion on two legs said algernon always shrewd in detecting a weakness youd have to go about with sentries on each side and sleep in an iron safe the end of the interview was a visit to the publichouse and the transferring of another legal instrument from algernon to anthony the latter departed moaning over his five pounds ten shillings in paper the former rejoicing at his five pounds in gold that day was saturday on monday only a few shillings of the five pounds remained but they were sufficient to command a cab and if modesty in dining was among the prescriptions for the day a dinner algernon was driven to the west he remembered when he had plunged in the midst of the fashionable whirlpool having felt reckless there formerly but he had become remarkably sedate when he stepped along the walks a certain equipage or horse was to his taste and once he would have said thats the thing for me being penniless now on the contrary he reckoned the possible cost grudgingly saying eh to himself and responding no faintly and then more positively wont do he was by no means acting as one on a footing of equality with the people he beholds a man who is ready to wager a thousand pounds that no other man present has that amount in his pocket can hardly feel unequal to his company charming ladies on horseback cantered past let them go he thought yesterday the sight of one would have set him dreaming on grand alliances when you can afford to be a bachelor the case is otherwise presently who should ride by but mrs lovell she was talking more earnestly than was becoming to that easymannered darkeyed fellow the man who had made him savage by entering the operabox poor old ned said algernon i must put him on his guard but even the lifting of a fingera hint on paperwould bring edward over from paris as he knew and that was not in his scheme so he only determined to write to his cousin a flood of evening gold lay over the western park the glory of this place algernon said to himself is that youre sure of meeting none but gentlemen here and he contrasted it with epsom downs a superstitious horror seized him when casting his eyes ahead he perceived sedgett among the tasteful groupsas discordant a figure as could well be seen and clumsily aware of it for he could neither step nor look like a man at ease algernon swung round and retraced his way but sedgett had long sight id heard of londonalgernon soon had the hated voice in his ears and ive bin up to london bfore i came here to have a wink at the fashnableshang me if ever i see such a scrumptious lot its worth a walk up and down for a hour or more d you come heer often sir eh who are you oh said algernon half mad with rage excuse me and he walked faster fifty times over sedgett responded cheerfully id pace you for a match up and down this place if you liked aint the horses a spectacle id rather be heer than there at they races as for the ladies ill tell you what ladies or no ladies give my young woman time for her hair to grow and her colour to come by george if she wouldnt shine against eer a onesmite me stone blind if she wouldnt so she shall australiall see i owe you my thanks for interdoocin me and never fear my not remembering where there was a crowd algernon could elude his persecutor by threading his way rapidly but the open spaces condemned him to merciless exposure and he flew before eyes that his imagination exaggerated to a stretch of supernatural astonishment the tips of his fingers the roots of his hair pricked with vexation and still manoeuvre as he might sedgett followed him call at my chambers he said sternly youre never at home sir call tomorrow morning at ten and see a great big black door and kick at it till my toe comes through my boot thank ye i tell you i wont have you annoying me in public once for all why sir i thought we parted friends last time didnt you shake my hand now didnt you shake my hand sir i ask you whether you shook my hand or whether you didnt a plain answer we had a bit of a scrimmage coming home i admit we had but shaking hands means friends again we are i know youre a gentleman and a man like me shouldnt be so bold as fur to strike his betters only dont you see sir fullobeers a hasty chap and up in a minute and hes sorry for it after algernon conceived a brilliant notion drawing five shillings from his pocket he held them over to sedgett and told him to drive down to his chambers and await his coming sedgett took the money but it was five shillings lost he made no exhibition of receiving orders and it was impossible to address him imperiously without provoking observations of an animated kind from the elegant groups parading and sitting young harry latters caught algernons eye never was youth more joyfully greeted harry spoke of the fridays race and the defection of the horse tenpenny nail a man passed with a nod and how d ye do for which he received in reply a cool stare whos that algernon asked the son of a high dignitary said harry you cut him i can do the thing you see when its a public duty whats the matter with him merely a blackleg a grec a cheat swindler or whatever name you like said harry we none of us nod to the professionals in this line and i wont exchange salutes with an amateur im peculiar he chose to be absent on the right day last year so from that date i consider him absent in toto none of your rrrrrm reckonings lets have the rrrrr m totoyou remember sucklings story of the yankee fellow byebye shall see you the day after tomorrow you dine with me and suckling at the club latters was hailed by other friends algernon was forced to let him go he dipped under the iron rail and crossed the row at a run an indecorous proceeding he could not help it the hope was that sedgett would not have the like audacity or might be stopped and algernons reward for so just a calculation was that on looking round he found himself free he slipped with all haste out of the park sedgetts presence had the deadening power of the torpedo on the thousand pounds for the last quarter of an hour algernon had not felt a motion of it a cab to make his escape certain was suggested to his mind and he would have called a cab had not the novel apparition of economy which now haunted him suggested that he had recently tossed five shillings into the gutter a man might dine on four shillings and sixpence enjoying a modest halfpint of wine and he possessed that sum to pinch himself and deserve well of providence he resolved not to drink wine but beer that day he named the beverage a pintbottle of ale and laughed as a royal economist may who punishes himself to please himself mighty jolly aint it sir said sedgett at his elbow algernon faced about and swore an oath from his boots upward so vehement was his disgust and allpervading his amazement ill wallop you at that game said sedgett you infernal scoundrel if you begin swearing sedgett warned him what do you want with me ill tell you sir i dont want to go to neer a cockfight nor betting hole here come up this street said algernon leading the way into a dusky defile from a main parade of fashion now whats your business confound you well sir i aint goin to be confounded that illill swear to the long and the short is i must have some money fore the weeks out you wont have a penny from me thats blunt though it aint in my pocket said sedgett grinning i say sir respectful as you like i must ive got to pay for passengerin over the sea self and wife and quick it must be theres things to buy on both sides a small advance and you wont be bothered say fifty fifty and you dont see me till saturday when accordin to agreement you hand to me the cash outside the church door and then we parts to meet no more oh let us be joyfulill sing algernons loathing of the coarseness and profanity of villany increased almost to the depth of a sentiment as he listened to sedgett i do nothing of the sort he said you shall not have a farthing be off if you follow me i give you into custody of a policeman you durst nt sedgett eyed him warily he could spy a physical weakness by affinity of cowardice as quickly as algernon a moral weakness by the same sort of relationship to it you dont dare sedgett pursued and why should you sir theres neer a reason why im civil i asks for my own no more n my own it aint i call the bargain good why shd i want fur to break it i want the money bad im sick o this country id like to be off in the first ship that sails cant you let me have ten till tomorrow then t other forty ive got a mortal need for it that i have come its no use your walking at that rate my legs ares good as yours algernon had turned back to the great thoroughfare he was afraid that ten pounds must be forfeited to this worrying demon in the flesh and sought the countenance of his welldressed fellows to encourage him in resisting he could think of no subterfuge menace was clearly useless and yet the idea of changeing one of the notes and for so infamous a creature caused pangs that helped him further to endure his dogging feet and filthy tongue this continued until he saw a womans hand waving from a cab presuming that such a signal objectionable as it was must be addressed to himself he considered whether he should lift his hat or simply smile as a favoured but not too deeply flattered man the cab drew up and the woman said sedgett she was a welllooking woman strongly coloured browneyed and hearty in appearance what a brute you are sedgett not to be at home when you brought me up to london with all the boxes and beddingmy goodness its a providence i caught you in my eye or i should have been driving down to the docks and seeing about the ship you are a brute come in at once if youre up to calling names ive got one or two for you sedgett growled algernon had heard enough sure that he had left sedgett in hands not likely to relinquish him he passed on with elastic step wine was greatly desired after his torments where was credit to be had true he looked contemptuously on the blooming land of credit now but an entry to it by one of the back doors would have been convenient so that he might be nourished and restored by a benevolent dinner while he kept his thousand intact however he dismissed the contemplation of credit and its transient charms i wont dine at all he said a beggar woman stretched out her handhe dropped a shilling in it hang me if i shall be able to was his next reflection and with the remaining three and sixpence he crossed the threshold of a tobacconists shop and bought cigars to save himself from excesses in charity after gravely reproaching the tobacconist for the growing costliness of cigars he came into the air feeling extraordinarily empty of this he soon understood the cause and it amused him accustomed to the smell of tobacco always when he came from his dinner it seemed as the fumes of the shop took his nostril that demands were being made within him by an inquisitive spirit and dissatisfaction expressed at the vacancy there whats the use i cant dine he uttered argumentatively im not going to change a note and i wont dine ive no club theres not a fellow i can see wholl ask me to dine ill lounge along home there is some sherry there but algernon bore vividly in mind that he did not approve of that sherry ive heard of fellows frying sausages at home and living on something like two shillings a day he remarked in meditation and then it struck him that mrs lovells parcel of returned jewels lay in one of his drawers at homethat is if the laundress had left the parcel untouched in an agony of alarm he called a cab and drove hotly to the temple finding the packet safe he put a couple of rings and the necklace with the opal in his waistcoat pocket the cabman must be paid of course so a jewel must be pawned which shall it be diamond or opal change a dozen times and let it be the trinket in the right handthe opal let it be the opal how much would the opal fetch the pawnbroker can best inform us upon that point so he drove to the pawnbroker one whom he knew the pawnbroker offered him fiveandtwenty pounds on the security of the opal what on earth is it that people think disgraceful in your entering a pawnbrokers shop algernon asked himself when taking his ticket and the fiveandtwenty pounds he repelled the stare of a man behind a neighbouring partition there are not many of that sort in the kingdom he said to the pawnbroker who was loftily fondling the unlucky opal wellhm perhaps theres not the pawnbroker was ready to admit it now that the arrangement had been settled i shant be able to let you keep it long as quick back as you like sir algernon noticed as he turned away that the man behind the partition who had more the look of a dapper young shopman than of a needy petitioner for loans or securities stretched over the counter to look at the opal and he certainly heard his name pronounced it enraged him but policy counselled a quiet behaviour in this place and no quarrelling with his pawnbroker besides his whole nature cried out for dinner he dined and had his wine as good he ventured to assert as any man could get for the money for he knew the hotels with the venerable cellars i should have made a firstrate courier to a millionaire he said with scornful candour but without abusing the disposition of things which had ordered his being a gentleman subsequently from his having sat so long over his wine without moving a leg he indulged in the belief that he had reflected profoundly out of which depths he started very much like a man who has dozed and felt a discomfort in his limbs and head i must forget myself he said nor was any grave mentor by to assure him that his tragic state was the issue of an evil digestion of his dinner and wine i must forget myself im under some doom i see it now nobody cares for me i dont know what happiness is i was born under a bad star my fates written following his youthful wisdom this wounded hart dragged his slow limbs toward the halls of brandy and song one learns to have compassion for fools by studying them and the fool though nature is wise is next door to nature he is naked in his simplicity he can tell us much and suggest more my excuse for dwelling upon him is that he holds the link of my story where fools are numerous one of them must be prominent now and then in a veracious narration there comes an hour when the veil drops on him he not being always clean to the discreeter touch algernon was late at the bank next day and not cheerful though he received his customary reprimand with submission this day was after the pattern of the day preceding except that he did not visit the park the night likewise on wednesday morning he arose with the conviction that england was no place for him to dwell in what if rhoda were to accompany him to one of the colonies the idea had been gradually taking shape in his mind from the moment that he had possessed the thousand could she not make butter and cheeses capitally while he rode on horseback through space she was a strong girl a loyal girl and would be a grateful wife ill marry her he said and hesitated yes ill marry her but it must be done immediately he resolved to run down to wrexby rejoice her with a declaration of love astound her with a proposal of marriage bewilder her little brain with hurrying adjectives whisk her up to london and in little more than a week be sailing on the high seas new born nothing of civilization about him save a few last very firstrate cigars which he projected to smoke on the poop of the vessel and so dream of the world he left behind he went down to the bank in better spirits and there wrote off a straightforward demand of an interview to rhoda hinting at the purpose of it while at his work he thought of harry latters and lord suckling and the folly of his dining with men in his present position settlingday it or yesterday might be but a colonist is not supposed to know anything of those arrangements one of his fellowclerks reminded him of a loan he had contracted and showed him his name written under obligatory initials he paid it ostentatiously drawing out one of his fifties up came another with a similar strip of paper you dont want me to change this do you said algernon and heard a tale of domestic needsand a grappling landlady he groaned inwardly odd that i must pay for his landlady being a vixen the note was changed the debt liquidated on the doorstep as he was going to lunch old anthony waylaid him and was almost noisily persistent in demanding his one pound three and his five pound ten algernon paid the sums ready to believe that there was a suspicion abroad of his intention to become a colonist he employed the luncheon hour in a visit to a colonial shipping office and nearly ran straight upon sedgett at the officedoor the woman who had hailed him from the cab was in sedgetts company but sedgett saw no one his head hung and his sullen brows were drawn moodily algernon escaped from observation his first inquiry at the office was as to the business of the preceding couple and he was satisfied by hearing that sedgett wanted berths for himself and wife whos the woman i wonder algernon thought and forgot her he obtained some particular information and returning to the bank was called before his uncle who curtly reckoned up his merits in a contemptuous rebuke and confirmed him in his resolution to incur this sort of thing no longer in consequence he promised sir william that he would amend his ways and these were the first hopeful words that sir william had ever heard from him algernons design was to dress that evening in the uniform of society so that in the event of his meeting harry latters he might assure him he was coming to his club and had been compelled to dine elsewhere with his uncle or anybody when he reached the door of his chambers a man was standing there who said mr algernon blancove yes algernon prolonged an affirmative to diminish the confidence it might inspire if possible may i speak with you sir algernon told him to follow in the man was tall and largefeatured with an immense blank expression of face ive come from mr samuels sir he said deferentially mr samuels was algernons chief jeweller oh algernon remarked well i dont want anything and let me say i dont approve of this touting for custom i thought mr samuels was above it the man bowed my business is not that sir ahem i dare say you remember an opal you had from our house it was set in a necklace all right i remember it perfectly said algernon cool but not of the collected colour the cost of it was fiftyfive pounds sir was it well ive forgotten we find that it has been pawned for fiveandtwenty a little less than half said algernon pawnbrokers are simply cheats they maynt be worse than others the man observed algernon was exactly in the position where righteous anger is the proper weapon if not the sole resource he flushed but was not sure of his opportunity for the explosion the man read the flush may i ask you did you pawn it sir im obliged to ask the question ii really donti dont choose to answer impudent questions what do you mean by coming here i may as well be open with you sir to prevent misunderstandings one of the young men was present when you pawned it he saw the thing done suppose he did he would be a witness against me ive dealt with samuels for threefour years yes sir but you have never yet paid any account and i believe i am right in saying that this opal is not the first thing coming from our house that has been pledgedi cant say you did it on the other occasions you had better not rejoined algernon he broke an unpleasant silence by asking what further my master has sent you his bill algernon glanced at the prodigious figures five hun he gasped recoiling and added well i cant pay it on the spot let me tell you youre liable to proceedings youd better avoid sir for the sake of your relations you dare to threaten to expose me to my relatives algernon said haughtily and immediately perceived that indignation at this point was a clever stroke for the man while deprecating the idea of doing so showed his more established belief in the possible virtue of such a threat not at all sir but you know that pledging things not paid for is illegal and subject to penalties no tradesman likes it they cant allow it i may as well let you know that mr samuels there stop cried algernon laughing as he thought heartily mr samuels is a very tolerable jew but he doesnt seem to understand dealing with gentlemen pressure comes he waved his hand swimmingly one wants money and gets it how one can mr samuels shall not go to bed thinking he has been defrauded i will teach mr samuels to think better of us gentiles write me a receipt for what amount sir said the man briskly for the value of the opalthat is to say for the value put upon it by mr samuels con hang never mind write the receipt he cast a fluttering fifty and a fluttering five on the table and pushed paper to the man for a receipt the man reflected and refused to take them i dont think sir he said that less than twothirds of the bill will make mr samuels easy you see this opal was in a necklace it wasnt like a ring you might have taken off your finger its a ladys ornament and soon after you obtain it from us you make use of it by turning it into cash its a case for a criminal prosecution which for the sake of your relations mr samuels wouldnt willingly bring on the criminal box is no place for you sir but mr samuels must have his own his mind is not easy i shouldnt like sir to call a policeman hey shouted algernon youd have to get a warrant its out sir though inclined toward small villanies he had not studied law and judging from his own affrighted sensations and the mans impassive face algernon supposed that warrants were as lightly granted as writs of summons he tightened his muscles in his time he had talked glibly of perdition but this was hot experience he and the man measured the force of their eyes algernon let his chest fall do you mean he murmured why sir its no use doing things by halves when a tradesman says he must have his money he takes his precautions are you in mr samuels shop not exactly sir youre a detective i have been in the service sir ah now i understand algernon raised his head with a strain at haughtiness if mr samuels had accompanied you i would have discharged the debt its only fair that i should insist upon having a receipt from him personally and for the whole amount with this he drew forth his purse and displayed the notable five hundred his glow of victory was short the impassive man likewise had something to exhibit i assure you sir he said mr samuels does know how to deal with gentlemen if you will do me the honour sir to run up with me to mr samuels shop or very well sir to save you that annoyance here is his receipt to the bill algernon mechanically crumpled up his note samuels ejaculated the unhappy fellow why my mother dealt with samuels my aunt dealt with samuels all my family have dealt with him for years and he talks of proceeding against me becauseupon my soul its too absurd sending a policeman too ill tell you whatthe exposure would damage mister samuels most materially of course my father would have to settle the matter but mistermister samuels would not recover so easily hed be glad to refund the five hundredwhat is itand twentyfivewhy not and sixpence three farthings i tell you i shall let my father pay mr samuels had better serve me with a common writ i tell you im not going to denude myself of money altogether i havent examined the bill leave it here you can tear off the receipt leave it here the man indulged in a slight demonstration of dissent no sir that wont do half the bill roared algernon half the bill i wouldnt mind paying about twothirds sir is what mr samuels asked for and hell stop and go on as before hell stop and hell go on will he mr samuels is amazingly like one of his own watches algernon sneered vehemently well he pursued in fancied security ill pay twothirds three hundred sir ay three hundred tell him to send a receipt for the three hundred and he shall have it as to my entering his shop again that i shall have to think over thats what gentlemen in mr samuels position have to run risk of sir said the man algernon more in astonishment than trepidation observed him feeling at his breastpocket the action resulted in an exhibition of a second bill with a legal receipt attached to it for three hundred pounds mr samuels is anxious to accommodate you in every way sir it isnt the full sum he wants its a portion he thought you might prefer to discharge a portion after this exhibition of foresight on the part of the jeweller there was no more fight in algernon beyond a strenuous faugh of uttermost disgust he examined the bill and receipt in the mans hand with great apparent scrupulousness not in reality seeing a clear syllable take it and change it he threw his five hundred down but recovered it from the enemys grasp and with a one two three banged his hundreds on the table for which he had the loathsome receipt handed to him how he asked chokingly did mr samuels know i couldi had money why sir you see the man as one who throws off a mask smiled cordially after buttoning up the notes credit d soon give up the ghost if it hadnt its own dodges as i may say this is only a feeler on mr samuels part he heard of his things going to pledge halloa he sings out and tradesmen are human sir between us i side with gentlemen in most cases howsever im so to speak in mr samuels pay a young gentleman in debt give him a good fright out comes his money if hes got any sending of a bill receipteds a good trying touch its a compliment to him to suppose he can pay mr samuels sir wouldnt go issuing a warrant if he could he wouldnt you named a warrant that set me up to it i shouldnt have dreamed of a gentleman supposing it otherwise didnt you notice me show a wall of a face i shouldnt ha dared to have tried that on an old handbegging your pardon i mean a reala scoundrel the regular ones must see features we mustnt be too cunning with them else they grow suspicious theyre keen as animals they are good afternoon to you sir algernon heard the door shut he reeled into a chair and muffling his head in his two arms on the table sobbed desperately seeing himself very distinctly reflected in one of the many facets of folly daylight became undesireable to him he went to bed a man who can in such extremities of despair go premeditatingly to his pillow obeys an animal instinct in pursuit of oblivion that will befriend his nerves algernon awoke in deep darkness with a delicious sensation of hunger he jumped up six hundred and fifty pounds of the money remained intact and he was joyful he struck a light to look at his watch the watch had stoppedthat was a bad sign he could not forget it why had his watch stopped a chilling thought as to whether predestination did not govern the world allayed all tumult in his mind he dressed carefully and soon heard a great city bell with horrid gulfs between the strokes tell him that the hour was eleven toward midnight not late he said whod have thought it cried a voice on the landing of the stairs as he went forth it was sedgett algernon had one inclination to strangle and another to mollify the wretch why sir ive been lurking heer for your return from your larks never guessed you was in its no use algernon began ay but it is though said sedgett and forced his way into the room now just listen ive got a young woman i want to pack out o the country i must do it while im aa bachelor boy she must go or we shall be having shindies you saw how she caught me out of a cab shes sure to be in the place where she aint wanted she goes to america ive got to pay her passage and mine too heres the truth she thinks im off with her she knows im bankrup at home so i am all the more reason for her thinking me her companion i get her away by train to the vessel and on board and there i give her the slip ships steaming away by this time tmorrow night ive paid for her and myself too she thinks leave it to me ill manage all that neatly enough but heers the truth im stumped i must and i will have fifty i dont want to utter neer a threat i want the money and if you dont give it i break off and you mind this mr blancove you dont come off s easy if i do break off mind i know all about your relations and by ill let em know all about you why youre as quiet heer sir as if you was miles away in a wood cottage and neer a dog near so algernon was thinking and without a light save the gas lamp in the square moreover they wrangled for an hour when algernon went forth a second time he was by fifty pounds poorer he consoled himself by thinking that the money had only anticipated its destination as arranged and it became a partial gratification to him to reflect that he had at any rate paid so much of the sum according to his bond in assuming possession of it and what were to be his proceedings they were so manifestly in the hands of fate that he declined to be troubled on that head next morning came the usual short impatient scrawl on thin blue paper from edward scarce worthy of a passing thought in a postscript he asked are there on your oath no letters for me if there are send them immediatelyevery one bills as well dont fail i must have them algernon was at last persuaded to pack up dahlias letters saying i suppose they cant do any harm now the expense of the postage afflicted him but women always cost a dozen to our one he remarked on his way to the city he had to decide whether he would go to the bank or take the train leading to wrexby he chose the latter course until feeling that he was about to embark in a serious undertaking he said to himself no duty first and postponed the expedition for the day following chapter xxxii squire blancove having business in town called on his brother at the bank asking whether sir william was at home with sarcastic emphasis on the title which smelt to him of commerce sir william invited him to dine and sleep at his house that night you will meet mrs lovell and a major waring a friend of hers who knew her and her husband in india said the baronet the deuce i shall said the squire and accepted maliciously where the squire dined he drank defying ladies and the newfangled subserviency to those flustering teabodies this was understood so when the claret and port had made a few rounds major waring was permitted to follow mrs lovell and the squire and his brother settled to conversation beginning upon gout sir william had recently had a touch of the family complaint and spoke of it in terms which gave the squire some fraternal sentiment from that they fell to talking politics and differed the breach was healed by a divergence to their sons the squire knew his own to be a scamp youll never do anything with him he said i dont think i shall sir william admitted didnt i tell you so you did but the point is what will you do with him send him to jericho to ride wild jackasses thats all hes fit for the superior complacency of sir williams smile caught the squires attention what do you mean to do with ned he asked i hope was the answer to have him married before the year is out to the widow the widow sir william raised his eyebrows mrs lovell i mean what gives you that idea why ned has made her an offer dont you know that i know nothing of the sort and dont believe it he has hes only waiting now over there in paris to get comfortably out of a scrapeyou remember what i told you at fairlyand then mrs lovells going to have himas he thinks but by george it strikes me this major youve got here knows how to follow petticoats and get in his harvest in the enemys absence i think youre quite under a delusion in both respects observed sir william what makes you think that i have edwards word he lies as naturally as an infant sucks pardon me this is my son you are speaking of and this is your port im drinking so ill say no more the squire emptied his glass and sir william thrummed on the table now my dog has got his name the squire resumed im not ambitious about him you are about yours and you ought to know him he spends or he dont spend its not the question whether he gets into debt but whether he does mischief with what he spends if algys a bad fish neds a bit of a serpent damned clever no doubt i suppose you wouldnt let him marry old flemings daughter now if he wanted to who is fleming sir william thundered out flemings the father of the girl im sorry for him he sells his farmland which ive been looking at for years so i profit by it but i dont like to see a man like that broken up algy i said before s a bad fish hang me if i think hed have behaved like ned if he had id have compelled him to marry her and shipped them both off clean out of the country to try their luck elsewhere youre proud im practical i dont expect you to do the same im up in london now to raise money to buy the farmqueens annes farm its advertized for sale i see fleeting wont sell it to me privately because my names blancove and im the father of my son and he fancies algys the man why he saw algy at the theatre in london with this girl of hiswe were all young fellows onceand the rascal took neds burden on his shoulders so i shall have to compete with other buyers and pay i dare say a couple of hundred extra for the property do you believe what i tell you now not a word of it said sir william blandly the squire seized the decanter and drank in a fury i had it from algy that would all the less induce me to believe it hm the squire frowned let me tell youhes a dogbut its a damned hard thing to hear ones own flesh and blood abused look here theres a couple one of them has made a fool of a girl it cant be my rascalstop a minutehe isnt the man because shed have been sure to have made a fool of him thats certain hes a softhearted dog hed aim at a cocksparrow and be glad if he missed there you have him he was one of your good boys i used to tell his poor mother when you leave off thinking for him hell go to the first handy villainand thats the devil and hes done it but heres the difference he goes himself he dont send another ill tell you what if you dont know about mr neds tricks you ought and you ought to make him marry the girl and be off to new zealand or any of the upsidedown places where he might begin by farming and soon with his abilities be cock o the walk he would perhaps be sending us a letter to say that he preferred to break away from the mother country and establish a republic hes got the same political opinions as you oh hell do well enough over here of course he will hes the very fellow to do well knock at him hes hard as nails and ll stick anywhere you wouldnt listen to me when i told you about this at fairly where some old sweetheart of the girl mistook that poor devil of a scapegoat algy for him and went pegging at him like a madman no said sir william no i would not nor do i now at least he struck out his right hand deprecatingly i listen can you tell me what he was doing when he went to italy he went partly at my suggestion turns you round his little finger he went off with this girl wanted to educate her or some nonsense of the sort that was mr neds business upon my soul im sorry for old fleming im told he takes it to heart its done him up now if it should turn out to be ned would you let him right the girl by marrying her you wouldnt the principle of examining your hypothesis before you proceed to decide by it is probably unknown to you sir william observed after bestowing a considerate smile on his brother who muffled himself up from the chilling sententiousness and drank sir william in the pride of superior intellect had heard as good as nothing of the charge against his son well said the squire think as you like act as you like alls one to me youre satisfied thats clear and im some hundred of pounds out of pocket this majors paying court to the widow is he i cant say that he is it would be a good thing for her to get married i should be glad a good thing for her i say a good thing for him let us hope if he can pay her debts sir william was silent and sipped his wine and if he can keep a tight hand on the reins thats wanted said the squire the gentleman whose road to happiness was thus prescribed stood by mrs lovells chair in the drawingroom he held a letter in his hand for which her own was pleadingly extended i know you to be the soul of truth percy she was saying the question is not that but whether you can bear the truth can i not who would live without it pardon me theres more you say you admire this friend of mine no doubt you do mind i am going to give you the letter i wish you simply to ask yourself now whether you are satisfied at my making a confidant of a man in robert eccless position and think it natural and justyou do quite just said mrs lovell and natural yes natural though not common eccentric which only means hors du commun and can be natural it is natural i was convinced he was a noble fellow before i knew that you had made a friend of him i am sure of it now and did he not save your life percy i have warned you that you are partly the subject of the letter do you forget that i am a woman and want it all the more impatiently major waring suffered the letter to be snatched from his hand and stood like one who is submitting to a test or watching the effect of a potent drug it is his second letter to you mrs lovell murmured i see it is a reply to yours she read a few lines and glanced up blushing am i not made to bear more than i deserve if you can do such mischief without meaning any to a man who is in love with another woman said percy yes she nodded i perceive the deduction but inferences are like shadows on the wallthey are thrown from an object and are monstrous distortions of it that is why you misjudge women you infer one thing from another and are ruled by the inference he simply bowed edward would have answered her in a bright strain and led her on to say brilliant things and then have shown her as by a sudden light that she had lost herself and reduced her to feel the strength and safety of his hard intellect that was the idea in her brain the next moment her heart ejected it petty when i asked permission to look at this letter i was not aware how great a compliment it would be to me if i was permitted to see it it betrays your friend it betrays something more said he mrs lovell cast down her eyes and read without further comment these were the contents my dear percynow that i see her every day again i am worse than ever and i remember thinking once or twice that mrs l had cured me i am a sort of man who would jump to reach the top of a mountain i understand how superior mrs l is to every woman in the world i have seen but rhoda cures me on that head mrs lovell makes men mad and happy and rhoda makes them sensible and miserable i have had the talk with rhoda it is all over i have felt like being in a big room with one candle alight ever since she has not looked at me and does nothing but get by her father whenever she can and takes his hand and holds it i see where the blow has struck her it has killed her pride and rhoda is almost all pride i suppose she thinks our plan is the best she has not said she does and does not mention her sister she is going to die or she turns nun or marries a gentleman i shall never get her she will not forgive me for bringing this news to her i told you how she coloured the first day i came which has all gone now she just opens her lips to me you remember corporal thwaitesyou caught his horse when he had his foot near wrenched off going through the gateand his way of breathing through the underrow of his teeththe poor creature was in such painthats just how she takes her breath it makes her look sometimes like that womans head with the snakes for her hair this bothers mehow is it you and mrs lovell manage to talk together of such things why two men rather hang their heads a bit my notion is that women ladies in especial ought never to hear of sad things of this sort of course i mean if they do it cannot harm them it only upsets me why are ladies less particular than girls in rhodas place shame being a virtue was mrs lovells running comment she comes up to town with her father tomorrow the farm is ruined the poor old man had to ask me for a loan to pay the journey luckily rhoda has saved enough with her pennies and two pences ever since i left the farm it has been in the hands of an old donkey here who has worked it his own way what is in the ground will stop there and may as well i leave off writing i write such stuff and if i go on writing to you i shall be putting these things the way you write about mrs lovell convinces me you are not in my scrape or else gentlemen are just as different from their inferiors as ladies are from theirs thats the question what is the meaning of your not being able to leave her for a day for fear she should fall under other influences then i copy your words you say she is all things to everybody and cannot help it in that case i would seize my opportunity and her waist and tell her she was locked up from anybody else friendship with menbut i cannot understand friendship with women and watching them to keep them right which must mean that you do not think much of them mrs lovell at this point raised her eyes abruptly from the letter and returned it you discuss me very freely with your friend she said percy drooped to her i warned you when you wished to read it but you see you have bewildered him it was scarcely wise to write other than plain facts men of that class she stopped of that class said he men of any class then you yourself if any one wrote to you such things what would you think it is very unfair i have the honour of seeing you daily because you cannot trust me out of your sight what is there inexplicable about me do you wonder that i talk openly of women who are betrayed and do my best to help them on the contrary you command my esteem said percy but you think me a puppet fond of them perhaps his tone of voice queried in a manner that made her smile i hate them she said and her face expressed it but you make them how you torment me how can i explain the magic are you not making one of me now where i stand then sit or kneel oh percy do nothing ridiculous inveterate insight was a characteristic of major waring but he was not the less in mrs lovells net he knew it to be a charm that she exercised almost unknowingly she was simply a sweet instrument for those who could play on it and therein lay her mighty fascination roberts blunt advice that he should seize the chance take her and make her his own was powerful with him he checked the particular appropriating action suggested by robert i owe you an explanation he said margaret my friend you can think of me as a friend percy if i can call you my friend what would i not call you besides i did you a great and shameful wrong when you were younger hush you did not deserve that judge of yourself as you will but i know now what my feelings were then the sublime executioner was no more than a spiteful man you give me your pardon do you not your hand she had reached her hand to him but withdrew it quickly not your hand margaret but you must give it to some one you will be ruined if you do not she looked at him with full eyes you know it then she said slowly but the gaze diminished as he went on i know by what i know of you that you of all women should owe a direct allegiance come i will assume privileges are you free would you talk to me so if you thought otherwise she asked i think i would said percy a little depends upon the person are you pledged at all to mr edward blancove do you suppose me one to pledge myself he is doing a base thing then percy let an assurance of my knowledge of that be my answer you do not love the man despise him say is he aware of it if clear writing can make him you have told him as much to his apprehension certainly further margaret i must speakdid he act with your concurrence or knowledge of it at all in acting as he has done heavens percy you question me like a husband it is what i mean to be if i may the frame of the fair lady quivered as from a blow and then her eyes rose tenderly i thought you knew me this is not possible you will not be mine why is it not possible i think i could say because i respect you too much because you find you have not the courage for what to confess that you were under bad influence and were not the margaret i can make of you put that aside if you remain as you are think of the snares if you marry one you despise look at the pit yes you will be mine half my love of my country and my profession is love of you margaret is fire in my blood i used to pray for opportunities that margaret might hear of me i knew that gallant actions touched her i would have fallen gladly i was sure her heart would leap when she heard of me let it beat against mine speak i will said mrs lovell and she suppressed the throbs of her bosom her voice was harsh and her face bloodless how much money have you percy this sudden sluicing of cold water on his heat of passion petrified him money he said with a strange frigid scrutiny of her features as in the flash of a mirror he beheld her bony worn sordid unacceptable but he was fain to admit it to be an eminently proper demand for enlightenment he said deliberately i possess an income of five hundred a year extraneous and in addition to my pay as major in her majestys service then he paused and the silence was like a growing chasm between them she broke it by saying have you any expectations this was crueller still though no longer astonishing he complained in his heart merely that her voice had become so unpleasant with emotionless precision he replied at my mothers death she interposed a soft exclamation at my mothers death there will come to me by reversion five or six thousand pounds when my father dies he may possibly bequeath his property to me on that i cannot count veritable tears were in her eyes was she affecting to weep sympathetically in view of these remote contingencies you will not pretend that you know me now percy she said trying to smile and she had recovered the natural feminine key of her voice i am mercenary you see not a mercenary friend so keep me as a friend say you will be my friend nay you had a right to know he protested it was disgracefulhorrible but it was necessary for me to know and now that you do know now that i know i have only to saybe as merciful in your idea of me as you can she dropped her hand in his and it was with a thrill of dismay that he felt the rush of passion reanimating his frozen veins be mercenary but be mine i will give you something better to live for than this absurd life of fashion you reckon on what our expenditure will be by that standard its comparative poverty butbut you can have some luxuries you can have a carriage a horse to ride active service may come i may rise give yourself to me and you must love me and regret nothing nothing i should regret nothing i dont want carriages or horses or luxuries i could live with you on a subalterns pay i cant marry you percy and for the very reason which would make me wish to marry you charade said he and the contempt of the utterance brought her head close under his dearest friend you have not to learn how to punish me the little reproach added to the wound to his pride required a healing medicament she put her lips to his fingers assuredly the comedy would not have ended there but it was stopped by an intrusion of the squire followed by sir william who while the squire full of wine and vindictive humourswent on humming ah hmmm soh said in the doorway to some one behind him and if you have lost your key and algernon is away of what use is it to drive down to the temple for a bed i make it an especial request that you sleep here tonight i wish it i have to speak with you mrs lovell was informed that the baronet had been addressing his son who was fresh from paris and not in his own modest opinion presentable before a lady chapter xxxiii once more farmer fleming and rhoda prepared for their melancholy journey up to london a light cart was at the gateway near which robert stood with the farmer who in his stiff brown overcoat that reached to his ankles and broad countryhat kept his posture of dumb expectation like a stalled ox and nodded to roberts remarks on the care which the garden had been receiving latterly the many roses clean in bud and the trim blue and white and red garden beds every word was a blow to him but he took it as well as rhodas apparent dilatoriness among the things to be submitted to by a man cut away by the roots from the home of his labour and old associations above his bowed head there was a board proclaiming that queen annes farm and all belonging thereunto was for sale his prospect in the vague wilderness of the future was to seek for acceptance as a common labourer on some kind gentlemans property the phrase kind gentleman was adopted by his deliberate irony of the fate which cast him out robert was stamping fretfully for rhoda to come at times mrs sumfit showed her head from the window of her bedroom crying drectly and disappearing the still aspect of the house on the shining may afternoon was otherwise undisturbed besides rhoda master gammon was being waited for on whom would devolve the driving of the cart back from the station robert heaped his vexed exclamations upon this old man the farmer restrained his voice in master gammons defence thinking of the comparison he could make between him and robert for master gammon had never run away from the farm and kept absent leaving it to take care of itself gammon slow as he might be was faithful and it was not he who had made it necessary for the farm to be sold gammon was obstinate but it was not he who after taking a lead and making the farm dependent on his lead had absconded with the brains and energy of the establishment such reflections passed through the farmers mind rhoda and mrs sumfit came together down the trim pathway and robert now had a clear charge against master gammon he recommended an immediate departure the horse ll bring himself home quite as well and as fast as gammon will he said but for the shakin and the joltin which tells o sovereigns and silver mrs sumfit was observing to rhoda you might carry the box and who would have guessed how stout it was and me to hit it with a poker and not break it i couldnt nor get a single one through the slitthe sight i was with a poker in my hand i do declare i felt azactly like a housebreakerand no soul to notice what you carries where you hear the gold my dear go somrs sumfit performed a methodical ahem and noised the sole of her shoe on the gravel so and folks ll think its a mistake they made whats thatthe farmer pointed at a projection under rhodas shawl it is a present father for my sister said rhoda what is it the farmer questioned again mrs sumfit fawned before him penitentlyah william shes poor and she do want a little to spend or she will be so nipped and like a frostbitten body she will and perhaps dear havent money in her sight for next days dinner which isoh such a panic for a young wife for it aint her hunger dear williamher husband she thinks of and her cookery at a standstill thinks she he will charge it on the kitchen so unreasonables men yes she added in answer to the rigid dejection of his look i said true to you i know i said not a penny can i get william when you asked me for loans and how could i get it i cant get it now see here dear she took the box from under rhodas shawl and rattled it with a down turn and an up turn you didnt ask me dear william whether i had a moneybox id ha told you so at once had ye but asked me and had you said gi me your moneybox it was yours only for your asking you do see you cant get any of it out so when you asked for money i was right to say id got none the farmer bore with her dreary rattling of the box in demonstration of its retentive capacities the mere force of the show stopped him from retorting but when to excuse master gammon for his tardiness she related that he also had a moneybox and was in search of it the farmer threw up his head with the vigour of a young man and thundered for master gammon by name vehemently wrathful at the combined hypocrisy of the pair he called twice and his face was purple and red as he turned toward the cart saying well go without the old man mrs sumfit then intertwisted her fingers and related how that she and master gammon had one day six years distant talked on a lonely evening over the mischances which befel poor people when they grew infirm or met with accident and what useless clays they were and yet they had their feelings it was a long and confidential talk on a summer evening and at the end of it master gammon walked into wrexby and paid a visit to mr hammond the carpenter who produced two strong savingboxes excellently manufactured by his own hand without a lid to them or lock and key so that there would be no getting at the contents until the boxes were full or a pressing occasion counselled the destruction of the boxes a constant subject of jest between mrs sumfit and master gammon was as to which first of them would be overpowered by curiosity to know the amount of their respective savings and their confessions of mutual weakness and futile endeavours to extract one piece of gold from the hoard and now think it or not said mrs sumfit i got that power over him from doctorin him and cookin for him i persuaded him to help my poor dahly in my blesseds need id like him to do it by halves but he cant master gammon appeared round a corner of the house his box draped by his handkerchief under his arm the farmer and robert knew when he was in sight that gestures and shouts expressing extremities of the need for haste would fail to accelerate his steps so they allowed him to come on at his own equal pace steady as time with the peculiar lopping bend of knees which jerked the moveless trunk regularly upward and the ancient round eyes fixed contemplatively forward there was an affectingness in this view of the mechanical old man bearing his poor hoard to bestow it robert said out unawares he mustnt be let to part with h old pennies no the farmer took him up nor i wont let him yes father rhoda intercepted his address to master gammon yes father she hardened her accent it is for my sister he does a good thing let him do it mas gammon what ha ye got there the farmer sung out but master gammon knew that he was about his own business he was a difficult old man when he served the farmer he was quite unmanageable in his private affairs without replying he said to mrs sumfit id gummed it the side of the box showed that it had been made adhesive for the sake of security to another substance thats whats caused ye to be so long mas gammon the veteran of the fields responded with a grin designed to show a lively cunning deary me mas gammon id give a fortnights work to know how much youm saved now i would and there your comforts in your heart and it shall be paid to you i do pray heaven in mercy to forgive me she whimpered if ever knowinly i hasted you at a meal or did deceive you when you looked for the pickings of freshkilled pig but if you only knew howto cookit spoils the temper of a woman id a aunt was cook in a gentlemans famly and daily he dirtied his thirteen plates never more nor never less and one daywas ever a woman punished so her best black silk dress she greased from the top to the bottom and he sent down nine clean plates and no word vouchsafed of explanation for gentlefolks they wont teach themselves how it do hang together with cooks in a kitchen jump up mas gammon cried the farmer wrathful at having been deceived by two members of his household who had sworn to him both that they had no money and had disregarded his necessity such being human nature mrs sumfit confided the termination of her story to rhoda or suggested rather at what distant point it might end and then giving master gammons box to her custody with directions for dahlia to take the boxes to a carpenters shopnot attempting the power of pokers upon themand count and make a mental note of the amount of the rival hoards she sent dahlia all her messages of smirking reproof and delighted love and hoped that they would soon meet and know happiness rhoda as usual had no emotion to spare she took possession of the second box and thus laden suffered robert to lift her into the cart they drove across the green past the mill and its flashing waters and into the road where the waving of mrs sumfits desolate handkerchief was latest seen a horseman rode by whom rhoda recognized and she blushed and had a boding shiver robert marked him and the blush as well it was algernon upon a liverystable hack his countenance expressed a mighty disappointment the farmer saw no one the ingratitude and treachery of robert and of mrs sumfit and master gammon kept him brooding in sombre disgust of life he remarked that the cart jolted a good deal if you goes in a cart wi company o four you expects to be jolted said master gammon you seem to like it robert observed to the latter it dont disturb my inards quoth the serenest of mankind gammon the farmer addressed him from the front seat without turning his head youll take and look about for a new place master gammon digested the recommendation in silence on its being repeated with d ye hear he replied that he heard well enough well then look about ye sharp or maybe youll be out in the cold said the farmer na returned master gammon ah never frets till im pinched ive given ye notice said the farmer no you hant said master gammon i give ye notice now no you dont how d ye mean cause i dont take neer a notice then youll be kicked out old man hey there y have me said master gammon i growed at the farm and you dont go and tell neer a tree t walk rhoda laid her fingers in the veterans palm youre a longlived family arent you master gammon said robert eyeing rhodas action enviously master gammon bade him go to a certain churchyard in sussex and inspect a particular tombstone upon which the ages of his ancestry were written they were more like the ages of oaks than of men its the heart kills said robert its damned misfortune murmured the farmer it is the wickedness in the world thought rhoda its a poor stomach i reckon master gammon ruminated they took leave of him at the station from which eminence it was a notable thing to see him in the road beneath making preparations for his return like a conqueror of the hours others might run and stew if they liked master gammon had chosen his pace and was not of a mind to change it for anybody or anything it was his boast that he had never ridden by railway nor ever means to if i can help it he would say he was very much in harmony with universal nature if to be that is the secret of human life meantime algernon retraced his way to the station in profound chagrin arriving there just as the train was visible he caught sight of the cart with master gammon in it and asked him whether all his people were going up to london but the reply was evidently a mile distant and had not started so putting a sovereign in master gammons hand together with the reins of his horse algernon bade the old man conduct the animal to the white bear inn and thus violently pushing him off the tramways of his intelligence left him stranded he had taken a firstclass returnticket of course being a gentleman in the desperate hope that he might jump into a carriage with rhoda he entered one of the secondclass compartments a fact not only foreign to his tastes and his habits but somewhat disgraceful as he thought his trust was that the ignoble of this earth alone had beheld him at any rate his ticket was first class as the guard would instantly and respectfully perceive and if he had the discomforts he had also some of the consolations of virtue once on his way the hard seat and the contemptible society surrounding him assured his reflective spirit that he loved otherwise was it in reason that he should endure these hardships i really love the girl he said fidgeting for cushions he was hot and wanted the window up to which his fellowtravellers assented then the atmosphere becoming loaded with offence to his morbid sense of smell he wanted the windows down and again they assented by jove i must love the girl ejaculated algernon inwardly as cramp cold and afflicted nostrils combined to astonish his physical sensations nor was it displeasing to him to evince that he was unaccustomed to bare boards were a rich country said a man to his neighbour but if you dont pay for it you must take your luck and theyll make you as uncomfortable as they can ay said the other ive travelled on the continent the secondclass carriages there are fit for anybody to travel in this is what comes of the worship of moneythe individual is not respected pounds alone these thought algernon are beastly democrats their remarks had been sympathetic with his manifestations which had probably suggested them he glowered out of the window in an exceedingly foreign manner a plainly dressed woman requested that the window should be closed one of the men immediately proceeded to close it algernon stopped him pardon me sir said the man its a lady wants it done and he did it a lady algernon determined that these were the sort of people he should hate for life go among them and then see what they are he addressed an imaginary assembly of antidemocrats as from a senatorial chair set in the after days cramp cold illordered smells and eternal hatred of his fellowpassengers convinced him in their aggregation that he surmounted not a little for love of rhoda the train arrived in london at dusk algernon saw rhoda step from a carriage near the engine assisted by robert and old anthony was on the platform to welcome her and anthony seized her bag and the troop of passengers moved away it may be supposed that algernon had angry sensations at sight of robert and to a certain extent this was the case but he was a mercurial youth and one who had satisfactorily proved superior strength enjoyed a portion of his respect besides if robert perchance should be courting rhoda he and robert would enter into another field of controversy and robert might be taught a lesson he followed the party on foot until they reached anthonys dwelling place noted the house and sped to the temple there he found a telegraphic message from edward that had been awaiting him since the morning stop it were the sole words of the communication brief and if one preferred to think so enigmatic what on earth does he mean cried algernon and affected again and again to see what edward meant without success stop itstop what stop the train stop my watch stop the universe oh this is rank humbug he flung the paper down and fell to counting the money in his possession the more it dwindled the more imperative it became that he should depart from his country behind the figures he calculated that in all probability rhoda would visit her sister this night i cant stop that he said and hearing a clock strike nor that a knock sounded on the door nor that the reflection inspired him with fatalistic views sedgett appeared and was welcome algernon had to check the impulse of his hand to stretch out to the fellow so welcome was he sedgett stated that everything stood ready for the morrow he had accomplished all that had to be done and its more than manyd reckon he said and rubbed his hands and laughed i was aboard ship in liverpool this morning that i was that ere young womans woke up from her dream he lengthened the word inexpressibly by this time that she is i had to pay for my passage though at which recollection he swore thats money gone never mind theres worse gone with it aint it nastydont you think sir to get tired of a young woman youve been keepin company with and have to be her companion whether you will or whether you wont shes sick enough now we travelled all night i got her on board got her to go to her bed and says i ill arrange about the luggage i packs myself down into a boat and saw the ship steam away a goodn hanged if i didnt catch myself singin and havent touched a drop o drink nor will till tomorrows over dont you think daehlis a very pretty name sir i run back to her as hard as rail d carry me shes had a letter from her sister recommending o her to marry me a noble man she calls meha ha thats good and what do you think my dear says i and bother me if i can screw either a compliment or a kiss out of her shes got fine lady airs of her own but im fond of her that i am well sir at the church door after the ceremony you settle our business honour brightthats it ent it algernon nodded sedgetts talk always produced discomfort in his ingenuous bosom by the way what politics are you he asked sedgett replied staring that he was a tory and algernon nodded again but with brows perturbed at the thought of this ruffian being of the same political persuasion as himself eh cried sedgett i dont want any of your hustings pledges though youll be at the door tomorrow or ill have a rowmind that a bargains a bargain i like the young woman but i must have the money why not hand it over now not till the deeds done said algernon very reasonably sedgett studied his features and as a result remarked you put me up to this ill do it and trust you so far but if im played on i throw the young woman over and expose you out and out but you mean honourable i do algernon said of his meaning another knock sounded on the door it proved to be a footman in sir williams livery bearing a letter from edward an amplification of the telegram dear algy stop it im back and have to see my father i may be down about two or three or four in the morning no key so keep in i want to see you my whole life is changed i must see her did you get my telegram answer by messenger i shall come to you the moment my father has finished his lecture yours eb algernon told sedgett to wait while he dressed in evening uniform and gave him a cigar to smoke he wrote dear ned stop what of course i suppose theres only one thing and how can i stop it what for you ridiculous old boy what a changeable old fellow you areoff to see what i can do after eleven oclock tomorrow youll feel comfortableif the governor is sweet speak a word for the old brown and bring two dozen in a cab if you can theres no encouragement to keep at home in this place put that to him i in your place could do it tell him its a matter of markets if i get better wine at hotels i go to hotels and i spend twiceten times the money and say we intend to make the laundress cook our dinners in chambers as a rule old b an inducement yours aff ab this epistle he dispatched by the footman and groaned to think that if perchance the old brown sherry should come he would in all probability barely drink more than halfadozen bottles of that prime vintage he and sedgett soon after were driving down to dahlias poor lodgings in the west on the way an idea struck him would not sedgett be a noisier claimant for the thousand than edward if he obeyed edwards direction and stopped the marriage he could hand back a goodly number of hundreds and leave it to be supposed that he had advanced the remainder to sedgett how to do it sedgett happened to say if you wont hand the money now i must have it when ive married her swear youll be in the vestry when were signing i know all about marriages you swear or i tell you if i find im cheated i will throw the young woman over slap algernon nodded i shall be there he said and thought that he certainly would not the thought cleared an oppression in his head though it obscured the pretty prospect of a colonial but and horse with rhoda cooking for him far from cares he did his best to resolve that he would stop the business if he could but if it is permitted to the fool to create entanglements and set calamity in motion to arrest its course is the last thing the gods allow of his doing chapter xxxiv in the shadowy library light when there was dawn out of doors edward sat with his father and both were silent for edward had opened his heart and his father had breathed some of the dry stock of wisdom on it many times edward rose to go and sir william signalled with his finger that he should stay an impassive motion not succeeded by speech and in truth the baronet was revolving such a problem as a long career of profitable banking refreshed by classical exercitations does not help us to solve there sat the son of his trust and his pride whose sound and equal temperament whose precocious worldly wit whose precise and broad intelligence had been the visionary comfort of his paternal days to come and his son had told him reiterating it in language special and exact as that of a chancery barrister unfolding his case to the presiding judge that he had deceived and wronged an underbred girl of the humbler classes and that after a term of absence from her he had discovered her to be a part of his existence and designed you would marry her sir william asked though less forcibly than if he could have put on a moral amazement that is my intention sir with your permission edward replied firmly and his father understood that he had never known this young man and dealt virtually with a stranger in his sonas shrewd a blow as the vanity which is in paternal nature may have to endure he could not fashion the words cerritus fuit though he thought the thing in both tenses edwards wits had always been too clearly in order and of what avail was it to repeat great and honoured prudential maxims to a hardheaded fellow whose choice was to steer upon the rocks he did remark in an undertone the misce stultitiam seems to be a piece of advice you have adopted too literally i quote what you have observed of some one else it is possible sir said edward i was not particularly sparing when i sat in the high seat non eadem est aetas non mens i now think differently i must take your present conduct as the fruit of your premature sagacity i suppose by the same rule your cousin algernon may prove to be some comfort to his father in the end let us hope he will sir his father will not have deserved it so well as mine the time is morning said sir william looking at his watch and bestowing in the bitterness of his reflections a hue of triumph on the sleep of his brother upstairs you are your own master edward i will detain you no more edward shook his limbs rejoicing you prepare for a life of hard work sir william resumed not without some instigation to sternness from this display of alacrity i counsel you to try the colonial bar edward read in the first sentence that his income would be restricted and in the second that his fathers social sphere was no longer to be his exactly sir i have entertained that notion myself he said and his breast narrowed and his features grew sharp and if i may suggest such matters to you i would advise you to see very little company for some years to come there sir you only anticipate my previously formed resolution with a knavery on my conscience and a giddypated girl on my hands and the doors of the london world open to me i should scarcely have been capable of serious work the precious metal which is knowledge sir is only to be obtained by mining for it and that excellent occupation necessarily sends a man out of sight for a number of years in the meantime mea virtute me involvo you need not stop short said his father with a sardonic look for the concluding lines the continuation is becoming in the mouth of a hero but humbler persons must content themselves not to boast the patent fact i think edward warmed as he spoke i am ready to bear it i dislike poverty but as i say i am ready to bear it come sir you did me the honour once to let me talk to you as a friend with the limits which i have never consciously overstepped let me explain myself plainly and simply sir william signified pray speak from the arms of his chair and edward standing went on after all a womans devotion is worth having when one is not asked for the small change every ten minutes i am aware of the philosophic truth that we get nothing in life for which we dont pay the point is to appreciate what we desire and so we reach a level that makes the payment less he laughed sir william could hardly keep back the lines of an ironical smile from his lips this pursued the orator is not the language for the colonial bar i wish to show you that i shall understand the character of my vocation there no sir my deeper wish is that you may accept my view of the sole course left to a man whose sense of honour is of accord with the inclination of his heart and not in hostility to his clearer judgement extremely forensic said sir william not displeased by the promise of the periods well sir i need not remark to you that rhetoric though it should fail to convey does not extinguish or imply the absence of emotion in the speaker but rather that his imagination is excited by his theme and that he addresses more presences than such as are visible it is like the roman mask fashioned for large assemblages by a parity of reasoning thensir william was seduced into colloquyan eternal broad grin is not in the instance of a dualogue good comedy it may hide profound grief edward made his eyes flash i find i can laugh it would be difficult for me to smile sir i pray that you will listen to me seriously though my language is not of a kind to make you think me absolutely earnest in what i say unless you know me which i must protest i certainly do not interposed sir william i will do my best to instruct you sir until recently i have not known myself i met this girl she trusted herself to me you are aware that i know a little of men and of women and when i tell you that i respect her now even more than i did at firstmuch moreso thoroughly that i would now put my honour in her hands by the counsel of my experience as she prompted by her instinct and her faith in me confided hers to mineperhaps even if you persist in accusing me of rashness you will allow that she must be in the possession of singularly feminine and estimable qualities i deceived her my object in doing so was to spare you those consequences followed which can hardly fail to ensue when of two living together the woman is at a disadvantage and eats her heart without complaining i could have borne a shrewish tongue better possibly because i could have answered it better it is worse to see a pale sad face with a smile of unalterable tenderness the very sweetness becomes repugnant as little boys requiring much medicine have anticipated you by noting in this world observed sir william i thank you for the illustration edward bowed but he smarted a man so situated lives with the ghost of his conscience a doubtful figure of speech sir william broke in i think you should establish the personality before you attempt to give a feature to the essence but continue edward saw that by forfeiting simplicity in order to catch his fathers peculiar cast of mind he had left him cold and in doubt as to the existence of the powerful impulse by which he was animated it is a prime error in the orator not to seize the emotions and subdue the humanity of his hearers first edward perceived his mistake he had however done well in making a show of the unabated vigour of his wits contempt did not dwell in the baronets tone on the contrary they talked and fenced and tripped one another as of old and considering the breach he had been compelled to explode between his father and himself edward understood that this was a real gain he resumed all figures of speech must be inadequate ah pardon me said sir william pertinaciously the figure i alluded to was not inadequate a soapbubble is not inadequate plainly sir in gods name hear me out cried edward shewhat shall i call her my mistress my sweetheart if you likelet the name be anything wife it should have been and shall bei left her and have left her and have not looked on her for many months i thought i was tired of heri was under odd influenceswitchcraft it seems i could believe in witchcraft now brutal selfishness is the phrase for my conduct i have found out my villany i have not done a days sensible work or had a single clear thought since i parted from her she has had brainfever she has been in the hospital she is now prostrate with misery while she suffered ii cant look back on myself if i had to plead before you for more than manly consideration i could touch you i am my own master and am ready to subsist by my own efforts there is no necessity for me to do more than say i abide by the choice i make and my own actions in deciding to marry her i do a good thingi do a just thing i will prove to you that i have done a wise thing let me call to your recollection what you did me the honour to remark of my letters from italy those were written with her by my side every other woman vexed me this one alone gives me peace and nerve to work if i did not desire to work should i venture to run the chances of an offence to you your girls of society are tasteless to me and they dont makes wives to working barristers no nor to working members they are very ornamental and excellent and as i think you would call them accomplished all england would leap to arms to defend their incontestible superiority to their mothers and their duties i have not the wish to stand opposed to my countrymen on any question although i go to other shores and may be called upon to make capital out of opposition they are admirable young persons no doubt i do not offer you a drab for your daughterinlaw sir if i rise she will be equal to my station she has the manners of a lady a lady i say not of the modern young lady with whom i am happy to think she does not come into competition she has not been sedulously trained to pull her way when she is to go into harness with a yokefellow but i am laying myself open to the charge of feeling my position weak seeing that i abuse the contrary one think what you will of me sir you will know that i have obeyed my best instinct and my soundest judgement in this matter i need not be taught that if it is my destiny to leave england i lose the association with him who must ever be my dearest friend and few young men can say as much of one standing in the relation of father with this edward finished not entirely to his satisfaction for he had spoken with too distinct a sincerity to please his own critical taste which had been educated to delight in acute antithesis and culminating sentencesthe grand biscayan billows of rhetorical utterance in comparison wherewith his talk was like the little chopping waves of a windblown lake but he had as he could see produced an impression his father stood up we shall be always friends i hope sir william said as regards a provision for you suitable to your estate that will be arranged you must have what comforts you have been taught to look to at the same time i claim a personal freedom for my own actions certainly sir said edward not conceiving any new development in these you have an esteem for mrs lovell have you not edward flushed i should have a very perfect esteem for her if he laughed slightlyyou will think i want everybody to be married and in the traces now she will never be manageable till she is married i am also of that opinion said sir william i will detain you no longer it is a quarter to five in the morning you will sleep here of course no i must go to the temple by the way algy prefers a petition for sherry he is beginning to discern good wine from bad which may be a hopeful augury i will order holmes to send some down to him when he has done a weeks real duty at the bank sooner or later then good morning sir good morning sir william shook his sons hand a minute after edward had quitted the house thats over he said sniffing the morning air gratefully and eyeing certain tinted wisps of cloud that were in a line of the fresh blue sky chapter xxxv a shy and humble entreaty had been sent by dahlia through robert to rhoda saying that she wished not to be seen until the ceremony was at an end but rhoda had become mentally stern toward her sister and as much to uphold her in the cleansing step she was about to take as in the desire to have the dear lost head upon her bosom she disregarded dahlias foolish prayer and found it was well that she had done so for to her great amazement dahlia worn shorn sickened and reduced to be a mark for the scorn of the cowardice which is in the world through the selfishness of a lying man loved the man still and wavered or rather shrank with a pitiful fleshly terror from the noble husband who would wipe the spot of shame from her forehead when after their long separation the sisters met dahlia was mistress of herself and pronounced rhodas name softly as she moved up to kiss her rhoda could not speak oppressed by the strangeness of the white face which had passed through fire she gave a mute kiss and a single groan while dahlia gently caressed her on the shoulder the frail touch of her hand was harder to bear than the dreary vision had been and seemed not so real as many a dream of it rhoda sat by her overcome by the awfulness of an actual sorrow never imagined closely though she had conjured up vague pictures of dahlias face she had imagined agony tears despair but not the spectral change the burntout look it was a face like a crystal lamp in which the flame has died the ghastly little skullcap showed forth its wanness rigidly rhoda wondered to hear her talk simply of home and the old life at each question the then and the now struck her spirit with a lightning flash of opposing scenes but the talk deepened dahlias martyrdom was near and their tongues were hurried into plain converse of the hour and then dahlia faltered and huddled herself up like a creature swept by the torrent rhoda learnt that instead of hate or loathing of the devilish man who had deceived her love survived upon dahlias lips it was compassion and forgiveness but rhoda in her contempt for the word called it love dahlia submitted gladly to the torture of interrogation do you can you care for him still and sighed in shame and fear of her sister not daring to say she thought her harsh not daring to plead for escape as she had done with robert why is there no place for the unhappy who do not wish to live and cannot die she moaned and rhoda cruelly fixed her to the marriage making it seem irrevocable and barring all the faint lights to the free outer world by praise of herpassionate praise of herwhen she confessed that half inanimate after her recovery from the fever and in the hope that she might thereby show herself to her father she had consented to devote her life to the only creature who was then near her to be kind to her rhoda made her relate how this man had seen her first and how by untiring diligence he had followed her up and found her hehe must love you said rhoda and in proportion as she grew more conscious of her sisters weakness and with every access of tenderness toward her she felt that dahlia must be thought for very much as if she were a child dahlia tried to float out some fretting words for mercy on one or other of her heavy breathings but her brain was under lead she had a thirst for rhodas praise in her desolation it was sweet though the price of it was her doing an abhorred thing abhorred she did not realize the consequences of the act or strength would have come to her to wrestle with the coil a stir of her blood would have endued her with womanly counsel and womanly frenzy nor could rhoda have opposed any real vehemence of distaste to the union on dahlias part but dahlias blood was frozen her brain was under lead she clung to the poor delight in her sisters praise and shuddered and thirsted she caught at the minutes and saw them slip from her all the health of her thoughts went to establish a sort of blind belief that god having punished her enough would not permit a second great misery to befall her she expected a sudden intervention even though at the altar she argued to herself that misery which follows sin cannot surely afflict us further when we are penitent and seek to do right her thought being that perchance if she refrained from striving against the current and if she suffered her body to be borne along god would be the more merciful with the small cunning of an enfeebled spirit she put on a mute submissiveness and deceived herself by it sufficiently to let the minutes pass with a lessened horror and alarm this was in the first quarter of the night the dawn was wearing near sedgett had been seen by rhoda a quiet interview a few words on either side attention paid to them by neither but the girl doated on his ugliness she took it for plain proof of his worthiness proof too that her sister must needs have seen the latter very distinctly or else she could not have submitted dahlia looked at the windowblinds and at the candlelight the little which had been spoken between her and her sister in such a chasm of time gave a terrible swiftness to the hours half shrieking she dropped her head in rhodas lap rhoda thinking that with this demonstration she renounced the project finally prepared to say what she had to say and to yield but as was natural after a paroxysm of weakness dahlias frenzy left no courage behind it dahlia said as she swept her brows i am still subject to nervous attacks they will soon leave you said rhoda nursing her hand dahlia contracted her lips is father very unforgiving to women poor father rhoda interjected for answer and dahlias frame was taken with a convulsion where shall i see him tomorrow she asked and glancing from the beamless candle to the windowblinds oh its day why didnt i sleep its day where am i to see him at roberts lodgings we all go there we all gohe goes your husband will lead you there my heaven my heaven i wish you had known what this is a littlejust a little i do know that it is a good and precious thing to do right said rhoda if you had only had an affection dear oh i how ungrateful i am to you it is only darling that i seem unkind to you said rhoda you think i must do this must why why rhoda pressed her fingers why when you were ill did you not write to me that i might have come to you i was ashamed said dahlia you shall not be ashamed any more my sister dahlia seized the windowblind with her trembling fingertips and looked out on the day as if it had smitten her eyeballs she covered her face giving dry sobs oh i wishi wish you had known what this is must i do it his face dear i am very sorry to distress you must i do it the doctor says i am so strong that nothing will break in me and that i must live if i am not killed but if i might only be a servant in fathers house i would give all my love to a little bed of flowers father has no home now said rhoda i knowi know i am ready i will submit and then father will not be ashamed to remain at the farm i am ready dear i am ready rhoda i am ready it is not much she blew the candle out see no one will do that for me we are not to live for ourselves i have done wrong and i am going to be humble yes i am i never was when i was happy and that proves i had no right to be happy all i ask is for another night with you why did we not lie down together and sleep we cant sleep nowits day come and lie down with me for a few hours my darling said rhoda while she was speaking dahlia drew the windowblind aside to look out once more upon the vacant inexplicable daylight and looked and then her head bent like the first thrust forward of a hawks sighting quarry she spun round her raised arms making a cramped clapping motion he is there chapter xxxvi at once rhoda perceived that it was time for her to act the name of him who stood in the street below was written on her sisters face she started to her side got possession of her hands murmuring come with me you are to come with me dont speak i know i will go down yes you are to obey and do what i tell you dahlias mouth opened but like a child when it is warned not to cry she uttered a faint inward wailing lost her ideas and was passive in a shuddering fit what am i to do she said supplicatingly as rhoda led her to her bedroom rest here be perfectly quiet trust everything to me i am your sister leaving her under the spell of coldlyspoken words rhoda locked the door on her she was herself in great agitation but nerved by deeper anger there was no faltering in her movements she went to the glass a minute as she tied her bonnetstrings under her chin and pinned her shawl a nights vigil had not chased the bloom from her cheek or the swimming lustre from her dark eyes content that her aspect should be seemly she ran down the stairs unfastened the bolts and without hesitation closed the door behind her at the same instant a gentleman crossed the road he asked whether mrs ayrton lived in that house rhodas vision danced across his features but she knew him unerringly to be the cruel enemy my sister dahlia fleming lives there she said then you are rhoda my name is rhoda minei fear it will not give you pleasure to hear itis edward blancove i returned late last night from abroad she walked to a distance out of hearing and out of sight of the house and he silently followed the streets were empty save for the solitary footing of an early workman going to his labour she stopped and he said i hope your sister is well she is quite well thank heaven for that i heard of some illness she has quite recovered did shetell me the truthdid she get a letter that i sent two days ago to her it was addressed to miss fleming wrexby kent england did it reach her i have not seen it i wrote said edward his scrutiny of her features was not reassuring to him but he had a sidethought prompted by admiration of her perfect build of figure her succinct expression of countenance and her equable manner of speech to the effect that the true english yeomanry can breed consummate women perhapswho knows even resolute human nature is the stronger for an added knotit approved the resolution he had formed or stamped with a justification the series of wild impulses the remorse and the returned tenderness and manliness which had brought him to that spot you know me do you not he said yes she answered shortly i wish to see dahlia you cannot not immediately of course but when she has risen later in the morning if she has received my letter she will she must see me no not later not at all said rhoda not at all why not rhoda controlled the surging of her blood for a vehement reply saying simply you will not see her my child i must i am not a child and i say what i mean but why am i not to see her do you pretend that it is her wish not to see me you cant i know her perfectly she is gentleness itself yes you know that said rhoda with a level flash of her eyes and confronting him in a way so rarely distinguishing girls of her class that he began to wonder and to ache with an apprehension she has not changed rhodafor we used to talk of you so often you will think better of me byandby naturally enough you detest me at present i have been a brute i cant explain it and i dont excuse myself i state the fact to you her sister my desire is to make up for the past will you take a message to her from me i will not you are particularly positive remarks touching herself rhoda passed by why are you so decided he said more urgently i know i have deeply offended and hurt you i wish and intend to repair the wrong to the utmost of my power surely its mere silly vindictiveness on your part to seek to thwart me go to her say i am here at all events let it be her choice not to see me if i am to be rejected at the door she cant have had my letter will you do that much she knows that you are here she has seen you has seen me edward drew in his breath sharply well and she sends you out to me rhoda did not answer she was strongly tempted to belie dahlias frame of mind she does send you to speak to me edward insisted she knows that i have come and you will not take one message in i will take no message from you you hate me do you not again she controlled the violent shock of her heart to give him hard speech he went on whether you hate me or not is beside the matter it lies between dahlia and me i will see her when i determine i allow of no obstacles not even of wrongheaded girls first let me ask is your father in london rhoda threw a masculine meaning into her eyes do not come before him i advise you if said edward with almost womanly softness you could know what i have passed through in the last eightandforty hours you would understand that i am equal to any meeting though to speak truth i would rather not see him until i have done what i mean to do will you be persuaded do you suppose that i have ceased to love your sister this her execrated word coming from his mouth vanquished her selfpossession are you cold he said seeing the ripple of a trembling run over her i am not cold i cannot remain here rhoda tightened her intertwisting fingers across under her bosom dont try to kill my sister outright shes the ghost of what she was be so good as to go she will soon be out of your reach you will have to kill me first if you get near her never you never shall you have lied to herbrought disgrace on her poor head we poor people read our bibles and find nothing that excuses you you are not punished because there is no young man in our family go edward gazed at her for some time well ive deserved worse he said not sorry now that he saw an opponent in her that she should waste her concentrated antagonism in this fashion and rejoiced by the testimony it gave him that he was certainly not too late you know rhoda she loves me if she does let her pray to god on her knees my good creature be reasonable why am i here to harm her you take me for a kind of monster you look at me very much let me say like a bristling cat here are the streets getting full of people and you ought not to be seen go to dahlia tell her i am here tell her i am come to claim her for good and that her troubles are over this is a moment to use your reason will you do what i ask i would cut my tongue out if it did you a service said rhoda citoyenne corday thought edward and observed then i will dispense with your assistance he moved in the direction of the house rhoda swiftly outstripped him they reached the gates together she threw herself in the gateway he attempted to parley but she was dumb to it i allow nothing to stand between her and me he said and seized her arm she glanced hurriedly to right and left at that moment robert appeared round a corner of the street he made his voice heard and coming up at double quick caught edward blancove by the collar swinging him off rhoda with a sign tempered him to muteness and the three eyed one another its you said robert and understanding immediately the tactics desired by rhoda requested edward to move a step or two away in his company edward settled the disposition of his coatcollar as a formula wherewith to regain composure of mind and passed along beside robert rhoda following what does this mean said robert sternly edwards darker nature struggled for ascendancy within him it was this mans violence at fairly which had sickened him and irritated him against dahlia and instigated him as he remembered well more than mrs lovells witcheries to the abhorrent scheme to be quit of her and rid of all botheration at any cost youre in some conspiracy to do her mischief all of you he cried if you mean dahlia fleming said robert itd be a base creature that would think of doing harm to her now he had a mans perception that edward would hardly have been found in dahlias neighbourhood with evil intentions at this moment though it was a thing impossible to guess generous himself he leaned to the more generous view i think your name is eccles said edward mr eccles my position here is a very sad one but first let me acknowledge that i have done you personally a wrong i am ready to bear the burden of your reproaches or what you will all that i beg is that you will do me the favour to grant me five minutes in private it is imperative rhoda burst inno robert but robert said it is a reasonable request and in spite of her angry eyes he waved her back and walked apart with edward she stood watching them striving to divine their speech by their gestures and letting her savage mood interpret the possible utterances it went ill with robert in her heart that he did not suddenly grapple and trample the man and so break away from him she was outraged to see roberts listening posture lies lies she said to herself and he doesnt know them to be lies the windowblinds in dahlias sittingroom continued undisturbed but she feared the agency of the servant of the house in helping to release her sister time was flowing to dangerous strands at last robert turned back singly rhoda fortified her soul to resist he has fooled you she murmured inaudibly before he spoke perhaps rhoda we ought not to stand in his way he wishes to do what a man can do in his case so he tells me and im bound not to disbelieve him he says he repentssays the word and gentlemen seem to mean it when they use it i respect the word and them when theyre up to that word he wrote to her that he could not marry her and it did the mischief and may well be repented of but he wishes to be forgiven and make amendswell such as he can hes been abroad and only received dahlias letters within the last two or three days he seems to love her and to be heartily wretched just hear me out youll decide but pray pray dont be rash he wishes to marry her says he has spoken to his father this very night came straight over from france after he had read her letters he saysand it seems fairhe only asks to see dahlia for two minutes if she bids him go he goes hes not a friend of mine as i could prove to you but i do think he ought to see her he says he looks on her as his wife always meant her to be his wife but things were against him when he wrote that letter well he says so and its true that gentlemen are situatedthey cant always or think they cant behave quite like honest men theyve got a hundred things to consider for our one thats my experience and i know something of the best among em the question is about this poor young fellow whos to marry her today mr blancove talks of giving him a handsome suma thousand poundsand making him comfortable there rhoda exclaimed with a lightning face you dont see what he is after that oh she paused revolted will you let me run off to the young man wherever hes to be found and put the case to himthat is from dahlia and you know she doesnt like the marriage overmuch rhoda perhaps he may think differently when he comes to hear of things as to mr blancove men change and change when theyre young i mean gentlemen we must learn to forgive either hes as clever as the devil or hes a man in earnest and deserves pity if youd heard him my poor sister sighed rhoda the mentioning of money to be paid had sickened and weakened her as with the very physical taste of degradation hearing the sigh robert thought she had become subdued then rhoda said we are bound to this young man who loves my sisterbound to him in honour and dahlia must esteem him to have consented as for the other she waved the thought of his claim on her sister aside with a quick shake of her head i rely on you to do thisi will speak to mr blancove myself he shall not see her there she indicated the house go to my sister and lose no time in taking her to your lodgings father will not arrive till twelve wait and comfort her till i come and answer no questions robert she gave him her hand gently and looking sweetly if you will do this if i will cried robert transported by the hopeful tenderness the servant girl of the house had just opened the front door intent on scrubbing and he passed in rhoda walked on to edward chapter xxxvii a profound belief in the efficacy of his eloquence when he chose to expend it was one of the principal supports of edwards sense of mastery a secret sense belonging to certain men in every station of life and which is the staff of many an otherwise impressible and fluctuating intellect with this gift if he trifled or slid downward in any direction he could right himself easily as he satisfactorily conceived it is a gift that may now and then be the ruin of promising youths though as a rule they find it helpful enough edward had exerted it upon his father and upon robert seeing rhodas approach he thought of it as a victorious swordsman thinks of his weapon and aimed his observation over her possible weak and strong points studying her curiously even when she was close up to him with robert the representative of force to aid her she could no longer be regarded in the light of a despicable hindrance to his wishes though inclined strongly to detest he respected her she had decision and a worthy bearing and a marvellously blooming aspect and a brain that worked withal when she spoke desiring him to walk on by her side he was pleased by her voice and recognition of the laws of propriety and thought it a thousand pities that she likewise should not become the wife of a gentleman by degrees after tentative beginnings he put his spell upon her ears for she was attentive and walked with a demure forward look upon the pavement in reality taking small note of what things he said until he quoted as against himself sentences from dahlias letters and then she fixed her eyes on him astonished that he should thus heap condemnation on his own head they were most pathetic scraps quoted by him showing the wrestle of love with a petrifying conviction of its hopelessness and with the stealing on of a malady of the blood they gave such a picture of dahlias reverent love for this man her long torture her chastity of soul and simple innocence and her gathering delirium of anguish as rhoda had never taken at all distinctly to her mind she tried to look out on him from a mist of tears how could you bear to read the letters she sobbed could any human being read them and not break his heart for her said he how could you bear to read them and leave her to perish his voice deepened to an impressive hollow i read them for the first time yesterday morning in france and i am here it was undeniably in its effect on rhoda a fine piece of pleading artifice it partially excused or accounted for his behaviour while it filled her with emotions which she felt to be his likewise and therefore she could not remain as an unsympathetic stranger by his side with this he flung all artifice away he told her the whole story saving the one black episode of itthe one incomprehensible act of a desperate baseness that blindly to get free he had deliberately permitted blinked at and had so been guilty of he made a mental pause as he was speaking to consider in amazement how and by what agency he had been reduced to shame his manhood and he left it a marvel otherwise he in no degree exonerated himself he dwelt sharply on his vice of ambition and scorned it as a misleading light yet i have done little since i have been without her and then with a persuasive sincerity he assured her that he could neither study nor live apart from dahlia she is the dearest soul to me on earth she is the purest woman i have lived with her i have lived apart from her and i cannot live without her i love her with a husbands love now do you suppose i will consent to be separated from her i know that while her heart beats its mine try to keep her from meyou kill her she did not die said rhoda it confounded his menaces this time she might he could not refrain from murmuring ah rhoda drew off from him but i say cried he that i will see her we say that she shall do what is for her good you have a project let me hear it you are mad if you have it is not our doing mr blancove it wasit was by her own choice she will not always be ashamed to look her father in the face she dare not see him before she is made worthy to see him i believe her to have been directed right and what is her choice she has chosen for herself to marry a good and worthy man edward called out have you seen himthe man rhoda thinking he wished to have the certainty of the stated fact established replied i have a good and worthy man muttered edward illness weakness misery have bewildered her senses she thinks him a good and worthy man i think him so and you have seen him i have why what monstrous delusion is this it cant be my good creature youre oddly deceived i imagine what is the mans name i can understand that she has lost her will and distinct sight but you are clearsighted and can estimate what is the mans name i can tell you said rhoda his name is mr sedgett mister edward gave one hollow stave of laughter and you have seen him and think him i know he is not a gentleman said rhoda he has been deeply good to my sister and i thank him and do respect him deeply edward echoed he was prompted to betray and confess himself courage failed they looked around simultaneously on hearing an advancing footstep the very man appearedin holiday attire flushed smiling and with a nosegay of roses in his hand he studied the art of pleasing women his eye struck on edward and his smile vanished rhoda gave him no word of recognition as he passed on he was led to speculate from his having seen mr edward instead of mr algernon and from the look of the former that changes were in the air possibly chicanery and the proclaiming of himself as neatly diddled by the pair whom with another he heartily hoped to dupe after he had gone by edward and rhoda changed looks both knew the destination of that lovely nosegay the common knowledge almost kindled an illuminating spark in her brain but she was left in the dark and thought him strangely divining or only strange for him a horror cramped his limbs he felt that he had raised a devil in that abominable smirking ruffian it may not perhaps be said that he had distinctly known sedgett to be the man he had certainly suspected the possibility of his being the man it is out of the power of most wilful and selfish natures to imagine so as to see accurately the deeds they prompt or permit to be done they do not comprehend them until these black realities stand up before their eyes ejaculating great heaven edward strode some steps away and returned its folly rhodathe uttermost madness ever conceived i do not believei know that dahlia would never consentfirst to marry any man but myself secondly to marry a man who is not a perfect gentleman her delicacy distinguishes her among women mr blancove my sister is nearly dead only that she is so strong the disgrace has overwhelmed her it has when she is married she will thank and honour him and see nothing but his love and kindness i will leave you now i am going to her said edward do not theres an end of talking i trust no one will come in my path where am i he looked up at the name of the street and shot away from her rhoda departed in another direction firm since she had seen sedgett pass that his nobleness should not meet with an ill reward she endowed him with fair moral qualities which she contrasted against edward blancoves evil ones and it was with a democratic fervour of contempt that she dismissed the superior dutward attractions of the gentleman chapter xxxviii this neighbourhood was unknown to edward and after plunging about in one direction and another he found that he had missed his way down innumerable dusky streets of dwarfed houses showing soiled silent windowblinds he hurried and chafed at one moment in sharp joy that he had got a resolution and the next dismayed by the singular petty impediments which were tripping him my dearest his heart cried to dahlia did i wrong you so i will make all well it was the work of a fiend now he turned to right now to left and the minutes flew they flew and in the gathering heat of his brain he magnified things until the sacrifice of herself dahlia was preparing for smote his imagination as with a blaze of the upper light and stood sublime before him in the grandeur of old tragedy she has blinded her eyes stifled her senses eaten her heart oh my beloved my wife my poor girl and all to be free from shame in her fathers sight who could have believed that a girl of dahlias class would at once have felt the shame so keenly and risen to such pure heights of heroism the sacrifice flouted conception it mocked the steady morning he refused to believe in it but the short throbs of his blood were wiser a whistling urchin became his guide the little lad was carelessly giving note to a popular opera tune with happy disregard of concord it chanced that the tune was one which had taken dahlias ear and remembering it and her pretty humming of it in the old days edwards wrestling unbelief with the fatality of the hour sank so entirely was he under the sovereignty of his sensations he gave the boy a big fee desiring superstitiously to feel that one human creature could bless the hour the house was in view he knocked and there came a strange murmur of some denial she is here he said menacingly she was taken away sir ten minutes gone by a gentleman the servant tied to assure him the landlady of the house coming up the kitchen stairs confirmed the statement in pity for his torpid incredulity she begged him to examine her house from top to bottom and herself conducted him to dahlias room that bed has not been slept in said the lawyer pointing his finger to it no sir poor thing she didnt sleep last night shes been wearying for weeks and last night her sister came and they hadnt met for very long two whole candles they burnt out or near upon it where edwards articulation choked where theyre gone to sir that i do not know of course she will come back the landlady begged him to wait but to sit and see the minutesthe black emissaries of perditionfly upon their business was torture as big as to endure the tearing off of his flesh till the skeleton stood out up to this point he had blamed himself now he accused the just heavens yea is not a sinner their lawful quarry and do they not slip the hounds with savage glee and hunt him down from wrong to evil from evil to infamy from infamy to death from death to woe everlasting and is this their righteousnesshe caught at the rusty garden rails to steady his feet algernon was employed in the comfortable degustation of his breakfast meditating whether he should transfer a further slice of ham or of yorkshire pie to his plate or else have done with feeding and light a cigar when edward appeared before him do you know where that man lives algernon had a prompting to respond now really what man but passion stops the breath of fools he answered yes have you the thousand in your pocket algernon nodded with a sickly grin jump up go to him give it up to him say that if he leaves london on the instant and lets you see him offsay it shall be doubled stay ill write the promise and put my signature tell him he shall on my word of honour have anotheranother thousand poundsas soon as i can possibly obtain it if he holds his tongue and goes with you and see that he goes dont talk to me on any other subject or lose one minute algernon got his limbs slackly together trying to think of the particular pocket in which he had left his cigarcase edward wrote a line on a slip of notepaper and signed his name beneath with this and an unsatisfied longing for tobacco algernon departed agreeing to meet his cousin in the street where dahlia dwelt by jove two thousand its an expensive thing not to know your own mind he thought how am i to get out of this scrape that girl rhoda doesnt care a button for me no colonies for me i should feel like a convict if i went alone what on earth am i to do it seemed preposterous to him that he should take a cab when he had not settled upon a scheme the sight of a tobacconists shop charmed one of his more immediate difficulties to sleep he was soon enabled to puff consoling smoke neds mad he pursued his soliloquy hes a weathercock do i ever act as he does and im the dog that gets the bad name the idea of giving this fellow two thousandtwo thousand pounds why he might live like a gentleman and that when your friend proves himself to be distraught the proper friendly thing to do is to think for him became eminently clear in algernons mind of course its neds money id give it if i had it but i havent and the fellow wont take a farthing less i know him however its my duty to try he summoned a vehicle it was a boast of his proud youth that never in his life had he ridden in a close cab flinging his shoulders back he surveyed the world on foot odd faces one sees he meditated i suppose theyve got feelings like the rest but a fellow cant help askingwhats the use of them if i inherit all right as i ought to why shouldnt iill squat down at old wrexby garden and farm and drink my port i hate london the squires not so far wrong i fancy it struck him that his chance of inheriting was not so very obscure after all why had he ever considered it obscure it was decidedly next to certain he being an only son and the squires health was bad while speculating in this wise he saw advancing arminarm lord suckling and harry latters they looked at him and evidently spoke together but gave neither nod nor smile nor a word in answer to his flying wave of the hand furious and aghast at this signal of exclusion from the world just at the moment when he was returning to it almost cheerfully in spirit he stopped the cab jumped out and ran after the pair i suppose i must say mr latters algernon commenced harry deliberated a quiet second or two well according to our laws of primogeniture i dont come first and therefore miss a better title he said how are you algernon nodded to lord suckling who replied very well i thank you their legs were swinging forward concordantly algernon plucked out his purse i have to beg you to excuse me he said hurriedly my cousin neds in a mess and ive been helping him as well as i canbothered not an hour my own fifty i think that amount he tendered to harry latters who took it most coolly a thousand he queried of lord suckling divided by two replied the young nobleman and the blucher of banknotes was proffered to him he smiled queerly hesitating to take it i was looking for you at all the clubs last night said algernon lord suckling and latters had been at theirs playing whist till past midnight yet is money even when paid over in this egregious public manner by a nervous hand such testimony to the sincerity of a man that they shouted a simultaneous invitation for him to breakfast with them in an hour at the club or dine with them there that evening algernon affected the nod of haste and acquiescence and ran lest they should hear him groan he told the cabman to drive northward instead of to the southwest the question of the thousand pounds had been decided for himby fate he chose to affirm the consideration that one is pursued by fate will not fail to impart a sense of dignity even to the meanest after all if i stop in england said he i cant afford to lose my position in society anythings better than that an unmitigated low scoundrel like sedgett should bag the game besides is it not somewhat sceptical to suppose that when fate decides she has not weighed the scales and decided for the best meantime the whole energy of his intellect was set reflecting on the sort of lie which edward would by nature and the occasion be disposed to swallow he quitted the cab and walked in the park and au diable to him there the fool has done his work it was now halfpast ten robert with a most heavy heart had accomplished rhodas commands upon him he had taken dahlia to his lodgings whither when free from edward rhoda proceeded in a mood of extreme sternness she neither thanked robert nor smiled upon her sister dahlia sent one quivering look up at her and cowered lower in her chair near the window father comes at twelve rhoda said robert replied he does after which a silence too irritating for masculine nerves filled the room you will find i hope everything here that you may want said robert my landlady will attend to the bell she is very civil thank you we shall not want anything said rhoda there is my sisters bible at her lodgings robert gladly offered to fetch it and left them with a sense of relief that was almost joy he waited a minute in the doorway to hear whether dahlia addressed him he waited on the threshold of the house that he might be sure dahlia did not call for his assistance her cry of appeal would have fortified him to stand against rhoda but no cry was heard he kept expecting it pausing for it hoping it would come to solve his intense perplexity the prolonged stillness terrified him for away from the sisters he had power to read the anguish of dahlias heart her frozen incapacity and the great and remorseless mastery which lay in rhodas inexorable will a few doors down the street he met major blaring on his way to him heres five minutes work going to be done which we may all of us regret till the day of our deaths robert said and related what had passed during the morning hours percy approved rhoda saying she must rescue her sister at all hazards the case is too serious for her to listen to feelings and regrets and objections the world against one poor woman is unfair odds robert i come to tell you i leave england in a day or two will you join me how do i know what i shall or can do said robert mournfully and they parted rhodas unflickering determination to carry out and to an end this tragic struggle of duty against inclination on her own sole responsibility forcing it on acting like a fate in contempt of mere emotionsseemed barely real to his mind each moment that he conceived it vividly he became more certain that she must break down was it in her power to drag dahlia to the steps of the altar and would not her heart melt when at last dahlia did get her voice this marriage can never take place he said and was convinced of its being impossible he forgot that while he was wasting energy at fairly rhoda had sat hiving bitter strength in the loneliness of the farm with one vile epithet clapping on her ears and nothing but unavailing wounded love for her absent unhappy sister to make music of her pulses he found his way to dahlias room he put her bible under his arm and looked about him sadly time stood at a few minutes past eleven flinging himself into a chair he thought of waiting in that place but a crowd of undefinable sensations immediately beset him seeing edward blancove in the street below he threw up the window compassionately and edward casting a glance to right and left crossed the road robert went down to him i am waiting for my cousin edward had his watch in his hand i think i am fast can you tell me the time exactly why im rather slow said robert comparing time with his own watch i make it four minutes past the hour i am at fourteen said edward i fancy i must be fast about ten minutes past is the time i think so much as that it may be a minute or so less i should like said edward to ascertain positively theres a clock down in the kitchen here i suppose said robert safer theres a clock at the church just in sight from here thank you i will go and look at that robert bethought himself suddenly that edward had better not i can tell you the time to a second he said its now twelve minutes past eleven edward held his watch balancing twelve he repeated and behind this mask of commonplace dialogue they watched one anotherwarily and still with pity on roberts side you cant place any reliance on watches said edward none i believe robert remarked if you could see the sun every day in this climate edward looked up ah the suns the best timepiece when visible robert acquiesced backwoodsmen in america dont need watches unless it is to astonish the indians with them ah yes hummed robert twelvefifteenit must be a quarter past or a three quarters to the next hour as the germans say odd robert ejaculated foreigners have the queerest ways in the world they mean no harm but they make you laugh they think the same of us and perhaps do the laughing more loudly ah let them said robert not without contemptuous indignation though his mind was far from the talk the sweat was on edwards forehead in a few minutes it will be halfpasthalfpast eleven i expect a friend that makes me impatient mr ecclesedward showed his singular smallish hardcut and flashing features clear as if he had blown off a mistyou are too much of a man to bear malice where is dahlia tell me at once some one seems to be cruelly driving her has she lost her senses she hasor else she is coerced in an inexplicable and shameful manner mr blancove said robert i bear you not a bit of malicecouldnt if i would im not sure i could have said guilty to the same sort of things in order to tell an enemy of mine i was sorry for what i had done and i respect you for your courage dahlia was taken from here by me edward nodded as if briefly assenting while his features sharpened why he asked it was her sisters wish has she no will of her own very little im afraid just now sir a remarkable sister are they of puritan origin not that i am aware of and this father mr blancove he is one of those sorthe cant lift up his head if he so much as suspects a reproach to his children edward brooded i desireas i told you as i told her sister as i told my father last nighti desire to make her my wife what can i do more are they mad with some absurd country pride halfpast elevenit will be murder if they force her to it where is she to such a man as that poor soul i can hardly fear it for i cant imagine it here the time is going you know the man yourself i know the man said robert ive never set eyes on himive never set eyes on him and never liked to ask much about him i had a sort of feeling her sister says he is a good and kind honourable young fellow and he must be before its too late edward muttered hurriedlyyou know himhis name is sedgett robert hung swaying over him with a big voiceless chest that sedgett he breathed huskily and his look was hard to meet edward frowned unable to raise his head lord in heaven some one has something to answer for cried robert come on come to the church that foul dogor you stay where you are ill go he to be dahlias husband theyve seen him and cant see what he iscunning with women as that how did they meet do you knowcant you guess he flung a lightning at edward and ran off bursting into the aisle he saw the minister closing the book at the altar and three persons moving toward the vestry of whom the last and the one he discerned was rhoda etext
