scourging of the fine shades xxx of the doubleman in us and the great fight when these are fullgrown xxxi besworth lawn xxxii the supper xxxiii defeat and flight of mrs chump chapter xxvi it was midnight mr pole had appeased his imagination with a chop and was trying to revive the memory of his old aftertheatre night carouses by listening to a song which emilia sang to him while he sipped at a smoking mixture and beat time on the table rejoiced that he was warm from head to foot at last thats a pretty song my dear he said a very pretty song it does for an old fellow and so did my supper light and wholesome im an old fellow i ought to know ive got a grownup son and grownup daughters i shall be a grandpa soon i dare say its not the thing for me to go about hearing glees i had an idea of it im better here all i want is to see my children happy married and settled and comfortable emilia stole up to him and dropped on one knee you love them i do i love my girls and my boy and my brandyandwater do you mean to say you rogue and me emilia looked up at him beseechingly yes and you i do i havent known you long my dear but i shall be glad to do what i can for you you shall make my house your home as long as you live and if i say make haste and get married its only just this girls ought to marry young and not be in an uncertain position am i worth having to be sure you are i should think so you havent got a penny but then youre not for spending one andmr pole nodded to right and left like a man who silenced a host of invisible logicians urging this and thatyoure a pleasant companion thrifty pretty musical by jingo what more do they want theyll have their song and chop at home yes but suppose it depends upon their fathers well if their fathers will be fools my dear i cant help em we neednt take em in a lump how about the doctor ill see him tomorrow morning and hear what he has to say shall i mr pole winked shrewdly you will not make my heart break emilias voice sounded one low chord as she neared the thing she had to say bless her soul the old merchant patted her im not the sort of man for that nor his his mr poles nerves became uneasy in a minute at the scent of a mystification he dashed his handkerchief over his forehead repeating his break a mans heart i whats the meaning of that for gods sake dont bother me emilia was still kneeling before him eyeing him with a shadowed steadfast air i say his because his heart is in mine he has any pain that hurts me he may be tremendously in love observed mr pole but he seems a deuced soft sort of a doctor whats his name i love wilfrid the merchant appeared to be giving ear to her long after the words had been uttered while there was silence in the room wilfrid my son he cried with a start he is my lover damned rascal mr pole jumped from his chair going and playing with an unprotected girl i can pardon a young mans folly but this is infamous my dear child he turned to emilia if youve got any notion about my son wilfrid you must root it up as quick as you can if hes been behaving like a villain leave him to me i detest i hate i loathe i would kick a young man who deceives a girl even if hes my sonmores the reason mr pole was walking up and down the room fuming as he spoke emilia tried to hold his hand as he was passing but he said there my child im very sorry for you and im damned angry with him let me go can you can you be angry with him for loving me deceiving you returned mr pole thats what it is and i tell you id rather fifty times the fellow had deceived me anything rather than that he should take advantage of a girl wilfrid loves me and would die for me said emilia now let me tell you the fact mr pole came to a halt fronting her my son wilfrid pole may be in love as he says here and there but he is engaged to be married to a lady of title i have his wordhis oath he got near a thousand pounds out of my pocket the other day on that understanding i dont speak about the money butnowits a lump others would have made a nice row about itbut is he a liar is he a seducing idling vagabond dog is he a contemptible scoundrel he is my lover said emilia she stood without changing a feature as in a darkness holding to the one thing she was sure of then with a sudden track of light in her brain i know the mistake she said pardon him he feared to offend you because you are his father and he thought i might not quite please you for he loves me he has loved me from the first moment he saw me he cannot be engaged to another i could bring him from any womans side i have only to say to myselfhe must come to me for he loves me it is not a thing to doubt mr pole turned and recommenced his pacing with hasty steps all the indications of a nervous tempest were on him interjecting halfformed phrases and now and then staring at emilia as at an incomprehensible object he worked at his hair till it lent him the look of one in horror at an apparition the fellows going to marry lady charlotte chillingworth i tell you he has asked my permission the infernal scamp he knew it pleased me he bled me of a thousand pounds only the other day i tell you hes going to marry lady charlotte chillingworth emilia received this statement with a most perplexing smile she shook her head he cannot cannot i say he shall and must and in a couple of months too the gravely sceptical smile on emilias face changed to a blank pallor then you make him siryou hell be a beggar if he dont you will keep him without money mr pole felt that he gazed on strange deeps in that girls face her voice had the wirelike hum of a rising wind there was no menace in her eyes the lashes of them drooped almost tenderly and the lips were but softly closed the heaving of the bosom though weighty was regular the hands hung straight down and were open she looked harmless but his physical apprehensiveness was sharpened by his nervous condition and he read power in her the capacity to concentrate all animal and mental vigour into one feelingthis being the power of the soul so she stood breathing quietly steadily eyeing him no no went on mr pole come come well sit down and see and talksee what can be done you know i always meant kindly by you oh yes emilia musically murmured and it cost her nothing to smile again now tell me how this began mr pole settled himself comfortably to listen all irritation having apparently left him under the influence of the dominant nature you need not be ashamed to talk it over to me i am not ashamed emilia led off and told her tale simply with here and there one of her peculiar illustrations she had not thought of love till it came to life suddenly she said and then all the world looked different the relation of wilfrids bravery in fighting for her varied for a single instant the low monotony of her voice at the close of the confession mr pole wore an aspect of distress this creatures utter unlikeness to the girls he was accustomed to corroborated his personal view of the case that wilfrid certainly could not have been serious and that she was deluded but he pitied her for he had sufficient imagination to prevent him from despising what he did not altogether comprehend so to fortify the damsel he gave her a lecture first on young mentheir selfish inconsiderateness their weakness the wanton lives they led their trick of lying for any sugarplum and how they laughed at their dupes secondly as to the conduct consequently to be prescribed to girls who were weaker frailer by disposition more confiding and who must believe nothing but what they heard their elders say emilia gave patient heed to the lecture but i am safe she remarked when he had finished for my lover is not as those young men are to speak at all and arrange his ideas was a vexation to the poor merchant he was here like an irritable traveller who knocks at a gate which makes as if it opens without letting him in emilias naive confidence he read as stupidity it brought on a fresh access of the nervous fever lurking in him and he cried jumping from his seat well you cant have him and theres an end you must give upconfound why do you expect to have everything you want at starting there my child but upon my honour a man loses his temper at having to talk for an hour or so and no result you must go to bed anddo you say your prayers well thats one way of getting out of itpray that you may forget all about whats not good for you why youre almost like a young man when you set your mind on a thing bad wont do say your prayers regularly and please pour me out a mouthful of brandy my hand tremblesi dont know whats the matter with itjust like those rushes on the thames i used to see when out fishing no wind and yet there they shake away i wish it was daylight on the old river now its night and no mistake i feel as if i had a fellow twirling a stick over my head the rascals been at it for the last month there stop where you are my dear dont begin to dance he pressed at his misty eyes half under the impression that she was taking a succession of dazzling leaps in air terror of an impending blow which he associated with emilias voice made him entreat her to be silent after a space he breathed a long breath of relief saying no no youre firm enough on your feet i dont think i ever saw you dance my girls have given it up what led me to thinkbut lets to bed and say our prayers i want a kiss emilia kissed him on the forehead the symptoms of illness were strange to her and passed unheeded she was too full of her own burning passion to take evidence from her sight the sun of her world was threatened with extinction she felt herself already a wanderer in a land of tombs where none could say whether morning had come or gone intensely she looked her misery in the face and it was as a voice that said no sun never sun any more to her but a bluehued moon slipped from among the clouds and hung in the black outstretched fingers of the tree of darkness fronting troubled waters this is thy light for ever thou shalt live in thy dream so as in a prisonhouse did her soul now recall the blissful hours by wilming weir she sickened but an instant the blood in her veins was too strong a tide for her to crouch in that imagined corpselike universe which alternates with an irradiated eden in the brain of the passionate young why should i lose him the dry sob choked her she struggled with the emotion in her throat and mr pole who had previously dreaded supplication and appeals for pity caressed her instantly the flood poured out you are not cruel i knew it i should have died if you had come between us oh wilfrids father i love youi have never had a very angry word on my mouth think think if you had made me curse you for i could you would have stopped my life and wilfrids what would our last thoughts have been we could not have forgiven you take up dead birds killed by frost you cry cruel winter murdering cold but i knew better you are wilfrids father whom i can kneel to my lovers father my own father my friend next to heaven oh bless my love for him you have only to know what my love for him is the thought of losing him goes like perishing cold through my bonesmy heart jerks as if it had to pull up my body from the grave every time it beats god in heaven cried the horrified merchant on whose susceptible nerves these images wrought with such a force that he absolutely had dread of her he gasped and felt at his heart and then at his pulse rubbed the moisture from his forehead and throwing a fixedly wild look on her eyes he jumped up and left her kneeling his caress had implied mercy to emilia for she could not reconcile it with the rejection of the petition of her soul she was now a little bewildered to see him trotting the room frowning and blinking and feeling at one wrist at momentary pauses all his words being lets be quiet lets be good lets go to bed and say our prayers mingled with short ejaculations i may say she intercepted him i may tell my dear lover that you bless us both and that we are to live oh speak sir let me hear you lets go to bed iterated mr pole come candles do light them in gods name light candles and lets be off and say our prayers you consent sir whats that your heart does mr pole stopped to enquire adding there dont tell me youve played the devil with mine whod ever have made me believe that i should feel more at ease running up and down the room than seated in my armchair among the wonders of the world that emilia put up her lips to kiss him as he passed her there was something deliciously soothing and havenlike to him in the aspect of her calmness now youll be a good girl said he when he had taken her salute and you she rejoined will be happier his voice dropped if you go on like this youve done for me but she could make no guess at any tragic meaning in his words my fatherlet me call you so will you see that you cant have him he stamped the syllables into her ears and with a notion of there being a foreign element about her repeatednonot have himnot yourssomebody elses this was clear enough only you can separate us said emilia with a brow levelled intently well and imr pole was pursuing in the gusty energy of his previous explanation his eyes met emilias gravely widening iim very sorry he broke down upon my soul i am the old man went to the mantelpiece and leaned his elbow before the glass emilias bosom began to rise again she was startled to hear him laugh a slight melancholy little burst and then a louder one followed by a fulltoned laughter that fell short and showed the heart was not in it that boy braintop what fun it was he said looking all the while into the glass why cant we live in peace and without bother is your candle alight my dear emilia now thought that he was practising evasion i will light it she said mr pole gave a wearied sigh his head being still turned to the glass he listened with a shrouded face for her movements saying good night good night ill light my own theres a dear a shouting was in his ears which seemed to syllable distinctly if she goes at once im safe the sight of pain at all was intolerable to him but he had a prophetic physical warning now that to witness pain inflicted by himself would be more than he could endure emilia breathed a low good night good night my loveall right tomorrow he replied briskly and remorse touching his kind heart as the music of her good night penetrated to it by thrilling avenues he added injudiciously dont fret well see what we can do soon make matters comfortable i love you and i know you will not stab me she answered no certainly not said mr pole still keeping his back to her struck with a sudden anticipating fear of having to go through this scene on the morrow he continued no misunderstands mind wilfrids done with there was a silence he trusted she might be gone turning round he faced her the light of the candle throwing her pale visage into ghostly relief where is sleep for you if you part us mr pole flung up his arms i insist upon your going to bed why shouldnt i sleep childs folly though he spoke so his brain was in strings to his timorous ticking nerves and he thought that it would be well to propitiate her and get her to utter some words that would not haunt his pillow my dear girl its not my doing i like you i wish you well and happy very fond of youblame circumstances not me then he murmured are black spots on the eyelids a bad sign i see big flakes of soot falling in a dark room emilias mated look fleeted you come between us sir because i have no money i tell you its the boys only chance to make his hit now mr pole stamped his foot angrily and you make my cornelia marry though she loves another as wilfrid loves me and if they do not obey you they are to be beggars is it you who can pray can you ever have good dreams i saved my father from the sin by leaving him he wished to sell me but my poor father had no money at all and i can pardon him money was a bright thing to him like other things to us mr pole what will any one say for you the unhappy merchant had made vehement efforts to perplex his hearing that her words might be empty and not future dragons round his couch he was looking forward to a night of sleep as a cure for the evil sensations besetting himhis only chance the chance was going and with the knowledge that it was unjustly torn from himthis one gleam of clear reason in his brain undimmed by the irritable storm which plucked him downhe cried out to clear himself they are beggars both and all if they dont marry before two months are out im a beggar then im ruined i shant have a penny im in a workhouse they are in good homes they are safe and thank their old father now then now shall i sleep emilia caught his staggering arm the glazed light of his eyes went out he sank into a chair white as if life had issued with the secret of his life wonderful varying expressions had marked his features and the tones of his voice while he was uttering that sharp succinct confession so that strange as it sounded every sentence fixed itself on her with incontrovertible force and the meaning of the whole flashed through her mind it struck her too awfully for speech she held fast to his nerveless hand and kneeling before him listened for his long reluctant breathing the shall i sleep seemed answered chapter xxvii for days after the foregoing scene brookfield was unconscious of what had befallen it wilfrid was trying his yacht the ladies were preparing for the great pleasuregathering on besworth lawn and shaping astute designs to exclude the presence of mrs chump for which they partly condemned themselves but as they said only hear her the excitable woman was swelling from conjecture to certainty on a continuous public cry of pon my honrdye think little bellonis gone and marrud pole emilias supposed flight had deeply grieved the ladies when alarm and suspicion had subsided fear of some wretched male baseness on the part of their brother was happily diverted by a letter wherein he desired them to come to him speedily they attributed her conduct to dread of mr pericles that fervid devotee of euterpe received the tidings with an obnoxious outburst which made them seriously ask themselves individually and in secret whether he was not a moneyed brute and nothing more nor could they satisfactorily answer the question he raved you let her go ha what creatures you arehein but you find not anozer in fifty years i say and here you stop and forty hours pass by and not a sing in motion what blood you have it is waternot blood such a voice a verve a style an eye a devil zat girl and all drawn up and out before ze time by a man she is spoilt he exhibited an anguish that they were not able to commiserate certain expressions falling from him led them to guess that he had set some plot in motion which emilias flight had arrested but his tragic outcries were all on the higher ground of the loss to art they were glad to see him go from the house soon he returned to demand wilfrids address arabella wrote it out for him with rebuking composure then he insisted upon having captain gambiers whom he described as ce nonchalant dandy him you will have a better opportunity of seeing by waiting here said adela and the captain came before mr pericles had retreated ce nonchalant was not quite true to his title when he heard that emilia had flown he did not say much but iterated gone with an elegant frown adding she must come back you know and was evidently more than commonly puzzled and vexed pursuing the strain in a way that satisfied mr pericles more thoroughly than adela she shall come back as soon as she has a collar growled mr pericles meaning captivity if shed only come back with her own maiden name interjected mrs chump ill give her a character but upon my honrdye think ut possible now arabella talked over her and rescued her fathers name the noisy sympathy and wild speculations of the tinleys and copleys had to be endured on the whole the feeling toward emilia was kind and the hope that she would come to no harm was fervently expressed by all the ladies frequently enough also to show the opinion that it might easily happen on such points mrs chump never failed to bring the conversation to a block supported as they were by captain gambier edward buxley freshfield sumner and more than once by sir twickenham whom freshfield launching angry shafts now called the semibetrothed the statistical cripple and other strong things that show a developing genius for streetcries and hustingsepithets in every member of the lists of the great rejected or of the jilted who can affect to be philosophical notwithstanding these aids the ladies of brookfield were crushed by mrs chump her main offence was that she revived for them so much of themselves that they had buried oh the unutterably sordid city life it hung about her like a smell of london smoke as a mere animal they passed her by and had almost come to a state of mind to pass her off it was the phantom or rather the embodiment of their first circle that they hated in the woman she took heroes from the journals read by servantmaids she thought highly of the court of aldermen she went on public knees to the aristocracy she was proud in fact of all city appetites what though none saw the peculiar sting they felt it and one virtue in possessing an ideal is that lodging in you as it does it insists upon the interior being furnished by your personal satisfaction and not by the blindness or stupidity of the outer world thus in one direction an ideal precludes humbug the ladies might desire to cloak facts but they had no pleasure in deception they had the feminine power of extinguishing things disagreeable so long as nature or the fates did them no violence when these forces sent an emissary to confound them as was clearly the case with mrs chump they fought the dreadful creature insisted upon shows of maudlin affection that could not be accorded to her so that she existed in a condition of preternatural sensitiveness among ladies pretending to dignity of life the horror of acrid complaints alternating with public offers of love from a gross woman may be pictured in the minds eye the absence of mr pole and wilfrid which caused mrs chump to chafe at the restraint imposed by the presence of males to whom she might not speak endearingly and deprived the ladies of proper counsel and what good may be at times in masculine authority led to one fierce battle wherein the great shot was fired on both sides mrs chump was requested to leave the house she declined interrogated as to whether she remained as an enemy knowing herself to be so looked upon she said that she remained to save them from the dangers they invited those dangers she named observing that mrs lupin their aunt might know them but was as liable to be sent to sleep by a fellow with a bag of jokes as a watchdog to be quieted by a bone the allusion here was to mrs lupins painful partially inexcusable incurable sense of humour especially when a gleam of it led to the prohibited passages of life the poor lady was afflicted so keenly that in instances where one of her sex and position in the social scale is bound to perish rather than let even the shadow of a laugh appear or any sign of fleshly perception or sympathy peep out she was seen to be mutely shockingly penitentially convulsed a degrading sight and albeit repeatedly remonstrated with she upon such occasions invariably turned imploring glancesa sort of frowning entreatyto the ladies or to any of her sex present did you not see that oh can you resist it she seemed to gasp as she made those fruitless efforts to drag them to her conscious level sink thou if thou wilt was the phrase indicated to her she had once thought her propensity innocent enough and enjoyable her nieces had almost cured her by sitting on her until mrs chump came to make her worst than ever it is to be feared that mrs chump was beginning to abuse her power over the little colourless lady we cannot when we find ourselves possessed of the gift of sending a creature into convulsions avoid exercising it mrs lupin was one of the victims of the modern feminine ideal she was in mind merely a woman devout and charitable as her nieces admitted but radicallywhat they did not like to think or to say whatrepugnant seemed to be the word a woman who consented to perceive the doublemeaning who acknowledged its suggestions of a violation of decency laughable and who could not restrain laughter was in their judgement righteously a victim after signal efforts to lift her up the verdict was that their aunt lupin did no credit to her sex if we conceive a timorous little body of finelystrung nerves inclined to be gay and shrewdly apprehensive but depending for her opinion of herself upon those about her we shall see that mrs lupins life was one of sorrow and scourges in the atmosphere of the ideal never did nun of the cloister fight such a fight with the flesh as this poor little woman that she might not give offence to the tribunal of the nice feelings which leads us to ask is sentimentalism in our modern days taking the place of monasticism to mortify our poor humanity the sufferings of the three of brookfield under mrs chump was not comparable to mrs lupins the good little womans soul withered at the self contempt to which her nieces helped her daily laughter far from expanding her heart and invigorating her frame was a thing that she felt herself to be nourishing as a traitor in her bosom and the worst was that it came upon her like a reckless intoxication at times possessing her as a devil might and justifying itself too and daring to say am i not nature mrs lupin shrank from the remembrance of those moments in another age the scenes between mrs lupin and mrs chump greatly significant for humanity as they are will be given without offence on one side or martyrdom on the other at present and before our sentimentalists are a concrete it would be profitless rashness to depict them when the great shots were fired off mrs chump being requested to depart and refusing mrs lupin fluttered between the belligerents doing her best to be a medium for the restoration of peace in repeating mrs chumps remarks which were rendered purposely strong with irish spice by that woman she choked and when she conveyed to mrs chump the counterremarks of the ladies she provoked utterances that almost killed her a sadder life is not to be imagined the perpetual irritation of a desire to indulge in her mortal weakness and listening to the sleepless conscience that kept watch over it her certainty that it would be better for her to laugh right out and yet her incapacity to contest the justice of her nieces rebuke her struggle to resist mrs chump which ended in a sensation of secret shameful liking for herall these warring influences within were seen in her behaviour i have always said observed cornelia that she labours under a disease what is more she had always told mrs lupin as much and her sisters had echoed her three to one in such a case is a severe trial to the reason of solitary one and mrs lupins case was peculiar inasmuch as the more she yielded to chumptemptation and eased her heart of its load of laughter the more her heart cried out against her and subscribed to the scorn of her nieces mrs chump acted a demons part she thirsted for mrs lupin that she might worry her hitherto she had not known that anything peculiar lodged in her tongue and with no other person did she think of using it to produce a desired effect but now the scenes in brookfield became hideous to the ladies and not wanting in their trials to the facial muscles of the gentlemen a significant sign of what the ladies were enduring was that they ceased to speak of it in their consultations it is a blank period in the career of young creatures when a fretting wretchedness forces them out of their dreams to action and it is then that they will do things that seen from the outside ie in the conduct of others they would hold to be monstrous all but impossible or how could cornelia persuade herself as she certainly persuaded sir twickenham and the world about her that she had a contemplative pleasure in his society arabella drew nearer to edward buxley whom she had not treated well and who as she might have guessed had turned his thoughts toward adela though clearly without encouragement adela indeed said openly to her sisters with a gallic ejaculation edward follows me do you know and he has adopted a sort of sicilianvespers look whenever he meets me with captain gambier i could forgive him if he would draw out a dagger and be quite theatrical but behold we meet and my bourgeois grunts and stammers and seems to beg us to believe that he means nothing whatever by his behaviour can you convey to his cityintelligence that he is just a trifle illbred now arabella had always seen edward as a thing that was her own which accounts for the treatment to which he had been subjected a quick spur of jealousya new sensationwas the origin of her leaning toward edward and the plea of saving adela from annoyance excused and covered it he for his part scarcely concealed his irritation until a little scented twisted note was put in his hand which said you are as anxious as i can be about our sweet lost emilia we believe ourselves to be on her traces this gave him wonderful comfort it put adela in a beautiful fresh light as a devoted benefactress and delicious intriguante he threw off some of his most telling caricatures at this period adela had divined that captain gambier suspected his cousin merthyr powys of abstracting emilia that he might shield her from mr pericles the captain confessed it calmly blushing and that he was in communication with miss georgiana ford mr powyss halfsister about whom adela was curious until the captain ejaculated a saintwhereat she was satisfied knowing by instinct that the preference is for sinners their meetings usually referred to emilia and it was astonishing how willingly the captain would talk of her adela repeated to herself this is our mask and thus she made it the captains for it must be said that the conquering captain had never felt so full of pity to any girl or woman to whom he fancied he had done damage as to emilia he enjoyed a most thorough belief that she was growing up to perplex him with her love and he had not consequently attempted to precipitate the measure but her flight had prematurely perplexed him in grave debate with the ends of his moustache for a term he concluded by accusing merthyr powys and with a little feeling of spite not unknown to masculine dignity he wrote to merthyrs halfsistermerely to inquire being aware that whatever he does you have been consulted on and the friends of this miss belloni are distressed by her absence the ladies of brookfield were accustomed to their fathers occasional unpremeditated absences and neither of them had felt an apprehension which she could not dismiss until one morning mr powys sent up his card to arabella requesting permission to speak with her alone chapter xxviii georgiana ford would have had little claim among the fair saints to be accepted by them as one of their order her reputation for coldness was derived from the fact of her having stood a siege from captain gambier but she loved a creature of earth too well to put up a hand for saintly honours the passion of her life centred in devotion to her half brother those who had studied her said perhaps with a touch of malignity that her religious instinct had its source in a desire to gain some place of intercession for him merthyr had leaned upon it too often to doubt the strength of it whatever its purity might be she when barely more than a child a girl of sixteen had followed him over the then luckless italian fieldssacrificing as much for a cause that she held to be trivial as he in the ardour of his halffanatical worship her theory was these italians are in bondage and since heaven permits it there has been guilt by endurance they are strengthened by suffering chastened so let them endure and suffer she would cleave to this view with many variations of pity merthyrs experience was tolerant to the weaker vessels young delight in power which makes her sometimes though sweet and merciful by nature enunciate hebraic severities oracularly he smiled and was never weary of pointing out practical refutations whereat she said will a thousand instances change the principle when the brain and especially the fine brain of a woman first begins to act for itself the work is of heavy labour she finds herself plunging abroad on infinite seas and runs speedily into the anchorage of dogmas obfuscatory saws and what she calls principles here she is safe but if her thinking was not originally the mere action of lively blood upon that battery of intelligence she will byandby reflect that it is not well for a live thing to be tied to a dead and that long clinging to safety confesses too much merthyr waited for georgians patiently on all other points they were heartinheart it was her pride to say that she loved him with no sense of jealousy and prayed that he might find a woman in plain words worthy of him this woman had not been found she confessed that she had never seen her georgians received captain gambiers communication in monmouth merthyr had now and then written of a miss belloni but he had seemed to refer to a sort of child and georgians had looked on her as another italian pensioner she was decisive the moment she awoke to feel herself brooding over the thought of this girl she started to join merthyr solitude is pasturage for a suspicion on her way she grew persuaded that her object was bad and stopped until the thought came if he is in a dilemma who shall help him save his sister and with spiritually streaming eyes at a vision of companionship broken but whether by his taking another adviser or by miss belloni she did not ask georgiana continued her journey at the door of lady gosstres townhouse she hesitated and said in her mind what am i doing and what earthliness has come into my love for him or turning to the cry will he want me stung herself conscious that there was some poison in her love but clinging to it not less she entered the house and was soon in merthyrs arms why have you come up he asked were you thinking of coming to me quickly she murmured in reply he did not say yes but that he had business in london nor did he say what georgiana let him go how miserable is such a weakness is this my love she thought again then she went to her bedroom and knelt and prayed her saviours pardon for loving a human thing too well but if the rays of her mind were dimmed her heart beat too forcibly for this complacent selfdeceit no not too well i cannot love him too well i am selfish when i say that it is myself i am loving to love him thrice as dearly as i do would bring me nearer to god love i mean not idolatryanother form of selfishness she prayed to be guided out of the path of snares can you pray can you put away all props of self this is true worship unto whatsoever power you kneel this passage out of a favourite book of sentences had virtue to help her now in putting away the props of self it helped her for the time she could not foresee the contest that was commencing for her love that shrieks at a mortal wound and bleeds humanly what is he but a pagan god with the passions of a pagan god yes thought georgiana meditating as different from the christian love as a brute from a man she felt that the revolution of the idea of love in her mind all that consoled her was becoming a temptation quick in her impulses she dismissed it i am like a girl she said scornfully like a woman would not have flattered her like what did she strive to be the picture of another self was before hera creature calmly strong unruffled and a refuge to her beloved it was a steady light through every wind that blew save when the heart narrowed and then it waxed feeble and the life in her was hungry for she knew not what georgianas struggle was to make her great passion eat up all the others sure of the intensity and thoroughness of her love for merthyr she would forecast for herself tasks in his service impossible save to one sensually dead and therefore spiritually sexless my love is pure she would say as if that were the talisman which rendered it superhuman she was under the delusion that lovers love was a reprehensible egoism her heart had never had place for it and thus her nature was unconsummated and the torment of a haunting insufficiency accompanied her sweetest hours ready to mislead her in all but very clearest actions she saw or she divined much of this struggle but the vision of it was fitful not consecutive it frightened and harassed without illuminating her now upon merthyrs return she was moved by it just enough to take his hand and say we are the same what can change us he replied or who and as she smiled up to him she was ashamed of her smile yes who he interjected by this time quite enlightened all subtle feelings are discerned by welsh eyes when untroubled by any mental agitation brother and sister were welsh and i may observe that there is human nature and welsh nature forgive me she said i have been disturbed about you perceiving that it would be well to save her from any spiritual twists and turns that she might reach what she desired to know he spoke out fully i have not written to you about miss belloni lately i think it must be seven or eight days since i had a letter from heryou shall see itlooking as if it had been written in the dark she gave the address of a london hotel i went to her and her story was that she had come to town to get mr poles consent to her marriage with his son and that when she succeeded in making herself understood by him the old man fell smitten with paralysis crying out that he was ruined and his children beggars ah said georgiana then this son is engaged to her she calls him her lover openly have i not told you naked and unashamed of course that has attracted my merthyr georgians drew to him tenderly breathing as one who has a burden off her heart but why did she write to you the question started up for this reason it appears that mr pole showed such nervous irritation at the idea of his family knowing the state he was in that the doctor attending him exacted a promise from her not to communicate with one of them she was alone in great perplexity and did what i had requested her to do she did me the honour to apply to me for any help it was in my power to give georgiana stood eyeing the ground sideways what is she like you shall see tomorrow if you will come with me dark or fair merthyr turned her face to the light laughing softly georgiana coloured with dropped eyelids she raised her eyes under their load of shame i will come gladly she said early tomorrow then rejoined merthyr on the morrow as they were driving to the hotel georgians wanted to know whether he called this miss belloni by her christian namea question so needless that her overconscious heart drummed with gratitude when she saw that he purposely spared her from one meaning look in this mutual knowledge mutual help in minute as in great things as well as in the recognition of a common nobility of mind the love of the two was fortified emilia had not been left by mr powys without the protection of a womans society in her singular position lady charlottes natural prompt kindness required no spur from her friend that she should go and brace up the spirits of a little woman whom she pitied doubly for loving a man who was deceiving her and not loving one who was good for her she went frequently to emilia and sat with her in the sombre hotel drawingroom still frank as she was and blunt as she affected to be she could not bring her tongue to speak of wilfrid if she had fancied any sensitive shuddering from the name and the subject to exist she would have struck boldly being capable of cruelty and where she was permitted to see a weakness rather fond of striking deep a belief in the existence of emilias courage touched her to compassion one day however she said what is it you take to in merthyr powys and this brought on plain speaking emilia could give no reason and it is a peculiarity of people who ask such questions that they think a want of directness in the answer suspicious lady charlotte said gravely come come what do you mean asked emilia i like so many things in him you dont like one thing chiefly i likewhat do i likehis kindness his kindness this was the sort of reply to make the lady implacable she seldom read others shrewdly and could not know that near her emilia thought of wilfrid in a way that made the vault of her brain seem to echo with jarred chords his kindness what a picture is the grateful girl i have seen rows of whitecapped charity children giving a bob and a sniffle as the parson went down the ranks promising buns well his kindness you are right in appreciating as much as you can see ill tell you why i like himbecause he is a gentleman and you havent got an idea how rare that animal is dear me should i be plainer to you if i called him a christian gentleman its the cant of a detestable school my child it means just thisbut why should i disturb your future faith in it the professors mainly profess to be a comfort to young women and i suppose you will meet your comfort and worship them with the growing mind and i must confess that they bait it rather cunningly nothing else would bite they catch almost all the raw boys who have anything in them but for me merthyr himself would have been caught long ago theres no absolute harm in them only that theyre a sentimental compromise i deny their honesty and if its flatly proved i deny their intelligence well this you cant understand i have not understood you at all said emilia no its the tongue thats the natural traitor to a woman and takes longer runs with every added year i suppose you know that mr powys wishes to send you to italy i do said emilia when are you going i am not going why emilias bosom rose she cried dear lady on the fall of it and was scarce audibleadding do you love wilfrid well you have brought me to the point quickly lady charlotte remarked i dont commonly beat the bush long myself love him you might as well ask me my age the indiscretion would be equal and the result the same love i have a proper fear of the word when two play at love they spoil the game its enough that he says he loves me emilia looked relieved poor lady she sighed poor lady charlotte echoed with curious eyes fixed on the puzzle beside her tell me you will not believe him emilia continued he is mine i shall never give him up it is useless for you or any one else to love him i know what love is now stop while you can i can be sorry for you but i will not let him go from me he is my lover emilia closed her lips abruptly she produced more effect than was visible lady charlotte drew out a letter saying perhaps this will satisfy you nothing cried emilia jumping to her feet read itread it and for heavens sake ma fille sauvage dont think im here to fight for the man he is not orpheus and our modern education teaches us that its we who are to be run after will you read it no will you read it to please me emilia changed from a look of quiet opposition to gentleness of feature why will it please you if i read that he has flattered you i never lie about what i feel i think men do her voice sank you wont allow yourself to imagine then that he has spoken false to you tell me retorted emilia are you sure in your heartas sure as it beats each timethat he loves you you are not it seems that we are dignifying my gentleman remarkably said lady charlotte when two women fight for a man that is almost a meal for his vanity now listen i am not as they phrase it in love i am an experienced personwhat is called a woman of the world i should not make a marriage unless i had come to the conclusion that i could help my husband or he me do me the favour to read this letter emilia took it and opened it slowly it was a letter in the tone of the gallant paying homage with some fervour emilia searched every sentence for the one word that being absent she handed back the letter her eyes lingering on the signature do you see what he says asked lady charlotte that i can be a right hand to him as i believe i can he writes like a friend emilia uttered this as when we have a contrast in the mind you excuse him for writing to me in that style yes he may write to any woman like that he has latitude you really fancy thats the sort of letter a friend would write that is how mr powys would write to me said emilia lady charlotte laughed my unhappy merthyr only if i could be a great deal older emilia hastened to add and lady charlotte slightly frowned but rubbed it out with a smile rising the lady said i have spoken to you upon equal terms and remember very few women would have done what i have done you are cared for by merthyr powys and thats enough it would do you no harm to fix your eyes upon him you wont get him but it would do you no harm he has a heart as they call it whatever it is its as strong as a cable he is a knight of the antique he is specially guarded however well he insists that you are his friend so you are mine and that is why i have come to you and spoken to you you will be silent about it i need not say no one but yourself is aware that lieutenant pole does me the honour to liken me to the good old gentleman who accompanied telemachus in his voyages and chooses me from among the handmaidens of earth on this head you will promise to be silent lady charlotte held forth her hand emilia would not take it before she had replied i knew this before you came and then she pressed the extended fingers lady charlotte drew her close has wilfrid taken you into his confidence so far emilia explained that she had heard it from his father the ladys face lit up as from a sting of anger very wellvery well she said and presently you are right when you speak of the power of lying in men observewilfrid told me that not one living creature knew there was question of an engagement between us what would you do in my case emilia replied forgive him and i should think no more of it yes it would be right and presuming him to have the vice i could be of immense service to him if at least he does not lie habitually but this is a description of treachery you know oh cried emilia what kind of treachery is that if he only will keep his heart open for me to give all mine to it she stood clutching her hands in the halfsobbing ecstasy which signalises a spiritual exaltation built on disquiet she had shown small emotion hitherto the sight of it was like the sight of a mighty hostile power to lady charlottea power that moved herthat challenged and irritated and subdued her for she saw there something that she had not and being of a nature leaning to greatmindedness though not of the first rank she could not meanly mask her own deficiency by despising it to do this is the secret evil by which souls of men and women stop their growth lady charlotte decided now to say goodbye her parting was friendly the form of it consisting of a nod an extension of the hand and a kind word or two when alone emilia wondered why she kept taking long breaths and tried to correct herself but the heart laboured yet she seemed to have no thought in her mind she had no active sensation of pity or startled selflove she went to smooth mr poles pillow as to a place of forgetfulness the querulous tyrannies of the invalid relieved her but the heavy lifting of her chest returned the moment she was alone she mentioned it to the doctor who prescribed for liver informing her that the said organ conducted one of the most important functions of her bodily system emilia listened to the lecturer and promised to take his medicine trusting to be perfectly quieted by the nauseous draught but when mr powys came she rushed up to him and fell with a cry upon his breast murmuring broken words that georgiana might fairly interpret as her suspicions directed nor had she ever seen merthyr look as he did when their eyes next met chapter xxix the card of mr powys found arabella alone in the house mrs lupin was among village schoolchildren mrs chump had gone to london to see whether anything was known of mr pole at his office where she fell upon the youth braintop and made him her own for the day adela was out in the woods contemplating nature and cornelia was supposed to be walking whither her stately fancy drew her will you take long solitary walks unprotected she was asked i have a parasol she replied and could hear miles distant the domestic comments being made on her innocence and the story it would be she thinks of no possible danger but from the sun a little forcing of her innocence now was necessary as an opiate for her conscience she was doing what her conscience could only pardon on the plea of her extreme innocence the sisters and the fashion at brookfield permitted the assumption and exaggerated it willingly it chanced however that adela had reason to feel discontented it was a breach of implied contract she thought that cornelia should as she did only yesterday tell her that she had seen edward buxley in the woods and that she was of opinion that the air of the woods was bad for her not to see would have been the sisterly obligation in adelas idea especially when seeing embraced things that no loving sister should believe bear in mind that we are sentimentalists the eye is our servant not our master andso are the senses generally we are not bound to accept more than we choose from them thus we obtain delicacy and thus as you will perceive our civilization by the aid of the sentimentalists has achieved an effective varnish there certainly to the vulgar mind a tail is visible the outrageous philosopher declares vehemently that no beast of the field or the forest would own such a tail his meaning is that he discerns the sign of the animal slinking under the garb of the stately polished creature i have all the difficulty in the world to keep him back and let me pursue my course these philosophers are a badmannered body either in opposition or in the support of them i maintain simply that the blinking sentimentalist helps to make civilization what it is and civilization has a great deal of merit did you not leave your parasol behind you at ipley said adela as she met cornelia in the afternoon cornelia coloured her pride supported her and she violated fine shades painfully in her response mr barrett left me there is that your meaning adela was too much shocked to note the courageousness of the reply well if all we do is to come into broad daylight was her horrified mental ejaculation the veil of life was about to be lifted for these ladies they found arabella in her room crying like an unchastened schoolgirl and their first idea was one of intense condemnationfresh offences on the part of mrs chump being conjectured little by little arabella sobbed out what she had heard that day from mr powys after the first stupor adela proposed to go to her father instantly and then suggested that they should all go she continued talking in random suggestions and with singular heat as if she conceived that the sensibility of her sisters required to be aroused by moving and acting it seemed to her that the prospect of a vast misery might be expunged and that she might escape from showing any likeness to arabellas shamefullydiscoloured face it was impossible for her to realize grief in her own bosom she walked the room in a nervous tremour shedding a note of sympathy to one sister and to the other at last arabella got fuller command of her voice when she had related that her fathers positive wish furthered by the doctors special injunction to obey it scrupulously was that they were not to go to him in london and not to breathe a word of his illness but to remain at brookfield entertaining friends adela stamped her foot saying that it was more than human nature could bear if we go said arabella the london doctor assured mr powys that he would not answer for papas life but good heavens are we papas enemies and why may mr powys see him if we his daughters cannot tell me how mr powys met him and knew of it tell mei am bewildered i feel that we are cheated in some way oh tell me something clear arabella said calmingly emilia is with papa she wrote to mr powys whether she did rightly or not we have not now to inquire i believe that she thought it right entertain friends interjected adela but papa cannot possibly mean that we are to go throughtothe fete on besworth lawn bella its in two days from this dreadful day papa has mentioned it to mr powys he desires us not to postpone it we arabellas voice broke piteously oh but this is torture cried adela with a deplorable vision of the lookingglass rising before her as she felt the tears sting her eyelids this cannot be no father wouldnot loving us as dear papa does to be quiet to sit and be gay to flaunt at a fete oh mercy mercy tell mehe left us quite wellno one could have guessed i remember he looked at me from the carriage window tell meit must be some moral shockwhat do you attribute it to wilfrid cannot be the guilty one we have been only too compliant to papas wishes about that woman tell me what you think it can be a voice said money which of the sisters had spoken adela did not know it was bitter enough that one could be brought to utter the thing even if her ideas were so base as to suspect it the tears now came dancing over her underlids like triumphing imps money echoed through her again and again curiously too she had no occasion to ask how it was that money might be supposed to have operated on her fathers health unable to realize to herself the image of her father lying ill and suffering but just sufficiently touched by what she could conceive of his situation the bare whisper of money came like a foul insult to overwhelm her in floods of liquid selflove she wept with that last anguish of a woman who is compelled to weep but is incapable of finding any enjoyment in her tears cornelia and arabella caught her hands she was the youngest and had been their pet it gratified them that adela should show a deep and keen feeling adela did not check herself from a demonstration that enabled her to look broadly as it were on her own tenderness of heart following many outbursts she asked and the illnesswhat is it not its causeitself a voice said paralysis adelas tears stopped she gazed on both faces trying with open mouth to form the word chapter xxx flying from port to port to effect an exchange of stewards the endless occupation of a yacht proprietor wilfrid had no tidings from brookfield the night before the gathering on besworth lawn he went to london and dined at his cluba place where youths may drink largely of the milk of this worlds wisdom wilfrids romantic sentiment was always corrected by an hour at his club after dinner he strolled to a not perfectly regulated theatre in company with a brother officer and when they had done duty before the scenes for a space of time they lounged behind to disenchant themselves in obedience to that precocious cynicism which is the young mans extraluxury the first figure that caught wilfrids attention there was mr pericles in a white overcoat stretched along a sofahis eyelids being down though his eyes were evidently vigilant beneath a titter of ladies present told of some recent interesting commotion only a row between that rich greek fellow who gave the supper and marion a vivacious dame explained to wilfrid shes in one of her jealous fits shed be jealous if her poodledog went on its hindlegs to anybody else poodle by jove said wilfrid pericles himself looks like an elongated poodle shaved up to his moustache look at him and he plays the tyrant does he oh she stands that some of those absurd women like it i think shes fussing about another girl you wouldnt what mans worth it but would you it depends upon the him monsieur depends upon his being very handsome and good and rich no the lady fired up there you dont know us the colloquy became almost tender until she said isnt this gassy and stifling i confess i do like a carriage and richmond on a sunday and then with two daughters you know but what i complain of is her folly in being in love or something like it with a rich fellow love the poor devilmanage the rich you mean yes of course that makes them both happy its a method of being charitable to two a rather fleshy fairy now entered and walked straight up to the looking glass to examine her paintpronouncedly turning her back to the sofa where mr pericles still lay at provoking full length her panting was ominous of a further explosion innocent child in the mockery of a foreign accent commenced it while wilfrid thought how unjustly and coldly critically he had accused his little emilia of vulgarity now that he had this feminine display of it swarming about him innocent child indeed be as deaf as you like you shall hear and sofas are not made for mens dirty boots in this country i believe theyre all pigs abroadthe men and the womencats oh dont open your eyesdont speak pray youre certain i must go when the bell rings youre waiting for that you unmanly dog a pig mr pericles here ventured to remind her murmuring as one in a dream a peeg she retorted mildly somewhat mollified by her apparent success but mr pericles had relapsed into his exasperating composure the breath of a deliberate and undeserved peacefulness continued to be drawn in by his nostrils at the accustomed warning there was an ostentatious rustle of retiring dresses whereat mr pericles chose to proclaim himself awake the astute fairyfury immediately stepped before him now you cant go on pretending sleep you shall hear and everybody shall hear you know youre a villain youre a wolf seeking mr pericles waved his hand and she was caught by the wrist and told that the scene awaited her let them wait she shouted and sharpening her cry as she was dragged off dare to take that girl to italy i know what that means with you an englishman might mean rightbut you you think youve been dealing with a fool why i can stop this in a minute and i will its youre the fool why i know her father he plays in the orchestra i know her namebelloni up sprang the greek like a galvanized corpse while two violent jerks from the man hauling her out rattled the laugh of triumph which burst from her at the same time wilfrid strove forward with the frown of one still bent listening and he and pericles were face to face the eyebrows of the latter shot up in a lively arch he made a motion toward the ceremony of shakehands but perceiving no correspondent overture grinned it is warmha you feel the heat step outside a minute said wilfrid oh no mr pericles looked pleasantly sagacious ze draughta cold will you come pursued wilfrid many sanks wilfrids hand was rising at this juncture his brother officer slipped out some languid words in his ear indicative of his astonishment that he should be championing a termagant and horror at the idea of such a thing being publicly imagined tamed wilfrid quickly he recovered himself with his usual cleverness seeing the signs of hostility vanish mr pericles said you are on a search for your father you have found him hom i should say a maladie of nerfs will come to him a pin fallhe start a storm at nighthe is out dancing among his ships of venture not a bid of coragewhich is bad if you shall find mr pole for to morrow on ze lawn vary glad with a smile compounded of sniffing dog and parisian obsequiousness mr pericles passed thinking he has not got her for such was his deduction if he saw that a man could flush for a womans name wilfrid stood like a machine with a thousand wheels in revolt sensations pricked at ideas and immediately left them to account for their existence as they best could the ideas committed suicide without a seconds consideration he felt the great gurgling sea in which they were drowned heave and throb then came a fresh set that poised better on the slackrope of his understanding by degrees a buried dread in his brain threw off its shroud the thought that there was something wrong with his father stood clearly over him to be swallowed at once in the less tangible belief that a harm had come to emilianot was coming but had come passion thinks wilfully when it thinks at all that night he lay in a deep anguish revolving the means by which he might help and protect her there seemed no way open save by making her his own and did he belong to himself what bound him to lady charlotte she was not lovely or loving he had not even kissed her hand yet she held him in a chain the two men composing most of us at the outset of actual life began their deadly wrestle within him both having become awakened if they wait for circumstance that steady fire will fuse them into one who is commonly a person of some strength but throttling is the custom between them and we are used to see men of murdered halves these men have what they fought for they are unaware of any guilt that may be charged against them though they know that they do not embrace life and so it is that we have vague discontent too universal change o lawgiver the length of our minority and let it not end till this battle is thoroughly fought out in approving daylight the period of our duality should be one as irresponsible in your eyes as that of our infancy is he we call a young man an individualwho is a pair of alternately kicking scales is he educated when he dreams not that he is divided he has drunk latin like a vital air and can quote what he remembers of homer but how has he been fortified for this tremendous conflict of opening manhood which is to our life here what is the landing of a soul to the life to come meantime it is a bad business when the doubleman goes about kneeling at the feet of more than one lady society to give that institution its due permits him to seek partial invulnerability by dipping himself in a dirty styx which corrects as we hear said the adolescent tendency to folly wilfrids sentiment had served him well or ill as it may be by keeping him from a headlong plunge in the protecting river and his folly was unchastened he did not even contemplate an escape from the net at emilias expense the idea came the idea will come to a young man in such a difficulty my mistress my glorious stolen fruit my dark angel of love he deserves a little credit for seeing that emilia never could be his mistress in the debased sense of the term union with her meant lifelong union he knew ultimate mental subjection he may also have seen in it unconsciously for hazy thoughts of that nature may mix with the belief that an alliance with her degrades us in this curious hotchpotch of emotions known to the world as youthful man a wife superior to her husband makes him ridiculous wilfully if the wretch is to be laughed at but a mistress thus illmatched cannot fail to cast the absurdest light on her monstrous dwarfcustodian wilfrid had the sagacity to perceive and the keen apprehension of ridicule to shrink from the picture besides he was beginning to love emilia his struggle now was to pluck his passion from his heart and such was already his plight that he saw no other way of attempting it than by taking horse and riding furiously in the direction of besworth chapter xxxi i am curious to see what you will make of this gathering i can cook a small company myself it requires the powers of a giantess to mix a body of people in the open air and all that is said of commanders of armies shall be said of you if you succeed this was lady gosstres encouragement to the fair presidents of the fete on besworth lawn there had been a time when they would have cried out internally we will do it fail who may that fallow hour was over their sole thought was to get through the day a little feverish impulse of rivalry with her great pattern may have moved arabella but the pressure of grief and dread and the contrast between her actions and feelings forcibly restrained a vain display as a consequence she did her duty better and won applause from the great ladys moveable court on eminences of the ground these girls are clever she said to lady charlotte they dont bustle too much they dont make too distinct a difference of tone with the different sets i shall propose miss pole as secretary to our pin and needle relief society do was the reply there is also the polish dance committee and if she has any energy left she might be treasurer to the ladies general revolution ball that is an association with which i am not acquainted said lady gosstre directing her eyeglass on the field here comes young pole hes gallant they tell me and handsome he studies us too obviously thats a mistake to be corrected charlotte one doesnt like to see a pair of eyes measuring us against a preconception quelconque now there is our ionian ambut you have corrected me merthyrhost if you please but see what is the man doing is he smitten with madness mr pericles had made a furious dash at the band in the centre of the lawn scattered their music and knocked over the stands when his gesticulations had been observed for some moments freshfield sumner said he has the look of a plucked hen who remembers that she once clapped wings and tries to recover the practice very good said lady gosstre she was not one who could be unkind to the professional wit and the musicleaves go for feathers what has the band done to displease him i thought the playing was good the instruments appear to have received a dismissal said lady charlotte i suppose this is a clearing of the stage for coming alarums and excursions behold the female element is agitated there are can you reckon at this distance merthyrtwelve fourteen of my sex entreating him in the best tragic fashion can he continue stern they seem to be as violent as the women who tore up orpheus said lady gosstre tracy runningbrook shrieked in a paroxysm splendid from his couch on the sward and immediately ran off with the idea bodily have i stumbled anywhere lady gosstre leaned to mr powys he replied with a satiric sententiousness that told lady gosstre what she wanted to know this is the isolated case where a little knowledge is truly dangerous said lady gosstre i prohibit girls from any allusion to the classics until they have taken their degree and are warranted not to open the wrong doors on the whole dont you think merthyr its better for women to avoid that pool and accept what the noble creature chooses to bring to us in buckets added lady charlotte what is your opinion georgey i forget merthyr has thought you worthy of instruction merthyr taught me in camp said georgians looking at her brotherher face showing peace and that confirmed calm delight habitual to it we found that there are times in war when you can do nothing and you are feverish to be employed then if you can bring your mind to study you are sure to learn quickly i liked nothing better than latin grammar studying latin grammar to the tune of great guns must be a new sensation freshfield sumner observed the pleasure is in getting rid of all sensation said she i mean you command it without at all crushing your excitement you cannot feel a fuller happiness than when you look back on those hours at least i speak for myself so said lady gosstre georgey did not waste her time after all charlotte what the latter thought was she could not handle a sword or fire a pistol would i have consented to be mere campbaggage yet no woman admired georgiana ford so much disappointment vitiated many of lady charlottes first impulses and not until strong antagonism had thrown her upon her generosity could she do justice to the finer natures about her there was full life in her veins and she was hearing the thirty fatal bells that should be music to a woman if melancholy music and she had not lived time that sounded in her ears as it kindled no past spoke of no future she was in unceasing rivalry with all of her sex who had a passion or a fixed affection or even an employment a sense that she was wronged by her fate haunted this lady rivalry on behalf of a man she would have held meanshe would have plucked it from her bosom at once she was simply envious of those who in the face of death could say i have lived pride and the absence of any power of self inspection kept her blind to her disease no recollection gave her boy save of the hours in the huntingfield there she led gallantly but it was not because of leading that she exulted there the quick blood struck on her brain like wine and she seemed for a time to have some one among the crowns of life an objectwho cared how smallwas ahead a poor old fox trying to save his brush and charlotte would have it if the master of cunning did not beat her its my natural thirst for blood she said she did not laugh as she thought now and then that the old red brush dragging over grey dews toward a yellow yolk in the curdled winter morning sky was the single thing that could make her heart throb brookfield was supported in its trial by the discomfiture of the tinleys these girls with their brother had evidently plotted to draw out mrs chump they had asked concerning her severally and hearing that she had not returned from town had each shown a blank face or had been doubtful of the next syllable of wilfrid emilia and mr pole question and answer were interchanged wilfrid will come in a few minutes miss belloni you know is preparing for italy papa papa i really do fear will not be able to join us such was brookfields concerted form of reply the use of it together with the gaiety of dancing blood gave adela who believed that she ought to be weeping and could have wept easily strange twitches of what i would ask permission to call the juvenile shrugphilosophy as thus what creatures we are but life is so and again is not merriment dreadful when a duty she was as miserable as she could be but not knowing that youth furnished a plea available the girl was ashamed of being cheerful at all edward burleys sketch of mr pericles scattering his band sent her into muffled screams of laughter for which she did internal penance so bitter that for her to be able to go on at all the shrugphilosophy was positively necessary mr pericles himself saw the sketch and remarked critically it is zat i have more hair following which he tapped the signal for an overture to commence and at the first stroke took a run with his elbows clapping exactly as the shrewd hand of edward had drawn him see himzat fellow mr pericles said to laura tinley pointing to the leader see him pose a maestro zat leads zis tintamarre he is a hum abug laura did the vocal caricaturing when she had gathered plenty of matter of this kind altogether as host mr pericles accomplished his duty in furnishing amusement late in the afternoon sir twickenham pryme and wilfrid arrived in company the baronet went straight to cornelia wilfrid beckoned to adela from whom he heard of his fathers illness at the hotel in town and the conditions imposed on them he nodded said lightly wheres emilia and nodded again to the answer with papa and then stopped as he was walking off to one of the groups after all it wont do for us to listen to the whims of an invalid im going back you neednt say youve seen me we have the doctors most imperative injunction dearest pleaded adela deceived for a moment papas illness is mental chiefly he is able to rise and will be here very soon if he is not in any way crossed for heavens sake command yourself as we have donepainfully indeed besides you have been seen has she wilfrid began and toned an additional carelessness she writes of course no not once and we are angry with her it looks like ingratitude or stupidity she can write people might say that we are not behaving well returned wilfrid repeating that he must go to town but now edward burley camp running with a message from the aristocratic heights and thither wilfrid walked captivesaying in adelas ear dont be angry with her adela thought very justly i shall if youve been making a fool of her naughty boy wilfrid saluted the ladies and made his bow of introduction to georgiana ford at whom he looked twice to confirm an impression that she was the perfect contrast to emilia and for this reason he chose not to look at her again lady charlotte dropped him a quick recognition if brookfield could have thrown the burden from its mind the day was one to feel a pride in three circles were present and brookfield denominated two that it had passed through and patronized allfrom lady gosstre aristocracy to the tinley set lucre and from these to the representative sumner girls cultivated poverty there were also intellectual scientific and art circles to deal with music pleasant to hear albeit condemned by mr pericles agreeable chatter courtly flirtation and homage and no dread of the defection of the letter h from their family i feel more and more convinced said adela meeting arabella that we can have really no cause for alarm otherwise papa would not have been cruel to his children arabella kindly reserved her opinion so let us try and be happy continued adela determining to be encouraged by silence with that she went on tiptoe gracefully and blew a kiss to her sisters lips running to captain gambier she said do you really enjoy this charming replied the everaffable gentleman if i might only venture to say what makes it so infinitely much to her immediate chagrin at missing a direct compliment which would have had to be parried and might have led to vistas the too sprightly young lady found herself running on its as nice as sin without the knowledge that you are sinning oh do you think that part of it disagreeable said the captain i think the heat terrific she retrieved her ground coquet et coquette muttered lady charlotte observing them from a distance and wondered whether her sex might be strongly represented in this encounter it was not in the best taste nor was it perhaps good policy if i may quote the tinley set for the ladies of brookfield to subscribe openly to the right of certain people present to be exclusive arabella would have answered lady gosstre and her party cannot associate with you to your mutual pleasure and profit and do you therefore blame her for not attempting what would fail ludicrously with herself as she was not sorry to show lady gosstre could associate cornelia had given up work to become a part of the court adela made flying excursions over the lawn laura tinley had the field below and mr pericles to herself that anxious gentleman consulted his watch from time to time as if he expected the birth of an event lady gosstre grew presently aware that there was more acrimony in freshfield sumners replies to sir twickenham whom he had seduced into a political argument than the professional wit need employ and as mr powyss talk was getting so attractive that the court had become crowded she gave a hint to georgiana and lady charlotte prompt lieutenants whose retirement broke the circle i never shall understand how it was done adela said subsequently it is hoped that everybody sees the importance of understanding such points she happened to be standing alone when a messenger came up to her and placed a letter in her hand addressed to her sister cornelia adela walked slowly up to the heights she knew mr barretts handwriting good heavensher thought may be translated out of fine shadesdoes c really in her heart feel so blind to our situation that she can go on playing still when she reached the group it was to hear mr powys speaking of mr barrett cornelia was very pale and stood wretchedly in contrast among the faces adela beckoned her to step aside here is a letter she said theres no postmark what has been the talk of that man do you mean of mr barrett cornelia repliedthat his father was a baronet and a madman who has just disinherited him just cried adela she thought of the title cornelia had passed on a bizarre story of mr barretts father was related to adela by sir twickenham she grappled it with her sense and so got nothing out of it disinherited him because he wrote to his father who was dying to say that he had gained a livelihood by playing the organ he had a hatred of music its incomprehensible you know sir twickenham the interest we take in mr barrett the masked anguish of cornelias voice hung in her ears she felt that it was now possible cornelia might throw over the rich for the penniless baronet and absolutely for an instant she thought nakedly the former ought not to be lost to the family thick clouds obscured the vision lady gosstre had once told her that the point of sir twickenhams private character was his susceptibility to ridicule her ladyship had at the same time complimented his discernment in conjunction with cornelia yes adela now thought but if my sister shows that she is not so wise as she looks cornelias figure disappeared under the foliage bordering besworth lawn as usual arabella had all the practical laboura fact that was noticed from the observant heights one sees mere de famille written on that young woman was the eulogy she won from lady gosstre how much would the great dame have marvelled to behold the ambition beneath the bustling surface arabella was feverish and freshfield sumner reported brilliant things uttered by her he became after a time her attendant aide and occasional witfoil they had some sharp exchanges and he could not but reflect on the pleasure her keen zest of appreciation gave him compared with cornelias grave smile which had often kindled in him profane doubts of the positive brightness or rapidity of her intelligence besworth at sunset what a glorious picture to have living before you every day said lady charlotte to her companion wilfrid flushed she read his look and said when they were out of hearing what a place for old people to sit here near the end of life the idea of it makes one almost forgive the necessity for getting old doesnt it tracy runningbrook might make a poem about silver heads and sunsetsomething you know very easy cantering thenno hunting i suppose one wouldnt have even a desire to go fasta sort of cockhorse just as we began with the stables let me tell you are too near the scullery one is bound to devise measures for the protection of the morals of the household while she was speaking wilfrids thoughts ran my time has come to strike for liberty this too she perceived and was prepared for him he said lady charlotte i feel that i must tell youi fear that i have been calculating rather more hopefully here the pitfall of sentiment yawned before him on a sudden i mean he struggled to avoid it but was at the brink in the next sentence i mean dear lady that i had hopesbesworth pleased you to offer you this with yourself she relieved him a different manner in a protesting male would have charmed her better she excused him knowing what stood in his way that i scarcely dared to hope said wilfrid bewildered to see the loose chain he had striven to cast off gather tightly round him you do hope it i have you have hoped that i she was not insolent by nature and corrected the form to marry me yes lady charlotte ii had that hopeif i could have offered this placebesworth i find that my father will never buy it i have misunderstood him he fixed his eyes on her expecting a cool or an ironical rejoinder to end the colloquyafter which fair freedom she answered we may do very well without it wilfrid was not equal to a start and the trick of rapturous astonishment he heard the words like the shooting of dungeonbolts thinking oh heaven if at the first i had only told the woman i do not love her but that sentimental lead had ruined him and on second thoughts how could he have spoken thus to the point when they had never previously dealt in anything save sentimental implications the folly was in his speaking at all the game was now in lady charlottes hands adela in another part of the field had released herself by a consummate use of the same weapon wilfrid had so clumsily handled her object was to put an end to the absurd and compromising sighs of edward buxley and she did so with the amiable contempt of a pupil dismissing a first instructor in an art we saw from the beginning it could not be edward the enamoured caricaturist vainly protested that he had not seen it from the beginning and did not now he recalled to her that she had said he was her first she admitted the truth with eyes dwelling on him until a ringlet got displaced her first to be that sentimental man would perish in the fires to have been that will sometimes console him even when he has lived to see what a thing he was who caught the budding fancy the unhappy caricaturist groaned between triumph as a leader and anguish at the prospect of a possible host of successors king in that pure bosom the thought would comeking of a mighty line mayhap and sentimental man awakened to this disastrous view of things endures shrewder pangs of rivalry in the contemplation of his usurping posterity than if as do they he looked forward to a tricked perfumed pommaded whipster pirouetting like any pierrotthe enviable image of the one who realized her first dream and to whom specially missioned angels first opened the golden gates of her heart i have learnt to see edward that you do not honour me with a love you have diverted from one worthier than i am and in answer to the question whether though having to abjure her love she loved him no no it is my arabella i love i love i will love no one but herwith sundry caressing ejaculations that spring a thirst for kisses and a tender putting of the case now and then so much for adelas part in the conflict edward was unaware that the secret of her mastering him was that she was now talking commonsense in the tone of sentiment he on the contrary talked sentiment in the tone of commonsense of course he was beaten and o you young lovers when you hear the dear lips setting what you call the worlds harsh language to this music know that an hour has struck for you it is a fatal sound to hear edward believed that his pleading had produced an effect when he saw miss adelas bosom rise as with a weight on it the burden of her thoughts washow big and heavy edwards eyes look when he is not amusing to get rid of him she said as with an impassioned coldness go her figure repeating this under closed eyelids was mysterious potent when he exclaimed then i will go her eyelids lifted wide she shut them instantly showing at the same time a slight tighteningin of the upper lip you beheld a creature tied to the stake of duty but she was exceedingly youthful and had not reckoned upon mans being a live machine possessing impulses of his own a violent seizure of her waist and enough of kisses to make up the sum popularly known as a shower stopped her performance she struggled and muttered passionately to be released we are seen she hazarded at the repetition edward accustomed to dread the warning let her go and fled turning hurriedly about adela found that she had spoken truth unawares and never wished so much that she had lied sir twickenham pryme came forward to her with his usual stiff courtly step if you could have been a littlea little earlier she murmured with an unflurried face laying a trembling hand in his and thus shielded herself from a suspicion could i know that i was wanted he pressed her hand i only know that i wish i had not left your side said sheadding though you must have thought me what if i were a man you members of parliament would call a bore for asking perpetual questions nay an apposite interrogation is the guarantee of a proper interest in the subject said the baronet cornelia was very soon reverted to her intellect is contemplative said adela exhibiting marvellous mental composure she would lose her unerring judgement in active life she cannot weigh things in her mind rapidly she is safe if her course of action is clear sir twickenham reserved his opinion of the truth of this i wonder whether she can forgive those who offend or insult her easily a singular pleasure warmed adelas veins her cheeks kindling she replied giving him her full face no if they are worthy of punishment but and now he watched a downcast profileone must have some forgiveness for fools indeed you speak like charity out of the windows of wisdom said the baronet do you not require in parliament to be tolerant at times adela pursued ho admitted it and to her outcry of oh that noble public life smiled deprecatinglymy dear young lady if you only knew the burden it brings it brings its burden said adela correcting with a most proper instinct another enthusiastic burst at the same time the honour is above the load am i talking too romantically you are at least occupied ninetenths of us to no very good purpose the baronet appended she rejoined if it were but a fraction the good done would survive and be more honourable to do perhaps he ejaculated the consolation should be great and is somehow small said she and they laughed softly at this stage adela was an exceedingly interesting young person in sir twickenhams mental register he tried her on politics and sociology she kept her ears open and followed his lead carefullyventuring here and there to indicate an opinion and suggesting dissent in a pained interrogation finally i confess she said i understand much less than i am willing to think and so i console myself with the thought that after all the drawingroom and thethe kitchenwell an educated female must serve her term there if she would be anything better than a mere ornament even in the highest walks of lifei mean the household is our sphere from that we mount to companionshipif we can amazement of sir twickenham on finding his own thought printed as it were on the air before him by these pretty lips the conversation progressed until adela by chance turned her eyes up a cross pathway and perceived her sister cornelia standing with mr barrett under a beech the man certainly held one of her hands pressed to his heart and her attitude struck a doubt whether his other hand was disengaged or her waist free adela walked nervously on without looking at the baronet she knew by his voice presently that his eyes had also witnessed the sight two in a day she thought what will he imagine us to be the baronet was thinking for your sister exposed you display more agitation than for yourself insulted adela found arabella in so fresh a mood that she was sure good news had been heard it proved that mrs chump had sent a few lines in a letter carried by braintop to this effect my dears all i found your father on his back in bed and he discharged me out of the room and the sight of me put him on his legs and you will soon see him be civil to mr braintop who is a faithful young man of great merit and show your gratitude tomartha chump braintop confirmed the words of the letter and then adela saidyou will do us the favour to stay and amuse yourself here tonight there will be a bed at brookfield what will he do arabella whispered associate with the tinleys returned adela in accordance with the sentiment here half concealed brookfield soon showed that it had risen from the hour of depression when it had simply done its duty arabella formed an oppositioncourt to the one in which she had studied but mr pericles defeated her by constantly sending to her for advice concerning the economies of the feast nevertheless she exhibited good pretensions to social queendom both personal and practical and if freshfield sumner instead of his crisp waspish comments on people and things had seconded her by keeping up a two minutes flow of talk from time to time she might have thought that lady gosstre was only luckier than herselfnot better endowed below the tinleys and their set surrounded mr periclesprompting him as was seen to send up continual messages one to wit is there to be dancing tonight being answered now if you please provoked sarcastic cheering and laura ran up to say how kind of you we appreciate it continue to dispense blessings on poor mortals by the way though freshfield took his line from the calm closed lips of his mistress poor mortals are not in the habit of climbing olympus to ask favours i perceived no barrier quoth laura audacity never does pray how am i to be punished freshfield paused for a potent stroke not like semele she saw the godyou never will while laura was hanging on the horrid edge between a false laugh and a starting blush arabella said that visual excommunication has been pronounced years ago freshfield ah then he hasnt changed his name in heaven laura touched her thus for the familiar use of the gentlemans christian name you must not imagine that very great changes are demanded of those who can be admitted i really find it hotter than below said laura flying arabellas sharp eyes discerned a movement in lady gosstres circle and she at once went over to her and entreated the great lady who set her off so well not to go the sunset fronted besworth lawn the last light of day was danced down to inspiriting music and now arabella sent word for besworth halldoors and windows to be opened and on the company beginning to disperse there beckoned promise of a brilliant suppertable admirable said lady gosstre and the encomium was general among the crowd surrounding arabella for up to this point the feasting had been delicate and something like plain hunger prevailed indeed arabella had heard remarks of a bad nature which she traced to the tinley set and bore with to meet her present reward making light of her triumph she encouraged freshfield to start a witcontest and took part in it herself with the gaiety of an unoccupied mind her sisters had aforetime more than once challenged her supremacy but they bowed to it now and adela especially did when after a ringing hit to freshfield which the tinleys might also take to their own bosoms she said in an undertone what is there between c and surprised by this astonishing vigilance and power of thinking below the surface while she performed above it adela incautiously turned her face toward the meditative baronet and was humiliated by arabellas mute indication of contempt for her coming answer this march across the lawn to the lighted windows of besworth was the culmination of brookfields joy and the crown for which it had striven though for how short a term it was to be worn was little known was it not a very queenly sphere of fine shades and nice feelings that brookfield had realized in arabellas conscience lay a certain reproach of herself for permitting the vice of a lower circle to cling to herviz she had still betrayed a stupid hostility to the tinleys she had rejoiced to see them incapable of mixing with any but their own set and thus be stamped publicly for what they were she had struggled to repress it and yet continually her wits were in revolt against her judgement perhaps one reason was that albert tinley had haunted her steps at an early part of the day and alberta sickening city young man full of insolence and half eyeglass according to freshfieldhad once ventured to propose for her the idea that the tinleys strove to catch at her skirts made arabella spiteful up to the threshold of besworth freshfield mr powys tracy and arabella kept the wheel of a dazzling run of smalltalk throwing intermittent sparks laura tinley would press up apparently to hear but in reality as all who knew her could see with the object of being a rival representative of her sex in this illustrious rare encounter of divine intelligences you are anxious to know said arabella hesitatingly to know dear echoed laura there was i presumed something you did not hear arabella was half ashamed of the rudeness to which her antagonism to lauras vulgarity forced her oh i hear everything laura assured her indeed said arabella by the way who conducts you laura was on edward burleys arm oh will you go tosuch and such an end of the table and if lady gosstre i may beg of you to do me the service to go there also was added aloud and lower but quite audibly mr pericles will have music so there can be no talking this with the soupcon of a demishrug you will not suffer much being implied laura said to herself i am not a fool a moment after arabella was admitting in her own mind as well as fine shades could interpret it that she was on entering the dininghall she beheld two figures seated at the point whither laura was led by her partner these were mrs chump and mr pole with champagne glasses in their hands arabella was pushed on by the inexorable crowd of hungry people behind chapter xxxii despite the pouring in of the flood of guests about the tables mrs chump and mr pole sat apparently unconcerned in their places and as if to show their absolute indifference to observation and opinion went through the ceremony of drinking to one another upon which they nodded and chuckled a suspicious eye had the option of divining that they used the shelter of the table cloth for an interchange of squeezes this would have been further strengthened by mrs chumps arresting exclamation pole company mr pole looked up he recognized lady gosstre and made an attempt in his usual brisk style to salute her mrs champ drew him back nothin but his legs my lady she whispered theres nothin sets m up like champagne my dears she called out to the three of brookfield those ladies were now in the hall gazing as mildly as humanity would allow at their common destiny thus startlingly displayed there was no doubt in the bosom of either one of them that exposure was to follow this prelude mental resignation was not even demanded of themmerely physical they did not seek comfort in an interchange of glances but dropped their eyes and masked their sight as they best could caesar assassinated did a similar thing my dears pursued mrs chump in irish exaggerated by wine ive found m for ye and if yed seen m this afternoonthe little peaky shaky fellow that he was and a doctor too feelin his pulse is ut slow says i doctor and draws a bottle of champagne he could hardly stand before his first glass pon my honr my lady ye naver saw sch a change in a mortal beinpole didnt ye go ha ha now and seem to be nutcracking with your fingers he did and if ye aver saw an astonished doctor why says i doctor ye think uts maguc why wheres the secret drink with m to be sure and you go and do that my lord doctor my dear mr doctor do ut all round and your patients ll bless your feet why isnt cheerful society and champagne the vary best of medicines if onnly the blood ll go of itself a little the faults in his legs hes all right at topif hed smooth his hair a bit checking her tongue mrs chump performed this service lightly for him in the midst of his muttered comments on her irish the fact was manifest to the whole assembly that they had indeed been drinking champagne to some purpose wilfrid stepped up to two of his sisters warning them hurriedly not to go to their father adela he arrested with a look but she burst the restraint to fulfil a childs duty she ran up gracefully and taking her fathers hand murmured a caressing dear papa thereall rightquite rightquite well mr pole repeated glad to see you all go away he tried to look kindly out of the nervous fit into which a word in a significant tone from one of his daughters had instantly plunged him mrs chump admonished her will ye undo all that ive been doin this blessed day glad you havent missed the day altogether sir wilfrid greeted his father in an offhand way ah my boy went the old man returning him what was meant for a bluff nod lady charlotte gave wilfrid an open look it meant if you can act like that and know as much as i know you are worth more than i reckoned he talked evenly and simply and appeared on the surface as composed as any of the guests present nor was he visibly disturbed when mrs chump catching his eye addressed him aloud yed have been more grateful to me to have brought little belloni as well now i know mr wilfrid but i was just obliged to leave her at the hotel for pole cant endure her he bomunates the sight of r if ye aver saw a dog burnt by the fire poles second to m if onnly ye speak that garls name the head of a strange musician belonging to the band stationed outside was thrust through one of the window apertures mr pericles beckoned him imperiously to retire and perform he objected and an altercation in bad english diverted the company it was changed to italian mia figlia seized wilfrids ear mr pericles bellowed allegro two minutes after braintop felt a touch on his shoulder and wilfrid speaking in a tone of friend to friend begged him to go to town by the last train and remove miss belloni to an hotel which he named certainly said braintop but if i meet her father wilfrid summoned champagne for him whereupon mrs chump cried out yere kind to wait upon the young man mr wilfrid and that mr braintops an invaluble young man and what do ye want with the hotel when weve left it mr paricles the greek raised his head from mr pole shrugging at her openly he and wilfrid then measured eyes a moment some champagne togezer said mr pericles with all my heart was the reply and their glasses were filled and they bowed and drank wilfrid took his seat drew forth his pocketbook and while talking affably to lady charlotte beside him and affecting once or twice to ponder over her remarks or to meditate a fitting answer wrote on a slip of paper under the table mine my angel you will see me tomorrow your lover this being inserted in an envelope with zigzag letters of address to form emilias name he contrived to pass to braintops hands and resumed his conversation with lady charlotte who said when there was nothing left to discover but what is it you concoct down there i cried wilfrid lifting his hands and so betraying himself after the fashion of the very innocent she despised any reading of acts not on the surface and nodded to the explanation he gaveto wit by the way do you mean have you noticed my habit of touching my fingers ends as i talk i count them backwards and forwards shows nervousness said lady charlotte you are a boy exceedingly a boy now i put a finger on his vanity said she and thought indeed that she had played on him mr pole lady gosstre addressed that gentleman i must hope that you will leave this dininghall as it is there is nothing in the neighbourhood to match it delightful interposed laura tinley but is it settled mr pole leaned forward to her ladyship and suddenly catching the sense of her words ah why not he said and reached his hand to some champagne which he raised to his mouth but drank nothing of reflection appeared to tell him that his safety lay in drinking and he drained the glass at a gulp mrs chump had it filled immediately and explained to a wondering neighbour its that that keeps m on his legs we shall envy you immensely said laura tinley to arabella who replied i assure you that no decision has been come to ah you want to surprise us with cards on a sudden from besworth that is not the surprise i have in store returned arabella sedately then you have a surprise do tell me how true to her sex is the lady who seeks to turn what it is into what it isnt said freshfield trusty lieutenant i think a little peeping makes surprises sweeter im weak enough to think that lady charlotte threw in that is so true exclaimed laura well and a secret shared is a fact uncommonly well airedthat is also true but remember you do not desire the surprise you are a destroying force to it and freshfield bowed curiosity sighed some one relieving freshfield from a sense of the guilt of heaviness i am a pandora laura smilingly said to whom tracy runningbrooks shout was heard with champagne in the heads of the men and classics in the heads of the women we shall come to something remarked lady gosstre half to herself and georgiana near her an observer of mr pole might have seen that he was fretting at a restriction on his tongue occasionally he would sit forward erect in his chair shake his coatcollar frown and sound a preparatory hem but it ended in his rubbing his hair away on the back of his head mrs chump who was herself perceiving new virtues in champagne with every glass took the movements as indicative of a companion exploration of the spiritual resources of this vintage she no longer called for it but lifted a majestic finger a siddons or tenthmuse finger as freshfield named it behind the row of heads upon which champagne speedily bubbled in the glasses laughter at the performance had fairly set in arabella glanced nervously round for mr pericles who looked at his watch and spread the fingers of one hand open thricean act that telegraphed fifteen minutes in fifteen minutes an opera troupe with three famous chiefs and a renowned primadonna were to arrive the fact was known solely to arabella and mr pericles it was the surprise of the evening but within fifteen minutes what might not happen with heads going at champagnepace arabella proposed to freshfield to rise dont the ladies go first the wit turned sensualist stammered and incurred that worse than frown a cold look of halfcomprehension which reduces indefinitely the proportions of the object gazed at there were probably a dozen very young men in the room waiting to rise with their partners at a signal for dancing and these could not be calculated upon to take an initiative or follow oneas ladies poor slaves will do when the electric hostess rustles the men present were nonconductors arabella knew that she could carry off the women but such a proceeding would leave her father at the mercy of the wine and moreover the probability was that mrs chump would remain by him and sole in a company of males explode her sex with ridicule brookfield in the bargain so arabella under a prophetic sense of evil waited and this came of it mr pole patted mrs chumps hand publicly in spite of the steady hum of smalltalkin spite of freshfield sumners circulation of a crisp anecdotein spite of lady gosstres kind effort to stop him by engaging him in conversation mr pole forced on for a speech he said that he had not been the thing lately it might be his legs as his dear friend martha on his right insisted but he had felt it in his head though as strong as any man present harrk at m cried mrs chump letting her eyes roll fondly away from him into her glass business my lady mr pole resumed ah you dont know what that is weve got to work hard to keep our heads up equal with you we dont swim with corks and my old friend ralph tinleyhe sells iron and has got a mine thats simple but my god maam when a man has his eye on the indian ocean and the atlantic and the baltic and the black sea and halfadozen colonies at once heyou well its a precious big eye hes got pole mrs chump came to his relief he dont know whether hes a ruined dog or a man to hold up his head in any company oh lord pole if yere going to talk of beggary mrs chump threw up her hands my lady i naver could abide the name of t im a kind heart ye know but i cant bear a ragged friend i hate m he seems to give me a pinch having uttered this it struck her that it was of a kind to convulse mrs lupin for whose seizures she could never accurately account and looking round she perceived sure enough that little forlorn body agitated with a handkerchief to her mouth as to besworth mr pole had continued i might buy twenty besworths ifif the cut shows the right card if sweat started on his forehead and he lifted his eyebrows blinking but none he smote the table none can say i havent been a good father ive educated my girls to marry the best the land can show i bought a house to marry them out of it was their own idea he caught arabellas eyes i thought so at all events for why should i have paid the money if i hadnt thought so when thenyes that sum was he choking saved mesaved me a piteous desperate outburst marked the last words that seemed to struggle from a tightened cord not that theres anything the matter he resumed with a very brisk wink im quite sound hearts sound lungs sound stomach regular i can see and smell and hear sense of touch is rather lumpy at times i know but the doctor says its nothingnothing at all and i should be all right if i didnt feel that i was always wearing a great leaden hat my gracious pole if yere not talkin postuv nonsense exclaimed mrs chump well my dear martha mr pole turned to her argumentatively how do you account for my legs i feel it at top i declare ive felt the edge of the brim half a yard out now my lady a man in that statesound and strong as the youngestbut i mean a vexed manworried man bothered man he doesnt want a woman to look after himi mean he doeshe does and why wont young girlsoh they might they mightsee that and when shes no extra expense but brings himhelps him to faceand no one has said the worlds a jolly world so often as i have its jolly he groaned lady charlotte saw wilfrid gazing at one spot on the table without a change of countenance she murmured to him what hits you hits me mr pole had recommenced on the evident instigation of laura tinley though lady gosstre and freshfield sumner had both sought to check the current in chumps lifetime it appeared he mr pole had thought of mrs chump with a respectful ardour and albeit she was no longer what she was when chump brought her over a blooming irish girlher hair exactly as now the black curl half over the cheek and a bright laugh and a white neck fat round arms and a shout of oh pole ye seem to be undressin of me before them all diverted the neighbours of the beauty who would not like such praise laura tinley to keep alive the subject laid herself open to freshfield by a remark at the same personal peril he inquired smoothly mr pericles stood up crying enfin as the doors were flung open and a great signora of operatic fame entered the hall supported on one side by a charming gentleman a tenore who shared her fame and more with her in the rear were two working baritones and behind them outside italian heads might be discerned the names of the queen of song and prince of singers flew round the room and laura uttered words of real gratitude for the delightful surprise to arabella as the latter turned from her welcome of them she is exactly like emiliayoung was uttered the thought went with a pang through wilfrids breast when the signora was asked if she would sup or take champagne and she replied that she would sup byandby and drink porter now the likeness to emilia was established among the poles meantime the unhappy braintop received an indication that he must depart as he left the hall he brushed past the chiefclerk of his office who soon appeared bowing and elbowing among the guests what a substitute for me thought braintop bitterly and in the belief that this old clerk would certainly go back that night and might undertake his commission he lingered near the band on the verge of the lawn a touch at his elbow startled him in the halflight he discerned emilia dont say you have seen me were her first words but when he gave her the letter she drew him aside and read it by the aid of lighted matches held in braintops hat drawing in her fervent breath to a yes yes at the close while she pressed the letter to her throat presently the singing began in an upper room that had shortly before flashed with sudden light braintop entreated emilia to go in and then rejoiced that she had refused they stood in a clear nightair under a yellowing crescent listening to the voice of an imperial woman impressed as he was braintop had nevertheless leisure to look out of his vinous mist and notice with some misgiving a parading light at a certain distance apparently the light of cigarettes being freshly kindled he was too much elated to feel alarm but if her father were to catch me again he thought and with emilia on his arm mr poles chiefclerk had brought discomposing news he was received by an outburst of no business payne i wont have business turning to mr pericles the old clerk said i came rather for you sir not expecting to find mr pole he was told by mr pericles to speak what he had to say and then the guests who had fallen slightly back heard a cavernous murmur and some whose eyes where on mr pole observed a sharp conflict of white and red in his face there there there there went mr pole hem pericles his handkerchief was drawn out and he became engaged as it were in wiping a moisture from the palm of his hand pericles have you got pluck now eh mr pericles had leaned down his ear for the whole of the news ten sossand he said smoothing his waistbands and then inserting his thumbs into the pits of his waistcoat also a chance of forty let us not lose time for ze music he walked away i dont believe in that dd coolness maam said mr pole wheeling round on freshfield sumner its put on that wears a mask hes one of those confounded humbugs who wear a mask tenforty and all for a shrug its not human i tell you he does that just out of a sort of jealousy to rival me as an englishman because im cool he must be do you think a mother doesnt feel the loss of her children i fear that i must grow petticoats before i can answer purely feminine questions said freshfield of courseof course assented mr pole and a man feels like a mother to his money for the moment he doesfor the moment what are those fellowsspartanswomen who cut off their breasts freshfield suggested amazons no they were women mr pole corrected him and if anything hurt them they never cried out thats whathaour friend pericles is trying at hes a fool he wont sleep tonight hell lie till he gets cold in the feet and then tuck them up like a dutch doll and perspire cold till his heart gives a bound and hell jump up and think his last hours come wind on the stomach do ye call it i say its wearing a mask the birdseye of the little merchant shot decisive meaning two young ladies had run from his neighbourhood making as if to lift hands to ears the sight of them brought mrs chump to his side pole pole she said is there annything wrong wrong martha he bent to her attempting irisharrah now and mustnt all be right if youre here she smote his cheek fondly yere not a bit of an irishman ye deer little fella come along and dance cried he imperiously a pretty spectacletwo fandangoes when theres singing ye silly mrs chump led him upstairs chafing one of his hands and remarking loudly on the wonder it was to see his knees constantly give as he walked on the dark lawn pressing wilfrids written words for fiery nourishment to her heart emilia listened to the singing why do people make a noise and not be satisfied to feel she said angrily to braintop as a great clapping of hands followed a divine aria her ideas on this point would have been different in the room by degrees a tender delirium took hold of her sense and then a subtle emotionwhich was partly prompted by dim rivalry with the voice that seemed to be speaking so richly to the man she lovedset her bosom rising and falling she translated it to herself thus what a joy it will be to him to hear me now and in a pause she sang clear out prima ditalia amica and hung on the last note to be sure that she would be heard by him braintop saw the cigarette dash into sparks on the grass at the same moment a snarl of critical vituperation told emilia that she had offended taste and her father he shouted her name and striding up to her stumbled over braintop whom he caught with one hand while the other fell firmly on emilia amicaamicaaa he burlesqued her stress of the luckless note lowing it at her and telling her in triumphant italian that she was found at last braintop after a short struggle and an effort at speech which was loosely shaken in his mouth heard that he stood a prisoner eh you have not lost your cheeks insulted his better acquaintance with english slang alternately in this queer tongue and in italian the pair of victims were addressed emilia knew her fathers temper he had a habit of dallying with an evil passion till it boiled over and possessed him believing braintop to be in danger of harm she beckoned to some of the faces crowding the windows but the movement was not seen as none of the circumstances were at all understood wilfrid however knew well who had sung those three bars concerning which the prima donna questioned mr pericles and would not be put off by hearing that it was a startled jackdaw or an owl and an ole nightingale the greek rubbed his hands now to recommence he said and we shall not notice a jackdaw again his eye went sideways watchfully at wilfrid you like zat piece of opera immensely said wilfrid half bowing to the signorato whom as to majesty mr pericles introduced him and fixed him now to seats mr pericles mandates was being obeyed when a cry of wilfrid from emilia below raised a flutter mr pole had been dozing in his chair he rose at the cry looking hard with a mechanical jerk of the neck at two or three successive faces and calling somebodysomebody to take his outstretched hand trembling in a paroxysm of nervous terror hearing his sons name again but more faintly he raised his voice for martha dont let that girl come near me ii cant get on with foreign girls his eyes went among the curious faces surrounding him wilfrid he shouted to the second summons sir was replied in the silence neither saw the other as they spoke are you going out to her wilfrid someone called me sir hes got the cunning of hell said mr pole baffled by his own agitation oh dont talk o that place moaned mrs chump stop cried the old man are you going stop you shant do mischief i meantherestop dont go youre not to go i say youre not to go out emphasis and gesticulations gave their weight to the plain words but rage at the upset of all sentiments and dignity that day made wilfrid reckless and he now felt his love to be all he had he heard his emilia being dragged away to miseryperhaps to be sold to shame maddened he was incapable of understanding his fathers state or caring for what the world thought his sisters gathered near him but were voiceless is he gone mr pole burst forward youre gone sir wilfrid have you gone to that girl i ask you whethertheres one shot at my heart he added in a swift undertone to one of the heads near him while he caught at his breast with both hands wilfrid will you stay here for gods sake go to him wilfrid murmured adela i cant because if you doif you donti mean if you go the old man gasped at the undertone now i have got it in my throat a quick physical fear caught hold of him in a moment his voice changed to entreaty i beg you wont go my dear boy wilfrid i tell you dont go because you wouldnt act like a ddim not angry but it is like acting like aheres company wilfrid come to me my boy do come here you maynt hahave your poor old father long now hes got you uup in the world i mean accidents for im sound enough only a little nervous from brainis he gone wilfrid was then leaving the room lady gosstre had been speaking to mr powys she was about to say a word to lady charlotte when the latter walked to the doorway and in a manner that smote his heart with a spasm of gratitude said dont heed these people he will bring on a fit if you dont stop his nerves are out and the wine they have given him go to him i will go to emilia and do as much for her as you could wilfrid reached his father in time to see him stagger back into the arms of mrs chump whose supplication was for the female stimulant known as something chapter xxxiii on reaching home that night arabella surprised herself thinking in the midst of her anguish whatever is said of us it cannot be said that there is a house where the servants have been better cared for and this reflection continued to burn with an astounding brilliancy through all the revolutions of a mind contemplating the dread of a fallen fortune the fact of a public exposure and what was to her an ambition destroyed adela had no such thoughts i have been walking on a plank she gasped from time to time as she gave startled glances into the abyss of poverty and hurried to her bedchambera faint whisper of selfcondemnation in her ears at the i being foremost the sisters were too proud to touch upon one anothers misery in complaints or to be common by holding debate on it they had not once let their eyes meet at besworth as the tinleys wonderingly noticed they said good night to their papa who was well enough to reply adding peremptorily downstairs at halfpast eightan intimation that he would be at the breakfast table and read prayers as usual inexperienced in nervous disease they were now filled with the idea that he was possibly acting a notion that had never been kindled in them before or otherwise how came these rapid almost instantaneous recoveries cornelia alone sounded near the keynote since the night that she had met him in the passage and the next morning when mrs chump had raised the hubbub about her loss cornelias thoughts had been troubled by some haunting spectral relationship with money it had helped to make her reckless in granting interviews to purcell barrett if we are poor i am free and that she might then give herself to whomever she pleased was her logical deduction the exposure at besworth and the partial confirmation of her suspicions were not without their secret comfort to her in the carriage coming home wilfrid had touched her hand by chance and pressed it with good heart she went to the library imagining that if he wished to see her he would appear and by exposing his own weakness learn to excuse hers she was right in her guess wilfrid came he came sauntering into the room with ah you here cornelia consented to play into his hypocrisy yes i generally think better here she replied and what has this pretty head got to do with thinking not much i suppose my lord she replied affecting nobly to acknowledge the weakness of the female creature wilfrid kissed her with an unaccustomed fervour this delicate mumming was to his taste it was yet more so when she spoke playfully to him of his going soon to be a married man he could answer to that in a smiling negative playing round the question until she perceived that he really desired to have his feeling for the odd dark girl who had recently shot across their horizon touched if only it were led to by the muffled ways of innuendo as a dog that cannot ask you verbally to scratch his head but wishes it will again and again thrust his head into your hand petitioning mutely that affection may divine him sobut we deal with a sentimentalist and the simile is too gross to be exact for no sooner was wilfrids head scratched than the operation stuck him as humiliating in other words the moment he felt his sisters fingers in the ticklish part he flew to another theme then returned and so backward and forwardmystifying her not slightly and making her think then he has no heart she by no means intended to encourage love for emilia but she hoped for his sake that the sentiment he had indulged was sincere byandby he said that though he had no particular affection for lady charlotte he should probably marry her without loving her wilfrid it is unfair to her it is unfair to yourself wilfrid understood perfectly who it was for whom she pleaded thus vehemently he let her continue and when she had dwelt on the horrors of marriages without love and the supreme duty of espousing one who has our hearts loyalty he said you may be right a man must not play with a girl he must consider that he owes a duty to one who is more dependentimplying that a woman s duty was distinct and different in such a case cornelia could not rise and plead for her sex had she pushed forth the woman she must have stood for her this is the game of fine shades and nice feelings under whose empire you see this family and from which they are to emerge considerably shorn but purifiedexamples of one present passage of our civilization at least dear if cornelia desperately breathed the name if emilia were forced to give her handlovingyouwe should be right in pitying her the snare was almost too palpable wilfrid fell into it from the simple passion that the name inspired and now his hand tightened poor child he moaned she praised his kind heart you cannot be unjust and harsh i know that you could not see hermeany of us miserable women feel dear ah i need not tell you that their tears are not the witnesses when they do not weep but the hot drops stream inwardlyand oh wilfrid let this never happen to me i shall not disgrace you because i intend to see you happy withwith her whoever she is and i would leave you happy but i should not survive it i can look on death a marriage without love is dishonour sentiment enjoys its splendid moods wilfrid having had the figure of his beloved given to him under nuptial benediction cloaked even as he wished it to be could afford now to commiserate his sister and he admired her at the same time ill take care you are not made a sacrifice of when the event is fixed he saidas if it had never been in contemplation oh i have not known happiness for years till this hour cornelia whispered to him bashfully and set him wondering why she should be happy when she had nothing but his sanction to reject a man on the other hand her problem was to gain lost ground by letting him know that of the pair it was not she who would marry beneath her station she tried it mentally in various ways in the end she thought it best to give him this positive assurance no he rejoined a woman never should there was no admission of equality to be got out of him so she kissed him of their fathers health a few words were saidof emilia nothing further she saw that wilfrids mind was resolved upon some part to play but shrank from asking his confidence lest facts should be laid bare at the breakfasttable mr pole was a little late he wore some of his false air of briskness on a hazy face and read prayersdrawing breath between each sentence and rubbing his forehead but the work was done by a man in ordinary health if you chose to think so as mrs chump did she made favourable remarks on his appearance begging the ladies to corroborate her they were silent now take a chop pole and show your appetite she said a chump chop my love my little man used to invite me of a mornin and that was the onnly joke he had so its worth rememberin a chop was placed before mr pole he turned it in his plate and wonderingly called to mind that he had once enjoyed chops at a loss to account for the distressing change he exclaimed to himself chump i wish the woman wouldnt thrust her husband between ones teeth an egg the chop was displaced for an egg which he tapped until mrs chump cried out oh if yere not like a postman pole and dye think yeve got a letter for a chick inside there this allusion scared mr pole from the egg he quitted the table muttering business business and went to the library when he was gone mrs chump gave a cry to know where braintop was but forgetting him immediately turned to the ladies and ejaculated brothm its just brothin he wants broth i say for anny man that wont eat his chop or his egg and my dears now what do ye say to me for bringing him home to ye i expect to be thanked i do and then well broth pole together till hes lusty as a prizeox and capers like a monkey wretched woman that could not see the ruin she had inflictedthat could not imagine how her bitter breath cut against those sensitive skins during a short pause little mrs lupin trotted to the door and shot through it in a paroxysm then wilfrids voice was heard he leaned against a corner of the window and spoke without directly looking at mrs chump so that she was some time in getting to understand the preliminary madam you must leave this house but presently her chin dropped and after feeble efforts to interpose an exclamation she sat quietovercome by the deliberate gravity of his manner and motioning despairingly with her head to relieve the swarm of unborn figureless ideas suggested by his passing speech the ladies were ranged like tribunal shapes it could not be said of souls so afflicted that they felt pleasure in the scene but to assist in the administration of a rigorous justice is sweet to them that are smarting they scarcely approved his naked statement of things when he came to mrs chumps particular aspiration in the householdviz to take a station and the dignity of their name the effect he produced satisfied them that the measure was correct her back gave a sharp bend as if an eternal support had snapped oh ye hit hard she moaned i tell you kindly that we who you will acknowledge must count for something here do not sanction any change that revolutionizes our domestic relations said wilfrid while mrs chump heaved and rolled on the swell of the big words like an overladen boat you have only to understand so much and thisthat if we resist it as we do you by continuing to contemplate it are provoking a contest which will probably injure neither you nor me but will be death to ham in his present condition mrs chump was heard to mumble that she alone knew the secret of restoring him to health and that he was rendered peaky and poky only by people supposing him so an astonishin thing she burst out if i kiss m and say poor pole hes poor pole on the spot and if onnly i but wilfrids stern voice flowed over her listen madam and let this be finished between us you know well that when a man has children he may wish to call another woman wifea woman not their mother but the main question is will his children consent to let her take that place we are of one mind and will allow no oneno oneto assume that position and now theres an end well talk like friends i have only spoken in that tone that you might clearly comprehend me on an important point i know you entertain a true regard for my father and it is that belief which makes me friends cried mrs chump getting courage from the savour of cajolery in these words friends oh ye fox ye fox and now commenced a curious duett wilfrid merely wished to terminate his sentence mrs chump wantonly sought to prevent him each was burdened with serious matter but they might have struck hands here had not this petty accidental opposition interposed makes me feel confident wilfrid resumed and poles promos mr wilfrud yere forgettin that confident maam he was the firrst to be soft i say maam for his sake an its for his sake and weak as he is on s legs poor fells which marrge ll cure bein a certain remdy mrs chump i beg you to listen mr wilfrud and i can see too and its three weeks and ye kissed little belloni in the passage outside this vary door and out in the garden the blow was entirely unexpected and took wilfrids breath so that he was not ready for his turn in this singular piece of harmony ye did mrs chump rejoiced to behold how her chance spark kindled flame in his cheeks its postuv ye did and yere the best blusher of the two my dear and no shame to ye though it is a garls business that little belloni takes to t like milk but you wilfrid strode up to her saying imperiously i tell you to listen she succumbed at once to a show of physical ascendency murmuring its sure he was seen kissin of her twice and mayhap more and hearty smacks of the lips toolikin it the ladies rewarded wilfrid for his service to their cause by absolutely hearing nothinga feat women can be capable of wilfrid however was angered by the absurdity of the charge and the scene and also by the profane touch on emilias name i must tell you maam that for my fathers sake i must desire you to quit thisyou will see the advisability of quitting this house for a time poles promus poles promus mrs chump wailed again will you give me your assurance now that you will go to be our guest again subsequently in writin and in words mr wilfrud answer me maam i will mr wilfrud and mr braintops a witness knowin the nature of an oath there naver was a more sacrud promus says pole martha wilfrid changed his tactics sitting down by her side he said i am sure you have an affection for my father im the most lovin woman my dear if it wasnt for my vartue i dont know whatd become o me ye could ask chump if he wasnt in his grave poor fella ill be cryin like a squeezed orrnge presently what with chump and pole twos too many for a melanchly woman you have an affection for my father i know maam now see hes ill if you press him to do what we certainly resist you endanger his life mrs chump started back from the man who bewildered her brain without stifling her sense of justice she knew that there was another way of putting the case whereby she was not stuck in the criminal box but the knowledge groped about blindly and finding herself there mrs chump lost all idea of a counteraccusation and resorted to wriggling and cajolery ah ye look sweeter when yere kissin us mr wilfrud and i wonder where the little belloni has got to tell me that there maybe no misunderstanding wilfrid again tried to fix her a rosy rosy fresh bit of a mouth shes got and pouts ut wilfrid took her hand answer me deed and im modust mr wilfrud you do him the honour to be very fond of him i am to believe that then you must consent to leave us at the end of a week you abandon any idea of an impossible ceremony and of us you make friends and not enemies at the concluding word mrs chump was no longer sustained by her excursive fancy she broke down and wrung her hands crying enmies poles children my enmies oh lord that i should live to hear ut and pole that knew me a bride first blushin she wailed and wept so that the ladies exchanged compassionate looks and arabella rose to press her hand and diminish her distress wilfrid saw that his work would be undone in a moment and waved her to her seat the action was perceived by mrs chump oh mr wilfrud my dear and a soldier and you that was my favourut if half my ffection for pole wasnt the seein of you so big and handsome and all my ideas to get ye marrud avery one so snug in a corner with a neat little lawful ring on your fingers and you that go to keep me a lone woman frightened of the darrk im an awful coward thats the truth and ye know that marrge is a holy thing and its such a beautful cermony oh mr wilfrudlieutent y are and id have bought ye a captain and made the hearts o your sisters jump with bonnuts and gowns and jools oh pole pole why did you keep me so short o cash its been the roon of me what did i care for your brooches and your gifts i wanted the good will of your daughters sir your son pole mrs chump stopped her flow of tears dear hearts she addressed her silent judges in mysterious guttural tones is it becas ye think theres a bit of a fear of the ladies repressed a violent inclination to huddle together like cattle from the blowing east i assure ye taint possble pursued mrs chump why do i gree to marry pole just this now we sit chirpin and chatterin of times thats gone and live twice over pole and myself and im used to m and i was soft to m when he was a merry buck and you cradle lumber in ideas mind for my vartue was always unmpeachble thats just the reason so come and lets all be friends with money in our pockuts yell find me as much of a garl as army of ye and there my weak times after my porrt my dears so now ye know when i cant be refusin a thing to ye are we friendssay are we even if the ladies had been disposed to pardon her vulgarity they could not by any effort summon a charitable sentiment toward one of their sex who degraded it by a public petition for a husband this was not to be excused and moreover they entertained the sentimentalists abhorrence of the second marriage of a woman regarding the act as simply execrable being treason to the ideal of the sextreason to womans puritytreason to the mysterious sentiment which places woman so high that when a woman slips there is no help for it but she must be smashed seeing that each looked as implacable as the other mrs chump called plaintively arrbella the lady spoke we are willing to be your friends mrs chump and we request that you will consider us in that light we simply do not consent to give you a name but well do without the name my dear interposed mrs chump yell call me plain martha which is almost mother and not a bit of t therecornelia my love what do ye say i can only reiterate my sisters words which demand no elucidation replied cornelia the forlorn woman turned her lap towards the youngest adla ye sweet little cajoler and dont use great cartwheels o words that leave a body crushed adela was suffering from a tendency to levity which she knew to be unbefitting the occasion and likely to defeat its significance she said i am sure mrs chump we are very much attached to you as mrs chump but after a certain period of life marriage does make people ridiculous and as much for your sake as our own we would advise you to discard a notion that cannot benefit anybody believe in our attachment and we shall see you here now and then and correspond with you when you are away and oh ye puss such an eel as y are mrs chump cried out what are ye doin but sugarin the same dose miss be qut its a traitor that makes whats nasty taste agreeble dye think my stomachs a fool ye may wheedle the mouth but not the stomach at this offence there fell a dead silence wilfrid gazed on them all indifferently waiting for the moment to strike a final blow when she had grasped the fact that pity did not sit in the assembly mrs chump rose oh if i havent been sitting among three owls and a raven she exclaimed then she fussed at her gown i wish ye good day young ladus and mayhap yed like to be interduced to no yourselves some fine mornin provdence can wait theres a patient hen on the eggs of all of ye i wouldnt marry pole nownot if he was to fall flat and howl for me mr wilfrud i wish ye goodbye yeve done your work ill be out of this house in halfanhour this was not quite what wilfrid had meant to effect he proposed to her that she should come to the yacht and indeed leave brookfield to go on board but mrs chump was in that frame of mind when shamefully wounded by others we find our comfort in wilfully wounding ourselves no she said betraying a meagre mollification at every offer ill not stop i wont go to the yachtunless i think better of ut but i wont stop yeve hurrt me and ill say goodbye i hope yell none of ye be widows its a crool thing and when yeve got no children of your own and feel all your inside risin to another persons and they hate ye hate ye oh ohthere mr wilfrud ye neednt touch me elbow oh dear look at me in the glass and my hair annybodyd swear id been drinkin i wont let pole look at me thatd cure m and he must let me have money because i dont care for cumulations not now when theres no youngno garls and a precious boy whod say when im gone bless her oh poor thing bless oh augh a note of sorrows own was fetched and the next instant with a figure of dignity the afflicted woman observed theres seven bottles of my porrt and theres eleven of champagne and some comut clart i shall write where uts to be sent and if you please look to the packing for bits o glass and a red stains not like your precious hope when youre undoin a hamper and thats just myself now and im a broken woman but naver mind nobody a very formal and stiff goodbye succeeding a wheezy lamentation concluded the speech casting a look at the glass mrs chump retired with her fingers on the ornamental piece of hair the door having closed on her wilfrid said to his sisters i want one of you to come with me to town immediately decide which will go his eyes questioned cornelia hers were dropped i have work to do pleaded adela an appointment you will break it no dear not not exactly an appointment then theres nothing to break put on your bonnet adela slipped from the room in a spirit of miserable obedience i could not possibly leave papa said arabella and wilfrid nodded his head his sisters knew quite well what was his business in town but they felt that they were at his mercy and dared not remonstrate cornelia ventured to say i think she should not come back to us till papa is in a better state perhaps not replied wilfrid careless how much he betrayed by his apprehension of the person indicated the two returned late that night and were met by arabella at the gate papa has beendont be alarmed she began he is better now but when he heard that she was not in the house the blood left his hands and feet i have had to use a falsehood i said she left word that she was coming back tonight or tomorrow then he became simply angry who could have believed that the sight of him so would ever have rejoiced me adela worn with fatigue sobbed oh oh by the way sir twickenham called and wished to see you said arabella curiously oh so weary the fair girl ejaculated halfdreaming that she saw herself as she threw back her head and gazed at stars and clouds we met captain gambier in town here she pinched arabellas arm the latter said where in a miserable street where he looked like a peacock in a quagmire arabella entreated wilfrid to be careful in his management of their father pray do not thwart him he has been anxious to know where you have gone hehe thinks you have conducted mrs chump and will bring her back i did not say iti merely let him think so she added presently he has spoken of money yes went adela in a low breath cornelia imagines thatthat wehe is perhaps inin want of it merchants are sometimes did sir twickenham say he would call tomorrow asked adela he said that most probably he would wilfrid had been silent as he entered the house mr poles bedroom bell rang and word came that he was to go to his father as soon as the sisters were alone adela groaned we have been hunting that girl all day in vile neighbourhoods wilfrid has not spoken more than a dozen sentences i have had to dine on buns and hideous soup i am halfdead with the smell of cabs oh if ever i am poor it will kill me that damp hay and close musty life are too intolerable yes you see i care for what i eat i seem to be growing an animal and wilfrid is going to drag me over the same course tomorrow if you dont prevent him i would not mind only it is absolutely necessary that i should see sir twickenham she gave a reason why which appeared to arabella so cogent that she said at once if cornelia does not take your place i will the kiss of thanks given by adela was accompanied by a request for tea arabella regretted that she had sent the servants to bed to bed cried her sister but they are the masters not we really if life were a round of sensual pleasure i think our servants might congratulate themselves arabella affected to show that they had their troubles but her statement made it clear that the servants of brookfield were peculiarly favoured servants as it was their mistresss pride to make them eventually adela consented to drink some sparkling light wine and being thirsty she drank eagerly and her tongue was loosed insomuch that she talked of things as one who had never been a blessed inhabitant of the kingdom of fine shades she spoke of cornelias chances of wilfrids headstrong infatuationor worse and of papas position remarking that she could both laugh and cry arabella glad to see her refreshed was pained by her rampant tone and when adela who had fallen into one of her reflective longshot moods chanced to say what a number of different beings there are in the world her reply was i was just then thinking we are all less unlike than we suppose oh my goodness cried adela what am i at allat allin the remotest degreelike that creature we have got rid of the negative was not decisively enunciated or immediate that is it did not come with the vehemence and volume that could alone have satisfied adelas expectation the we are all of one family was an offensive truism of which adela might justly complain that night the ladies received their orders from wilfridthey were to express no alarm before their father as to the state of his health or to treat him ostensibly as an invalid they were to marvel publicly at mrs chumps continued absence and a letter requesting her to return was to be written at the sign of an expostulation wilfrid smote them down by saying that the old mans life hung on a thread and it was for them to cut it or not etext editors bookmarks a marriage without love is dishonour bear in mind that we are sentimentaliststhe eye is our servant i am not ashamed
