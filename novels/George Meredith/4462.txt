note there is a short list of bookmarks or pointers at the end of the file for those who may wish to sample the authors ideas before making an entire meal of them dw the tragic comedians a study in a wellknown story by george meredith book chapter vii he was down on the plains to her the second day and as usual when they met it was as if they had not parted his animation made it seem so he was like summers morning sunlight his warmth striking instantly through her blood dispersed any hesitating strangeness that sometimes gathers during absences caused by girlish dread of a step to take or shame at the step taken when coldish gentlemen rather create these backflowings and gaps in the feelings she had grown reconciled to the perturbation of his messages and would have preferred to have him startling and thrilling her from a distance but seeing him she welcomed him and feeling in his bright presence not the faintest chill of the fit of shyness she took her bravery of heart for a sign that she had reached his level and might own it by speaking of the practical measures to lead to their union on one subject sure to be raised against him by her parents she had a right to be inquisitive the baroness she asked to see a photograph of her alvan gave her one out of his pocketbook and watched her eyelids in profile as she perused those features of the budless grey woman the eyelids in such scrutinies reveal the critical mind clotildes drooped till they almost closed upon their lashesdeadly criticism think of her age said alvan colouring he named a grandmaternal date for the year of the baronesss birth her eyebrows now stood up her contemplation of those disenchanting lineaments came to an abrupt finish she returned the square card to him slowly shaking her head still eyeing earth as her hand stretched forth the card laterally he could not contest the woeful verdict twenty years back he murmured writhing the baroness was a woman fair to see in the days twenty years back though clotilde might think it incredible she really was once clotilde resumed her doleful shaking of the head she sighed he shrugged she looked at him and he blinked a little for the first time since they had come together she had a clear advantage and as it was likely to be a rare occasion she did not let it slip she sighed again he was wounded by her underestimate of his ancient conquest yesnow he said impatiently i cannot feel jealousy i cannot feel rivalry said she sad of voice the humour of her tranced eyes in the shaking head provoked him to defend the baroness for her goodness of heart her energy of brain clotilde tolled her naughty head but it is a strong face she said a strong facea strong jaw by lavater you were youngand daringly adventurous she was captivating in her distress now she is oldand you are friends friends yes alvan replied and praised the girl as of course she deserved to be praised for her open mind we are friends he said dropping a deepchested breath the title this girl scornfully supplied was balm to the vanity she had stung and his burnt skin was too eager for a covering of any sort to examine the mood of the giver she had positively humbled him so far as with a single word to relieve him for he had seen bristling chapters in her look at the photograph yet for all the natural sensitiveness of the mans vanity he did not seek to bury the subject at the cost of a misconception injurious in the slightest degree to the sentiments he entertained toward the older lady as well as the younger friends you are right good friends only you should know that it is just a littlea trifle different the fact is i cannot kill the past and i would not it would try me sharply to break the tie connecting us were it possible to break it i am bound to her by gratitude she is old now and were she twice that age i should retain my feeling for her you raise your eyes clotilde well when i was much younger i found this lady in desperate illfortune and she honoured me with her confidence young man though i was i defended her i stopped at no measure to defend her against a powerful husband rememberthe most unscrupulous of foes who sought to rob her of every right she possessed and what i did then i again would do i was vowed to her interests to protect a woman shamefully wronged i did not stick at trifles as you know you have read my speech in defence of myself before the court by my interpretation of the case i was justified but i estranged my family and made the world my enemy i gave my time and money besides the forfeit of reputation to the case and reasonably there was an arrangement to repay me out of the estate reserved for her so that the baroness should not be under the degradation of feeling herself indebted you will not think that out of the way men of the world do not as for matters of the heart between us were as far apart as the poles he spoke hurriedly he had said all that could be expected of him they were in a wood walking through lines of spruce firs of deep golden green in the yellow beams one of these trees among its wellrobed fellows fronting them was all lichensmitten from the low sweeping branches touching earth to the plumed top the tree was deadblack as its shadow a vision of blackness i will compose a beautiful dutiful modest oddest beseeching screeching mildish childish epistle to her and you shall read it and if you approve it we shall despatch it said clotilde there speaks my goldcrested serpent at her wisest replied alvan and now for my visit to your family i follow you in a day en avant contre les canons a run to lake leman brings us to them in the afternoon i shall see you in the evening so our separation wont be for long this time all the auspices are good we shall not be rich nor poor clotilde reminded him that a portion of money would be brought to the store by her we dont count it said he not rich certainly and you will not expect me to make money by my pen above all things i detest the writing for money fiction and verse appeal to a besotted public that judges of the merit of the work by the standard of its taste avaunt and journalism for money is egyptian bondage no slavery is comparable to the chains of hired journalism my pen is my fountainthe key of me and i give my self i do not sell i write when i have matter in me and in the direction it presses for otherwise not one word i would never ask you to sell yourself said clotilde i would rather be in want of common comforts he squeezed her wrist they were again in front of the blackdraped blighted tree it was the sole tree of the host clad thus in scurf bearing a semblance of livid metal they looked at it as having seen it before and passed on but the wife of sigismund alvan will not be poor in renown he resumed radiating his full bloom on her my highest ambition is to be sigismund alvans wife she exclaimed to hear her was as good as wine and his heart came out on a genial chuckle ay the choice you have made is not by heaven so bad sigismund alvans wife shall take the foremost place of all look at me he lifted his head to the highest on his shoulders widening his eagle eyes he was now thoroughly restored and in his own upper element expansive after the humiliating contraction of his mans vanity under the glances of a girl do you take me for one who could be content with the part of second i will work and do battle unceasingly but i will have too the prize of battle to clasp it savour it richly i was not fashioned to be the lean meek martyr of a cause not i i carry too decisive a weight in the balance to victory i have a taste for fruits my fairest and republics my bright lutetia can give you splendid honours he helped her to realize this with the assuring splendour of his eyes bride of the elect of the people is not that as glorious a title think you as queen of an hereditary sovereign mumbling of gods grace on his wormeaten throne i win that seat by service by the dedication of this brain to the peoples interests they have been ground to the dust and i lift them as i did a persecuted lady in my boyhood i am the soldier of justice against the army of the unjust but i claim my reward if i live to fight i live also to enjoy i will have my station i win it not only because i serve but because also i have seen have seen ahead seen where all is dark read the unwritten because i am soldier and prophet the brain of man is joves eagle and his lightning on earththe title to majesty henceforth ah my fairest entering the city beside me and the people shouting around she would not think her choice a bad one clotilde made sign and gave some earnest on his arm of ecstatic hugging we may have hard battles grim deceptions to go through before that day comes he continued after a while the day is coming but we must wait for it work on i have the secret of how to head the peopleto put a head to their movement and make it irresistible as i believe it will be beneficent i set them moving on the lines of the law of things i am no empty theorizer no phantasmal speculator i am the man of science in politics when my system is grasped by the people there is but a step to the realization of it one step it will be taken in my time or acknowledged later i stand for index to the people of the path they should take to triumphmust take as triumph they must sooner or later not by the route of what is called progresspooh that is a middle class invention to effect a compromise with the people the matter rests with their intelligence meanwhile my star is bright and shines reflected i notice she said favouring him with as much reflection as a splendid lover could crave for that you never look down you never look on the ground but always either up or straight before you people have remarked it said he smiling here we are at this funereal tree again all roads lead to rome and ours appears to conduct us perpetually to this tree it s the only dead one here he sighted the plumed black top and along the swelling branches decorously clothed in decay a salted ebon moss when seen closely the small grey particles giving a sick shimmer to the darkness of the mass it was very witchlike of a witch in her incantationsmoke not a single bare spot but dead dead as any peeled and fallen said alvan fingering a tuft of the sooty snakelichen this is a tree for a melancholy poeteh clotildefor him to come on it by moonlight after a scene with his mistress or tales of her by the way and by the way my fair darling let me never think of your wearing this kind of garb for me should i be ordered off the first to join the dusky army below women who put on their dead husbands in public are not wellmannered women though they may be excellent professional widows excellent he snapped the lichendust from his fingers observing that he was not sure the contrast of the flourishing and blighted was not more impressive in sunlight and then he looked from the tree to his true loves hair the tree at a little distance seemed run over with sunless lizards her locks were golden serpents shall i soon see your baroness clotilde asked him not in advance of the ceremony he answered in good time you understandan old friend making room for a new one and that one young and beautiful with golden tresses at first but her heart is quite sound have no fear i guarantee it i know her to the roots she desires my welfare she does my behests if i am bound to her by gratitude so and in a greater degree is she to me the utmost she will demand is that my bride shall be worthy of mea good mate for me in the fight to come and i have tested my bride and found her half my heart therefore she passes the examination with the baroness they left the tree behind them we will take good care not to return this way again said alvan without looking back that tree belongs to a plantation of the under world its fellows grow in the wood across acheron and that tree has looked into the ghastliness of the flood and seen itself hecate and hermes know about it phoebus cannot light it that tree stands for death blooming we think it sinister but down there it is a homely tree down there when do we go the shudder in that tree is the air exchanging between life and deaththe ghosts going and coming its on the border line i just felt the creep i think you did the reason isthere is always a material reasonthat you were warm and a bit of chill breeze took you as you gazed while for my part i was imagining at that very moment what of all possible causes might separate us and i acknowledged that death could do the trick but death my love is far from us two does she look as grimmish as she does in the photograph said clotilde who the baroness alvan laughed the baroness was not so easily defended from a girl as from her husband it appeared she is the best of comrades best of friends she has her faults may not relish the writ announcing her final deposition but be you true to me and as true as she has unfailingly been to me she will be to you that i can promise my poor lucie she is winter if you will it is not the winter of the steppes you may compare her to winter in a noble country a fine landscape of winter the outlines of her face she has a great brain how much i owe that woman for instruction you meet now and then men who have the woman in them without being womanized they are the pick of men and the choicest women are those who yield not a feather of their womanliness for some amount of manlike strength and she is one mans brain womans heart i thought her unique till i heard of you and how do i stand between you two she has the only fault you can charge me with she is before me in time as i am before you shall i spoil you as she spoilt me no no obedience to a boy is the recognition of the heirapparent and i respect the salique law as much as i love my love i do not offer obedience to a girl but succour support you will not rule me but you will invigorate and if you are petted you shall not be spoilt do not expect me to show like that undertakerly tree till my years are one hundred even then it will be dangerous to repose beneath my branches in the belief that i am sapless because i have changed colour we jews have a lusty blood we are strong of the earth we serve you but you must minister to us sensual we have truly excellent appetites and why not heroical too soldiers poets musicians the gentiles masters in mental arithmetic keenest of weapons surpassing him in common sense and capacity for brotherhood ay and in charity or what stores of vengeance should we not have nourished already we have the moneybags soon we shall hold the chief offices and when the popular election is as unimpeded as the coursing of the blood in a healthy body the jew shall be foremost and topmost for he is preeminently by comparison the brain of these latter day communities but that is only my answer to the brutish contempt of the jew i am no champion of a race i am for the world for man clotilde remarked that he had many friends all men of eminence and a large following among the people he assented yes tresten retka kehlen the nizzian yes if i were other than for legalityif it came to a rising i could tell off able lieutenants tell me of your interview with ironsides she said proudly and fondly would this ambitious little head know everything said alvan putting his lips among the locks well we met he requested it we agreed that we were on neutral ground for the moment that he might ultimately have to decapitate me or i to banish him but temporarily we could compare our plans for governing he showed me his hand i showed him mine we played openhanded like two at whist he did not doubt my honesty and i astonished him by taking him quite in earnest he has dealt with diplomatists who imagine nothing but shuffling the old ironer i love him for his love of common sense his contempt of mean deceit he will outwit you but his dexterity is a giantsa simple evolution rapidly performed and nothing so much perplexes pygmies then he has them bagsful of them the world will see and see giant meet giant i suspect he and i proposed each of us in the mildest manner contrary schemesschemes to stiffen the hair of europe enough that we parted with mutual respect he is a fine fellow and so was my friend the emperor tiberius and so was richelieu napoleon was a fine enginethere is a difference yes ironsides is a fine fellow but he and i may cross his ideas are not many the point to remember is that he is iron on them he can drive them hard into the density of the globe he has quick nerves and imagination he can conjure up penetrate and traverse complicationsan enemys plans all that the enemy will be able to combine and the likeliest that he will do good we opine that we are equal to the same he is for kingcraft to mask his viziercraftand save him the labour of patiently attempting oratory and persuasion which accomplishment he does not possessit is not in iron we think the more precious metal will beat him when the broader conflict comes but such an adversary is not to be underrated i do not underrate him and certainly not he me had he been born with the gifts of patience and a fluent tongue and not a petty noble he might have been for the people as knowing them the greater power he sees that their knowledge of their power must eventually come to them in the meantime his party is forcible enough to assure him he is not fighting a losing game at present and he is no doubt by lineage and his traditions monarchical he is curiously simple not really cynical his apparent cynicism is sheer irritability his contemptuous phrases are directed against obstacles against things persons nations that oppose him or cannot serve his turn against his king if his king is restive but he respects his king against your friends country because there is no fixing it to a line of policy and it seems to have collapsed but he likes that country the best in europe after his own he is nearest to contempt in his treatment of his dupes and tools who are dropped out of his mind when he has quite squeezed them for his occasion to be taken up again when they are of use to him hence he will have no following but let me die tomorrow the party i have created survives in him you see the dam in me the stream judge then which of them gains the future admitting that in the present he may beat me he is a prussian stoutly defined from a german and yet again a german stoutly defined from our borderers and that completes him he has as little the idea of humanity as the sword of our hermann the cannonball of our frederick observe him what an eye he has i watched it as we were talking and he has i repeat imagination he can project his mind in front of him as far as his reasoning on the possible allows and that eye of his flashes and not only flashes you see it hurling a bolt it gives me the picture of a balearic slinger about to whizz the stone for that eye looks far and is hard and is dead certain of its markwithin his practical compass as i have said i see farther and i fancy i proved to him that i am not a dreamer in my opinion when we cross our swords i stand a fair chance of not being worsted we shall you shrink figuratively my darling have no fear combative as we may be both of us we are now grave seniors we have serious business a party looks to him my party looks to me never need you fear that i shall be at sword or pistol with any one i will challenge my man whoever he as that needs a lesson to touch buttons on a waistcoat with the button on the foil or drill fiver and eights in cards at twenty paces but i will not fight him though he offend me for i am stronger than my temper and as i do not want to take his nip of life and judge it to be of less value than mine the imperilling of either is an absurdity oh because i know you are incapable of craven fear cried clotilde answering aloud the question within herself of why she so much admired why she so fondly loved him to feel his courage backing his high good sense was to repose in security and her knowledge that an astute self control was behind his courage assured her he was invincible it seemed to her therefore as they walked side by side and she saw their triumphant pair of figures in her fancy natural that she should instantly take the step to prepare her for becoming his republican princess she walked an equal with the great of the earth by virtue of her being the mate of the greatest of the great she trod on some and she thrilled gratefully to the man who sustained her and shielded her on that eminence elect of the people he and by a vaster power than kings can summon through the trumpet she could surely pass through the trial with her parents that she might step to the place beside him she pressed his arm to be physically a sharer of his glory was it love it was as lofty a stretch as her nature could strain to she named the city on the shores of the great swiss lake where her parents were residing she bade him follow her thither and name the hotel where he was to be found the hour when he was to arrive am i not precise as an office clerk she said with a pleasant taste of the reality her preciseness pictured practical as the head of a state department said he in good faith i shall not keep you waiting she resumed the sooner we are together after the action opens the better for our success my golden crest have no misgivings sigismund you have transformed me a spark of you is in my blood come i shall send word to your hotel when you are to appear but you will come you will be there i know i know you so entirely as a rule lutetia women know no more than half of a man even when they have married him at least you ought to know me you know that if i were to exercise my will firmly nowit would not waver if i called it forthi could carry you off and spare you the flutter you will have to go through during our interlude with papa and mama i almost wish you would said she she looked half imploringly biting her lip to correct the peeping wish alvan pressed a finger on one of her dimples be brave flight and defiance are our last resource now that i see you resolved i shun the scandal and we will leave it to them to insist on it if it must be how can you be less than resolved after i have poured my influence into your veins the other day on the heightshad you consented then well it would have been very well but not so well we two have a future and are bound to make the opening chapters good sober reading for an example if we can i take you from your fathers house from your mothers arms from the god speed of your friends that is how alvans wife should be presented to the world clotildes epistle to the baroness was composed approved and despatched to a frigid eye it read as more hypocritical than it really was for supposing it had to be written the language of the natural impulse called up to write it was necessarily in request and that language is easily overdone so as to be discordant with the situation while it is as the writer feels a fairly true and wellformed expression of the pretty impulse but wiser is it always that the star in the ascendant should not address the one waning hardly can a word be uttered without grossly wounding she would not do it to a younger rival the letter strikes on the recipients age she babbles of a friendship she plays at childish ninny the display of her ingenuous happiness causes feminine natures bosom to rise in surges the declarations of her devotedness to the man waken comparisons with a deeper a longertried suffering actually the letter of the rising star assumes personal feeling to have died out of the abandoned luminary and personal feeling is chafed to its acutest edge by the perusal contempt also of one who can stupidly simulate such innocence is roused among alvans gifts the understanding of women did not rank high he was too robust he had been too successful your very successful hero regards them as ninepins destined to fall the whole tuneful nine at a peculiar poetical twist of the bowlers wrist one knocking down the otherfiguratively for their scruples or for their example with their sisters his tastes had led him into the avenues of success and as he had not encountered grand resistances he entertained his opinion of their sex the particular maxim he cherished was to stake everything on his making a favourable first impression after which single figure he said all your empty naughts count with women for hundreds thousands millions noblest virtues are but sickly units he would have stared like any philistine at the tale of their capacity to advance to a likeness unto men in their fight with the world women for him were objects to be chased the politicians relaxation taken like the sportsmans business with keen relish both for the pursuit and the prey and a view of the termination of his pastime their feelings he could appreciate during the time when they flew and fell perhaps a little longer but the change in his own feelings withdrew him from the communion of sentiment this is the state of men who frequent the avenues of success at present he was thinking of a wife and he approved the epistle to the baroness cordially i do think it a nice kind of letter and quite humble enough said clotilde he agreed yes yes she knows already that this is really serious with me so much for the baroness now for their parting a parting that is no worse than the turning of a page to a final meeting is made light of but felt reason is all in our favour and yet the gods are jealous of the bliss of mortals the slip between the cup and the lip is emotionally watched for even though it be not apprehended when the cup trembles for very fulness clotilde required reassuring and comforting i am certain you will prevail you must you cannot be resisted i stand to witness to the fact she sighed in a languor only my people are hard to manage i see more clearly now that i have imposed on them and they have given away by a sort of compact so long as i did nothing decisive that i see but then again have i not your spirit in me now what has ever resisted youthen as i am alvans wife i share his heart with his fortunes and i do not really dread the scenes from anticipating failure stillthe truth is i fear i am three parts an actress and the fourth feels itself a shivering morsel to face reality no i do not really feel it but press my hand i shall be truei am so utterly yours and because i have such faith in you you never yet have failed never and it is impossible for me to conceive it said alvan thoughtfully his last word to her on her departure was courage hers to him was conveyed by the fondest of looks she had previously said tomorrow to remind him of his appointment to be with her on the morrow and herself that she would not long stand alone she did not doubt of her courage while feasting on the beauty of one of the acknowledged strong men of earth she kissed her hand she flung her heart to him from the waving fingers chapter viii alvan left to himself had a quiet belief in the subjugation of his tricksy clotilde and the inspiriting he had given her all the rest to come was mere business matter of the conflict scarcely calling for a plan of action who can hold her back when a woman is decided to move husbands have tried it vainly and parents and though the husband and the parents are not dealing with the same kind of woman you see the same elemental power in her under both conditions of rebel wife and rebel daughter to break conventional laws and be splendidly irrational that is if she can be decided in other words aimed at a mark and inflamed to fly the barriers intercepting he fancied he had achieved it alvan thanked his fortune that he had to treat with parents the consolatory sensation of a pure intent soothed his inherent wildness in the contemplation of the possibility that the latter might be roused by those people her parents to upset his honourable ambition to win a wife after the fashion of orderly citizens it would be on their heads but why vision mischance an old halfjesting prophecy of his among his friends that he would not pass his fortieth year rose upon his recollection without casting a shadow lo the reckless prophet about to marry no dark bride no skeleton no colourless thing no lichened tree was she not death my friends but life is the bride of this doomed fortieth year was animation ever vivider in contrast with obstruction her hair would kindle the frosty shades to a throb of vitality it would be sunshine in the subterranean sphere the very thinking of her dispersed that realm of the poison hue and the eternally inviting phosphorescent still curved forefinger which says come to think of her as his vernal bride while the snowy alps were a celestial garden of no sunset before his eyes was to have the taste of mortal life in the highest he wondered how it was that he could have waited so long for her since the first night of their meeting and he just distinguished the fact that he lived with the pulses of the minutes much as she did only more fierily the ceaseless warfare called politics must have been the distraction he forgot any other of another kind he was a bridegroom for whom the rosed alps rolled out a panorama of illimitable felicity and there were certain things he must overcome before he could name his bride his own so that his innate love of contention which had been constantly flattered by triumph brought his whole nature into play with the prospect of the morrow not much liking it either there is a nerve in brave warriors that does not like the battle before the crackle of musketry is heard and the big artillery methodically according to his habit he jotted down the hours of the trains the hotel mentioned by clotilde the address of her father he looked to his cardcase his writing materials his notes upon swiss law considering that the scene would be in switzerland and he was a lawyer bent on acting within and up to the measure of the law as well as pleading eloquently the desire to wing a telegram to her he thought it wise to repress and he found himself in consequence composing verses turgid enough even to his own judgement poets would have failed at such a time and he was not one but an orator enamoured he was a wild man cased in the knowledge of jurisprudence and wishing to enter the ranks of the soberly blissful these he could imagine that he complimented by the wish then why should he doubt of his fortune he did not the night passed the morning came and carried him on his journey late in the afternoon he alighted at the hotel he called clotildes a letter was handed to him his eyes all over the page caught the note of it for her beginning of the battle and despair at the first repulse and now my turn said he not overjoyously the words jew and demagogue and baroness quoted in the letter were old missiles hurling again at him but clotildes parents were yet to learn that this jew demagogue and champion of an injured lady was a gentleman respectful to their legal and natural claims upon their child while maintaining his own they were to know him and change their tone as he was reading the letter upstairs by sentences his door opened at the answer to a tap he started his face was a shields welcome to the birdlike applicant for admission clotilde stood hesitating he sent the introducing waiter speeding on his most kellnerish legs and drew her in alvan i have come she was like a bird in his hands palpitating to extinction he bent over her what has happened trembling and very pale hard in her throat she said the worst you have spoken to them both subsequent to this he shook the letter it is hopeless both to father and mother both they will not hear your name they will not hear me speak i repeat it is past all hope all chance of moving them they hatehate you hate me for thinking of you i had no choice i wrote at once and followed my letter i ran through the streets i pant for want of breath not want of courage i prove i have it alvan i have done all i can do she was enfolded she sank on the nest dropping her eyelids but he said nothing she looked up at him her strained pale eyes provoked a closer embrace this would be the home for you if we were flying said he glancing round at the room with a sensation like a shudder tell me what there is to be told alvan i have that is all they will not listen they loathe oh what possesses them they have not met me yet they will not will not everno they must they refuse their child for daring to say she loves you is detested take metake me away runfacing the enemy his countenance was the fiery laugh of a thirster for strife they have to be taught the stuff alvan is made of clotilde moaned to signify she was sure he nursed an illusion i found them celebrating the betrothal of my sister lotte with the austrian count walburg i thought it favourable for us i spoke of you to my mother oh that scene what she said i cannot recollect it was a hiss then my father your name changed his features and his voice they treated me as impure for mentioning it you must have deadly enemies i was unable to recognize either father or motherthey have become transformed but you see i am here courage you said and i determined i would show it and be worthy of you but i am pursued i am sure my father is powerful in this place we shall barely have time to escape alvans resolution was taken some frienda lady living in the city herename her quickone you can trust he said and fondled her hastily much as a gentle kind of drillmaster straightens a fair pupils shoulders yes you have shown courage now it must be submission to me you shall be no runaway bride but honoured at the altar out of this hotel is the first point you know some such lady clotilde tried to remonstrate and to suggest she could have prophesied certain evil from any evasion of the straight line of flight she was so sure of it because of her intuition that her courage had done its utmost in casting her on him and that the remainder within her would be a drawing back she could not get the word or even the look to encounter his close and warm imperiousness and hesitating she noticed where they were together alone she could not refuse the protection he offered in a person of her own sex and now flushing with the thought of where they were together alone feminine modesty shrivelled at the idea of entreating a man to bear her off though feminine desperation urged to it she felt herself very bare of clothing and she named a lady a madame emerly living near the hotel her heart sank like a stone it is for you cried alvan keenly sensible of his loss and his generosity in temporarily resigning herfor a subsequent triumph but my wife shall not be snatched by a thief in the night are you not my wifemy golden bride and you may give me this pledge of it as if the vows had just been uttered and still i resign you till we speak the vows it shall not be said of alvans wife in the days of her glory that she ran to her nuptials through ratpassages his pride in his prevailingness thrilled her she was cooled by her despondency sufficiently to perceive where the centre of it lay but that centre of self was magnificent she recovered some of her enthusiasm thinking him perhaps to be acting rightly in any case they were united her step was irrevocable her having entered the hotel her being in this room certified to that it seemed to her while she was waiting for the carriage he had ordered that she was already half a wife she was not conscious of a blush the sprite in the young womans mind whispered of fire not burning when one is in the heart of it and undoubtedly contemplated from the outside this room was the heart of fire an impulse to fall on alvans breast and bless him for his chivalrousness had to be kept under lest she should wreck the thing she praised otherwise she was not ill at ease alvan summoned his gaiety all his homeliness of tone to give her composure and on her quitting the room she was more than ever bound to him despite her gloomy foreboding a maid of her household a middleaged woman gabbling of devotion to her ran up the steps of the hotel her tale was that the general had roused the city in pursuit of his daughter and she heard whither clotilde was going within half an hour clotilde was in madame emerlys drawingroom relating her desperate history of love and parental tyranny assisted by the lover whom she had introduced her hostess promised shelter and exhibited sympathy the whole teutonic portion of the continent knew alvan by reputation he was insurrectionally notorious in morals and menacingly in politics but his fine air handsome face flowing tongue and the signal proof of his respect for the lady of his love and deference toward her family won her personally she promised the best help she could give them they were certainly in a romantic situation such as few women could see and decline their aid to the lovers madame emerly proved at least her sincerity before many minutes had passed chancing to look out into the street she saw clotildes mother and her betrothed sister stepping up to the house what was to be done and was the visit accidental she announced it and clotilde cried out but alvan cried louder heavendirected and so let me see her and speak to hernothing could be better madame emerly took mute counsel of clotilde shaking her own head premonitorily and then she said i think indeed it will be safer if i am asked to say you are not here and i know not where you are yes yes clotilde replied oh do that she half turned to alvan rigid with an entreaty that hung on his coming voice no said alvan shocked in both pride and vanity plaindealing no subterfuge begin with foul falsehood no i would not have you burdened madame with the shadow of a conventional untruth on our account and when it would be bad policy oh no worse than the sin as the honest cynic says we will go down to madame von rudiger and she shall make acquaintance with the man who claims her daughters hand clotilde rocked in an agony her friend was troubled both ladies knew what there would be to encounter better than he but the man strong in his belief in himself imposed his will on them alvan and clotilde clasped hands as they went downstairs to madame emerlys reception room she could hardly speak do not forsake me is this forsaking he could ask it in the deeply questioning tone which supplies the answer oh alvan she would have said be warned he kissed her fingers trust to me she had to wrap her shivering spirit in a blind reliance and utter leaning on him she could almost have said know me better and she would sincere as her passion in its shallow vessel was have been moved to say it for a warning while yet there was time to leave the house instead of turning into that room had not a remainder of her first exaltation rapidly degenerating to desperation inspired her with the thought of her being a part of this handsome undaunted triumphflashing man such a state of blind reliance and utter leaning however has a certain tendency to disintegrate the will and by so doing it prepares the spirit to be a melting prize of the winner men and women alike who renounce their own individuality by cowering thus abjectly under some other before the storm are in reality abjuring their idea of that other and offering themselves up to the genius of power in whatsoever direction it may chance to be manifested in whatsoever person we no sooner shut our eyes than we consent to be prey we lose the soul of election mark her as she proceeds for should her hero fail and she be suffering through his failure and her reliance on him the blindness of it will seem to her to have been an infinite virtue anything but her deplorable weakness crouching beneath his show of superhuman strength and it will seem to her so long as her sufferings endure that he deceived her just expectations and was a vain pretender to the superhumanfor it was only a superhuman jew and democrat whom she could have thought of espousing the pusillanimous are under a necessity to be selfconsoled when they are not selfjustified it is their instinctive manner of putting themselves in the right to themselves the love she bore him because it was the love his high conceit exacted hung on success she was ready to fly with him and love him faithfully but not without some reason where reason we will own should not quite so coldly obtrude will it seem to her that the man who would not fly and would try the conflict insisted to stake her love on the issue he provoked he roused the tempest he angered the fates he tossed her to them and reason coldest reason close as it ever is to the cravens heart in its hour of trial whispers that he was prompted to fling the gamblers die by the swollen conceit in his fortune rather than by his desire for the prize that frigid reason of the craven has redhot perceptions it spies the spot of truth were the spot revealed in the man the whole man then so unerring is the eyeshot at him we should have only to transform ourselves into cowards fronting a crisis to read him through and topple over the sphinx of life by presenting her the sum of her most mysterious creature in an epigram but there was as much more in alvan than any fainthearted thing seeing however keenly could see as there is more in the world than the epigrams aimed at it contain courage said he and she tremblingly be careful and then they were in the presence of her mother and sister her sister was at the window hanging her head low a poor figure her mother stood in the middle of the room and met them full face with a womans combative frown of great eyes in which the stare is a bolt away with that man i will not suffer him near me she cried alvan advanced to her tell me madame in gods name what you have against me she swung her back on him go sir my husband will know how to deal with one like you out of my sight i say the brutality of this reception of alvan nerved clotilde she went up to him and laying her hand on his arm feeling herself almost his equal said let us go come i will not bear to hear you so spoken to no one shall treat you like that when i am near she expected him to give up the hopeless task after such an experience of the commencement he did but clasp her hand assuring the frau von rudiger that no word of hers could irritate him nothing can make me forget that you are clotildes mother you are the mother of the lady i love and may say what you will to me madame i bear it a man spotted with every iniquity the world abhors and i am to see him holding my daughter by the handit is too abominable and because there is no one present to chastise him he dares to address me and talk of his foul passion for my daughter i repeat that which you have to do is to go my ears are shut you can annoy you can insult you cannot move me go she stamped her aspect spat alvan bowed under perfect selfcommand he said i will go at once to clotildes father i may hope that with a reasonable man i shall speedily come to an understanding she retorted enter his house and he will have you driven out by his lacqueys hardly i am not of those men who are driven from houses alvan said smiling but madame i will act on your warning and spare her father for all sakes the attempt seeing he does not yet know whom he deals with i will write to him letters from you will be flung back unopened it may of course be possible to destroy even my patience madame mine sir is at an end you reduce us to rely on ourselves it is the sole alternative you have not waited for that rejoined frau von rudiger you have already destroyed my daughters reputation by inducing her to leave her fathers house and hesitate to return oh you are known you are known for your dealings with women as well as men we know you we have we pray to god little more to learn of you you ahthief thief alvans voice rose on hers like the clapping echo of it she had up the whole angry pride of the man in arms and could discern that she had struck the wound in his history but he was terrible to look at so she made the charge supportable by saying you have stolen my child from me clotilde raised her throat shrewish in excitement false he did not i went to him of my own will to run from your heartlessness mother that i call motherand be out of hearing of my fathers curses and threats yes to him i fled feeling that i belonged more to him than to you and never will i return to you you have killed my love i am this mans own because i love him only him ever him you abuse as his partner in life for all it may giveas his wife trample on him you trample on me make black brows at your child for choosing the man of all men alive to worship and follow through the world i do i am his i glory in him her gaze on alvan said now was she not worthy of him now and would they not go forth together now oh now her gaze was met by nothing like the brilliant counterpart she merited it was as if she had offered her beauty to a glass and found a reflection in dull metal he smiled calmly from her to her mother he said you accuse me of stealing your child madame you shall acknowledge that you have wronged me clotilde my clotilde may i count on you to do all and everything for me is there any sacrifice i could ask that would be too hard for you will you at one sign from me go or do as i request you she replied in an anguish over the chilling riddle of his calmness i will but sprang out of that obedient consent fearful of overacting her part of slave to him before her mother in a ghastly apprehension of the part he was for playing to the same audience yes i will do all all that you command i am yours i will go with you bid me do whatever you can think of all except bid me go back to the people i have hitherto called minenot that and that is what i have to request of you said he with his calm smile brightening and growing more foreign histrionic unreadable to her and this greatest sacrifice that you can perform for me are you prepared to do it will you she tried to decipher the mask he wore it was proof against her imploring eyes if you can ask meif you can positively wish ityes she said but think of what you are doing oh alvan not back to them think he smiled insufferably he was bent on winning a parentblest bride an unimpeachable wife a lady handed to him instead of taken one of the worlds polished silver vessels think that you are doing this for me said he it is for my sake and now madame i give you back your daughter you see she is mine to give she obeys me and ithough it can be only for a short timegive her back to you she goes with you purely because it is my wish do not forget that and so madame i have the honour he bowed profoundly he turned to clotilde and drew her within his arm what you have done in obedience to my wish my beloved shall never be forgotten never can i sufficiently thank you i know how much it has cost you but here is the end of your trials all the rest is now my task rely on me with your whole heart let them not misuse you otherwise do their bidding be sure of my knowing how you are treated and at the slightest act of injustice i shall be beside you to take you to myself be sure of that and be not unhappy they shall not keep you from me for long submit a short while to the will of your parents mine you will find the stronger resolve it in your soul that i your lover cannot fail for it is impossible to me to waver consider me as the one fixed light in your world and look to me soon then have patience be true and we are one he kissed cold lips he squeezed an inanimate hand the horribly empty sublimity of his behaviour appeared to her in her mothers contemptuous face his eyes were on her as he released her and she stood alone she seemed a dead thing but the sense of his having done gloriously in mastering himself to give these worldly people of hers a lesson and proof that he could within due measure bow to their laws and customs dispelled the brief vision of her unfitness to be left the compressed energy of the man under his conscious display of a greatminded deference to the claims of family ties and duties intoxicated him he thought but of the present achievement and its just effect he had cancelled a bad reputation among these people from whom he was about to lead forth a daughter for alvans wife and he reasoned by the grandeur of his exhibition of generositywhich was brought out in strong relief when he delivered his retiring bow to the frau von rudigers shoulderthat the worst was over he had to deal no more with silly women now for clotildes father women were privileged to oppose their senselessness to the divine fire men could not retreat behind such defences they must meet him on the common ground of men where this constant battler had never yet encountered a reverse clotildes cold staring gaze a little livelier to wonderment than to reflection observed him to be scrupulous of the formalities in the diverse character of his parting salutations to her mother her sister and the lady of the house he was goinghe could actually go and leave her she stretched herself to him faintly she let it be seen that she did so as much as she had force to make it visible she saw him smiling incomprehensibly like a winner of the field to be left to the enemy she could get nothing from him but that insensible round smile and she took the ebbing of her poor effort for his rebuff you that offered yourself in flight to him who once proposed it he had the choice of you and he abjured you he has cast you off she phrased it in speech to herself it was incredible but it was clear he had gone the room was vacant the room was black and silent as a dungeon he will not have you he has handed you back to them the more readily to renounce you she framed the words half aloud in a moan as she glanced at her mother heaving in stern triumph her sister drooping madame emerly standing at the window the cravens first instinct for safety quick as the cavern lynx for light set her on the idea that she was abandoned it whispered of quietness if she submitted and thus she reasoned had alvan taken her she would not have been guilty of more than a common piece of lovedesperation in running to him the which may be loves glory when marriage crowns it by his rejecting her and leaving her he rendered her not only a runaway but a castaway it was not natural that he should leave her not natural in him to act his recent part but he had done it consequently she was at the mercy of those who might pick her up she was in her humiliation and dread all of the moment she could see to no distance and judging of him feeling for herself within that contracted circle of sensationsure from her knowledge of her cowardice that he had done unwiselyshe became swayed about like a castaway in soul until her distinguishing of his mad recklessness in the challenge of a power greater than his own grew present with her as his personal cruelty to the woman who had flung off everything flung herself on the tempestuous deeps on his behalf and here she was left to float or founder alvan had gone the man rageing over the room abusing her infamous lover the dirty jew the notorious thief scoundrel gallowsbird etc etc frightful epithets not to be transcribedwas her father he had come she knew not how alvan had tossed her to him abuse of a lover is ordinarily retorted on in the ladys heart by the brighter perception of his merits but when the heart is weak the creature suffering shame her lover the cause of it and seeming cruel she is likely to lose all perception and bend like a flower pelted her cry to him if you had been wiser this would not have been will sink to the inward meditation if he had been truerand though she does not necessarily think him untrue for charging him with it there is already a loosening of the bonds where the accusation has begun they are not broken because they are loosened still the loosening of them makes it possible to cut them with less of a snap and less pain alvan had relinquished her he loved to brave the tempest in a frail small boat and he certainly could not have apprehended the furious outbreak she was exposed to she might so far have exonerated him had she been able to reflect but she whom he had forced to depend on him in blind reliance now opened her eyes on an opposite power exercising material rigours after having enjoyed extraordinary independence for a young woman she was treated as a refractory child literally marched through the streets in the custody of her father who clutched her by the hair alvans beloved golden locksand held her under terror of a huge foresters weapon that he had seized at the first tidings of his daughters flight to the jew he seemed to have a grim indifference to exposure contempt with a sense of the humour of it and this was a satisfaction to him founded on his practical observance of two or three maxims quite equal to the fullest knowledge of women for rightly managing them preferable inasmuch as they are simpler and by merely cracking a whip bring her back to the post instead of wasting time by hunting her as she likes to run police were round his house the general chattered and shouted of the desperate lawlessness and larcenies of that jewthe things that jew would attempt he dragged her indoors muttering of his policy in treating her at last to a wholesome despotism this was the medicine for herhe knew her whether he did or not he knew the potency of his physic he knew that osiers can be made to bend with a frightful noise of hammering he himself nailed up the window shutters of the room she was locked in hard and fast and he left her there and roared across the household that any one holding communication with the prisoner should be shot like a dog this was a manifestation of power in a form more convincing than the orators she was friendless abused degraded benighted in broad daylight abandoned by her lover she sank on the floor of the room conceiving with much strangeness of sentiment under these hard stripes of misfortune that reality had come the monster had hold of her she was isolated fed like a dungeoned captive she had nothing but our natural obstinacy to hug or seem to do so when wearifulness reduced her to cling to the semblance of it only i marry alvan was her iterated answer to her father on his visits to see whether he had yet broken her and she spoke with the desperate firmness of weak creatures that strive to nail themselves to the sound of it he listened and named his time for returning the tug between rigour and endurance continued for about forty hours she then thought in an exhaustion strange that my father should be so fiercely excited against this man can he have reasons i have not heard of her fathers unwonted harshness suggested the question in her quailing nature which was beginning to have a movement to kiss the whip the question set her thinking of the reasons she knew she saw them involuntarily from the side of parents and they wore a sinister appearance in reality her present scourging was due to them as well as to alvans fatal decision her misery was traceable to his conduct and his judgementboth bad and yet all this while he might be working to release her near upon rescuing she swung round to the side of her lover against these executioner parents and scribbled to him as well as she could under the cracks in her windowshutters urging him to appear she spent her heart on it a note to her friend the english lady protested her love for alvan but with less abandonment with a frozen resignation to the loss of himall around her was so dark by andby there was a scratching at her door the maid whom she trusted brought her news of alvan outside the door and in the maid and mistress knelt hope flickered up in the bosom of clotilde the whispers were exchanged through the partition where is he gone but where he has left the city clotilde pushed the letter for her friend under the door that one for alvan she retained stung by his desertion of her and thinking practically that it was useless to aim a letter at a man without an address she did not ask herself whether the maids information was honest for she wanted to despair as the exhausted want to lie down she wept through the night it was one of those nights of the torrents of tears which wash away all save the adamantine within us if there be ought of that besides the breathing structure the reason why she wept with so delirious a persistency was that her nature felt the necessity for draining her of her selfpitifulness knowing that it nourished the love whereby she was tormented they do not weep thus who have a heart for the struggle in the morning she was a dried channel of tears no longer selfpitiful careless of herself as she thought in other words unable any further to contend reality was too strong this morning her sisters came to her room imploring her to yieldif she married alvan what could be their prospects as the sistersin law of such a manher betrothed sister lotte could not hope to espouse count walburg alvans name was infamous in society their house would be a lazarhouse they would be condemned to seclusion a favourite brother followed with sympathy that set her tears running again and arguments she could not answer how could he hold up his head in his regiment as the relative of the scandalous jew democrat he would have to leave the service or be duelling with his brother officers every other day of his life for rightly or wrongly alvan was abhorred and his connection would be fatal to them all perhaps to her fathers military and diplomatic career principally the head of their house would be ruined she was compelled to weep again by having no other reply the tears were now mixed drops of pity for her absent lover and her family she was already disunited from him when she shed them feeling that she was dry rock to herself heartless as many bosoms drained of selfpity will become incapable of that any further she leaned still in that direction and had a languid willingness to gain outward comfort to be caressed a little by her own kindred before she ceased to live was desireable after her heavy scourging she wished for the touches of affection knowing them to be selfish but her love of life and hard view of its reality made them seem a soft reminder of what life had been alvan had gone her natural blankness of imagination read his absence as an entire relinquishment it knelled in a vacant chamber he had gone he had committed an irretrievable error he had given up a fight of his own vain provoking that was too severe for him he was not the lover he fancied himself or not the lord of men she had fancied him her excessive misery would not suffer a picture of him not one clear recollection of him to stand before her he who should have been at hand had gone and she was fearfully beset almost lifeless and being abandoned her blank night of imagination felt that there was nothing left for her save to fall upon those nearest she gave her submission to her mother in her mind during the last wrestling with a weakness that was alternately her love and her cowardice the interpretation of the act ran he may come and i am his if he comes and if not i am bound to my people he had taught her to rely on him blindly and thus she did it inanimately while cutting herself loose from him in a similar mood the spiritual waverer vows to believe if the saint will appear however she submitted then there was joy in the family and she tasted their caresses chapter ix after his deed of loftiness alvan walked to his hotel where the sight of the room clotilde had entered that morning caught his breath he proceeded to write his first letter to general von rudiger repressing his hearts intimations that he had stepped out of the friendly path and was on a strange and tangled one the sense of power in him was leonine enough to promise the forcing of a way whithersoever the path yet did that ghost of her figure across the room haunt him with searching eyes they set him spying over himself at an actor who had not needed to be acting his part brilliant though it was he crammed his energy into his idea of the part to carry it forward victoriously before the world it would without question redound to his credit and he heard the world acclaiming him alvans wife was honourably won as became the wife of a doctor of law from the bosom of her family when he could have had her in the old lawless fashion for a call to a coachman alvan the republican is eminently a citizen consider his past life by that test of his character he who had many times defied the world in hot rebellion had become through his desire to cherish a respectable passion if not exactly slavish to it subservient as we see royal personages that are happy to be on bowing terms with the multitude bowing lower lower of course the multitude must bow to inspire an august serenity but the nod they have in exchange for it is not an independent one ceasing to be a social rebel he conceived himself as a recognized dignitary and he passed under the bondage of that position clotilde had been in this room she had furnished proof that she could be trusted now she had committed herself perished as a maiden of society and her parents even the senseless mother must see it and decide by it the general would bring her to reason general von rudiger was a man of the world an honourable soninlaw could not but be acceptable to him now at least and such a soninlaw would ultimately be the pride of his house a flower from thy garden friend and my wearing it shall in good time be cause for some parental gratification the letter despatched alvan paced his chamber with the ghost of clotilde he was presently summoned to meet count walburg and another intimate of the family in the hotel downstairs these gentlemen brought no message from general von rudiger their words were directed to extract a promise from him that he would quit his pursuit of clotilde and of course he refused they hinted that the general might have official influence to get him expelled the city and he referred them to the proof but he looked beyond the words at a new something of extraordinary and sinister aspect revealed to him in their manner of treating his pretensions to the hand of the lady he had not yet perfectly seen the view the world took of him because of his armed opposition to the world nor could he rightly reflect on it yet being too anxious to sign the peace he felt as it were a blow startling him from sleep his visitors tasked themselves to be strictly polite they did not undervalue his resources for commanding respect between man and man the strange matter was behind their bearing which indicated the positive impossibility of the union of clotilde with one such as he and struck at the curtain covering his history he could not raise it to thunder his defence of himself or even allude to the implied contempt of his character with a boiling gorge he was obliged to swallow both the history and the insult returning them the equivalent of their courtesies though it was on his lips to thunder heavily a second endeavour in an urgent letter before nightfall to gain him admission to headquarters met the same repulse as the foregoing the bearer of it was dismissed without an answer alvan passed a night of dire disturbance the fate of the noble genoese conspirator slipping into still harbour water on the step from boat to boat and borne down by the weight of his armour in the moment of the ripeness of his plot at midnight when the signal for action sparkled to lighten across the ships and forts had touched him in his boys readings and he found a resemblance of himself to fiesco stopped as he was by a base impediment tripped ignominiously choked by the weight of the powers fitting him for battle a man such as alvan arrested on his career by an opposition to his enrolment of a bridethink of it what was this girl in a life like his but oh the question was no sooner asked than the thought that this girl had been in this room illuminated the room telling him she might have been his own this instant confounding him with an accusation of madness for rejecting her why had he done it surely women weak women must be at times divinely inspired she warned him against the step but he proud of his armoury went his way he choked he suffered the torture of the mailed genoese going under worse for the drowners delirium swirls but a minute in the gaping brain while he had to lie all night at the mercy of the night he was only calmer when morning came night has little mercy for the selfreproachful and for a strong man denouncing the folly of his error it has none the bequest of the night was a fever of passion and upon that fever the light of morning cleared his head to weigh the force opposing him he gnawed the paradox that it was huge because it was petty getting a miserable sour sustenance out of his consciousness of the position it explained great enemies great undertakings would have revived him as they had always revived and fortified but here was a stolid small obstacle scarce assailable on its own level and he had chosen that it should be attacked through its own laws and forms by shutting a door by withholding an answer to his knocks the thing reduced him to hesitation and the thing had weapons to shoot at him his history his very blood stood open to its shafts and the sole quality of a giant which he could show to front it was the breath of one for a mark these direct perceptions of the circumstances were played on by the fever he drew from his fiesco bed accuracy of vision in our crises is not so uncommon as the proportionate equality of feeling we do indeed frequently see with eyes of just measurement while we are conducting ourselves like madmen the facts are seen and yet the spinning nerves will change their complexion and without enlarging or minimizing they will alternate their effect on us immensely through the colour presenting them now sombre now hopeful doing its work of extravagance upon perceptibly plain matter the fitful colour is the fever he must win her for he never yet had failedhe had lost her by his folly she was hisshe was torn from him she would come at his biddingshe would cower to her tyrants the thought of her was life and death in his frame bright heaven and the abyss at one beat of the heart she swam to his arms at another he was straining over darkness and whose the fault he rose out of his amazement crying it with a roar and foreignly beholding himself he pelted himself with epithets his worst enemies could not have been handier in using them from alvan to alvan they signified such an earthquake in a land of splendid structures as shatters to dust the pride of the works of men he was down among them lower than the herd rolling in vulgar epithets that attached to one like him became of monstrous distortion o fool dolt blind ass tottering idiot drunken masquerader miserable jack knave performing suicide with that blessed coxcomb air of curling a lockclotilde clotilde where has one read the story of a man who had the jewel of jewels in his hand and flung in into the deeps thinking that he flung a pebble fish fool fish and fish till doomsday theres nothing but your fools face in the water to be got to bite at the bait you throw fool fish for the flungaway beauty and hook your shadow of a bottoms head what impious villain was it refused the gift of the gods that he might have it bestowed on him according to his own prescription of the ceremonies they laugh by orcus how they laugh the laughter of the gods is the lightning of deaths irony over mortals can they have a finer subject than a giant gone fool tears burst from him tears of rage regret selflashing o for yesterday he called aloud for the recovery of yesterday bellowed groaned a giant at war with pigmies having nought but their weapons having to fight them on his knees to fight them with the right hand while smiting himself with the left has too much upon him to keep his private dignity in order he was the same in his lettersa cyclops hurling rocks and raising the seas to shipwreck dignity was cast off he came out naked letters to clotilde and to the baroness to the friend nearest him just then colonel von tresten calling them to him were dashed to paper in this naked frenzy and he could rave with all the truth of life that to have acted the idiot more than the loss of the woman was the ground of his anguish each antecedent of his career had been a step of strength and success departed the woman was but a fragment of the tremendous wreck the woman was utterly diminutive yet she was the key of the reconstruction the woman won he would be himself once more and feeling that his passion for her swelled to full tide and she became a towering splendour whereat his eyeballs ached she became a melting armful that shook him to big bursts of tears the feeling of the return of strength was his love in force the giant in him loved her warmly her sweetness her archness the opening of her lips their way of holding closed and her brightness of wit her tender eyelashes her appreciating looks her sighing the thousand varying shades of her motions and her features interflowing like a lighted water swam to him one by one like so many handmaiden messengers distinctly beheld of the radiant indistinct whom he adored with more of spirit in his passion than before this tempest a giant going through a giants contortions fleshly as the race of giants and gross coarse dreadful likely to be horrible when whipped and stirred to the dregs alvan was greathearted he could love in his giants fashion love and lay down life for the woman he loved though the nature of the passion was not heavenly or for the friend who would have to excuse him often or for the public causewhich was to minister to his appetites he was true man a native of earth and if he could not quit his huge personality to pipe spiritual music during a storm of trouble being a soul wedged in the gnarled wood of the standing giant oak and giving mighty sound of timber at strife rather than the angelical cry he suffered as he loved to his depths we have not to plumb the depths he was not heroic but hugely man love and man sometimes meet for noble concord the strings of the hungry instrument are not all so rough that loves touch on them is indistinguishable from the rattling of the wheels within certain herald harmonies have been heard but love which purifies and enlarges us and sets free the soul love visiting a fleshly frame must have time and space and some help of circumstance to give the world assurance that the man is a temple fit for the rites out of romances he is not melodiously composed and in a giant are various giants to be slain or thoroughly subdued ere this divinity is taken for leader it is not done by miracle as it happened cruelly for alvan the woman who had become the radiant indistinct in his desiring mind was one whom he knew to be of a shivery stedfastness his plucking her from another was neither wonderful nor indefensible they two were suited as no other two could be the handsome boy who had gone through a form of plighting with her was her slave and she required for her mate a master she felt it and she sided to him quite naturally moved by the sacred direction of the acknowledgement of a mutual fitness twice however she had relapsed on the occasions of his absence and owning his power over her when they were together again she sowed the fatal conviction that he held her at present and that she was a woman only to be held at present by the palpable grasp of his physical influence partly it was correct not entirely seeing that she kept the impression of a belief in him even when she drifted away through sheer weakness but it was the single positive view he had of her and it was fatal for it begat a devil of impatience they are undermining her nownownow he started himself into busy frenzies to reach to her already indifferent to the means and waxing increasingly reckless as he fed on his agitation some faith in her even the little she deserved would have arrested him unhappily he had less than she who had enough to nurse the dim sense of his fixity and sank from him only in her hearts faintness but he when no longer flattered by the evidence of his mastery took her for sand why then had he let her out of his grasp the horrid echoed interrogation flashed a hideous view of the woman but how had he come to be guilty of it he asked himself again and without answering him his counsellors to that poor wisdom set to work to complete it giant vanity urged giant energy to make use of giant duplicity he wrote to clotilde with one voice quoting the law in their favour with another commanding her to break it he gathered and drilled a legion of spies and showered his gold in bribes and plots to get the letter to her to get an interviewone human word between them chapter x his friend colonel von tresten was beside him when he received the enemys counterstroke count walburg and his companion brought a letter from clotildeno reply a letter renouncing him briefly in cold words befitting the act she stated that the past must be dead between them for the future she belonged to her parents she had left the city she knew not where he might be her letter concluded but henceforward he should know that they were strangers alvan held out the deadly paper when he had read the contents he smote a forefinger on it and crumpled it in his hand that was the dumb oration of a man shocked by the outrage upon passionate feeling to the state of brute his fist outstretched to the length of his arm shook the reptile letter under a terrible frown tresten saw that he supposed himself to be perfectly master of his acts because he had not spoken and had managed to preserve the ordinary courtesies you have done your commission the colonel said to count walburg whose companion was not disposed to go without obtaining satisfactory assurances and pressed for them alvan fastened on him you adopt the responsibility of this he displayed the letter i do it lies tresten remarked to count walburg these visits are provocations they are not so intended said the count bowing pacifically his friend was not a man of the sword and was not under the obligation to accept an insult they left the letter to do its work big natures in their fits of explosiveness must be taken by flying shots as dwarfs peep on a monster or the scythian attacked a phalanx were we to hear all the roarings of the shirted heracles a world of comfortable little ones would doubt the unselfishness of his love of dejaneira yes really they would think it was not a chivalrous love they would consider that he thought of himself too much they would doubt too of his being a gentleman partial glimpses of him one may fear will be discomposing to simple natures there was a short black eruption alvan controlled it to ask hastily what the baroness thought and what she had heard of clotilde tresten made sign that it was nothing of the best see my girl has hundreds of enemies and i only i know her and can defend herweak base shallow trickster traitress that she is cried alvan and came down in a thundershower upon her yesterdaythe day beforewhen just now here in this room gave herselfand now he bent and immediately straightening his back addressed colonel von tresten as her calumniator say your worst of her and i say i will make of that girl the peerless woman of earth i in earnest its no dream she can be made o god the beast has turned tail i knew she could there s three of beast to one of goddess in her and set her alone and let her be hunted and i not by beast it is with her cowardly skulking beastthe noblest and very bravest under my wing incomprehensible to you tresten but who understands women you hate her do not she s a riddle but no worse than the rest of the tangle she gives me up pooh she writes it she writes anything and that vilest i say i will make more enviable more clotilde he thundered her signature in an amazement broken suddenly by the sight of her putting her name to the letter she had done that written her name to the renunciation of him no individual could bear the sight of such a crime and no suffering man could be appeased by a single victim to atone for it her sex must be slaughtered he raged against the woman she became that ancient poisonous thing the woman his fury would not distinguish her as clotilde though the name had started him and it was his knowledge of the particular sinner which drew down his curses on the sex he twisted his body hugging at his breast as if he had her letter sticking in his ribs the letter was up against his ribs and he thumped it crushed it patted it he kissed it and flung it stamped on it and was foulmouthed seeing it at his feet he bent to it like a man snapped in two lamenting bewailing himself recovering sight of her fragmentarily it stuck in his ribs and in scorn of the writer and sceptical of her penning it he tugged to pull it out and broke the shaft but left the rankling arrowheadshe had traced the lines and though tyranny racked her to do that thing his agony followed her hand over the paper to her name which fixed and bit in him like the deadly toothed arrowhead called asp and there was no uprooting it the thing lived her deed was the woman there was no separating them witness it in love murdered o that woman she has murdered love she has blotted love completely out she is the archthief and assassin of mankindthe female apollyon he lost sight of her in the prodigious iniquity covering her sex with a cowl of night and it was what women are what women will do the one and all alike simpering simulacra that men find them to be soulless clogs on us bloodsuckers until a feature of the particular sinner peeped out on him and brought the fresh agony of a reminder of his great heartedness for that womantresten you know mei would have sacrificed for that woman fortune and life my hope my duty my immortality she knew it and shelook he unwrinkled the letter carefully for it to be legible and clenched it in a ball signs her name signs her name her namegod of heaven it would be incredible in a holy chroniclesigns her name to the infamous harlotry see clotilde von rudiger its her writing thats her signature clotilde in full youd hardly fancy that now but look the colonels eyelids were blinking and alvan dinted his fingernail under her name there it is clotilde signed shamelessly just as she might have written to one of her friends about bonnets and balls and books henceforward strangers she and i his laughter even to tresten a man of camps sounded profane as a yell beneath a cathedral dome why the woman has been in my hands i released her spared her drilled brain and blood ransacked all the code to do her homage and honour in every mortal way and we two strangers do you hear that tresten why if you had seen hershe was lost and i this man she now pierces with ice kept hell down under bolt and barworse i believe broke a good womans heart that never a breath should rise that could accuse her on suspicion or in malice or by accident justly or with a shadow of truth i think it best for us both so she thinks for me she not only decides she thinks she is the active principle tis mine to submita certain presumption was in that girl always ha do you hear me her letter may sting it shall not dupe strangers poor fool you see plainly she was nailed down to write the thing this letter is a flat lie she can lieoh born to the art born to itlies like a saint tricking satan but she says she has left the city now to find her he began marching about the room with great strides i ll have the whole continent up her keepers shall have no rest i ll have them by the law courts and by stratagem and if law and cunning fail force i have sworn it i have done all that honour can ask of a man more than any man to my knowledge would have done and now its war i declare war on them they will have it i mean to take that girl from them snatch or catch the girl is my girl and if there are laws against my having my own to powder with the laws well and do you suppose me likely to be beaten then cicero was a fiction and caesar a peoples legend not if they are history and eloquence and commandership have power over the blood and souls of men first i write to her his friend suggested that he knew not where she was but already the pen was at work the brain pouring as from a pitcher writing was bloodletting and the interminable pages drained him of his fever as he wrote she grew more radiant more indistinct more fiercely desired the concentration of his active mind directed his whole being on the track of clotilde idealizing her beyond human that last day when he had seen her appeared to him as the day of days that day was clotilde herself she in person he saw it as the woman and saw himself translucent in the great luminousness and behind it all was dark as in front that one day was the sun of his life it had been a day of rain and he beheld it in memory just as it had been with the dark threaded air the dripping streets and he glorified it past all daily radiance his letter was a burning hymn to the day his moral grandeur on the day made him live as part of the splendour was it possible for the woman who had seen him then to be faithless to him the swift deduction from his own feelings cleansed her of a suspicion to the contrary and he became lighthearted he hummed an air when he had finished his letter to her councils with his adherents and couriers were held and some were despatched to watch the house and slip the letter to her maid others were told off to bribe and hound their way on the track of clotilde his gold rained into their hands with the directions colonel von tresten was the friend of his attachment to the baroness a friend of both and a warm one men coming into contact with alvan took their shape of friend or enemy sharply for he was friend or enemy of no dubious feature devoted to them he loved and a battery on them he opposed the colonel had been the confidant of the baronesss grief over this lovepassion of alvans and her resignation he shared her doubts of clotildes nobility of character the reports were not favourable to the young lady but the baroness and he were of one opinion that alvan in love was not likely to be governable by prudent counsel he dropped a word of the whispers of clotildes volatility alvan nodded his perfect assent she is that she is anything you like you cannot exaggerate her for good or evil she is matchless colour her as you please adopting the tone of argument he said she writes that letter well it is her writing and the moment i am sure of it as hers i would not have it unwritten i love it he looked maddish with his love of the horrible thing and resumed soberly the point is that she has the charm for me she is plastic in my hands other men would waste the treasure i make of her what i will and she knows it and knows that she hangs on me to flourish worthily i breathe the very soul of the woman into her as for that letter of hers it burnt him this time to speak of the letter she may write and write shes weak thin a reed shelet her be say of her when she plays beastshe is absent from alvan i can forgive the letters nothing it means nothing except thou fool alvan to let me go yes that her people are acting tyrant with heras legally they have no right to do in this country and i shall prove it to them when i have gained admission to herand i soon shall it cant be refused i am off to the head of her fathers office tomorrow and i have only to represent the state of affairs to the minister in my language to obtain his authority to demand admission to herthen friend you will see i lift my finger and you will see at my request she went back to her mother i have but to beckon he had cooled to the happy assurance of his authority over her all the giants of his system being well in action and when that is the case with a big nature it is at rest or such is the condition of repose granted it in life on the morrow he was off to batter at doors which would have expected rather the summons of an armed mob at his heels than the strange cry of the radical man maltreated by love chapter xi the story of clotildes departure from the city like that of alvans communicated to her by her maid was an anticipation of the truth disseminated by her parents she was removed when the swarm of spies and secret letterbearers were attaining a position of dignity through the rumour of legal gentlemen about to direct the movements of the besieging army a stir seemed to her to prognosticate a rescue and she went not unwillingly to be in motion to see roadside faces pricked her senses with some hope she had gained the peace she needed and in that state her heart began to be agitated by a fresh awakening luxurious at first rather than troublesome she had sunk so low that the light of alvan seemed too distant for a positive expectation of him but few approached her whom she did not fancy under strange disguises the gentlemen were servants the blouses were gentlemen she looked wistfully at old women bearing baskets for the forbidden fruit to peep out in the form of an envelope all passed her blankly noticing her eyes the journey was short she was taken to a place a little beyond the head of the lake and there though she had liberty to breathe the air fast fixed within the walls of a daily sameness that became gradually the hum of voices accusing alvan of one in excess of the many sins laid against him by his enemies was he not possibly an empty pretender to power a mere great talker her bit of liberty increased her chafing at the deadly monotony of this existence and envenomed the accusation by seeming to push her forth quite half way to meet him if he would but come or show sign she impetuously vindicated him from the charge of crediting the sincerity of any words she might have committed to paper at the despotic dictation of her father oh no alvan could not be guilty of such folly as that he could not it would be to suppose him unacquainted with her ignorant of the nature of women he would know that she wrote the wordswhy she could not perfectly recollect how she had come to write them and found it easier to extinguish the act of having written them at all which was done by the angry recurrence to his failure to intervene now when the drama cried for his godlike appearance perhaps he was really unacquainted with her thought her stronger than she was the idea reflected a shadow on his intelligence she was not in a situation that could bear of her blaming herself while she was thus devoured by the legions of her enfeebled wits clotilde was assiduously courted by her family and her father from time to time brought pen and paper for her to write anew from his dictation he was pleased to hail her as his fair secretary and when the letters were unimportant she wrote flowingly happy to be praised they were occasionally addressed to friends she discovered herself writing one to the professor in which he was about to be informed that she had resolved to banish alvan from her mind for ever she stopped her heart stopped the pen fell from her hand in loathing her father warily bade her proceed she could not she signified it choking only a few days before she had written to the professor exultingly of her engagement she refused to belie herself in such a manner retrospectively her rapid contradictions appeared impossible the picture of her was not human and she gave out a negative of her whole frame convulsed whereat the general was not slow to remind her of the scourgings she had undergone by a sudden burst of his wrath he knew the proper physic you girls want the lesson we read to skittish recruits you shall have it write he is now as nothing to me you shall write that you hate him if you hesitate why you unreasonable slut you have given him up you have told him you have given him up and what objection can you have to telling others now you have done it i was forced to it body and soul cried clotilde sobbing and bursting into desperation out of a weak show of petulance that she had put on to propitiate him if i have to tell i will tell how it was for that my heart is unchanged and alvan is and will be my lord all the world may see i would rather write that i hate him you write the man is now as nothing to me said her father dashing his finger in a fiery zigzag along the line for her pen to follow or else my girl youve been playing us a pretty farce he strung himself for a mad gallop of wrath gave her a shudder and relapsed no no youre wiser youre a better girl than that write it i must have it writtenhere come the worst is over the rest is childs play come take the pen ill guide your hand the pen was fixed in her hand and the first words formed they looked such sprawling skeletons that clotilde had the comfort of feeling sure they would be discerned as the work of compulsion so she wrote on mechanically solacing herself for what she did with vows of future revolt alvan had a saying that want of courage is want of sense and she remembered his illustration of how sense would nourish courage by scattering the fear of death if we would only grasp the thought that we sink to oblivion gladly at night and most of us quit it reluctantly in the morning she shut her eyes while writing she fancied death would be welcome and as she certainly had sense she took it for the promise of courage she flattered herself by believing therefore that she who did not object to die was only awaiting the cruellydelayed advent of her lover to be almost as brave as hethe feminine of him with these ideas in her head much clearer than when she wrote the couple of lines to alvanfor then her head was reeling she was then beaten and prostrate she signed her name to a second renunciation of him and was aware of a flush of selfreproach at the simple suspicion of his being deceived by it it was an insult to his understanding full surely the professor would not be deceived and a lover with a heart to reach to her and read her could never be hoodwinked by so palpable a piece of slavishness she was indeed slavish the apology necessitated the confession but that promise of courage coming of her ownership of sense vindicated her prospectively she had so little of it that she embraced it as a present possession and she made it alvans task to put it to the trial hence it became alvans offence if owing to his absence she could be charged with behaving badly her generosity pardoned him his inexplicable delay to appear in his might but see what your continued delay causes she said and her tone was merely sorrowful she had forgotten her signature to the letter to the professor when his answer arrived the sight of the handwriting of one of her lovers faithfullest friends was like a peal of bells to her and she tore the letter open and began to blink and spell at a strange language taking the frosty sentences piecemeal he begged her to be firm in her resolution give up alvan and obey her parents this man of high intelligence and cultivation wrote like a provincial schoolmistress moralizing though he knew the depth of her passion for alvan and had within the month received her larksong of her betrothal he this man if living man he could be thoughtcounselled her to endeavour to deserve the love and respect of her parents alluded to alvans age and her better birth approved her resolve to consult the wishes of her family and in fine was as rank a traitor to friendship as any chronicled out on him she swept him from earth and she had built some of her hopes on the professor false friend she cried she wept over alvan for having had so false a friend there remained no one that could be expected to intervene with a strong arm save the baroness the professors emphasized approval of her resolve to consult the wishes of her family was a shocking hypocrisy and clotilde thought of the contrast to it in her letter to the baroness the tripping and stumbling prettily awkward little tone of gosling innocent new from its egg throughout the letter was a triumph of candour she repeated passages paragraphs of the letter assuring herself that such affectionately reverential prattle would have moved her and with the strongest desire to cast her arms about the writer it had been composed to be moving to a woman to any woman the old woman was entreated to bestow her blessing on the young one all in arcadia and let the young one nestle to the bosom she had not an idea of robbing she could not have had the idea else how could she have made the petition and in order to compliment a venerable dame on her pure friendship for a gentleman it was imperative to reject the idea besides after seeing the photograph of the baroness common civility insisted on the purity of her friendship nay in mercy to the poor gentleman friendship it must be a letter of reply from that noble lady was due possibly she had determined not to write but to act she was a lady of exalted birth a lady of the upper aristocracy who could if she would bring both a social and official pressure upon the general and it might be in motion now behind the scenes clotilde laid hold of her phantom baroness almost happy under the phantoms whisper that she need not despair you have been a little weak the phantom said to her and she acquiesced with a soft sniffle adding but dearest honoured lady you are a woman and know what our trials are when we are so persecuted o that i had your beautiful sedateness i do admire it madam i wish i could imitate she carried her dramatic ingenuousness farthel still by saying i have seen your photograph implying that the inimitable the much coveted air of composure breathed out of yonder presentment of her features for i cant call you good looking she said within herself for the satisfaction of her sense of candour of her sense of contrast as well and shutting her eyes she thought of the horrid penitent a harshfaced woman in confession must be the picture sent her swimmingly to the confessional where sat a man with his head in a hood and he soon heard enough of mixed substance to dash his hood almost his head off beauty may be immoderately frank in soul to the ghostly the black page comprised a very long list but put this on the white page says she to the surging father inside his box i loved alvan a sentence or two more fetches the alvanic man jumping out of the priest and so closely does she realize it that she has to hunt herself into a corner with the question whether she shall tell him she guessed him to be no other than her lover how could you expect a girl who is not a papist to come kneeling here she says and he answers with no matter what of a gallant kind in this manner her natural effervescence amused her sorrowful mind while gazing from her chamber window at the mountain sides across the valley where tourists in the autumnal season sweep up and down like a tidal river she had ceased to weep she had outwept the colour of her eyes and the consolation of weeping dressed in black to the throat she sat and waited the arrival of her phantom friend the baronessthat angel who proved her goodness in consenting to be the friend of alvans beloved because she was the true friend of alvan how cheap such a way of proving goodness clotilde did not consider she wanted it so the mountain heights were in dusty sunlight she had seen them day after day thinly lined on the dead sky inviting thunder and doomed to sultriness she looked on the garden of the house a desert under bee and butterfly looking beyond the garden she perceived her father on the glaring road and one with him the sight of whom did not flush her cheek or spring her heart to a throb though she pitied the poor boy he was useless to her utterly soon her indian bacchus was in her room and alone with her and at her feet her father had given him hope he came bearing eyes that were like hopes own and kneeling kissing her hands her knees her hair he seemed unaware that she was inanimate there was nothing imaginable in which he could be of use he was only another dustcloud of the sultry sameness she had been expecting a woman a tempest choral with sky and mountain and valley hollows as the overture to alvans appearance but he roused her with marko she had never felt her cowardice and his passionately beseeching trembling will you have me called up the tiger in the girl in spite of pity for his voice she retorted on her parents will i have you i you ask me what is my will it sounds oddly from you seeing that i wrote to you in lucerne what i would have and nothing has changed in me since then nothing my feeling for him is unaltered and everything you have heard of me was wrung out of me by my unhappiness the world is dead to me and all in it that is not sigismund alvan to you i am accustomed to speak every thought of my soul and i tell you the world and all it has is dead to me even my parentsi hate them marko pressed her hands if he loved her slavishly it was generously the wild thing he said was one of the frantic leaps of generosity in a heart that was gone to impulse i see it they have martyrized you i know you so well clotilde so then come to me come with me let me cherish you i will take you and rescue you from your people and should it be your positive wish to meet alvan again i myself will take you to him and then you may choose between us the generosity was evident there was nevertheless to a young woman realizing the position foreshadowed by such a project the suspicion of a slavish hope nestling among the circumstances in the background and this she was taught by the dangerous emotion of gratitude gaining on her and melting her to him she too had a slavish hope that was athirst and sinking and it flew at the throat of markos eager to satiate its vengeance for these long delays in the destroying of a weaker she left her chair and cried as you will what is it to me take me if you please take that glove it is the shape of my hand you have as much of me as is there my life is gone you or another but take this warning and my oath with it i swear to you that wherever i see sigismund alvan i go straight to him though the way be over you all of you lying dead beneath me the lift of incredulous horror in markos large black eyes excited her to a more savage imagination rejoice i should rejoice to see you all of you dead that i might walk across you safe from disturbance to get to him i love be under no delusion i love him better than the lives of any dear to me or my own i am his he is my faith my worship i am true to him i am i am you force my hand from me you take this miserable body but my soul is free to love him and to go to him when god gives me sight of him i am alvans eternally all your laws are mockeries you and my people and your priests and your lawmakers are shadows brainvapours let him beckonso you have your warning do what i may i cannot be called untrue and now let me be i want repose my head breaks i have been on the rack and i am in pieces marko clung to her hand said she was terrible and pitiless but clung the hand was nerveless it was her dear hand had her tongue been more venomous in wildness than the encounter with a weaker than herself made it be the holding of her hand would have been his antidote in him there was love for two clotilde allowed him to keep the hand assuring herself she was unconscious he did so he brought her peace he brought her old throning self back to her and he was handsome and tame as a leopardskin at her feet if she was doomed to reach to alvan through him at least she had warned him the vision of the truthfulness of her nature threw a celestial wan beam on her guilty destiny she patted his head and bade him leave her narrowing her shoulders on the breast to let it be seen that the dark household within was locked and shuttered he went he was good obedient humane he was generous exquisitely bred he brought her peace and he had been warned it is difficult in affliction to think of one who belongs to us as one to whom we owe a duty the unquestionably sincere and devoted lover is also in his candour a featureless person and though we would not punish him for his goodness we have the right to anticipate that it will be equal to every trial perhaps for the sake of peace after warning him her meditations tottered in dots but when the heart hungers behind such meditations that thinking without language is a dangerous habit for there will suddenly come a dash usurping the series of tentative dots which is nothing other than the dreadful thing resolved on as of necessity as naturally as the adventurous bowlegged infant pitches back from an excursion of two paces to mothers lap and not much less innocently within the mind it would appear the dash is a haven reached that would not be greeted if it stood out in words could we live without ourselves letting our animal do our thinking for us legibly we live with ourselves agreeably so long as his projects are phrased in his primitive tongue even though we have clearly apprehended what he means and though we sufficiently well understand the whither of our destination under his guidance no counsel can be saner than that the heart should be bidden to speak out in plain verbal speech within us for want of it clotildes short explorations in dotanddash land were of a kind to terrify her and yet they seemed not only unavoidable but foreshadowing of the unavoidable to come or possiblythe thought came to heralvan would keep his word and save her from worse by stepping to the altar between her and marko there calling on her to decide and quit the prince and his presence would breathe courage into her to go to him it set her looking to the altar as a prospect of deliverance her mother could not fail to notice a change in clotildes wintry face now that marko was among them her inference tallied with his report of their interview so she supposed the girl to have accepted more or less heartily markos forgiveness for him the girls eyes were soft and kind her gaze was through the eyelashes as one seeing a dream on a far horizon marko spoke of her cheerfully and was happy to call her his own but would not have her troubled by any ceremonial talk of their engagement so she had much to thank him for and her consciousness of the signal instance of ingratitude lying ahead in the darkness like a house mined beneath the smiling slumberer made her eager to show the real gratefulness and tenderness of her feelings this had the appearance of renewed affection consequently her parents lost much of their fear of the besieger outside and she was removed to the city two parties were in the city one favouring alvan and one abhorring the audacious jew together they managed to spread incredible reports of his doings which required little exaggeration to convince an enemy that he was a man with whom hostility could not be left to sleep the general heard of the mans pleading his cause in all directions to get pressure put upon him showing something like a devilish persuasiveness jew and demagogue though he was for there seemed to be a feeling abroad that the interview this howling lover claimed with clotilde ought to be granted the latest report spoke of him as off to the generals court for an audience of his official chief general von rudiger looked to his defences and he had sufficient penetration to see that the weakest point of them might be a submissive daughter a letter to clotilde from the baroness was brought to the house by a messenger the general thought over it the letter was by no means a seductive letter for a young lady to receive from such a person yet he did not anticipate the whole effect it would produce when ultimately he decided to give it to her being of course unaware of the noble style of clotildes address to the baroness he stipulated that there must be no reply to it except through him and clotilde had the coveted letter in her hands at
