distinction chapter x richard passes through his preliminary ordeal and is the occasion of an aphorism chapter xi in which the last act of the bakewell comedy is closed in a letter book chapter i some years ago a book was published under the title of the pilgrim's scrip it consisted of a selection of original aphorisms by an anonymous gentleman who in this bashful manner gave a bruised heart to the world he made no pretension to novelty our new thoughts have thrilled dead bosoms he wrote by which avowal it may be seen that youth had manifestly gone from him since he had ceased to be jealous of the ancients there was a half sigh floating through his pages for those days of intellectual coxcombry when ideas come to us affecting the embraces of virgins and swear to us they are ours alone and no one else have they ever visited and we believe them for an example of his ideas of the sex he said i expect that woman will be the last thing civilized by man some excitement was produced in the bosoms of ladies by so monstrous a scorn of them one adventurous person betook herself to the heralds' college and there ascertained that a griffin between two wheatsheaves which stood on the title page of the book formed the crest of sir austin absworthy bearne feverel baronet of raynham abbey in a certain western county folding thames a man of wealth and honour and a somewhat lamentable history the outline of the baronet's story was by no means new he had a wife and he had a friend his marriage was for love his wife was a beauty his friend was a sort of poet his wife had his whole heart and his friend all his confidence when he selected denzil somers from among his college chums it was not on account of any similarity of disposition between them but from his intense worship of genius which made him overlook the absence of principle in his associate for the sake of such brilliant promise denzil had a small patrimony to lead off with and that he dissipated before he left college thenceforth he was dependent upon his admirer with whom he lived filling a nominal post of bailiff to the estates and launching forth verse of some satiric and sentimental quality for being inclined to vice and occasionally and in a quiet way practising it he was of course a sentimentalist and a satirist entitled to lash the age and complain of human nature his earlier poems published under the pseudonym of diaper sandoe were so pure and bloodless in their love passages and at the same time so biting in their moral tone that his reputation was great among the virtuous who form the larger portion of the english book buying public election seasons called him to ballad poetry on behalf of the tory party diaper possessed undoubted fluency but did tittle though sir austin was ever expecting much of him a languishing inexperienced woman whose husband in mental and in moral stature is more than the ordinary height above her and who now that her first romantic admiration of his lofty bearing has worn off and her fretful little refinements of taste and sentiment are not instinctively responded to is thrown into no wholesome household collision with a fluent man fluent in prose and rhyme lady feverel when she first entered on her duties at raynham was jealous of her husband's friend by degrees she tolerated him in time he touched his guitar in her chamber and they played rizzio and mary together for i am not the first who found the name of mary fatal says a subsequent sentimental alliterative love poem of diaper's such was the outline of the story but the baronet could fill it up he had opened his soul to these two he had been noble love to the one and to the other perfect friendship he had bid them be brother and sister whom he loved and live a golden age with him at raynham in fact he had been prodigal of the excellences of his nature which it is not good to be and like timon he became bankrupt and fell upon bitterness the faithless lady was of no particular family an orphan daughter of an admiral who educated her on his half pay and her conduct struck but at the man whose name she bore after five years of marriage and twelve of friendship sir austin was left to his loneliness with nothing to ease his heart of love upon save a little baby boy in a cradle he forgave the man he put him aside as poor for his wrath the woman he could not forgive she had sinned every way simple ingratitude to a benefactor was a pardonable transgression for he was not one to recount and crush the culprit under the heap of his good deeds but her he had raised to be his equal and he judged her as his equal she had blackened the world's fair aspect for him in the presence of that world so different to him now he preserved his wonted demeanor and made his features a flexible mask mrs doria forey his widowed sister said that austin might have retired from his parliamentary career for a time and given up gaieties and that kind of thing her opinion founded on observation of him in public and private was that the light thing who had taken flight was but a feather on her brother's feverel heart and his ordinary course of life would be resumed there are times when common men cannot bear the weight of just so much hippias feverel one of his brothers thought him immensely improved by his misfortune if the loss of such a person could be so designated and seeing that hippias received in consequence free quarters at raynham and possession of the wing of the abbey she had inhabited it is profitable to know his thoughts if the baronet had given two or three blazing dinners in the great hall he would have deceived people generally as he did his relatives and intimates he was too sick for that fit only for passive acting the nursemaid waking in the night beheld a solitary figure darkening a lamp above her little sleeping charge and became so used to the sight as never to wake with a start one night she was strangely aroused by a sound of sobbing the baronet stood beside the cot in his long black cloak and travelling cap his fingers shaded a lamp and reddened against the fitful darkness that ever and anon went leaping up the wall she could hardly believe her senses to see the austere gentleman dead silent dropping tear upon tear before her eyes she lay stone still in a trance of terror and mournfulness mechanically counting the tears as they fell one by one the hidden face the fall and flash of those heavy drops in the light of the lamp he held the upright awful figure agitated at regular intervals like a piece of clockwork by the low murderous catch of his breath it was so piteous to her poor human nature that her heart began wildly palpitating involuntarily the poor girl cried out to him oh sir and fell a weeping sir austin turned the lamp on her pillow and harshly bade her go to sleep striding from the room forthwith he dismissed her with a purse the next day once when he was seven years old the little fellow woke up at night to see a lady bending over him he talked of this the next day but it was treated as a dream until in the course of the day his uncle algernon was driven home from lobourne cricket ground with a broken leg then it was recollected that there was a family ghost and though no member of the family believed in the ghost none would have given up a circumstance that testified to its existence for to possess a ghost is a distinction above titles algernon feverel lost his leg and ceased to be a gentleman in the guards of the other uncles of young richard cuthbert the sailor perished in a spirited boat expedition against a slaving negro chief up the niger some of the gallant lieutenant's trophies of war decorated the little boy's play shed at raynham and he bequeathed his sword to richard whose hero he was the diplomatist and beau vivian ended his flutterings from flower to flower by making an improper marriage as is the fate of many a beau and was struck out of the list of visitors algernon generally occupied the baronet's disused town house a wretched being dividing his time between horse and card exercise possessed it was said of the absurd notion that a man who has lost his balance by losing his leg may regain it by sticking to the bottle at least whenever he and his brother hippias got together they never failed to try whether one leg or two stood the bottle best much of a puritan as sir austin was in his habits he was too good a host and too thorough a gentleman to impose them upon his guests the brothers and other relatives might do as they would while they did not disgrace the name and then it was final they must depart to behold his countenance no more algernon feverel was a simple man who felt subsequent to his misfortune as he had perhaps dimly fancied it before that his career lay in his legs and was now irrevocably cut short he taught the boy boxing and shooting and the arts of fence and superintended the direction of his animal vigour with a melancholy vivacity the remaining energies of algernon's mind were devoted to animadversions on swift bowling he preached it over the county struggling through laborious literary compositions addressed to sporting newspapers on the decline of cricket it was algernon who witnessed and chronicled young richard's first fight which was with young tom blaize of belthorpe farm three years the boy's senior hippias feverel was once thought to be the genius of the family it was his ill luck to have strong appetites and a weak stomach and as one is not altogether fit for the battle of life who is engaged in a perpetual contention with his dinner hippias forsook his prospects at the bar and in the embraces of dyspepsia compiled his ponderous work on the fairy mythology of europe he had little to do with the hope of raynham beyond what he endured from his juvenile tricks a venerable lady known as great aunt grantley who had money to bequeath to the heir occupied with hippias the background of the house and shared her candles with him these two were seldom seen till the dinner hour for which they were all day preparing and probably all night remembering for the eighteenth century was an admirable trencherman and cast age aside while there was a dish on the table mrs doris foray was the eldest of the three sisters of the baronet a florid affable woman with fine teeth exceedingly fine light wavy hair a norman nose and a reputation for understanding men and that with these practical creatures always means the art of managing them she had married an expectant younger son of a good family who deceased before the fulfilment of his prospects and casting about in her mind the future chances of her little daughter and sole child clare she marked down a probability the far sight the deep determination the resolute perseverance of her sex where a daughter is to be provided for and a man to be overthrown instigated her to invite herself to raynham where with that daughter she fixed herself the other two feverel ladies were the wife of colonel wentworth and the widow of mr justice harley and the only thing remarkable about them was that they were mothers of sons of some distinction austin wentworth's story was of that wretched character which to be comprehended that justice should be dealt him must be told out and openly which no one dares now do for a fault in early youth redeemed by him nobly according to his light he was condemned to undergo the world's harsh judgment not for the faultfor its atonement married his mother's housemaid whispered mrs doria with a ghastly look and a shudder at young men of republican sentiments which he was reputed to entertain 'the compensation for injustice' says the 'pilgrim's scrip' is that in that dark ordeal we gather the worthiest around us and the baronet's fair friend lady blandish and some few true men and women held austin wentworth high he did not live with his wife and sir austin whose mind was bent on the future of our species reproached him with being barren to posterity while knaves were propagating the principal characteristic of the second nephew adrian harley was his sagacity he was essentially the wise youth both in counsel and in action in action the pilgrim's scrip observes wisdom goes by majorities adrian had an instinct for the majority and as the world invariably found him enlisted in its ranks his appellation of wise youth was acquiesced in without irony the wise youth then had the world with him but no friends nor did he wish for those troublesome appendages of success he caused himself to be required by people who could serve him feared by such as could injure not that he went out of the way to secure his end or risked the expense of a plot he did the work as easily as he ate his daily bread adrian was an epicurean one whom epicurus would have scourged out of his garden certainly an epicurean of our modern notions to satisfy his appetites without rashly staking his character was the wise youth's problem for life he had no intimates except gibbon and horace and the society of these fine aristocrats of literature helped him to accept humanity as it had been and was a supreme ironic procession with laughter of gods in the background why not laughter of mortals also adrian had his laugh in his comfortable corner he possessed peculiar attributes of a heathen god he was a disposer of men he was polished luxurious and happyat their cost he lived in eminent self content as one lying on soft cloud lapt in sunshine nor jove nor apollo cast eye upon the maids of earth with cooler fire of selection or pursued them in the covert with more sacred impunity and he enjoyed his reputation for virtue as something additional stolen fruits are said to be sweet undeserved rewards are exquisite the best of it was that adrian made no pretences he did not solicit the favourable judgment of the world nature and he attempted no other concealment than the ordinary mask men wear and yet the world would proclaim him moral as well as wise and the pleasing converse every way of his disgraced cousin austin in a word adrian harley had mastered his philosophy at the early age of one and twenty many would be glad to say the same at that age twice told they carry in their breasts a burden with which adrian's was not loaded mrs doria was nearly right about his heart a singular mishap at his birth possibly or before it had unseated that organ and shaken it down to his stomach where it was a much lighter nay an inspiring weight and encouraged him merrily onward throned there it looked on little that did not arrive to gratify it already that region was a trifle prominent in the person of the wise youth and carried as it were the flag of his philosophical tenets in front of him he was charming after dinner with men or with women delightfully sarcastic perhaps a little too unscrupulous in his moral tone but that his moral reputation belied him and it must be set down to generosity of disposition such was adrian harley another of sir austin's intellectual favourites chosen from mankind to superintend the education of his son at raynham adrian had been destined for the church he did not enter into orders he and the baronet had a conference together one day and from that time adrian became a fixture in the abbey his father died in his promising son's college term bequeathing him nothing but his legal complexion and adrian became stipendiary officer in his uncle's household a playfellow of richard's occasionally and the only comrade of his age that he ever saw was master ripton thompson the son of sir austin's solicitor a boy without a character a comrade of some description was necessary for richard was neither to go to school nor to college sir austin considered that the schools were corrupt and maintained that young lads might by parental vigilance be kept pretty secure from the serpent until eve sided with him a period that might be deferred he said he had a system of education for his son how it worked we shall see chapter ii october shone royally on richard's fourteenth birthday the brown beechwoods and golden birches glowed to a brilliant sun banks of moveless cloud hung about the horizon mounded to the west where slept the wind promise of a great day for raynham as it proved to be though not in the manner marked out already archery booths and cricketing tents were rising on the lower grounds towards the river whither the lads of bursley and lobourne in boats and in carts shouting for a day of ale and honour jogged merrily to match themselves anew and pluck at the lining laurel from each other's brows line manly britons the whole park was beginning to be astir and resound with holiday cries sir austin feverel a thorough good tory was no game preserver and could be popular whenever he chose which sir males papworth on the other side of the river a fast handed whig and terror to poachers never could be half the village of lobourne was seen trooping through the avenues of the park fiddlers and gipsies clamoured at the gates for admission white smocks and slate surmounted by hats of serious brim and now and then a scarlet cloak smacking of the old country dotted the grassy sweeps to the levels and all the time the star of these festivities was receding further and further and eclipsing himself with his reluctant serf ripton who kept asking what they were to do and where they were going and how late it was in the day and suggesting that the lads of lobourne would be calling out for them and sir austin requiring their presence without getting any attention paid to his misery or remonstrances for richard had been requested by his father to submit to medical examination like a boor enlisting for a soldier and he was in great wrath he was flying as though he would have flown from the shameful thought of what had been asked of him by and by he communicated his sentiments to ripton who said they were those of a girl an offensive remark remembering which richard after they had borrowed a couple of guns at the bailiff's farm and ripton had fired badly called his friend a fool feeling that circumstances were making him look wonderfully like one ripton lifted his head and retorted defiantly i'm not this angry contradiction so very uncalled for annoyed richard who was still smarting at the loss of the birds owing to ripton's bad shot and was really the injured party he therefore bestowed the abusive epithet on ripton anew and with increase of emphasis you shan't call me so then whether i am or not says ripton and sucks his lips this was becoming personal richard sent up his brows and stared at his defier an instant he then informed him that he certainly should call him so and would not object to call him so twenty times do it and see returns ripton rocking on his feet and breathing quick with a gravity of which only boys and other barbarians are capable richard went through the entire number stressing the epithet to increase the defiance and avoid monotony as he progressed while ripton bobbed his head every time in assent as it were to his comrade's accuracy and as a record for his profound humiliation the dog they had with them gazed at the extraordinary performance with interrogating wags of the tail twenty times duly and deliberately richard repeated the obnoxious word at the twentieth solemn iteration of ripton's capital shortcoming ripton delivered a smart back hander on richard's mouth and squared precipitately perhaps sorry when the deed was done for he was a kind hearted lad and as richard simply bowed in acknowledgment of the blow he thought he had gone too far he did not know the young gentleman he was dealing with richard was extremely cool shall we fight here he said anywhere you like replied ripton a little more into the wood i think we may be interrupted and richard led the way with a courteous reserve that somewhat chilled ripton's ardour for the contest on the skirts of the wood richard threw off his jacket and waistcoat and quite collected waited for ripton to do the same the latter boy was flushed and restless older and broader but not so tight limbed and well set the gods sole witnesses of their battle betted dead against him richard had mounted the white cockade of the feverels and there was a look in him that asked for tough work to extinguish his brows slightly lined upward at the temples converging to a knot about the well set straight nose his full grey eyes open nostrils and planted feet and a gentlemanly air of calm and alertness formed a spirited picture of a young combatant as for ripton he was all abroad and fought in school boy stylethat is he rushed at the foe head foremost and struck like a windmill he was a lumpy boy when he did hit he made himself felt but he was at the mercy of science to see him come dashing in blinking and puffing and whirling his arms abroad while the felling blow went straight between them you perceived that he was fighting a fight of desperation and knew it for the dreaded alternative glared him in the face that if he yielded he must look like what he had been twenty times calumniously called and he would die rather than yield and swing his windmill till he dropped poor boy he dropped frequently the gallant fellow fought for appearances and down he went the gods favour one of two parties prince turnus was a noble youth but he had not pallas at his elbow ripton was a capital boy he had no science he could not prove he was not a fool when one comes to think of it ripton did choose the only possible way and we should all of us have considerable difficulty in proving the negative by any other ripton came on the unerring fist again and again and if it was true as he said in short colloquial gasps that he required as much beating as an egg to be beaten thoroughly a fortunate interruption alone saved our friend from resembling that substance the boys heard summoning voices and beheld mr morton of poer hall and austin wentworth stepping towards them a truce was sounded jackets were caught up guns shouldered and off they trotted in concert through the depths of the wood not stopping till that and half a dozen fields and a larch plantation were well behind them when they halted to take breath there was a mutual study of faces ripton's was much discoloured and looked fiercer with its natural war paint than the boy felt nevertheless he squared up dauntlessly on the new ground and richard whose wrath was appeased could not refrain from asking him whether he had not really had enough never shouts the noble enemy well look here said richard appealing to common sense i'm tired of knocking you down i'll say you're not a fool if you'll give me your hand ripton demurred an instant to consult with honour who bade him catch at his chance he held out his hand there and the boys grasped hands and were fast friends ripton had gained his point and richard decidedly had the best of it so they were on equal ground both could claim a victory which was all the better for their friendship ripton washed his face and comforted his nose at a brook and was now ready to follow his friend wherever he chose to lead they continued to beat about for birds the birds on the raynham estates were found singularly cunning and repeatedly eluded the aim of these prime shots so they pushed their expedition into the lands of their neighbors in search of a stupider race happily oblivious of the laws and conditions of trespass unconscious too that they were poaching on the demesne of the notorious farmer blaize the free trade farmer under the shield of the papworths no worshipper of the griffin between two wheatsheaves destined to be much allied with richard's fortunes from beginning to end farmer blaize hated poachers and especially young chaps poaching who did it mostly from impudence he heard the audacious shots popping right and left and going forth to have a glimpse at the intruders and observing their size swore he would teach my gentlemen a thing lords or no lords richard had brought down a beautiful cock pheasant and was exulting over it when the farmer's portentous figure burst upon them cracking an avenging horsewhip his salute was ironical havin' good sport gentlemen are ye just bagged a splendid bird radiant richard informed him oh farmer blaize gave an admonitory flick of the whip just let me clap eye on't then say please interposed ripton who was not blind to doubtful aspects farmer blaize threw up his chin and grinned grimly please to you sir why my chap you looks as if ye didn't much mind what come t'yer nose i reckon you looks an old poacher you do tall ye what 'tis' he changed his banter to business that bird's mine now you jest hand him over and sheer off you dam young scoundrels i know ye and he became exceedingly opprobrious and uttered contempt of the name of feverel richard opened his eyes if you wants to be horsewhipped you'll stay where y'are continued the farmer giles blaize never stands nonsense then we'll stay quoth richard good so be't if you will have't have't my men as a preparatory measure farmer blaize seized a wing of the bird on which both boys flung themselves desperately and secured it minus the pinion that's your game cried the farmer here's a taste of horsewhip for ye i never stands nonsense and sweetch went the mighty whip well swayed the boys tried to close with him he kept his distance and lashed without mercy black blood was made by farmer blaize that day the boys wriggled in spite of themselves it was like a relentless serpent coiling and biting and stinging their young veins to madness probably they felt the disgrace of the contortions they were made to go through more than the pain but the pain was fierce for the farmer laid about from a practised arm and did not consider that he had done enough till he was well breathed and his ruddy jowl inflamed he paused to receive the remainder of the cock pheasant in his face take your beastly bird cried richard money my lads and interest roared the farmer lashing out again shameful as it was to retreat there was but that course open to them they decided to surrender the field look you big brute richard shook his gun hoarse with passion i'd have shot you if i'd been loaded mind if i come across you when i'm loaded you coward i'll fire the un english nature of this threat exasperated farmer blaize and he pressed the pursuit in time to bestow a few farewell stripes as they were escaping tight breeched into neutral territory at the hedge they parleyed a minute the farmer to inquire if they had had a mortal good tanning and were satisfied for when they wanted a further instalment of the same they were to come for it to belthorpe farm and there it was in pickle the boys meantime exploding in menaces and threats of vengeance on which the farmer contemptuously turned his back ripton had already stocked an armful of flints for the enjoyment of a little skirmishing richard however knocked them all out saying no gentlemen don't fling stones leave that to the blackguards just one shy at him pleaded ripton with his eye on farmer blaize's broad mark and his whole mind drunken with a sudden revelation of the advantages of light troops in opposition to heavies no said richard imperatively no stones and marched briskly away ripton followed with a sigh his leader's magnanimity was wholly beyond him a good spanking mark at the farmer would have relieved master ripton it would have done nothing to console richard feverel for the ignominy he had been compelled to submit to ripton was familiar with the rod a monster much despoiled of his terrors by intimacy birch fever was past with this boy the horrible sense of shame self loathing universal hatred impotent vengeance as if the spirit were steeped in abysmal blackness which comes upon a courageous and sensitive youth condemned for the first time to taste this piece of fleshly bitterness and suffer what he feels is a defilement ripton had weathered and forgotten he was seasoned wood and took the world pretty wisely not reckless of castigation as some boys become nor oversensitive as to dishonour as his friend and comrade beside him was richard's blood was poisoned he had the fever on him severely he would not allow stone flinging because it was a habit of his to discountenance it mere gentlemanly considerations has scarce shielded farmer blaize and certain very ungentlemanly schemes were coming to ghastly heads in the tumult of his brain rejected solely from their glaring impracticability even to his young intelligence a sweeping and consummate vengeance for the indignity alone should satisfy him something tremendous must be done and done without delay at one moment he thought of killing all the farmer's cattle next of killing him challenging him to single combat with the arms and according to the fashion of gentlemen but the farmer was a coward he would refuse then he richard feverel would stand by the farmer's bedside and rouse him rouse him to fight with powder and ball in his own chamber in the cowardly midnight where he might tremble but dare not refuse lord cried simple ripton while these hopeful plots were raging in his comrade's brain now sparkling for immediate execution and anon lapsing disdainfully dark in their chances of fulfilment how i wish you'd have let me notch him ricky i'm a safe shot i never miss i should feel quite jolly if i'd spanked him once we should have had the beat of him at that game i say and a sharp thought drew ripton's ideas nearer home i wonder whether my nose is as bad as he says where can i see myself to these exclamations richard was deaf and he trudged steadily forward facing but one object after tearing through innumerable hedges leaping fences jumping dykes penetrating brambly copses and getting dirty ragged and tired ripton awoke from his dream of farmer blaize and a blue nose to the vivid consciousness of hunger and this grew with the rapidity of light upon him till in the course of another minute he was enduring the extremes of famine and ventured to question his leader whither he was being conducted raynham was out of sight they were a long way down the valley miles from lobourne in a country of sour pools yellow brooks rank pasturage desolate heath solitary cows were seen the smoke of a mud cottage a cart piled with peat a donkey grazing at leisure oblivious of an unkind world geese by a horse pond gabbling as in the first loneliness of creation uncooked things that a famishing boy cannot possibly care for and must despise ripton was in despair where are you going to he inquired with a voice of the last time of asking and halted resolutely richard now broke his silence to reply anywhere anywhere ripton took up the moody word but ain't you awfully hungry he gasped vehemently in a way that showed the total emptiness of his stomach no was richard's brief response not hungry ripton's amazement lent him increased vehemence why you haven't had anything to eat since breakfast not hungry i declare i'm starving i feel such a gnawing i could eat dry bread and cheese richard sneered not for reasons that would have actuated a similar demonstration of the philosopher come cried ripton at all events tell us where you're going to stop richard faced about to make a querulous retort the injured and hapless visage that met his eye disarmed him the lad's nose though not exactly of the dreaded hue was really becoming discoloured to upbraid him would be cruel richard lifted his head surveyed the position and exclaiming here dropped down on a withered bank leaving ripton to contemplate him as a puzzle whose every new move was a worse perplexity chapter iii among boys there are laws of honour and chivalrous codes not written or formally taught but intuitively understood by all and invariably acted upon by the loyal and the true the race is not nearly civilized we must remember thus not to follow your leader whithersoever he may think proper to lead to back out of an expedition because the end of it frowns dubious and the present fruit of it is discomfort to quit a comrade on the road and return home without him these are tricks which no boy of spirit would be guilty of let him come to any description of mortal grief in consequence better so than have his own conscience denouncing him sneak some boys who behave boldly enough are not troubled by this conscience and the eyes and the lips of their fellows have to supply the deficiency they do it with just as haunting and even more horrible pertinacity than the inner voice and the result if the probation be not very severe and searching is the same the leader can rely on the faithfulness of his host the comrade is sworn to serve master ripton thompson was naturally loyal the idea of turning off and forsaking his friend never once crossed his mind though his condition was desperate and his friend's behaviour that of a bedlamite he announced several times impatiently that they would be too late for dinner his friend did not budge dinner seemed nothing to him there he lay plucking grass and patting the old dog's nose as if incapable of conceiving what a thing hunger was ripton took half a dozen turns up and down and at last flung himself down beside the taciturn boy accepting his fate now the chance that works for certain purposes sent a smart shower from the sinking sun and the wet sent two strangers for shelter in the lane behind the hedge where the boys reclined one was a travelling tinker who lit a pipe and spread a tawny umbrella the other was a burly young countryman pipeless and tentless they saluted with a nod and began recounting for each other's benefit the daylong doings of the weather as it had affected their individual experience and followed their prophecies both had anticipated and foretold a bit of rain before night and therefore both welcomed the wet with satisfaction a monotonous betweenwhiles kind of talk they kept droning in harmony with the still hum of the air from the weather theme they fell upon the blessings of tobacco how it was the poor man's friend his company his consolation his comfort his refuge at night his first thought in the morning better than a wife chuckled the tinker no curtain lecturin' with a pipe your pipe an't a shrew that be it the other chimed in your pipe doan't mak' ye out wi' all the cash saturday evenin' take one said the tinker in the enthusiasm of the moment handing a grimy short clay speed the plough filled from the tinker's pouch and continued his praises penny a day and there y'are primed better than a wife ha ha and you can get rid of it if ye wants for to and when ye wants added tinker so ye can speed the plough took him up and ye doan't want for to leastways t'other case i means pipe and continued tinker comprehending him perfectly it don't bring repentance after it not nohow master it doan't andspeed the plough cocked his eye it doan't eat up half the victuals your pipe doan't here the honest yeoman gesticulated his keen sense of a clincher which the tinker acknowledged and having so to speak sealed up the subject by saying the best thing that could be said the two smoked for some time in silence to the drip and patter of the shower ripton solaced his wretchedness by watching them through the briar hedge he saw the tinker stroking a white cat and appealing to her every now and then as his missus for an opinion or a confirmation and he thought that a curious sight speed the plough was stretched at full length with his boots in the rain and his head amidst the tinker's pots smoking profoundly contemplative the minutes seemed to be taken up alternately by the grey puffs from their mouths it was the tinker who renewed the colloquy said he times is bad his companion assented sure ly but it somehow comes round right resumed the tinker why look here where's the good o' moping i sees it all come round right and tight now i travels about i've got my beat 'casion calls me t'other day to newcastleeh coals ejaculated speed the plough sonorously coals echoed the tinker you ask what i goes there for mayhap never you mind one sees a mort o' life in my trade not for coals it isn't and i don't carry 'em there neither anyhow i comes back london's my mark says i i'll see a bit o' the sea and steps aboard a collier we were as nigh wrecked as the prophet paul awho's him the other wished to know read your bible said the tinker we pitched and tossed'tain't that game at sea 'tis on land i can tell ye i thinks down we're a going say your prayers bob tiles that was a night to be sure but god's above the devil and here i am ye see speed the plough lurched round on his elbow and regarded him indifferently d'ye call that doctrin' he bean't al'ays or i shoo'n't be scrapin' my heels wi' nothin' to do and what's warse nothin' to eat why look heer luck's luck and bad luck's the con trary varmer bollop t'other day has's rick burnt down next night his gran'ry's burnt what do he tak' and go and do he takes and goes and hangs unsel' and turns us out of his employ god warn't above the devil then i thinks or i can't make out the reckonin' the tinker cleared his throat and said it was a bad case and a darn'd bad case i'll tak' my oath on't cried speed the plough well look heer heer's another darn'd bad case i threshed for varmer blaize blaize o' beltharpe afore i goes to varmer bollop varmer blaize misses pilkins he swears our chaps steals pilkins 'twarn't me steals 'em what do he tak' and go and do he takes and tarns us off me and another neck and crop to scuffle about and starve for all he keers god warn't above the devil then i thinks not nohow as i can see the tinker shook his head and said that was a bad case also and you can't mend it added speed the plough it's bad and there it be but i'll tell ye what master bad wants payin' for he nodded and winked mysteriously bad has its wages as well's honest work i'm thinkin' varmer bollop i don't owe no grudge to varmer blaize i do and i shud like to stick a lucifer in his rick some dry windy night speed the plough screwed up an eye villainously he wants hittin' in the windjest where the pocket is master do varmer blaize and he'll cry out 'o lor'' varmer blaize will you won't get the better o' varmer blaize by no means as i makes out if ye doan't hit into him jest there the tinker sent a rapid succession of white clouds from his mouth and said that would be taking the devil's side of a bad case speed the plough observed energetically that if farmer blaize was on the other he should be on that side there was a young gentleman close by who thought with him the hope of raynham had lent a careless half compelled attention to the foregoing dialogue wherein a common labourer and a travelling tinker had propounded and discussed one of the most ancient theories of transmundane dominion and influence on mundane affairs he now started to his feet and came tearing through the briar hedge calling out for one of them to direct them the nearest road to bursley the tinker was kindling preparations for his tea under the tawny umbrella a loaf was set forth oh which ripton's eyes stuck in the edge fastened ravenously speed the plough volunteered information that bursley was a good three mile from where they stood and a good eight mile from lobourne i'll give you half a crown for that loaf my good fellow said richard to the tinker it's a bargain quoth the tinker eh missus his cat replied by humping her back at the dog the half crown was tossed down and ripton who had just succeeded in freeing his limbs from the briar prickly as a hedgehog collared the loaf those young squires be sharp set and no mistake said the tinker to his companion come we'll to bursley after 'em and talk it out over a pot o' beer speed the plough was nothing loath and in a short time they were following the two lads on the road to bursley while a horizontal blaze shot across the autumn and from the western edge of the rain cloud chapter iv search for the missing boys had been made everywhere over raynham and sir austin was in grievous discontent none had seen them save austin wentworth and mr morton the baronet sat construing their account of the flight of the lads when they were hailed and resolved it into an act of rebellion on the part of his son at dinner he drank the young heir's health in ominous silence adrian harley stood up in his place to propose the health his speech was a fine piece of rhetoric he warmed in it till after the ciceronic model inanimate objects were personified and richard's table napkin and vacant chair were invoked to follow the steps of a peerless father and uphold with his dignity the honour of the feverels austin wentworth whom a soldier's death compelled to take his father's place in support of the toast was tame after such magniloquence but the reply the thanks which young richard should have delivered in person were not forthcoming adrian's oratory had given but a momentary life to napkin and chair the company of honoured friends and aunts and uncles remotest cousins were glad to disperse and seek amusement in music and tea sir austin did his utmost to be hospitable cheerful and requested them to dance if he had desired them to laugh he would have been obeyed and in as hearty a manner how triste said mrs doria forey to lobourne's curate as that most enamoured automaton went through his paces beside her with professional stiffness one who does not suffer can hardly assent the curate answered basking in her beams ah you are good exclaimed the lady look at my clare she will not dance on her cousin's birthday with anyone but him what are we to do to enliven these people alas madam you cannot do for all what you do for one the curate sighed and wherever she wandered in discourse drew her back with silken strings to gaze on his enamoured soul he was the only gratified stranger present the others had designs on the young heir lady attenbury of longford house had brought her highly polished specimen of market ware the lady juliana jaye for a first introduction to him thinking he had arrived at an age to estimate and pine for her black eyes and pretty pert mouth the lady juliana had to pair off with a dapper papworth and her mama was subjected to the gallantries of sir miles who talked land and steam engines to her till she was sick and had to be impertinent in self defence lady blandish the delightful widow sat apart with adrian and enjoyed his sarcasms on the company by ten at night the poor show ended and the rooms were dark dark as the prognostics multitudinously hinted by the disappointed and chilled guests concerning the probable future of the hope of raynham little clare kissed her mama curtsied to the lingering curate and went to bed like a very good girl immediately the maid had departed little clare deliberately exchanged night attire for that of day she was noted as an obedient child her light was allowed to burn in her room for half an hour to counteract her fears of the dark she took the light and stole on tiptoe to richard's room no richard was there she peeped in further and further a trifling agitation of the curtains shot her back through the door and along the passage to her own bedchamber with extreme expedition she was not much alarmed but feeling guilty she was on her guard in a short time she was prowling about the passages again richard had slighted and offended the little lady and was to be asked whether he did not repent such conduct toward his cousin not to be asked whether he had forgotten to receive his birthday kiss from her for if he did not choose to remember that miss clare would never remind him of it and to night should be his last chance of a reconciliation thus she meditated sitting on a stair and presently heard richard's voice below in the hall shouting for supper master richard has returned old benson the butler tolled out intelligence to sir austin well said the baronet he complains of being hungry the butler hesitated with a look of solemn disgust let him eat heavy benson hesitated still more as he announced that the boy had called for wine it was an unprecedented thing sir austin's brows were portending an arch but adrian suggested that he wanted possibly to drink his birthday and claret was conceded the boys were in the vortex of a partridge pie when adrian strolled in to them they had now changed characters richard was uproarious he drank a health with every glass his cheeks were flushed and his eyes brilliant ripton looked very much like a rogue on the tremble of detection but his honest hunger and the partridge pie shielded him awhile from adrian's scrutinizing glance adrian saw there was matter for study if it were only on master ripton's betraying nose and sat down to hear and mark good sport gentlemen i trust to hear he began his quiet banter and provoked a loud peal of laughter from richard ha ha i say rip 'havin' good sport gentlemen are ye' you remember the farmer your health parson we haven't had our sport yet we're going to have some first rate sport oh well we haven't much show of birds we shot for pleasure and returned them to the proprietors you're fond of game parson ripton is a dead shot in what cousin austin calls the kingdom of 'would have done' and 'might have been' up went the birds and cries rip 'i've forgotten to load' oh horip some more claretdo just leave that nose of yours alone your health ripton thompson the birds hadn't the decency to wait for him and so parson it's their fault and not rip's you haven't a dozen brace at your feet what have you been doing at home cousin rady playing hamlet in the absence of the prince of denmark the day without you my dear boy must be dull you know 'he speaks can i trust what he says is sincere there's an edge to his smile that cuts much like a sneer' sandoe's poems you know the couplet mr rady why shouldn't i quote sandoe you know you like him rady but if you've missed me i'm sorry rip and i have had a beautiful day we've made new acquaintances we've seen the world i'm the monkey that has seen the world and i'm going to tell you all about it first there's a gentleman who takes a rifle for a fowling piece next there's a farmer who warns everybody gentleman and beggar off his premises next there's a tinker and a ploughman who think that god is always fighting with the devil which shall command the kingdoms of the earth the tinker's for god and the ploughman i'll drink your health ricky said adrian interrupting oh i forgot parsoni mean no harm adrian i'm only telling what i've heard no harm my dear boy returned adrian i'm perfectly aware that zoroaster is not dead you have been listening to a common creed drink the fire worshippers if you will here's to zoroaster then cried richard i say rippy we'll drink the fire worshippers to night won't we a fearful conspiratorial frown that would not have disgraced guido fawkes was darted back from the plastic features of master ripton richard gave his lungs loud play why what did you say about blaizes rippy didn't you say it was fun another hideous and silencing frown was ripton's answer adrian matched the innocent youths and knew that there was talking under the table see thought he this boy has tasted his first scraggy morsel of life today and already he talks like an old stager and has if i mistake not been acting too my respected chief he apostrophized sir austin combustibles are only the more dangerous for compression this boy will be ravenous for earth when he is let loose and very soon make his share of it look as foolish as yonder game piea prophecy adrian kept to himself uncle algernon shambled in to see his nephew before the supper was finished and his more genial presence brought out a little of the plot look here uncle said richard would you let a churlish old brute of a farmer strike you without making him suffer for it i fancy i should return the compliment my lad replied his uncle of course you would so would i and he shall suffer for it the boy looked savage and his uncle patted him down i've boxed his son i'll box him said richard shouting for more wine what boy is it old blaize has been putting you up never mind uncle the boy nodded mysteriously 'look there' adrian read on ripton's face he says 'never mind' and lets it out did we beat to day uncle yes boy and we'd beat them any day they bowl fair i'd beat them on one leg there's only watkins and featherdene among them worth a farthing we beat cries richard then we'll have some more wine and drink their healths the bell was rung wine ordered presently comes in heavy benson to say supplies are cut off one bottle and no more the captain whistled adrian shrugged the bottle however was procured by adrian subsequently he liked studying intoxicated urchins one subject was at richard's heart about which he was reserved in the midst of his riot too proud to inquire how his father had taken his absence he burned to hear whether he was in disgrace he led to it repeatedly and it was constantly evaded by algernon and adrian at last when the boy declared a desire to wish his father good night adrian had to tell him that he was to go straight to bed from the supper table young richard's face fell at that and his gaiety forsook him he marched to his room without another word adrian gave sir austin an able version of his son's behaviour and adventures dwelling upon this sudden taciturnity when he heard of his father's resolution not to see him the wise youth saw that his chief was mollified behind his moveless mask and went to bed and horace leaving sir austin in his study long hours the baronet sat alone the house had not its usual influx of feverels that day austin wentworth was staying at poer hall and had only come over for an hour at midnight the house breathed sleep sir austin put on his cloak and cap and took the lamp to make his rounds he apprehended nothing special but with a mind never at rest he constituted himself the sentinel of raynham he passed the chamber where the great aunt grantley lay who was to swell richard's fortune and so perform her chief business on earth by her door he murmured good creature you sleep with a sense of duty done and paced on reflecting she has not made money a demon of discord and blessed her he had his thoughts at hippias's somnolent door and to them the world might have subscribed a monomaniac at large watching over sane people in slumber thinks adrian harley as he hears sir austin's footfall and truly that was a strange object to seewhere is the fortress that has not one weak gate where the man who is sound at each particular angle ay meditates the recumbent cynic more or less mad is not every mother's son favourable circumstancesgood air good company two or three good rules rigidly adhered tokeep the world out of bedlam but let the world fly into a passion and is not bedlam the safest abode for it sir austin ascended the stairs and bent his steps leisurely toward the chamber where his son was lying in the left wing of the abbey at the end of the gallery which led to it he discovered a dim light doubting it an illusion sir austin accelerated his pace this wing had aforetime a bad character notwithstanding what years had done to polish it into fair repute the raynham kitchen stuck to tradition and preserved certain stories of ghosts seen there that effectually blackened it in the susceptible minds of new house maids and under crooks whose fears would not allow the sinner to wash his sins sir austin had heard of the tales circulated by his domestics underground he cherished his own belief but discouraged theirs and it was treason at raynham to be caught traducing the left wing as the baronet advanced the fact of a light burning was clear to him a slight descent brought him into the passage and he beheld a poor human candle standing outside his son's chamber at the same moment a door closed hastily he entered richard's room the boy was absent the bed was unpressed no clothes about nothing to show that he had been there that night sir austin felt vaguely apprehensive has he gone to my room to await me thought the father's heart something like a tear quivered in his arid eyes as he meditated and hoped this might be so his own sleeping room faced that of his son he strode to it with a quick heart it was empty alarm dislodged anger from his jealous heart and dread of evil put a thousand questions to him that were answered in air after pacing up and down his room he determined to go and ask the boy thompson as he called ripton what was known to him the chamber assigned to master ripton thompson was at the northern extremity of the passage and overlooked lobourne and the valley to the west the bed stood between the window and the door six austin found the door ajar and the interior dark to his surprise the boy thompson's couch as revealed by the rays of his lamp was likewise vacant he was turning back when he fancied he heard the sibilation of a whispering in the room sir austin cloaked the lamp and trod silently toward the window the heads of his son richard and the boy thompson were seen crouched against the glass holding excited converse together sir austin listened but he listened to a language of which he possessed not the key their talk was of fire and of delay of expected agrarian astonishment of a farmer's huge wrath of violence exercised upon gentlemen and of vengeance talk that the boys jerked out by fits and that came as broken links of a chain impossible to connect but they awake curiosity the baronet condescended to play the spy upon his son over lobourne and the valley lay black night and innumerable stars how jolly i feel exclaimed ripton inspired by claret and then after a luxurious pausei think that fellow has pocketed his guinea and cut his lucky richard allowed a long minute to pass during which the baronet waited anxiously for his voice hardly recognizing it when he heard its altered tones if he has i'll go and i'll do it myself you would returned master ripton well i'm hangedi say if you went to school wouldn't you get into rows perhaps he hasn't found the place where the box was stuck in i think he funks it i almost wish you hadn't done it upon my honoureh look there what was that that looked like somethingi say do you think we shall ever be found out master ripton intoned this abrupt interrogation verb seriously i don't think about it said richard all his faculties bent on signs from lobourne well but ripton persisted suppose we are found out if we are i must pay for it sir austin breathed the better for this reply he was beginning to gather a clue to the dialogue his son was engaged in a plot and was moreover the leader of the plot he listened for further enlightenment what was the fellow's name inquired ripton his companion answered tom bakewell i'll tell you what continued ripton you let it all clean out to your cousin and uncle at supperhow capital claret is with partridge pie what a lot i atedidn't you see me frown the young sensualist was in an ecstasy of gratitude to his late refection and the slightest word recalled him to it richard answered him yes and felt your kick it doesn't matter rady's safe and uncle never blabs well my plan is to keep it close you're never safe if you don'ti never drank much claret before ripton was off again won't i now though claret's my wine you know it may come out any day and then we're done for he rather incongruously appended richard only took up the business thread of his friend's rambling chatter and answered you've got nothing to do with it if we are haven't i though i didn't stick in the box but i'm an accomplice that's clear besides added ripton do you think i should leave you to bear it all on your shoulders i ain't that sort of chap ricky i can tell you sir austin thought more highly of the boy thompson still it looked a detestable conspiracy and the altered manner of his son impressed him strangely he was not the boy of yesterday to sir austin it seemed as if a gulf had suddenly opened between them the boy had embarked and was on the waters of life in his own vessel it was as vain to call him back as to attempt to erase what time has written with the judgment blood this child for whom he had prayed nightly in such a fervour and humbleness to god the dangers were about him the temptations thick on him and the devil on board piloting if a day had done so much what would years do were prayers and all the watchfulness he had expended of no avail a sensation of infinite melancholy overcame the poor gentlemana thought that he was fighting with a fate in this beloved boy he was half disposed to arrest the two conspirators on the spot and make them confess and absolve themselves but it seemed to him better to keep an unseen eye over his son sir austin's old system prevailed adrian characterized this system well in saying that sir austin wished to be providence to his son if immeasurable love were perfect wisdom one human being might almost impersonate providence to another alas love divine as it is can do no more than lighten the house it inhabitsmust take its shape sometimes intensify its narrownesscan spiritualize but not expel the old lifelong lodgers above stairs and below sir austin decided to continue quiescent the valley still lay black beneath the large autumnal stars and the exclamations of the boys were becoming fevered and impatient by and by one insisted that he had seen a twinkle the direction he gave was out of their anticipations again the twinkle was announced both boys started to their feet it was a twinkle in the right direction now he's done it cried richard in great heat now you may say old blaize'll soon be old blazes rip i hope he's asleep i'm sure he's snoringlook there he's alight fast enough he's dry he'll burni say ripton re assumed the serious intonation do you think they'll ever suspect us what if they do we must brunt it of course we will but i say i wish you hadn't given them the scent though i like to look innocent i can't when i know people suspect me lord look there isn't it just beginning to flare up the farmer's grounds were indeed gradually standing out in sombre shadows i'll fetch my telescope said richard ripton somehow not liking to be left alone caught hold of him no don't go and lose the best of it here i'll throw open the window and we can see the window was flung open and the boys instantly stretched half their bodies out of it ripton appearing to devour the rising flames with his mouth richard with his eyes opaque and statuesque stood the figure of the baronet behind them the wind was low dense masses of smoke hung amid the darting snakes of fire and a red malign light was on the neighbouring leafage no figures could be seen apparently the flames had nothing to contend against for they were making terrible strides into the darkness oh shouted richard overcome by excitement if i had my telescope we must have it let me go and fetch it i will the boys struggled together and sir austin stepped back as he did so a cry was heard in the passage he hurried out closed the chamber and came upon little clare lying senseless along the door chapter v in the morning that followed this night great gossip was interchanged between raynham and lobourne the village told how farmer blaize of belthorpe farm had his pick feloniously set fire to his stables had caught fire himself had been all but roasted alive in the attempt to rescue his cattle of which numbers had perished in the flames raynham counterbalanced arson with an authentic ghost seen by miss clare in the left wing of the abbeythe ghost of a lady dressed in deep mourning a scar on her forehead and a bloody handkerchief at her breast frightful to behold and no wonder the child was frightened out of her wits and lay in a desperate state awaiting the arrival of the london doctors it was added that the servants had all threatened to leave in a body and that sir austin to appease them had promised to pull down the entire left wing like a gentleman for no decent creature said lobourne could consent to live in a haunted house rumour for the nonce had a stronger spice of truth than usual poor little clare lay ill and the calamity that had befallen farmer blaize as regards his rick was not much exaggerated sir austin caused an account of it be given him at breakfast and appeared so scrupulously anxious to hear the exact extent of injury sustained by the farmer that heavy benson went down to inspect the scene mr benson returned and acting under adrian's malicious advice framed a formal report of the catastrophe in which the farmer's breeches figured and certain cooling applications to a part of the farmer's person sir austin perused it without a smile he took occasion to have it read out before the two boys who listened very demurely as to ordinary newspaper incident only when the report particularized the garments damaged and the unwonted distressing position farmer blaize was reduced to in his bed indecorous fit of sneezing laid hold of master ripton thompson and richard bit his lip and burst into loud laughter ripton joining him lost to consequences i trust you feel for this poor man said sir austin to his son somewhat sternly he saw no sign of feeling it was a difficult task for sir austin to keep his old countenance toward the hope of raynham knowing him the accomplice incendiary and believing the deed to have been unprovoked and wanton but he must do so he knew to let the boy have a fair trial against himself be it said moreover that the baronet's possession of his son's secret flattered him it allowed him to act and in a measure to feel like providence enabled him to observe and provide for the movements of creatures in the dark he therefore treated the boy as he commonly did and richard saw no change in his father to make him think he was suspected the youngster's game was not so easy against adrian adrian did not shoot or fish voluntarily he did nothing to work off the destructive nervous fluid or whatever it may be which is in man's nature so that two culprit boys once in his power were not likely to taste the gentle hand of mercy and richard and ripton paid for many a trout and partridge spared at every minute of the day ripton was thrown into sweats of suspicion that discovery was imminent by some stray remark or message from adrian he was as a fish with the hook in his gills mysteriously caught without having nibbled and dive into what depths he would he was sensible of a summoning force that compelled him perpetually towards the gasping surface which he seemed inevitably approaching when the dinner bell sounded there the talk was all of farmer blaize if it dropped adrian revived it and his caressing way with ripton was just such as a keen sportsman feels toward the creature that had owned his skill and is making its appearance for the world to acknowledge the same sir austin saw the manoeuvres and admired adrian's shrewdness but he had to check the young natural lawyer for the effect of so much masked examination upon richard was growing baneful this fish also felt the hook in his gills but this fish was more of a pike and lay in different waters where there were old stumps and black roots to wind about and defy alike strong pulling and delicate handling in other words richard showed symptoms of a disposition to take refuge in lies you know the grounds my dear boy adrian observed to him tell me do you think it easy to get to the rick unperceived i hear they suspect one of the farmer's turned off hands i tell you i don't know the grounds richard sullenly replied not adrian counterfeited courteous astonishment i thought mr thompson said you were over there yesterday ripton glad to speak the truth hurriedly assured adrian that it was not he had said so not you had good sport gentlemen hadn't you oh yes mumbled the wretched victims reddening as they remembered in adrian's slightly drawled rusticity of tone farmer blaize's first address to them i suppose you were among the fire worshippers last night too persisted adrian in some countries i hear they manage their best sport at night time and beat up for game with torches it must be a fine sight after all the country would be dull if we hadn't a rip here and there to treat us to a little conflagration a rip laughed richard to his friend's disgust and alarm at his daring you don't mean this rip do you mr thompson fire a rick i should as soon suspect you my dear boy you are aware young gentlemen that it is rather a serious thing eh in this country you know the landlord has always been the pet of the laws by the way adrian continued as if diverging to another topic you met two gentlemen of the road in your explorations yesterday magians now if i were a magistrate of the county like sir miles papworth my suspicions would light upon those gentlemen a tinker and a ploughman i think you said mr thompson not well say two ploughmen more likely two tinkers said richard oh if you wish to exclude the ploughmanwas he out of employ ripton with adrian's eyes inveterately fixed on him stammered an affirmative the tinker or the ploughman the ploughm ingenuous ripton looking about as if to aid himself whenever he was able to speak the truth beheld richard's face blackening at him and swallowed back half the word the ploughman adrian took him up cheerily then we have here a ploughman out of employ given a ploughman out of employ and a rick burnt the burning of a rick is an act of vengeance and a ploughman out of employ is a vengeful animal the rick and the ploughman are advancing to a juxtaposition motive being established we have only to prove their proximity at a certain hour and our ploughman voyages beyond seas is it transportation for rick burning inquired ripton aghast adrian spoke solemnly they shave your head you are manacled your diet is sour bread and cheese parings you work in strings of twenties and thirties arson is branded on your backs in an enormous a theological works are the sole literary recreation of the well conducted and deserving consider the fate of this poor fellow and what an act of vengeance brings him to do you know his name how should i know his name said richard with an assumption of innocence painful to see sir austin remarked that no doubt it would soon be known and adrian perceived that he was to quiet his line marvelling a little at the baronet's blindness to what was so clear he would not tell for that would ruin his influence with richard still he wanted some present credit for his discernment and devotion the boys got away from dinner and after deep consultation agreed upon a course of conduct which was to commiserate with farmer blaize loudly and make themselves look as much like the public as it was possible for two young malefactors to look one of whom already felt adrian's enormous a devouring his back with the fierceness of the promethean eagle and isolating him forever from mankind adrian relished their novel tactics sharply and led them to lengths of lamentation for farmer blaize do what they might the hook was in their gills the farmer's whip had reduced them to bodily contortions these were decorous compared with the spiritual writhings they had to perform under adrian's manipulation ripton was fast becoming a coward and richard a liar when next morning austin wentworth came over from poer hall bringing news that one mr thomas bakewell yeoman had been arrested on suspicion of the crime of arson and lodged in jail awaiting the magisterial pleasure of sir miles papworth austin's eye rested on richard as he spoke these terrible tidings the hope of raynham returned his look perfectly calm and had moreover the presence of mind not to look at ripton chapter vi as soon as they could escape the boys got together into an obscure corner of the park and there took counsel of their extremity whatever shall we do now asked ripton of his leader scorpion girt with fire was never in a more terrible prison house than poor ripton around whom the raging element he had assisted to create seemed to be drawing momently narrower circles there's only one chance said richard coming to a dead halt and folding his arms resolutely his comrade inquired with the utmost eagerness what that chance might be richard fixed his eyes on a flint and replied we must rescue that fellow from jail ripton gazed at his leader and fell back with astonishment my dear ricky but how are we to do it richard still perusing his flint replied we must manage to get a file in to him and a rope it can be done i tell you i don't care what i pay i don't care what i do he must be got out bother that old blaize exclaimed ripton taking off his cap to wipe his frenzied forehead and brought down his friend's reproof never mind old blaize now talk about letting it out look at you i'm ashamed of you you talk about robin hood and king richard why you haven't an atom of courage why you let it out every second of the day whenever rady begins speaking you start i can see the perspiration rolling down you are you afraidand then you contradict yourself you never keep to one story now follow me we must risk everything to get him out mind that and keep out of adrian's way as much as you can and keep to one story with these sage directions the young leader marched his companion culprit down to inspect the jail where tom bakewell lay groaning over the results of the super mundane conflict and the victim of it that he was in lobourne austin wentworth had the reputation of the poor man's friend a title he earned more largely ere he went to the reward god alone can give to that supreme virtue dame bakewell the mother of tom on hearing of her son's arrest had run to comfort him and render him what help she could but this was only sighs and tears and oh deary me which only perplexed poor tom who bade her leave an unlucky chap to his fate and not make himself a thundering villain whereat the dame begged him to take heart and he should have a true comforter and though it's a gentleman that's coming to you tomfor he never refuses a poor body said mrs bakewell it's a true christian tom and the lord knows if the sight of him mayn't be the saving of you for he's light to look on and a sermon to listen to he is tom was not prepossessed by the prospect of a sermon and looked a sullen dog enough when austin entered his cell he was surprised at the end of half an hour to find himself engaged in man to man conversation with a gentleman and a christian when austin rose to go tom begged permission to shake his hand take and tell young master up at the abbey that i an't the chap to peach he'll know he's a young gentleman as'll make any man do as he wants 'em he's a mortal wild young gentleman and i'm a ass that's where 'tis but i an't a blackguard tell him that sir this was how it came that austin eyed young richard seriously while he told the news at raynham the boy was shy of austin more than of adrian why he did not know but he made it a hard task for austin to catch him alone and turned sulky that instant austin was not clever like adrian he seldom divined other people's ideas and always went the direct road to his object so instead of beating about and setting the boy on the alert at all points crammed to the muzzle with lies he just said tom bakewell told me to let you know he does not intend to peach on you and left him richard repeated the intelligence to ripton who cried aloud that tom was a brick he shan't suffer for it said richard and pondered on a thicker rope and sharper file but will your cousin tell was ripton's reflection he richard's lip expressed contempt a ploughman refuses to peach and you ask if one of our family will ripton stood for the twentieth time reproved on this point the boys had examined the outer walls of the jail and arrived at the conclusion that tom's escape might be managed if tom had spirit and the rope and file could be anyway reached to him but to do this somebody must gain admittance to his cell and who was to be taken into their confidence try your cousin ripton suggested after much debate richard smiling wished to know if he meant adrian no no ripton hurriedly reassured him austin the same idea was knocking at richard's head let's get the rope and file first said he and to bursley they went for those implements to defeat the law ripton procuring the file at one shop and richard the rope at another with such masterly cunning did they lay their measures for the avoidance of every possible chance of detection and better to assure this in a wood outside bursley richard stripped to his shirt and wound the rope round his body tasting the tortures of anchorites and penitential friars that nothing should be risked to make tom's escape a certainty sir austin saw the marks at night as his son lay asleep through the half opened folds of his bed gown it was a severe stroke when after all their stratagems and trouble austin wentworth refused the office the boys had zealously designed for him time pressed in a few days poor tom would have to face the redoubtable sir miles and get committed for rumours of overwhelming evidence to convict him were rife about lobourne and farmer blaize's wrath was unappeasable again and again young richard begged his cousin not to see him disgraced and to help him in this extremity austin smiled on him my dear ricky said he there are two ways of getting out of a scrape a long way and a short way when you've tried the roundabout method and failed come to me and i'll show you the straight route richard was too entirely bent upon the roundabout method to consider this advice more than empty words and only ground his teeth at austin's unkind refusal he imparted to ripton at the eleventh hour that they must do it themselves to which ripton heavily assented on the day preceding poor tom's doomed appearance before the magistrate dame bakewell had an interview with austin who went to raynham immediately and sought adrian's counsel upon what was to be done homeric laughter and nothing else could be got out of adrian when he heard of the doings of these desperate boys how they had entered dame bakewell's smallest of retail shops and purchased tea sugar candles and comfits of every description till the shop was clear of customers how they had then hurried her into her little back parlour where richard had torn open his shirt and revealed the coils of rope and ripton displayed the point of a file from a serpentine recess in his jacket how they had then told the astonished woman that the rope she saw and the file she saw were instruments for the liberation of her son that there existed no other means on earth to save him they the boys having unsuccessfully attempted all how upon that richard had tried with the utmost earnestness to persuade her to disrobe and wind the rope round her own person and ripton had aired his eloquence to induce her to secrete the file how when she resolutely objected to the rope both boys began backing the file and in an evil hour she feared said dame bakewell she had rewarded the gracious permission given her by sir miles papworth to visit her son by tempting tom to file the law though thanks be to the lord dame bakewell added tom had turned up his nose at the file and so she had told young master richard who swore very bad for a young gentleman boys are like monkeys remarked adrian at the close of his explosions the gravest actors of farcical nonsense that the world possesses may i never be where there are no boys a couple of boys left to themselves will furnish richer fun than any troop of trained comedians no no art arrives at the artlessness of nature in matters of comedy you can't simulate the ape your antics are dull they haven't the charming inconsequence of the natural animal lack at these two think of the shifts they are put to all day long they know i know all about it and yet their serenity of innocence is all but unruffled in my presence you're sorry to think about the end of the business austin so am i i dread the idea of the curtain going down besides it will do ricky a world of good a practical lesson is the best lesson sinks deepest said austin but whether he learns good or evil from it is the question at stake adrian stretched his length at ease this will be his first nibble at experience old time's fruit hateful to the palate of youth for which season only hath it any nourishment experience you know coleridge's capital similemournful you call it well all wisdom is mournful 'tis therefore coz that the wise do love the comic muse their own high food would kill them you shall find great poets rare philosophers night after night on the broad grin before a row of yellow lights and mouthing masks why because all's dark at home the stage is the pastime of great minds that's how it comes that the stage is now down an age of rampant little minds my dear austin how i hate that cant of yours about an age of workyou and your mortons and your parsons brawnley rank radicals all of you base materialists what does diaper sandoe sing of your age of work listen 'an age of betty tit for tat an age of busy gabble an age that's like a brewer's vat fermenting for the rabble 'an age that's chaste in love but lax to virtuous abuses whose gentlemen and ladies wax too dainty for their uses 'an age that drives an iron horse of time and space defiant exulting in a giant's force and trembling at the giant 'an age of quaker hue and cut by mammon misbegotten see the mad hamlet mouth and strut and mark the kings of cotton 'from this unrest lo early wreck'd a future staggers crazy ophelia of the ages deck'd with woeful weed and daisy' murmuring get your parson brawnley to answer that adrian changed the resting place of a leg and smiled the age was an old battle field between him and austin my parson brawnley as you call him has answered it said austin not by hoping his best which would probably leave the age to go mad to your satisfaction but by doing it and he has and will answer your diaper sandoe in better verse as he confutes him in a better life you don't see sandoe's depth adrian replied consider that phrase 'ophelia of the ages' is not brawnley like a dozen other leading spiritsi think that's your term just the metaphysical hamlet to drive her mad she poor maid asks for marriage and smiling babes while my lord lover stands questioning the infinite and rants to the impalpable austin laughed marriage and smiling babes she would have in abundance if brawnley legislated wait till you know him he will be over at poer hall shortly and you will see what a man of the age means but now pray consult with me about these boys oh those boys adrian tossed a hand are there boys of the age as well as men not then boys are better than men boys are for all ages what do you think austin they've been studying latude's escape i found the book open in ricky's room on the top of jonathan wild jonathan preserved the secrets of his profession and taught them nothing so they're going to make a latude of mr tom bakewell he's to be bastille bakewell whether he will or no let them let the wild colt run free we can't help them we can only look on we should spoil the play adrian always made a point of feeding the fretful beast impatience with pleasantriesa not congenial diet and austin the most patient of human beings began to lose his self control you talk as if time belonged to you adrian we have but a few hours left us work first and joke afterwards the boy's fate is being decided now so is everybody's my dear austin yawned the epicurean yes but this boy is at present under our guardianshipunder yours especially not yet not yet adrian interjected languidly no getting into scrapes when i have him the leash young hound the collar young colt i'm perfectly irresponsible at present you may have something different to deal with when you are responsible if you think that i take my young prince as i find him coz a julian or a caracalla a constantine or a nero then if he will play the fiddle to a conflagration he shall play it well if he must be a disputatious apostate at any rate he shall understand logic and men and have the habit of saying his prayers then you leave me to act alone said austin rising without a single curb adrian gesticulated an acquiesced withdrawal i'm sure you would not still more certain you cannot do harm and be mindful of my prophetic words whatever's done old blaize will have to be bought off there's the affair settled at once i suppose i must go to the chief to night and settle it myself we can't see this poor devil condemned though it's nonsense to talk of a boy being the prime instigator austin cast an eye at the complacent languor of the wise youth his cousin and the little that he knew of his fellows told him he might talk forever here and not be comprehended the wise youth's two ears were stuffed with his own wisdom one evil only adrian dreaded it was clear the action of the law as he was moving away adrian called out to him stop austin there don't be anxious you invariably take the glum side i've done something never mind what if you go down to belthorpe be civil but not obsequious you remember the tactics of scipio africanus against the punic elephants well don't say a wordin thine ear coz i've turned master blaize's elephants if they charge 'twill bye a feint and back to the destruction of his serried ranks you understand not well 'tis as well only let none say that i sleep if i must see him to night i go down knowing he has not got us in his power the wise youth yawned and stretched out a hand for any book that might be within his reach austin left him to look about the grounds for richard chapter vii a little laurel shaded temple of white marble looked out on the river from a knoll bordering the raynham beechwoods and was dubbed by adrian daphne's bower to this spot richard had retired and there austin found him with his head buried in his hands a picture of desperation whose last shift has been defeated he allowed austin to greet him and sit by him without lifting his head perhaps his eyes were not presentable where's your friend austin began gone was the answer sounding cavernous from behind hair and fingers an explanation presently followed that a summons had come for him in the morning from mr thompson and that mr ripton had departed against his will in fact ripton had protested that he would defy his parent and remain by his friend in the hour of adversity and at the post of danger sir austin signified his opinion that a boy should obey his parent by giving orders to benson for ripton's box to be packed and ready before noon and ripton's alacrity in taking the baronet's view of filial duty was as little feigned as his offer to richard to throw filial duty to the winds he rejoiced that the fates had agreed to remove him from the very hot neighbourhood of lobourne while he grieved like an honest lad to see his comrade left to face calamity alone the boys parted amicably as they could hardly fail to do when ripton had sworn fealty to the feverals with a warmth that made him declare himself bond and due to appear at any stated hour and at any stated place to fight all the farmers in england on a mandate from the heir of the house so you're left alone said austin contemplating the boy's shapely head i'm glad of it we never know what's in us till we stand by ourselves there appeared to be no answer forthcoming vanity however replied at last he wasn't much support remember his good points now he's gone ricky oh he was staunch the boy grumbled and a staunch friend is not always to be found now have you tried your own way of rectifying this business ricky i have done everything and failed there was a pause and then the deep toned evasion tom bakewell's a coward i suppose poor fellow said austin in his kind way he doesn't want to get into a deeper mess i don't think he's a coward he is a coward cried richard do you think if i had a file i would stay in prison i'd be out the first night and he might have had the rope tooa rope thick enough for a couple of men his size and weight ripton and i and ned markham swung on it for an hour and it didn't give way he's a coward and deserves his fate i've no compassion for a coward nor i much said austin richard had raised his head in the heat of his denunciation of poor tom he would have hidden it had he known the thought in austin's clear eyes while he faced them i never met a coward myself austin continued i have heard of one or two one let an innocent man die for him how base exclaimed the boy yes it was bad austin acquiesced bad richard scorned the poor contempt how i would have spurned him he was a coward i believe he pleaded the feelings of his family in his excuse and tried every means to get the man off i have read also in the confessions of a celebrated philosopher that in his youth he committed some act of pilfering and accused a young servant girl of his own theft who was condemned and dismissed for it pardoning her guilty accuser what a coward shouted richard and he confessed it publicly you may read it yourself he actually wrote it down and printed it you have the book in your father's library would you have done so much richard faltered no he admitted that he never could have told people then who is to call that man a coward said austin he expiated his cowardice as all who give way in moments of weakness and are not cowards must do the coward chooses to think 'god does not see' i shall escape' he who is not a coward and has succumbed knows that god has seen all and it is not so hard a task for him to make his heart bare to the world worse i should fancy it to know myself an impostor when men praised me young richard's eyes were wandering on austin's gravely cheerful face a keen intentness suddenly fixed them and he dropped his head so i think you're wrong ricky in calling this poor tom a coward because he refuses to try your means of escape austin resumed a coward hardly objects to drag in his accomplice and where the person involved belongs to a great family it seems to me that for a poor plough lad to volunteer not to do so speaks him anything but a coward richard was dumb altogether to surrender his rope and file was a fearful sacrifice after all the time trepidation and study he had spent on those two saving instruments if he avowed tom's manly behaviour richard feverel was in a totally new position whereas by keeping tom a coward richard feverel was the injured one and to seem injured is always a luxury sometimes a necessity whether among boys or men in austin the magian conflict would not have lasted long he had but a blind notion of the fierceness with which it raged in young richard happily for the boy austin was not a preacher a single instance a cant phrase a fatherly manner might have wrecked him by arousing ancient or latent opposition the born preacher we feel instinctively to be our foe he may do some good to the wretches that have been struck down and lie gasping on the battlefield he rouses antagonism in the strong richard's nature left to itself wanted little more than an indication of the proper track and when he said tell me what i can do austin he had fought the best half of the battle his voice was subdued austin put his hand on the boy's shoulder you must go down to farmer blaize well said richard sullenly divining the deed of penance you'll know what to say to him when you're there the boy bit his lip and frowned ask a favour of that big brute austin i can't just tell him the whole case and that you don't intend to stand by and let the poor fellow suffer without a friend to help him out of his scrape but austin the boy pleaded i shall have to ask him to help off tom bakewell how can i ask him when i hate him austin bade him go and think nothing of the consequences till he got there richard groaned in soul you've no pride austin perhaps not you don't know what it is to ask a favour of a brute you hate richard stuck to that view of the case and stuck to it the faster the more imperatively the urgency of a movement dawned upon him why continued the boy i shall hardly be able to keep my fists off him surely you've punished him enough boy said austin he struck me richard's lip quivered he dared not come at me with his hands he struck me with a whip he'll be telling everybody that he horsewhipped me and that i went down and begged his pardon begged his pardon a feverel beg his pardon oh if i had my will the man earns his bread ricky you poached on his grounds he turned you off and you fired his rick and i'll pay him for his loss and i won't do any more because you won't ask a favour of him no i will not ask a favour of him austin looked at the boy steadily you prefer to receive a favour from poor tom bakewell at austin's enunciation of this obverse view of the matter richard raised his brow dimly a new light broke in upon him favour from tom bakewell the ploughman how do you mean austin to save yourself an unpleasantness you permit a country lad to sacrifice himself for you i confess i should not have so much pride pride shouted richard stung by the taunt and set his sight hard at the blue ridges of the hills not knowing for the moment what else to do austin drew a picture of tom in prison and repeated tom's volunteer statement the picture though his intentions were far from designing it so had to richard whose perception of humour was infinitely keener a horrible chaw bacon smack about it visions of a grinning lout open from ear to ear unkempt coarse splay footed rose before him and afflicted him with the strangest sensations of disgust and comicality mixed up with pity and remorsea sort of twisted pathos there lay tom hobnail tom a bacon munching reckless beer swilling animal and yet a man a dear brave human heart notwithstanding capable of devotion and unselfishness the boy's better spirit was touched and it kindled his imagination to realize the abject figure of poor clodpole tom and surround it with a halo of mournful light his soul was alive feelings he had never known streamed in upon him as from an ethereal casement an unwonted tenderness an embracing humour a consciousness of some ineffable glory an irradiation of the features of humanity all this was in the bosom of the boy and through it all the vision of an actual hob nail tom coarse unkempt open from ear to ear whose presence was a finger of shame to him and an oppression of clodpole yet toward whom he felt just then a loving kindness beyond what he felt for any living creature he laughed at him and wept over him he prized him while he shrank from him it was a genial strife of the angel in him with constituents less divine but the angel was uppermost and led the vanextinguished loathing humanized laughter transfigured pridepride that would persistently contemplate the corduroys of gaping tom and cry to richard in the very tone of adrian's ironic voice behold your benefactor austin sat by the boy unaware of the sublimer tumult he had stirred little of it was perceptible in richard's countenance the lines of his mouth were slightly drawn his eyes hard set into the distance he remained thus many minutes finally he jumped to his legs saying i'll go at once to old blaize and tell him austin grasped his hand and together they issued out of daphne's bower in the direction of lobourne chapter viii farmer blaize was not so astonished at the visit of richard feverel as that young gentleman expected him to be the farmer seated in his easy chair in the little low roofed parlour of an old fashioned farm house with a long clay pipe on the table at his elbow and a veteran pointer at his feet had already given audience to three distinguished members of the feverel blood who had come separately according to their accustomed secretiveness and with one object in the morning it was sir austin himself shortly after his departure arrived austin wentworth close on his heels algernon known about lobourne as the captain popular wherever he was known farmer blaize reclined m considerable elation he had brought these great people to a pretty low pitch he had welcomed them hospitably as a british yeoman should but not budged a foot in his demands not to the baronet not to the captain not to good young mr wentworth for farmer blaize was a solid englishman and on hearing from the baronet a frank confession of the hold he had on the family he determined to tighten his hold and only relax it in exchange for tangible advantagescompensation to his pocket his wounded person and his still more wounded sentiments the total indemnity being in round figures three hundred pounds and a spoken apology from the prime offender young mister richard even then there was a reservation provided the farmer said nobody had been tampering with any of his witnesses in that ease farmer blaize declared the money might go and he would transport tom bakewell as he had sworn he would and it goes hard too with an accomplice by law added the farmer knocking the ashes leisurely out of his pipe he had no wish to bring any disgrace anywhere he respected the inmates of raynham abbey as in duty bound he should be sorry to see them in trouble only no tampering with his witnesses he was a man for law rank was much money was much but law was more in this country law was above the sovereign to tamper with the law was treason to the realm i come to you direct the baronet explained i tell you candidly what way i discovered my son to be mixed up in this miserable affair i promise you indemnity for your loss and an apology that shall i trust satisfy your feelings assuring you that to tamper with witnesses is not the province of a feverel all i ask of you in return is not to press the prosecution at present it rests with you i am bound to do all that lies in my power for this imprisoned man how and wherefore my son was prompted to suggest or assist in such an act i cannot explain for i do not know hum said the farmer i think i do you know the cause sir austin stared i beg you to confide it to me 'least i can pretty nigh neighbour it with a gues said the farmer we an't good friends sir austin me and your son just nownot to say cordial i ye see sir austin i'm a man as don't like young gentlemen a poachin' on his grounds without his permissionin special when birds is plentiful on their own it appear he do like it consequently i has to flick this whipas them fellers at the races all in this 'ere ring's mine as much as to say and who's been hit he's had fair warnin' i'm sorry for't but that's just the case sir austin retired to communicate with his son when he should find him algernon's interview passed off in ale and promises he also assured farmer blaize that no feverel could be affected by his proviso no less did austin wentworth the farmer was satisfied money's safe i know said he now for the 'pology and farmer blaize thrust his legs further out and his head further back the farmer naturally reflected that the three separate visits had been conspired together still the baronet's frankness and the baronet's not having reserved himself for the third and final charge puzzled him he was considering whether they were a deep or a shallow lot when young richard was announced a pretty little girl with the roses of thirteen springs in her cheeks and abundant beautiful bright tresses tripped before the boy and loitered shyly by the farmer's arm chair to steal a look at the handsome new comer she was introduced to richard as the farmer's niece lucy desborough the daughter of a lieutenant in the royal navy and what was better though the farmer did not pronounce it so loudly a real good girl neither the excellence of her character nor her rank in life tempted richard to inspect the little lady he made an awkward bow and sat down the farmer's eyes twinkled her father he continued fought and fell for his coontry a man as fights for's coontry's a right to hould up his headay with any in the land desb'roughs o' dorset d'ye know that family master feverel richard did not know them and by his air did not desire to become acquainted with any offshoot of that family she can make puddens and pies the farmer went on regardless of his auditor's gloom she's a lady as good as the best of 'em i don't care about their being catholicsthe desb'roughs o' dorset are gentlemen and she's good for the pianer too she strums to me of evenin's i'm for the old tunes she's for the new gal like while she's with me she shall be taught things use'l she can parley voo a good 'un and foot it as it goes been in france a couple of year i prefer the singin' of 't to the talkin' of 't come luce toon upeh ye wun't that song abort the viffendeera femalefarmer blaize volunteered the translation of the titlewho wears theyou guess what and marches along with the french sojers a pretty brazen bit o' goods i sh'd fancy mademoiselle lucy corrected her uncle's french but objected to do more the handsome cross boy had almost taken away her voice for speech as it was and sing in his company she could not so she stood a hand on her uncle's chair to stay herself from falling while she wriggled a dozen various shapes of refusal and shook her head at the farmer with fixed eyes aha laughed the farmer dismissing her they soon learn the difference 'twixt the young 'un and the old 'un go along luce and learn yer lessons for to morrow reluctantly the daughter of the royal navy glided away her uncle's head followed her to the door where she dallied to catch a last impression of the young stranger's lowering face and darted through farmer blaize laughed and chuckled she an't so fond of her uncle as that every day not that she an't a good nursethe kindest little soul you'd meet of a winter's walk she'll read t' ye and make drinks and sing too if ye likes it and she won't be tired a obstinate good 'un she be bless her the farmer may have designed by these eulogies of his niece to give his visitor time to recover his composure and establish a common topic his diversion only irritated and confused our shame eaten youth richard's intention had been to come to the farmer's threshold to summon the farmer thither and in a loud and haughty tone then and there to take upon himself the whole burden of the charge against tom bakewell he had strayed during his passage to belthorpe somewhat back to his old nature and his being compelled to enter the house of his enemy sit in his chair and endure an introduction to his family was more than he bargained for he commenced blinking hard in preparation for the horrible dose to which delay and the farmer's cordiality added inconceivable bitters farmer blaize was quite at his ease nowise in a hurry he spoke of the weather and the harvest of recent doings up at the abbey glanced over that year's cricketing hoped that no future feverel would lose a leg to the game richard saw and heard arson in it all he blinked harder as he neared the cup in a moment of silence he seized it with a gasp mr blaize i have come to tell you that i am the person who set fire to your rick the other night an odd consternation formed about the farmer's mouth he changed his posture and said ay that's what ye're come to tell me sir yes said richard firmly and that be all yes richard reiterated the farmer again changed his posture then my lad ye've come to tell me a lie farmer blaize looked straight at the boy undismayed by the dark flush of ire he had kindled you dare to call me a liar cried richard starting up i say the farmer renewed his first emphasis and smacked his thigh thereto that's a lie richard held out his clenched fist you have twice insulted me you have struck me you have dared to call me a liar i would have apologizedi would have asked your pardon to have got off that fellow in prison yes i would have degraded myself that another man should not suffer for my deed quite proper interposed the farmer and you take this opportunity of insulting me afresh you're a coward sir nobody but a coward would have insulted me in his own house sit ye down sit ye down young master said the farmer indicating the chair and cooling the outburst with his hand sit ye down don't ye be hasty if ye hadn't been hasty t'other day we sh'd a been friends yet sit ye down sir i sh'd be sorry to reckon you out a liar mr feverel or anybody o' your name i respects yer father though we're opp'site politics i'm willin' to think well o' you what i say is that as you say an't the trewth mind i don't like you none the worse for't but it an't what is that's all you knows it as well's i richard disdaining to show signs of being pacified angrily reseated himself the farmer spoke sense and the boy after his late interview with austin had become capable of perceiving vaguely that a towering passion is hardly the justification for a wrong course of conduct come continued the farmer not unkindly what else have you to say here was the same bitter cup he had already once drained brimming at richard's lips again alas poor human nature that empties to the dregs a dozen of these evil drinks to evade the single one which destiny less cruel had insisted upon the boy blinked and tossed it off i came to say that i regretted the revenge i had taken on you for your striking me farmer blaize nodded and now ye've done young gentleman still another cupful i should be very much obliged richard formally began but his stomach was turned he could but sip and sip and gather a distaste which threatened to make the penitential act impossible very much obliged he repeated much obliged if you would be so kind and it struck him that had he spoken this at first he would have given it a wording more persuasive with the farmer and more worthy of his own pride more honest in fact for a sense of the dishonesty of what he was saying caused him to cringe and simulate humility to deceive the farmer and the more he said the less he felt his words and feeling them less he inflated them more so kind he stammered so kind fancy a feverel asking this big brute to be so kind as to do me the favour me the favour to exert yourself it's all to please austin to endeavour tohem to there's no saying it the cup was full as ever richard dashed at it again what i came to ask is whether you would have the kindness to try what you could do what an infamous shame to have to beg like this do to savedo to ensurewhether you would have the kindness it seemed out of all human power to gulp it down the draught grew more and more abhorrent to proclaim one's iniquity to apologize for one's wrongdoing thus much could be done but to beg a favour of the offended partythat was beyond the self abasement any feverel could consent to pride however whose inevitable battle is against itself drew aside the curtains of poor tom's prison crying a second time behold your benefactor and with the words burning in his ears richard swallowed the dose well then i want you mr blaizeif you don't mindwill you help me to get this man bakewell off his punishment to do farmer blaize justice he waited very patiently for the boy though he could not quite see why he did not take the gate at the first offer oh said he when he heard and had pondered on the request hum ha we'll see about it t'morrow but if he's innocent you know we shan't mak'n guilty it was i did it richard declared the farmer's half amused expression sharpened a bit so young gentleman and you're sorry for the night's work i shall see that you are paid the full extent of your losses thank'ee said the farmer drily and if this poor man is released to morrow i don't care what the amount is farmer blaize deflected his head twice in silence bribery one motion expressed corruption the other now said he leaning forward and fixing his elbows on his knees while he counted the case at his fingers' ends excuse the liberty but wishin' to know where this 'ere money's to come from i sh'd like jest t'ask if so be sir austin know o' this my father knows nothing of it replied richard the farmer flung back in his chair lie number two said his shoulders soured by the british aversion to being plotted at and not dealt with openly and ye've the money ready young gentleman i shall ask my father for it and he'll hand't out certainly he will richard had not the slightest intention of ever letting his father into his counsels a good three hundred pounds ye know the farmer suggested no consideration of the extent of damages and the size of the sum affected young richard who said boldly he will not object when i tell him i want that sum it was natural farmer blaize should be a trifle suspicious that a youth's guarantee would hardly be given for his father's readiness to disburse such a thumping bill unless he had previously received his father's sanction and authority hum said he why not 'a told him before the farmer threw an objectionable shrewdness into his query that caused richard to compress his mouth and glance high farmer blaize was positive 'twas a lie hum ye still hold to't you fired the rick he asked the blame is mine quoth richard with the loftiness of a patriot of old rome na na the straightforward briton put him aside ye did't or ye didn't do't did ye do't or no thrust in a corner richard said i did it farmer blaize reached his hand to the bell it was answered in an instant by little lucy who received orders to fetch in a dependent at belthorpe going by the name of the bantam and made her exit as she had entered with her eyes on the young stranger now said the farmer these be my principles i'm a plain man mr feverel above board with me and you'll find me handsome try to circumvent me and i'm a ugly customer i'll show you i've no animosity your father paysyou apologize that's enough for me let tom bakewell fight't out with the law and i'll look on the law wasn't on the spot i suppose so the law ain't much witness but i am leastwise the bantam is i tell you young gentleman the bantam saw't it's no moral use whatever your denyin' that ev'dence and where's the good sir i ask what comes of 't whether it be you or whether it be tom bakewellain't all one if i holds back ain't it sim'lar it's the trewth i want and here't comes added the farmer as miss lucy ushered in the bantam who presented a curious figure for that rare divinity to enliven chapter ix in build of body gait and stature giles jinkson the bantam was a tolerably fair representative of the punic elephant whose part with diverse anticipations the generals of the blaize and feverel forces from opposing ranks expected him to play giles surnamed the bantam on account of some forgotten sally of his youth or infancy moved and looked elephantine it sufficed that giles was well fed to assure that giles was faithfulif uncorrupted the farm which supplied to him ungrudging provender had all his vast capacity for work in willing exercise the farmer who held the farm his instinct reverenced as the fountain source of beef and bacon to say nothing of beer which was plentiful at belthorpe and good this farmer blaize well knew and he reckoned consequently that here was an animal always to be relied ona sort of human composition out of dog horse and bull a cut above each of these quadrupeds in usefulness and costing proportionately more but on the whole worth the money and therefore invaluable as everything worth its money must be to a wise man when the stealing of grain had been made known at belthorpe the bantam a fellow thresher with tom bakewell had shared with him the shadow of the guilt farmer blaize if he hesitated which to suspect did not debate a second as to which he would discard and when the bantam said he had seen tom secreting pilkins in a sack farmer blaize chose to believe him and off went poor tom told to rejoice in the clemency that spared his appearance at sessions the bantam's small sleepy orbits saw many things and just at the right moment it seemed he was certainly the first to give the clue at belthorpe on the night of the conflagration and he may therefore have seen poor tom retreating stealthily from the scene as he averred he did lobourne had its say on the subject rustic lobourne hinted broadly at a young woman in the case and moreover told a tale of how these fellow threshers had in noble rivalry one day turned upon each other to see which of the two threshed the best whereof the bantam still bore marks and malice it was said however there he stood and tugged his forelocks to the company and if truth really had concealed herself in him she must have been hard set to find her unlikeliest hiding place now said the farmer marshalling forth his elephant with the confidence of one who delivers his ace of trumps tell this young gentleman what ye saw on the night of the fire bantam the bantam jerked a bit of a bow to his patron and then swung round fully obscuring him from richard richard fixed his eyes on the floor while the bantam in rudest doric commenced his narrative knowing what was to come and thoroughly nerved to confute the main incident richard barely listened to his barbarous locution but when the recital arrived at the point where the bantam affirmed he had seen t'm baak'll wi's owen hoies richard faced him and was amazed to find himself being mutely addressed by a series of intensely significant grimaces signs and winks what do you mean why are you making those faces at me cried the boy indignantly farmer blaize leaned round the bantam to have a look at him and beheld the stolidest mask ever given to man bain't makin' no faces at nobody growled the sulky elephant the farmer commanded him to face about and finish a see t'm baak'll the bantam recommenced and again the contortions of a horrible wink were directed at richard the boy might well believe this churl was lying and he did and was emboldened to exclaim you never saw tom bakewell set fire to that rick the bantam swore to it grimacing an accompaniment i tell you said richard i put the lucifers there myself the suborned elephant was staggered he meant to telegraph to the young gentleman that he was loyal and true to certain gold pieces that had been given him and that in the right place and at the right time he should prove so why was he thus suspected why was he not understood a thowt i see 'un then muttered the bantam trying a middle course this brought down on him the farmer who roared thought ye thought what d'ye mean speak out and don't be thinkin' thought what the devil's that how could he see who it was on a pitch dark night richard put in thought the farmer bellowed louder thoughtdevil take ye when ye took ye oath on't hulloa what are ye screwin' yer eye at mr feverel fori say young gentleman have you spoke to this chap before now i replied richard i have not seen him before farmer blaize grasped the two arms of the chair he sat on and glared his doubts come said he to the bantam speak out and ha' done wi't say what ye saw and none o' yer thoughts damn yer thoughts ye saw tom bakewell fire that there rick the farmer pointed at some musk pots in the window what business ha' you to be a thinkin' you're a witness thinkin' an't ev'dence what'll ye say to morrow before magistrate mind what you says today you'll stick by to morrow thus adjured the bantam hitched his breech what on earth the young gentleman meant he was at a loss to speculate he could not believe that the young gentleman wanted to be transported but if he had been paid to help that why he would and considering that this day's evidence rather bound him down to the morrow's he determined after much ploughing and harrowing through obstinate shocks of hair to be not altogether positive as to the person it is possible that he became thereby more a mansion of truth than he previously had been for the night as he said was so dark that you could not see your hand before your face and though as he expressed it you might be mortal sure of a man you could not identify him upon oath and the party he had taken for tom bakewell and could have sworn to might have been the young gentleman present especially as he was ready to swear it upon oath so ended the bantam no sooner had he ceased than farmer blaize jumped up from his chair and made a fine effort to lift him out of the room from the point of his toe he failed and sank back groaning with the pain of the exertion and disappointment they're liars every one he cried liars perj'rers bribers and c'rruptersstop to the bantam who was slinking away you've done for yerself already you swore to it a din't said the bantam doggedly you swore to't the farmer vociferated afresh the bantam played a tune upon the handle of the door and still affirmed that he did not a double contradiction at which the farmer absolutely raged in his chair and was hoarse as he called out a third time that the bantam had sworn to it noa said the bantam ducking his poll noa he repeated in a lower note and then while a sombre grin betokening idiotic enjoyment of his profound casuistical quibble worked at his jaw not up'n o ath he added with a twitch of the shoulder and an angular jerk of the elbow farmer blaize looked vacantly at richard as if to ask him what he thought of england's peasantry after the sample they had there richard would have preferred not to laugh but his dignity gave way to his sense of the ludicrous and he let fly a shout the farmer was in no laughing mood he turned a wide eye back to the door lucky for'm he exclaimed seeing the bantam had vanished for his fingers itched to break that stubborn head he grew very puffy and addressed richard solemnly now look ye here mr feverel you've been a tampering with my witness it's no use denyin' i say y' 'ave sir you or some of ye i don't care about no feverel my witness there has been bribed the bantam's been bribed and he shivered his pipe with an energetic thump on the tablebribed i knows it i could swear to't upon oath richard inquired with a grave face ay upon oath said the farmer not observing the impertinence i'd take my bible oath on't he's been corrupted my principal witness oh it's dam cunnin' but it won't do the trick i'll transport tom bakewell sure as a gun he shall travel that man shall sorry for you mr feverelsorry you haven't seen how to treat me properyou or yours money won't do everythingno it won't it'll c'rrupt a witness but it won't clear a felon i'd ha' 'soused you sir you're a boy and'll learn better i asked no more than payment and apology and that i'd ha' taken contentalways provided my witnesses weren't tampered with now you must stand yer luck all o' ye richard stood up and replied very well mr blaize and if continued the farmer tom bakewell don't drag you into't after 'm why you're safe as i hope ye'll be sincere it was not in consideration of my own safety that i sought this interview with you said richard head erect grant ye that the farmer responded grant ye that yer bold enough young gentlemancomes of the blood that should be if y' had only ha' spoke trewthi believe yer fatherbelieve every word he said i do wish i could ha' said as much for sir austin's son and heir what cried richard with an astonishment hardly to be feigned you have seen my father but farmer blaize had now such a scent for lies that he could detect them where they did not exist and mumbled gruffly ay we knows all about that the boy's perplexity saved him from being irritated who could have told his father an old fear of his father came upon him and a touch of an old inclination to revolt my father knows of this said he very loudly and staring as he spoke right through the farmer who has played me false who would betray me to him it was austin no one knew it but austin yes and it was austin who persuaded me to come here and submit to these indignities why couldn't he be open with me i shall never trust him again and why not you with me young gentleman said the farmer i sh'd trust you if ye had richard did not see the analogy he bowed stiffly and bade him good afternoon farmer blaize pulled the bell company the young gentleman out lucy he waved to the little damsel in the doorway do the honours and mr richard ye might ha' made a friend o' me sir and it's not too late so to do i'm not cruel but i hate lies i whipped my boy tom bigger than you for not bein' above board only yesterdayay made 'un stand within swing o' this chair and take's measure now if ye'll come down to me and speak trewth before the trialif it's only five minutes before't or if sir austin who's a gentleman 'll say there's been no tamperin' with any o' my witnesses his word for'twell and good i'll do my best to help off tom bakewell and i'm glad young gentleman you've got a conscience about a poor man though he's a villain good afternoon sir richard marched hastily out of the room and through the garden never so much as deigning a glance at his wistful little guide who hung at the garden gate to watch him up the lane wondering a world of fancies about the handsome proud boy chapter x to have determined upon an act something akin to heroism in its way and to have fulfilled it by lying heartily and so subverting the whole structure built by good resolution seems a sad downfall if we forget what human nature in its green weedy spring is composed of young richard had quitted his cousin austin fully resolved to do his penance and drink the bitter cup and he had drunk it drained many cups to the dregs and it was to no purpose still they floated before him brimmed trebly bitter away from austin's influence he was almost the same boy who had slipped the guinea into tom bakewell's hand and the lucifers into farmer blaize's rick for good seed is long ripening a good boy is not made in a minute enough that the seed was in him he chafed on his road to raynham at the scene he had just endured and the figure of belthorpe's fat tenant burnt like hot copper on the tablet of his brain insufferably condescending and what was worse in the right richard obscured as his mind's eye was by wounded pride saw that clearly and hated his enemy for it the more heavy benson's tongue was knelling dinner as richard arrived at the abbey he hurried up to his room to dress accident or design had laid the book of sir austin's aphorisms open on the dressing table hastily combing his hair richard glanced down and read the dog returneth to his vomit the liar must eat his lie underneath was interjected in pencil the devil's mouthful young richard ran downstairs feeling that his father had struck him in the face sir austin marked the scarlet stain on his son's cheekbones he sought the youth's eye but richard would not look and sat conning his plate an abject copy of adrian's succulent air at that employment how could he pretend to the relish of an epicure when he was painfully endeavouring to masticate the devil's mouthful heavy benson sat upon the wretched dinner hippias usually the silent member as if awakened by the unnatural stillness became sprightly like the goatsucker owl at night and spoke much of his book his digestion and his dreams and was spared both by algernon and adrian one inconsequent dream he related about fancying himself quite young and rich and finding himself suddenly in a field cropping razors around him when just as he had by steps dainty as those of a french dancing master reached the middle he to his dismay beheld a path clear of the blood thirsty steel crop which he might have taken at first had he looked narrowly and there he was hippias's brethren regarded him with eyes that plainly said they wished he had remained there sir austin however drew forth his note book and jotted down a reflection a composer of aphorisms can pluck blossoms even from a razor prop was not hippias's dream the very counterpart of richard's position he had he looked narrowly might have taken the clear path he too had been making dainty steps till he was surrounded by the grinning blades and from that text sir austin preached to his son when they were alone little clare was still too unwell to be permitted to attend the dessert and father and son were soon closeted together it was a strange meeting they seemed to have been separated so long the father took his son's hand they sat without a word passing between them silence said most the boy did not understand his father his father frequently thwarted him at times he thought his father foolish but that paternal pressure of his hand was eloquent to him of how warmly he was beloved he tried once or twice to steal his hand away conscious it was melting him the spirit of his pride and old rebellion whispered him to be hard unbending resolute hard he had entered his father's study hard he had met his father's eyes he could not meet them now his father sat beside him gently with a manner that was almost meekness so he loved this boy the poor gentleman's lips moved he was praying internally to god for him by degrees an emotion awoke in the boy's bosom love is that blessed wand which wins the waters from the hardness of the heart richard fought against it for the dignity of old rebellion the tears would come hot and struggling over the dams of pride shamefully fast they began to fall he could no longer conceal them or check the sobs sir austin drew him nearer and nearer till the beloved head was on his breast an hour afterwards adrian harley austin wentworth and algernon feverel were summoned to the baronet's study adrian came last there was a style of affable omnipotence about the wise youth as he slung himself into a chair and made an arch of the points of his fingers through which to gaze on his blundering kinsmen careless as one may be whose sagacity has foreseen and whose benevolent efforts have forestalled the point of danger at the threshold adrian crossed his legs and only intruded on their introductory remarks so far as to hum half audibly at intervals ripton and richard were two pretty men in parody of the old ballad young richard's red eyes and the baronet's ruffled demeanour told him that an explanation had taken place and a reconciliation that was well the baronet would now pay cheerfully adrian summed and considered these matters and barely listened when the baronet called attention to what he had to say which was elaborately to inform all present what all present very well knew that a rick had been fired that his son was implicated as an accessory to the fact that the perpetrator was now imprisoned and that richard's family were as it seemed to him bound in honour to do their utmost to effect the man's release then the baronet stated that he had himself been down to belthorpe his son likewise and that he had found every disposition in blaize to meet his wishes the lamp which ultimately was sure to be lifted up to illumine the acts of this secretive race began slowly to dispread its rays and as statement followed statement they saw that all had known of the business that all had been down to belthorpe all save the wise youth adrian who with due deference and a sarcastic shrug objected to the proceeding as putting them in the hands of the man blaize his wisdom shone forth in an oration so persuasive and aphoristic that had it not been based on a plea against honour it would have made sir austin waver but its basis was expediency and the baronet had a better aphorism of his own to confute him with expediency is man's wisdom adrian harley doing right is god's adrian curbed his desire to ask sir austin whether an attempt to counteract the just working of the law was doing right the direct application of an aphorism was unpopular at raynham i am to understand then said he that blaize consents not to press the prosecution of course he won't algernon remarked confound him he'll have his money and what does he want besides these agricultural gentlemen are delicate customers to deal with however if he really consents i have his promise said the baronet fondling his son young richard looked up to his father as if he wished to speak he said nothing and sir austin took it as a mute reply to his caresses and caressed him the more adrian perceived a reserve in the boy's manner and as he was not quite satisfied that his chief should suppose him to have been the only idle and not the most acute and vigilant member of the family he commenced a cross examination of him by asking who had last spoken with the tenant of belthorpe i think i saw him last murmured richard and relinquished his father's hand adrian fastened on his prey and left him with a distinct and satisfactory assurance of his amicable intentions no said richard not the feverels joined in astounded chorus richard sidled away from his father and repeated a shamefaced no was he hostile inquired adrian smoothing his palms and smiling yes the boy confessed here was quite another view of their position adrian generally patient of results triumphed strongly at having evoked it and turned upon austin wentworth reproving him for inducing the boy to go down to belthorpe austin looked grieved he feared that richard had faded in his good resolve i thought it his duty to go he observed it was said the baronet emphatically and you see what comes of it sir adrian struck in these agricultural gentlemen i repeat are delicate customers to deal with for my part i would prefer being in the hands of a policeman we are decidedly collared by blaize what were his words ricky give it in his own doric he said he would transport tom bakewell adrian smoothed his palms and smiled again then they could afford to defy mr blaize he informed them significantly and made once more a mysterious allusion to the punic elephant bidding his relatives be at peace they were attaching in his opinion too much importance to richard's complicity the man was a fool and a very extraordinary arsonite to have an accomplice at all it was a thing unknown in the annals of rick burning but one would be severer than law itself to say that a boy of fourteen had instigated to crime a full grown man at that rate the boy was 'father of the man' with a vengeance and one might hear next that 'the baby was father of the boy' they would find common sense a more benevolent ruler than poetical metaphysics when he had done austin with his customary directness asked him what he meant i confess adrian said the baronet hearing him expostulate with austin's stupidity i for one am at a loss i have heard that this man bakewell chooses voluntarily not to inculpate my son seldom have i heard anything that so gratified me it is a view of innate nobleness in the rustic's character which many a gentleman might take example from we are bound to do our utmost for the man and saying that he should pay a second visit to belthorpe to inquire into the reasons for the farmer's sudden exposition of vindictiveness sir austin rose before he left the room algernon asked richard if the farmer had vouchsafed any reasons and the boy then spoke of the tampering with the witnesses and the bantam's not upon oath which caused adrian to choke with laughter even the baronet smiled at so cunning a distinction as that involved in swearing a thing and not swearing it upon oath how little he exclaimed does one yeoman know another to elevate a distinction into a difference is the natural action of their minds i will point that out to blaize he shall see that the idea is native born richard saw his father go forth adrian too was ill at ease this trotting down to belthorpe spoils all said he the affair would pass over to morrowblaize has no witnesses the old rascal is only standing out for more money no he isn't richard corrected him it's not that i'm sure he believes his witnesses have been tampered with as he calls it what if they have boy adrian put it boldly the ground is cut from under his feet blaize told me that if my father would give his word there had been nothing of the sort he would take it my father will give his word then said adrian you had better stop him from going down austin looked at adrian keenly and questioned him whether he thought the farmer was justified in his suspicions the wise youth was not to be entrapped he had only been given to understand that the witnesses were tolerably unstable and like the bantam ready to swear lustily but not upon the book how given to understand he chose not to explain but he reiterated that the chief should not be allowed to go down to belthorpe sir austin was in the lane leading to the farm when he heard steps of some one running behind him it was dark and he shook off the hand that laid hold of his cloak roughly not recognizing his son it's i sir said richard panting pardon me you mustn't go in there why not said the baronet putting his arm about him not now continued the boy i will tell you all to night i must see the farmer myself it was my fault sir i i lied to himthe liar must eat his lie oh forgive me for disgracing you sir i did iti hope i did it to save tom bakewell let me go in alone and speak the truth go and i will wait for you here said his father the wind that bowed the old elms and shivered the dead leaves in the air had a voice and a meaning for the baronet during that half hour's lonely pacing up and down under the darkness awaiting his boy's return the solemn gladness of his heart gave nature a tongue through the desolation flying overheadthe wailing of the mother of plenty across the bare swept landhe caught intelligible signs of the beneficent order of the universe from a heart newly confirmed in its grasp of the principle of human goodness as manifested in the dear child who had just left him confirmed in its belief in the ultimate victory of good within us without which nature has neither music nor meaning and is rock stone tree and nothing more in the dark the dead leaves beating on his face he had a word for his note book there is for the mind but one grasp of happiness from that uppermost pinnacle of wisdom whence we see that this world is well designed chapter xi of all the chief actors in the bakewell comedy master ripton thompson awaited the fearful morning which was to decide tom's fate in dolefullest mood and suffered the gravest mental terrors adrian on parting with him had taken casual occasion to speak of the position of the criminal in modern europe assuring him that international treaty now did what universal empire had aforetime done and that among atlantic barbarians now as among the scythians of old an offender would find precarious refuge and an emissary haunting him in the paternal home under the roofs of law and removed from the influence of his conscienceless young chief the staggering nature of the act he had put his hand to its awful felonious aspect overwhelmed ripton he saw it now for the first time why it's next to murder he cried out to his amazed soul and wandered about the house with a prickly skin thoughts of america and commencing life afresh as an innocent gentleman had crossed his disordered brain he wrote to his friend richard proposing to collect disposable funds and embark in case of tom's breaking his word or of accidental discovery he dared not confide the secret to his family as his leader had sternly enjoined him to avoid any weakness of that kind and being by nature honest and communicative the restriction was painful and melancholy fell upon the boy mama thompson attributed it to love the daughters of parchment rallied him concerning miss clare forey his hourly letters to raynham and silence as to everything and everybody there his nervousness and unwonted propensity to sudden inflammation of the cheeks were set down for sure signs of the passion miss letitia thompson the pretty and least parchmenty one destined by her papa for the heir of raynham and perfectly aware of her brilliant future up to which she had since ripton's departure dressed and grimaced and studied cadences the latter with such success though not yet fifteen that she languished to her maid and melted the small factotum footman miss letty whose insatiable thirst for intimations about the young heir ripton could not satisfy tormented him daily in revenge and once quite unconsciously gave the lad a fearful turn for after dinner when mr thompson read the paper by the fire preparatory to sleeping at his accustomed post and mama thompson and her submissive female brood sat tasking the swift intricacies of the needle and emulating them with the tongue miss letty stole behind ripton's chair and introduced between him and his book the latin initial letter large and illuminated of the theme she supposed to be absorbing him as it did herself the unexpected vision of this accusing captain of the alphabet this resplendent and haunting a fronting him bodily threw ripton straight back in his chair while guilt with her ancient indecision what colours to assume on detection flew from red to white from white to red across his fallen chaps letty laughed triumphantly amor the word she had in mind certainly has a connection with arson but the delivery of a letter into master ripton's hands furnished her with other and likelier appearances to study for scarce had ripton plunged his head into the missive than he gave way to violent transports such as the healthy minded little damsel for all her languishing cadences deemed she really could express were a downright declaration to be made to her the boy did not stop at table quickly recollecting the presence of his family he rushed to his own room and now the girl's ingenuity was taxed to gain possession of that letter she succeeded of course she being a huntress with few scruples and the game unguarded with the eyes of amazement she read this foreign matter dear riptonif tom had been committed i would have shot old blaize do you know my father was behind us that night when clare saw the ghost and heard all we said before the fire burst out it is no use trying to conceal anything from him well as you are in an awful state i will tell you all about it after you left ripton i had a conversation with austin and he persuaded me to go down to old blaize and ask him to help off tom i went for i would have done anything for tom after what he said to austin and i defied the old churl to do his worst then he said if my father paid the money and nobody had tampered with his witnesses he would not mind if tom did get off and he had his chief witness in called the bantam very like his master i think and the bantam began winking at me tremendously as you say and said he had sworn he saw tom bakewell but not upon oath he meant not on the bible he could swear to it but not on the bible i burst out laughing and you should have seen the rage old blaize was in it was splendid fun then we had a consultation at home austin rady my father uncle algernon who has come down to us again and your friend in prosperity and adversity rdf my father said he would go down to old blaize and give him the word of a gentleman we had not tampered with his witnesses and when he was gone we were all talking and rady says he must not see the farmer i am as certain as i live that it was rady bribed the bantam well i ran and caught up my father and told him not to go in to old blaize but i would and eat my words and tell him the truth he waited for me in the lane never mind what passed between me and old blaize he made me beg and pray of him not to press it against tom and then to complete it he brought in a little girl a niece of his and says to me she's your best friend after all and told me to thank her a little girl twelve years of age what business had she to mix herself up in my matters depend upon it ripton wherever there is mischief there are girls i think she had the insolence to notice my face and ask me not to be unhappy i was polite of course but i would not look at her well the morning came and tom was had up before sir miles papworth it was sir miles gout gave us the time or tom would have been had up before we could do anything adrian did not want me to go but my father said i should accompany him and held my hand all the time i shall be careful about getting into these scrapes again when you have done anything honourable you do not mind but getting among policemen and magistrates makes you ashamed of yourself sir miles was very attentive to my father and me and dead against tom we sat beside him and tom was brought in sir miles told my father that if there was one thing that showed a low villain it was rick burning what do you think of that i looked him straight in the face and he said to me he was doing me a service in getting tom committed and clearing the country of such fellows and rady began laughing i hate rady my father said his son was not in haste to inherit and have estates of his own to watch and sir miles laughed too i thought we were discovered at first then they began the examination of tom the tinker was the first witness and he proved that tom had spoken against old blaize and said something about burning his rick i wished i had stood in the lane to bursley with him alone our country lawyer we engaged for tom cross questioned him and then he said he was not ready to swear to the exact words that had passed between him and tom i should think not then came another who swore he had seen tom lurking about the farmer's grounds that night then came the bantam and i saw him look at rady i was tremendously excited and my father kept pressing my hand just fancy my being brought to feel that a word from that fellow would make me miserable for life and he must perjure himself to help me that comes of giving way to passion my father says when we do that we are calling in the devil as doctor well the bantam was told to state what he had seen and the moment he began rady who was close by me began to shake and he was laughing i knew though his face was as grave as sir miles you never heard such a rigmarole but i could not laugh he said he thought he was certain he had seen somebody by the rick and it was tom bakewell who was the only man he knew who had a grudge against farmer blaize and if the object had been a little bigger he would not mind swearing to tom and would swear to him for he was dead certain it was tom only what he saw looked smaller and it was pitch dark at the time he was asked what time it was he saw the person steal away from the rick and then he began to scratch his head and said supper time then they asked what time he had supper and he said nine o'clock by the clock and we proved that at nine o'clock tom was drinking in the ale house with the tinker at bursley and sir miles swore and said he was afraid he could not commit tom and when he heard that tom looked up at me and i say he is a noble fellow and no one shall sneer at tom while i live mind that well sir miles asked us to dine with him and tom was safe and i am to have him and educate him if i like for my servant and i will and i will give money to his mother and make her rich and he shall never repent he knew me i say rip the bantam must have seen me it was when i went to stick in the lucifers as we were all going home from sir miles's at night he has lots of red faced daughters but i did not dance with them though they had music and were full of fun and i did not care to i was so delighted and almost let it out when we left and rode home rady said to my father the bantam was not such a fool as he was thought and my father said one must be in a state of great personal exaltation to apply that epithet to any man and rady shut his mouth and i gave my pony a clap of the heel for joy i think my father suspects what rady did and does not approve of it and he need not have done it after all and might have spoilt it i have been obliged to order him not to call me ricky for he stops short at rick so that everybody knows what he means my dear austin is going to south america my pony is in capital condition my father is the cleverest and best man in the world clare is a little better i am quite happy i hope we shall meet soon my dear old rip and we will not get into any more tremendous scrapes will wei remain your sworn friend richard doria feverel ps i am to have a nice river yacht good bye rip mind you learn to box mind you are not to show this to any of your friends on pain of my displeasure nb lady b was so angry when i told her that i had not come to her before she would do anything in the world for me i like her next best to my father and austin good bye old rip poor little letitia after three perusals of this ingenuous epistle where the laws of punctuation were so disregarded resigned it to one of the pockets of her brother ripton's best jacket deeply smitten with the careless composer and so ended the last act of the bakewell comedy in which the curtain closes with sir austin's pointing out to his friends the beneficial action of the system in it from beginning to end
