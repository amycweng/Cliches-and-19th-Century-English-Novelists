this country at the time when crowned heads were running over europe crying out for charitys sake to be amused after their tiresome work of slaughter and you know what a dread they have of moping she was famous for her fun and high spirits besides her good looks which you may judge of for yourself on a walk down most of our great noblemens collections of pictures in england where you will behold her as the goddess diana fitting an arrow to a bow and elsewhere an amazon holding a spear or a lady with dogs in the costume of the day and in one place she is a nymph if not diana herself gazing at her naked feet before her attendants loosen her tunic for her to take the bath and her hounds are pricking their ears and you see antlers of a stag behind a block of stone she was a wonderful swimmer among other things and one early morning when she was a girl she did really swim they say across the shannon and back to win a bet for her brother lord levellier the colonel of cavalry who left an arm in egypt and changed his way of life to become a wizard as the common people about his neighbourhood supposed because he foretold the weather and had cures for aches and pains without a doctors diploma but we know now that he was only a mathematician and astronomer all for inventing military engines the brother and sister were great friends in their youth when he had his right arm to defend her reputation with and she would have done anything on earth to please him there is a picture of her in an immense flat white silk hat trimmed with pale blue like a pavilion the broadest brim ever seen and she simply sits on a chair and venus the queen of beauty would have been extinguished under that hat i am sure and only to look at countess fannys eye beneath the brim she has tipped ever so slightly in her artfulness makes the absurd thing graceful and suitable oh she was a cunning one but you must be on your guard against the scandalmongers and collectors of anecdotes and worst of any the critic of our galleries of art for she being in almost all of them the principal painters of the day were on their knees for the favour of a sitting they have to speak of her pretty frequently and they season their dish the coxcombs do by hinting a knowledge of her history here we come to another portrait of the beautiful but we fear naughty countess of cressett you are to imagine that they know everything and they are so indulgent when they drop their blot on a ladys character they can boast of nothing more than having read nymrieys letters and correspondence published fortunately for him when he was no longer to be called to account below for his malicious insinuations pretending to decency in initials and dashes that man was a hater of women and the clergy he was one of the horrid creatures who write with a wink at you which sets the wicked part of us on fire i have known it myself and i own it to my shame and if i happened to be ignorant of the history of countess fanny i could not refute his wantonness he has just the same benevolent leer for a bishop give me if we are to make a choice the beggars breech for decency i say i like it vastly in preference to a nymney who leads you up to the curtain and agitates it and bids you to retire on tiptoe you cannot help being angry with the man for both reasons but he is the writer society delights in to show what it is composed of a man brazen enough to declare that he could hold us in suspense about the adventures of a broomstick with the aid of a yashmak and an ankle may know the world you had better not know himthat is my remark and do not trust him he tells the story of the old buccaneer in fear of the public for it was general property but of course he finishes with a nymney touch so the old buccaneer is the doubloon she takes in exchange for a handful of silver pieces there is no such handful to exchangenot of the kind he sickeningly nudges at you i will prove to you it was not countess fannys naughtiness though she was indeed very blamable women should walk in armour as if they were born to it for these cold sneerers will never waste their darts on cuirasses an independent brave young creature exposing herself thoughtlessly in her reckless innocence is the victim for them they will bring all society down on her with one of their explosive sly words appearing so careless the cowards i say without hesitation her conduct with regard to kirby the old buccaneer as he was called however indefensible in itself warrants her at heart an innocent young woman much to be pitied only to think of her i could sometimes drop into a chair for a good cry and of him too and their daughter carinthia jane was the pair of them as to that and so was chillon john the son those critics quoting nymney should look at the portrait of her in the long saloon of cresset castle where she stands in blue and white completely dressed near a table supporting a couple of holster pistols and then let them ask themselves whether they would speak of her so if her little hand could move well and so the tale of her swim across the shannon river and back drove the young earl of cresset straight over to ireland to propose for her he saying that she was the girl to suit his book not allowing her time to think of how much he might be the man to suit hers the marriage was what is called a good one both full of frolic and he wealthy and rather handsome and she quite lovely and spirited no wonder the whole town was very soon agog about the couple until at the end of a year people began to talk of them separately she going her way and he his she could not always be on the top of a coach which was his throne of happiness plenty of stories are current still of his fame as a fourinhand coachman they say he once drove an emperor and a king a prince chancellor and a pair of field marshals and some ladies of the day from the metropolis to richmond hill in fifty or sixty odd minutes having the ground cleared all the way by bell and summons and only a donkeycart and man and a deaf old woman to pay for and went as you can imagine at such a tearing gallop that those grand highnesses had to hold on for their lives and lost their hats along the road and a publican at kew exhibits one above his bar to the present hour and countess fanny was up among them they say she was equal to it and some say that was the occasion of her meeting the old buccaneer she met him at richmond in surrey we know for certain it was on richmond hill where the old king met his lass they say countess fanny was parading the hill to behold the splendid view always admired so much by foreigners with their achs and hechs and surrounded by her crowned courtiers in frogged uniforms and moustachioed like seahorses a little before dinner time when kirby passed her and the emperor made a remark on him for kirby was a magnificent figure of a man and used to be compared to a threedecker entering harbour after a victory he stood six feet four and was broadshouldered and deepchested to match and walked like a king who has humbled his enemy you have seen big dogs and so countess fanny looked round kirby was doing the same but he had turned right about and appeared transfixed and like a royal beast angry with his wound if ever there was love at first sight and a dreadful love like a runaway mailcoach in a storm of wind and lightning at black midnight by the banks of a flooded river which was formerly our comparison for terrible situations it was when those two met and what you exclaim buccaneer kirby full sixtyfive and countess fanny no more than three and twenty a young beauty of the world of fashion courted by the highest and she in love with him go and gaze at one of our big ships coming out of an engagement home with all her flags flying and her crew manning the yards that will give you an idea of a young womans feelings for an old warrior never beaten down an inch by anything he had to endure matching him i dare say in her womans heart with the mighty highnesses who had only smelt the outside edge of battle she did rarely admire a valiant man old as methuselah he would have made her kneel to him she was all heart for a real hero the story goes that countess fanny sent her husband to captain kirby at the emperors request to inquire his name and on hearing it she struck her hands on her bosom telling his majesty he saw there the bravest man in the kings dominions which the emperor scarce crediting and observing that the man must be then a superhuman being to be so distinguished in a nation of the brave countess fanny related the wellknown tale of captain kirby and the shipful of mutineers and how when not a man of them stood by him and he in the service of the first insurgent state of spanish america to save his ship from being taken over to the enemyhe blew her up fifteen miles from land and so he got to shore swimming and floating alternately and was called old skyhigh by english sailors any number of whom could always be had to sail under buccaneer kirby he fought on shore as well and once he came down from the tops of the andes with a black beard turned white and went into action with the title of kirbys ghost but his heart was on salt water he was never so much at home as in a ship foundering or splitting into the clouds we are told that he never forgave the admiralty for striking him off the list of english naval captains which is no doubt why in his old age he nursed a grudge against his country ours i am sure was the loss and many have thought so since he was a mechanician a master of stratagems and would say that brains will beat grim death if we have enough of them he was a standing example of the lessons of his own maxims for men a very curious book that fetches a rare price now wherever a copy is put up for auction i shudder at them as if they were muzzles of firearms pointed at me but they were not addressed to my sex and still they give me an interest in the writer who would declare that he had never failed in an undertaking without stripping bare to expose to himself where he had been wanting in intention and determination there you may see a truly terrible man so the emperor being immensely taken with kirbys method of preserving discipline on board ship because as we say to the madman your straitwaistcoat is my easychair monarchs have a great love of discipline he begged countess fannys permission that he might invite captain kirby to his table and countess fanny she had the name from the ballad i am the star of prince and czar my light is shed on many but i wait here till my bold buccaneer makes prize of countess fanny for the popular imagination was extraordinarily roused by the elopement and there were songs and ballads out of number countess fanny despatched her husband to captain kirby again meaning no harm though the poor man is laughed at in the songs for going twice upon his mission none of the mighty people repented of having the old buccaneerfor that night at all events he sat in the midst of them you may believe like the lord of that table with his great white beard and hairnot a lock of it shedand his bronze lionface and a resolute but a merry eye that he had he was no deep drinker of wine but when he did drink and the wine champagne he drank to show his disdain of its powers and the emperor wishing for a narrative of some of his exploits particularly the blowing up of his ship kirby paid his majesty the compliment of giving it him as baldly as an official report to the admiralty so disengaged and calm was he with his bottles of champagne in him where another would have been sparkling and laying on the colours that he was then and there offered admirals rank in the imperial navy and the old buccaneer like a courtier of our best days bows to countess fanny and asks her if he is a free man to go and no says she we cannot spare you and there was a pretty wrangle between countess fanny and the emperor each pulling at the old buccaneer to have possession of him he was rarely out of her sight after their first meeting and the ridiculous excuse she gave to her husbands family was she feared he would be kidnapped and made a cossack of and young lord cressett her husband began to grumble concerning her intimacy with a man old enough to be her grandfather as if the age were the injury he seemed to think it so and vowed he would shoot the old depredator dead if he found him on the grounds of cressett like vermin he said and it was considered that he had the right and no jury would have convicted him you know what those days were he had his opportunity one moonlight night not far from the castle and peppered kirby with shot from a fowlingpiece at some say five paces distance if not pointblank but kirby had a maxim steady shakes them and he acted on it to receive his enemys fire and the young lords hand shook and the old buccaneer stood out of the smoke not much injured except in the coatcollar with a pistol cocked in his hand and he said many would take that for a declaration of war but i know it s only your lordships diplomacy and then he let loose to his mad fun astounding lord cressett and his gamekeeper and vowed as the young lord tried to relate subsequently as well as he could recollect the wordshere i have it in printthat he was a man pickled in saltpetre when an infant like achilles and proof against powder and shot not marked with cross and key and fetched up from the square magazine in the central depot of the infernal factory third turning to the right off the grand arcade in kingdomcome where the nightporter has to wear wet petticoats like a highland chief to make short work of the sparks flying about otherwise this world and many another would not have to wait long for combustion kirby had the wildest way of talking when he was not issuing orders under fire best understood by sailors i give it you as it stands here printed i do not profess to understand so lord cressett said diplomacy and infernal factories be hanged have your shot at me its only fair and kirby discharged his pistol at the top twigs of an old oak tree and called the young lord a briton and proposed to take him in hand and make a man of him as nigh worthy of his wife as any one not an alexander of macedon could be so they became friendly and the young lord confessed it was his family that had urged him to the attack and kirby abode at the castle and all three were happy in perfect honour i am convinced but such was not the opinion of the cressetts and levelliers down they trooped to cressett castle with a rush and a roar crying on the disgrace of an old desperado like kirby living there dukes marchionesses cabinet ministers leaders of fashion and fireeating colonels of the kings bodyguard one of whom captain john peter kirby laid on his heels at ten paces on an april morning when the duel was fought as early as the blessed heavens had given them light to see to do it such days those were there was talk of shutting up the infatuated lady if not incarcerated she was rigidly watched the earl her husband fell altogether to drinking and coaching and other things the ballad makes her say my family my gaolers be my husband is a zany naught see i clear save my bold buccaneer to rescue countess fanny and it goes on o little lass at play on the grass come earn a silver penny and youll be dear to my bold buccaneer for news of his countess fanny in spite of her bravery that poor woman suffered we used to learn by heart the ballads and songs upon famous events in those old days when poetry was worshipped but captain kirby gave provocation enough to both families when he went among the taverns and clubs and vowed before providence over his big fist that they should rue their interference and he would carry off the lady on a day he named he named the hour as well they say and that was midnight of the month of june the levelliers and cressetts foamed at the mouth in speaking of him so enraged they were on account of his age and his passion for a young woman as to blood the kirbys of lincolnshire were quite equal to the cressetts of warwick the old buccaneer seems to have had money too but you can see what her people had to complain of his insolent contempt of them was unexampled and their tyranny had roused my ladys high spirit not a bit less and she said right out when he comes i am ready and will go with him there was boldness for you on both sides all the town was laughing and betting on the event of the night in june and the odds were in favour of kirby for though lord cressett was quite the popular young english nobleman being a capital whip and free of his coin in those days men who had smelt powder were often prized above titles and the feeling out of society was very strong for kirby even previous to the fight on the heath and the age of the indomitable adventurer must have contributed to his popularity he was the hero of every song whats age to me cries kirby why young and fresh let her be but it s mighty better reasoned for a man to be well seasoned and a man she has in me cries kirby as to his exact age write me down sixtythree cries kirby i have always maintained that it was an understatement we must remember it was not kirby speaking but the songwriter kirby would not in my opinion have numbered years he was proud of below their due quantity he was more if he died at ninetyone and chillon switzer john kirby born eleven months after the elopement was we know twentythree years old when the old man gave up the ghost and bequeathed him little besides a lawsuit with the austrian government and the care of carinthia jane the second child of this extraordinary union both children born in wedlock as you will hear sixtythree or sixtyseven near upon seventy when most men are reaping and stacking their sins with groans and weak knees kirby was a match for his juniors which they discovered captain john peter avason kirby son of a lincolnshire squire of an ancient stock was proud of his blood and claimed descent from a chief of the danish rovers whats rank to me cries kirby a titled lass let her be but unless my plans miscarry ill show her when we marry as brave a pedigree cries kirby that was the songwriters answer to the charge that the countess had stooped to a degrading alliance john peter was fourth of a family of seven children all males and hard at the bottle early in life for want of proper occupation he says in his memoirs and applauds his brother stanson the clergyman for being ahead of him in renouncing strong dunks because he found that he cursed better upon water water however helped stanson kirby to outlive his brothers and inherit the lincolnshire property and at the period of the great scandal in london he was palsied and waited on by his grandson and heir ralph thorkill kirby the hero of an adventure celebrated in our law courts and on the english stage for he took possession of his coachmans wife and was accused of compassing the death of the husband he was not hanged for it so we are bound to think him not guilty the stagepiece is called saturday night and it had an astonishing run but is only remembered now for the song of saturday sung by the poor coachman and labourers at the village alehouse before he starts to capture his wife from the clutches of her seducer and meets his fate never was there a more popular song you heard it everywhere i recollect one verse o saturday money is slippery metal and saturday ale it is tipsy stuff at home the old woman is boiling her kettle she thinks we dont know when weve tippled enough we drink and of never a man are we jealous and never a man against us will he speak for who can be hard on a set of poor fellows who only see saturday once a week you chorus the last two lines that was the very song the unfortunate coachman of kirby hall joined in singing before he went out to face his end for the woman he loved he believed in her virtue to the very last the ravished wife of my bosom he calls her all through the latter half of the play it is a real tragedy the songs of that day have lost their effect now i suppose they will ever remain pathetic to me and to hear the poor coachman william martin invoking the name of his dear stolen wife elizabeth jug in hand so tearfully while he joins the song of saturday was a most moving thing you saw nothing but handkerchiefs out all over the theatre what it is that has gone from our drama i cannot tell i am never affected now as i was then and people in a low station of life could affect me then without being flung at me for i dislike an entire dish of them i own we were simpler in our habits and ways of thinking elizabeth martin according to report was a woman to make better men than ralph thorkill act evillyas to good looks i mean she was not entirely guiltless i am afraid though in the last scene mrs kempson who played the part as alas she could do to the very life so threw herself into the pathos of it that there were few to hold out against her and we felt that elizabeth had been misled so much for morality in those days and now for the elopement chapter ii mistress gossip tells of the elopement of the countess of cressett with the old buccaneer and of charles dump the postillion conducting them and of a great county family the twentyfirst of june was the day appointed by captain kirby to carry off countess fanny and the time midnight and ten minutes to the stroke of twelve countess fanny as if she scorned to conceal that she was in a conspiracy with her greyhaired lover notwithstanding that she was watched and guarded left the marchioness of arpingtons ballroom and was escorted downstairs by her brother lord levellier sworn to baffle kirby present with him in the street and witness to the shutting of the carriagedoor on countess fanny were brother officers of his general abrane colonel jack potts and sir upton tomber the door fast shut countess fanny kissed her hand to them and drew up the window seeming merry and as they had expected indignation and perhaps resistance for she could be a spitfire in a temper and had no fear whatever of firearms they were glad to have her safe on such good terms and so general abrane jumped up on the box beside the coachman jack potts jumped up between the footmen and sir upton tomber and the onearmed lord as soon as the carriage was disengaged from the ruck two deep walked on each side of it in the road all the way to lord cressetts town house no one thought of asking where that silly young man wasprobably under some table their numbers were swelled by quite a host going along for heavy bets were on the affair dozens having backed kirby and it must have appeared serious to them with the lady in custody and constables on the lookout and kirby and his men nowhere in sight they expected an onslaught at some point of the procession and it may be believed they wished it if only that they might see something for their money a beautiful bright moonlight night it happened to be arm in arm among them were lord pitscrew and russett earl of fleetwood a great friend of kirbys for it was a device of the old buccaneers that helped the earl to win the great welsh heiress who made him even before he took to hoarding and buyingone of the wealthiest noblemen in england but she was crazed by her marriage or the wild scenes leading to it she never presented herself in society she would sit on the top of estlemont towersas they formerly spelt itall day and half the night in midwinter often looking for the mountains down in her native west country covered with an old white flannel cloak and on her head a tall hat of her welsh womenfolk and she died of it leaving a son in her likeness of whom you will hear lord fleetwood had lost none of his faith in kirby and went on booking bets giving him huge odds thousands he accepted fifty to one when the carriage came to a stop at the steps of lord cressetts mansion but he was anxious and well he might be seeing countess fanny alight and pass up between two lines of gentlemen all bowing low before her not a sign of the old buccaneer anywhere to right or left heads were on the look out and vows offered up for his appearance she was at the door and about to enter the house then it was that with a shout of the name of some dreadful heathen god colonel jack potts roared out shes half a foot short o the mark he was on the pavement and it seems he measured her as she slipped by him and one thing and another caused him to smell a cheat and general abrane standing beside her near the door cried where art flying now jack but jack potts grew more positive and bellowed peel her wig were done and she did not speak a word but stood huddledup and hooded and lord levellier caught her up by the arm as she was trying a dash into the hall and sir upton tomber plucked at her veil and raised it and whistled phewwhich struck the rabble below with awe of the cunning of the old buccaneer and there was no need for them to hear general abrane say right jack weve a dead one in hand or jack potts reply its ten thousand pounds clean winged away from my pocket like a string of wild geese the excitement of the varletry in the square they say was fearful to hear so the principal noblemen and gentlemen concerned thought it prudent to hurry the young woman into the house and bar the door and there she was very soon stripped of veil and blonde false wig with long curls the whole framing of her artificial resemblance to countess fanny and she proved to be a goodlooking foreign maid a dark one powdered trembling very much but not so frightened upon hearing that her penalty for the share she had taken in the horrid imposture practised upon them was to receive and return a salute from each of the gentlemen in rotation which the hussy did with proper submission and jack potts remarked that it was an honest buss but dear at ten thousand when you have been the victim of a deceit the explanation of the simplicity of the trick turns all the wonder upon yourself you know and the backers of the old buccaneer and the wagerers against him crowed and groaned in chorus at the maids narrative of how the moment countess fanny had thrown up the window of her carriage she sprang out to a carriage on the off side containing kirby and how she this little french jade sprang in to take her place one snap of the fingers and the transformation was accomplished so for another kiss all round they let her go free and she sat at the suppertable prepared for countess fanny and the party by order of lord levellier and amused the gentlemen with stories of the ladies she had served english and foreign and that is how men are taught to think they know our sex and may despise it i could preach them a lesson those men might as well not believe in the steadfastness of the very stars because one or two are reported lost out of the firmament and now and then we behold a whole shower of fragments descending the truth is they have taken a stain from the life they lead and are troubled puddles incapable of clear reflection to listen to the tattle of a chatting little slut and condemn the whole sex upon her testimony is a nice idea of justice many of the gentlemen present became notorious as womanscorners whether owing to countess fanny or other things lord levellier was and lord fleetwood the wicked man and certainly the hearing of naughty stories of us by the light of a grievous and vexatious instance of our misconduct must produce an impression countess fannys desperate passion for a man of the age of kirby struck them as out of nature they talked of it as if they could have pardoned her a younger lover all that lord cressett said on the announcement of the flight of his wife was ah fan she never would run in my ribbons he positively declined to persue lord levellier would not attempt to follow her up without him as it would have cost money and he wanted all that he could spare for his telescopes and experiments who then was the gentleman who stopped the chariot with his three mounted attendants on the road to the sea on the heath by the great punchbowl that has been the question for now longer than half a century in fact approaching seventy mortal years no one has ever been able to say for certain it occurred at six oclock on the summer morning countess fanny must have known himand not once did she open her mouth to breathe his name yet she had no objection to talk of the adventure and how simon fettle captain kirbys old ships steward in south america seeing horsemen stationed on the ascent of the high road bordering the bowl which is miles round and deep made the postillion cease jogging and sang out to his master for orders and kirby sang back to him to look to his priming and then the postillion was bidden proceed and he did not like it but he had to deal with pistols behind where men feel weak and he went bobbing on the saddle in dejection as if upon his very heart he jogged and soon the fray commenced there was very little parleying between determined men simon fettle was a plain kindly creature without a thought of malice who kept his masters accounts he fired the first shot at the foremost man as he related in after days to reduce the odds kirby said to countess fanny just to comfort her never so much as imagining she would be afraid the worst will be a bloody shirt for simon to mangle for they had been arranging to live cheaply in a cottage on the continent and simon fettle to do the washing she could not help laughing outright but when the old buccaneer was down striding in the battle she took a pistol and descended likewise and she used it too and loaded again she had not to use it a second time kirby pulled the gentleman off his horse wounded in the thigh and while dragging him to countess fanny to crave her pardon a shot intended for kirby hit the poor gentleman in the breast and kirby stretched him at his length and simon and he disarmed the servant who had fired one was insensible one flying and those two on the ground all in broad daylight but so lonely is that spot nothing might have been heard of it if at the end of the week the postillion who had been bribed and threatened with terrible threats to keep his tongue from wagging had not begun to talk so the scene of the encounter was examined and on one spot carefully earthed over bloodmarks were discovered in the green sand people in the huts on the hilltop a quarter of a mile distant spoke of having heard sounds of firing while they were at breakfast and a little boy named tommy wedger said he saw a dead body go by in an open coach that morning all bloody and mournful he had to appear before the magistrates crying terribly but did not know the nature of an oath and was dismissed time came when the boy learned to swear and he did and that he had seen a beautiful lady firing and killing men like pigeons and partridges but that was after charles dump the postillion had been telling the story those who credited charles dumps veracity speculated on dozens of great noblemenand gentlemen known to be dying in love with countess fanny and this brings us to another family i do not say i know anything i do but lay before you the evidence we have to fix suspicion upon a notorious character perfectly capable of trying to thwart a man like kirby and with good reason to try if she had bewitched him to a consuming passion as we are told about eleven miles distant as the crow flies and a bold huntsman will ride in that heath country from the punchbowl right across the mounds and the broad water lies the estate of the fakenhams who intermarried with the coplestones of the iron mines and were the wealthiest of the old county families until curtis fakenham entered upon his inheritance money with him was like the farmwifes dish of grain she tosses in showers to her fowls he was more than what you call a ladykiller he was a womaneater his pride was in it as well as his taste and when men are like that indeed they are devourers curtis was the elder brother of commodore baldwin fakenham whose offspring like his own were so strangely mixed up with captain kirbys children by countess fanny as you will hear and these two brothers were sons of geoffrey fakenham celebrated for his devotion to the french countess jules dandreuze or some such name a courtly gentleman who turned papist on his deathbed in france in brittany somewhere not to be separated from her in the next world as he solemnly left word wickedly many think to show the oddness of things and how opposite to one another brothers may be his elder the uncle of curtis and baldwin was the renowned old admiral fakenham better known along our seacoasts and ports among sailors as old showery because of a remark he once made to his flagcaptain when cannonballs were coming thick on them in a hardfought action hot work sir his captain said showery replied the admiral as his cockedhat was knocked off by the wind of a cannonball he lost both legs before the war was over and said merrily stumps for life while they were carrying him below to the cockpit in my girlhood the boys were always bringing home anecdotes of old admiral showery not all of them true ones perhaps but they fitted him he was a rough seaman fond as they say of his glass and his girl and utterly despising his brother geoffrey for the airs he gave himself and crawling on his knees to a female parleyvoo and when geoffrey died the admiral drank to his rest in the grave theres to my brother jeff he said and flinging away the dregs of his glass there s to the frog and flinging away the glass to shivers theres to the turncoat he salted his language in a manner i cannot repeat no epithet ever stood by itself when i was young the boys relished these dreadful words because they seemed to smell of tar and battlesmoke when every english boy was for being a sailor and daring the black gentleman below in all truth the bad words came from him though an excellent scholar has assured me they should be taken for aspirates and mean no harm and so it may be but heartily do i rejoice that aspirates have been dropped by people of birth for you might once hear titled ladies guilty of them in polite society i do assure you we have greatly improved in that respect they say the admirals reputation as a british sailor of the old school made him rather his name a great favourite at court but to court he could not be got to go and if the tale be true their majesties paid him a visit on board his ship in harbour one day and sailors tell you that old showery gave his liege lord and lady a common dish of boiled beef with carrots and turnips and a plain dumpling for their dinner with ale and port wine the merit of which he swore to and he became so elate that after the cloth was removed he danced them a hornpipe on his pair of wooden legs whistling his tune and holding his full tumbler of hot grog in his hand all the while without so much as the spilling of a dropso earnest was he in everything he did they say his limit was two bottles of port wine at a sitting with his glass of hot grog to follow and not a soul could induce him to go beyond that in addition to being a great seaman he was a very religious man and a stout churchman well now the curtis fakenham of captain kirbys day had a good deal of his uncle as well as his father in him the spirit of one and the outside of the other and favoured or not he had been distinguished among countess fannys adorers she certainly chose to be silent about the name of the assailant and it has been attested on oath that two days and a night subsequent to the date furnished by charles dump curtis fakenham was brought to his house hollis grange lame of a leg with a shot in his breast that he carried to the family vault and his head gamekeeper john wiltshire a resolute fellow was missing from that hour some said they had a quarrel and curtis was wounded and john wiltshire killed curtis was known to have been extremely attached to the man yet when wiltshire was inquired for he let fall a word of having more of wiltshire than was agreeable to hampshirehis county people asked what that meant yet according to the tale it was the surviving servant by whom he or whoever it may have been was accidentally shot we are in a perfect tangle on the other hand it was never denied that curtis and john wiltshire were in london together at the time of countess fannys flight and curtis fakenham was one of the procession of armed gentleman conducting her in her carriage as they supposed and he was known to have started off on the discovery of the cheat with horrible imprecations against frenchwomen it became known too that horses of his were standing saddled in his innyard at midnight and more charles dump the postillion was taken secretly to set eyes on him as they wheeled him in his gardenwalk and he vowed it was the identical gentleman but this coming by and by to the ear of curtis he had charles dump fetched over to confront him and then the man made oath that he had never seen mr curtis fakenham anywhere but there in his own house at hollis one does not really know what to think of it this postillion made a small fortune he was everywhere in request people were never tired of asking him how he behaved while the fight was going on and he always answered that he sat as close to his horse as he could and did not dream of dismounting for he said he was a figure on a horse and naught when off it his repetition of the story with some adornments and that same remark made him the popular man of the county people said he might enter parliament and i think at one time it was possible but a great success is full of temptations after being hired at inns to fill them with his account of the battle and tipped by travellers from london to show the spot he set up for himself as innkeeper and would have flourished only he had contracted habits on his rounds and he fell to contradicting himself so that he came to be called lying charley and the people of the country said it was he who drained the punchbowl for though he helped to put the capital into it he took all the interest out of it yet we have the doctor of the village of ipley dr cawthorne a noted botanist assuring us of the absolute credibility of charles dump whom he attended in the poor creatures last illness when charles dump confessed he had lived in mortal terror of squire curtis and had got the trick of lying through fear of telling the truth hence his ruin so he died delirious and contrite cawthorne the great turf man inherited a portrait of him from his father the doctor it was often the occasion of the story being told over again and used to hang in the patients reception room next to an oilpainting of the punchbowl an admired landscape picture by a local artist highlytoned and true to every particular of the scene with the bright yellow road winding uphill and the banks of brilliant purple heath and a white thorn in bloom quite beautiful and the green fir trees and the big bowl black as a cauldronindeed a perfect feast of harmonious contrasts in colours and now you know how it is that the names of captain kirby and curtis fakenham are alive to the present moment in the district we lived a happy domestic life in those old coaching days when county affairs and county people were the topics of firesides and the country enclosed us to make us feel snug in our own importance my opinion is that men and women grow to their dimensions only where such is the case we had our alarms from the outside now and again but we soon relapsed to dwell upon our private business and our pleasant little hopes and excitements the courtships and the crosses and the scandals the teaparties and the dances and how the morning looked after the stormy night had passed and the coach coming down the hill with a box of news and perhaps a curious passenger to drop at the inn i do believe we had a liking for the very highwaymen if they had any reputation for civility what i call human events things concerning you and me instead of the deafening catastrophes now afflicting and taking all conversation out of us had their natural interest then we studied the face of each morning as it came and speculated upon the secret of the thing it might have in store for us or our heroes and heroines we thought of them more than of ourselves long after the adventures of the punchbowl our county was anxious about countess fanny and the old buccaneer wondering where they were and whether they were prospering whether they were just as much in love as ever and which of them would bury the other and what the foreign people abroad thought of that strange pair chapter iii continuation of the introductory meanderings of dame gossip together with her sudden extinction i have still time before me according to the terms of my agreement with the person to whom i have i fear foolishly entrusted the letters and documents of a story surpassing ancient as well as modern in the wonderment it causes that would make the law courts bless their hearts judges no less than the barristers to have it running through them day by day with every particular to wrangle over and many to serve as a text for the pulpit so to proceed it should be mentioned that the postillion charles dump is not represented and i have no conception of the reason why not sitting on horseback in the portrait in the possession of the cawthorne family i have not seen it i am bound to admit we had offended dr cawthorne by once in an urgent case calling in another doctor who he would have it was a quack that ought to have killed us and we ceased to visit but a gentleman who was an established patient of dr cawthornes and had frequent opportunities of judging the portrait in the course of a chronic malady describes charles dump on his legs as a small man looking diminished from a very much longer one by shrinkage in thickish wrinkles from the shoulders to the shanks his hat is enormous and very gay he is rather of sad countenance an elevation of his collar behind the ears and pointed at the neck gives you notions of his having dropped from some hook he stands with his forefinger extended like a disused semaphorepost that seems tumbling and desponding on the hill by the highroad in his attitude while telling the tale if standing it may be called where the whole figure appears imploring for a seat that was his natural position as one would suppose any artist must have thought and a horse beneath him but it has been suggested that the artist in question was no painter of animals then why did he not get a painter of animals to put in the horse it is vain to ask though it is notorious that artists combine without bickering to do these things and one puts his name on the animal the other on the human being or landscape my informant adds that the prominent feature telling a melancholy tale of its own is of sanguine colour and while plainly in the act of speaking charles dump might be fancied about to drop off to sleep he was impressed by the dreaminess of the face and i must say i regard him as an interesting character during my girlhood napoleon bonaparte alone would have been his rival for filling an inn along our roads i have known our boys go to bed obediently and get up at night to run three miles to the wheatsheaf only to stand on the bench or travellersrest outside the window and look in at charles dump reciting with just room enough in the crowd to point his finger as his way was he left a child mary dump who grew up to become ladys maid to livia fakenham daughter of curtis the beauty of hampshire equalled by no one save her cousin henrietta fakenham the daughter of commodore baldwin and they were two different kinds of beauties not to be compared and different were their fortunes for this lady was likened to the sun going down on a cloudy noon and that lady to the moon riding through a stormy night livia was the young widow of lord duffield when she accepted the earl of fleetwood and was his third countess and again a widow at eightandtwenty and stepmother to young croesus the earl of fleetwood of my story mary dump testifies to her kindness of heart to her dependents if we are to speak of goodness i am afraid there are other witnesses i resent being warned that my time is short and that i have wasted much of it over the attractive charles what i have done i have done with a purpose and it must be a storyteller devoid of the rudiments of his art who can complain of my dwelling on charles dump for the world to have a pause and pin its faith to him which it would not do to a grander personthat is as a peg wonderful events however true they are must be attached to something common and familiar to make them credible charles dump i say is like a frontpage picture to a history of those old quiet yet exciting days in england and when once you have seized him the whole period is alive to you as it was to me in the delicious dulness i loved that made us thirsty to hear of adventures and able to enjoy to the utmost every thing occurring the man is no more attractive to me than a lump of clay how could he be but supposing i took up the lump and told you that there where i found it that lump of clay had been rolled over and flung off by the left wheel of the prophets chariot of fire before it mounted aloft and disappeared in the heavens aboveyou would examine it and cherish it and have the scene present with you you may be sure and magnificent descriptions would not be onehalf so persuasive and that is what we call in my profession art if you please so to continue the earl of cressett fell from his coachbox in a fit and died of it a fortnight after the flight of his wife and the people said she might as well have waited kirby and countess fanny were at lucerne or lausanne or some such place in switzerland when the news reached them and kirby without losing an hour laid hold of an english clergyman of the established church and put him through the ceremony of celebrating his lawful union with the beautiful young creature he adored and this he did he said for the world to guard his fan in a wider circle than his two arms could compass if not quite so well so the old buccaneer was ever after that her lawful husband and as his wedded wife not wedded to a fool she was an example to her sex like many another woman who has begun badly with a lightheaded mate it is hard enough for a man to be married to a fool but a man is only halfcancelled by that burden it has been said whereas a woman finds herself on board a rudderless vessel and often the desperate thing she does is to avoid perishing ten months or eleven some say following the proclamation of the marriagetie a son was born to countess fanny close by the castle of chillononthelake and he had the name of chillon switzer john kirby given to him to celebrate the fact two years later the girl was born and for the reason of her first seeing the light in that austrian province she was christened carinthia jane she was her old fathers pet but countess fanny gloried in the boy she had fancied she would be a childless woman before he gave sign of coming and they say she wrote a little volume of meditations in prospect of approaching motherhood for the guidance of others in a similar situation i have never been able to procure the book or pamphlet but i know she was the best of mothers and of wives too and she with her old husband growing like a rose out of a weatherbeaten rock proved she was that among those handsome foreign officers poorly remarkable for their morals not once had the old buccaneer to teach them a lesson think of it and you will know that her feet did not straynor did her pretty eyes her heart was too full for the cravings of vanity innocent ladies who get their husbands into scrapes are innocent perhaps but knock you next door in their bosoms where the soul resides and ask for information of how innocence and uncleanness may go together kirby purchased a mine in carinthia on the borders of styria and worked it himself his native land displeased him so that he would not have been unwilling to see chillon enter the austrian service which the young man was inclined for subsequent to his return to his parents from one of the english public schools notwithstanding his passionate love for old england but lord levellier explained the mystery in a letter to his halfforgiven sister praising the boy for his defence of his mothers name at the school where a big brutal fellow sneered at her and chillon challenged him to sword or pistol and then he walked down to the boys home in staffordshire to force him to fight and the father of the boy made him offer an apology that was not much balm to master chillons wound he returned to his mother quite heavy unlike a young man and the unhappy lady though she knew him to be bitterly sensitive on the point of honour and especially as to everything relating to her saw herself compelled to tell him the history of her life to save him as she thought from these chivalrous vindications of her good name she may have even painted herself worse than she was both to excuse her brothers miserliness to her son and the worlds evil speaking of her wisely or not she chose this course devotedly to protect him from the perils she foresaw in connection with the name of the once famous countess fanny in the british isles and thus are we stricken by the days of our youth it is impossible to moralize conveniently when one is being hurried by a person at ones elbow so the young man heard his mother out and kissed her and then he went secretly to vienna and enlisted and served for a year as a private in the regiment of hussars called my papers tell me liechtenstein and what with his good conduct and the help of kirbys friends he would have obtained a commission from the emperor when at the right moment to keep a sprig of kirbys growth for his country lord levellier sent word that he was down for a cornetcy in a british regiment of dragoons chillon came home from a garrison town and there was a consultation about his future career shall it be england shall it be austria countess fannys voice was for england and she carried the vote knowing though she did that it signified separation and it might be alienationwhere her son would chance to hear things he could not refute she believed that her son by such a man as kirby would be of use to his country and her voice against herself was for england it broke her heart if she failed to receive the regular letter she pined and was disconsolate he has heard more of me was in her mind her husband sat looking at her with his old large grey glassy eyes you would have fancied him awaiting her death as the signal for his own release but she poor mother behind her weeping lids beheld her sons filial love of her wounded and bleeding when there was anything to be done for her old kirby was astir when it was nothing either in physic or assistance he was like a great corner of rock you may indeed imagine grief in the very rock that sees its flower fading to the withered shred on the last night of her life this old man of past ninety carried her in his arms up a flight of stairs to her bed a week after her burial kirby was found a corpse in the mountain forest his having called the death of his darling his lightningstroke must have been the origin of the report that he died of lightning he touched not a morsel of food from the hour of the dropping of the sod on her coffin of ebony wood an old crust of their mahogany bread supposed at first to be a specimen of quartz was found in one of his coat pockets he kissed his girl carinthia before going out on his last journey from home and spoke some wandering words the mine had not been worked for a year she thought she would find him at the mouth of the shaft where he would sometimes be sitting and staring already dead at heart with the death he saw coming to the beloved woman they had to let her down with ropes that she might satisfy herself he was not below she and her great dog and a faithful manservant discovered the body in the forest chillon arrived from england to see the common grave of both his parents and now goodbye to sorrow for a while keep your tears for the living and first i am going to describe to you the young earl of fleetwood son of the strange welsh lady the richest nobleman of his time and how he persued and shunned the lady who had fascinated him henrietta the daughter of commodore baldwin fakenham and how he met carinthia jane and concerning that lovely henrietta and chillon kirbylevellier and of the young poet of ordinary parentage and the giant captain abrane and livia the widowed countess of fleetwood henriettas cousin daughter of curtis fakenham and numbers of others lord levellier lord brailstone lord simon pitscrew chumley potts young ambrose mallard and the english pugilist such a man of honour though he drank and the adventures of madge carinthia janes maid just a few touches and then the marriage dividing great britain into halves taking sides after that i trust you may go on as i would carry you were we all twenty years younger had i but sooner been in possession of these treasured papers i promise you excitement enough if justice is done to them but i must and will describe the wedding this young earl of fleetwood you should know was a very powdermagazine of ambition and never would he break his word which is right if we are properly careful and so he she ceases according to the terms of the treaty the venerable ladys time has passed an extinguisher descends on her giving her the likeness of one under condemnation of the most holy inqusition in the ranks of an auto da fe and singularly resembling that victim at the first sharp bite of the flames she will be when she hears the version of her story chapter iv morning and farewell to an old home brother and sister were about to leave the mountainland for england they had not gone to bed overnight and from the windows of their deserted home a little before dawn they saw the dwindled moon a late riser break through droves of hunted cloud directly topping their ancient guardian height the triple peak and giant of the range friendlier in his name than in aspect for the two young people clinging to the scene they were to quit his name recalled olddays the apparition of his head among the heavens drummed on their sense of banishment to the girl this was a division of her life and the dawn held the sword she felt herself midswing across a gulf that was the grave of one half without a light of promise for the other her passionate excess of attachment to her buried home robbed the future of any colours it might have worn to bid a young heart quicken and england though she was of british blood was a foreign place to her not alluring her brother had twice come out of england reserved in speech her mothers talk of england had been unhappy her father had suffered illtreatment there from a brutal institution termed the admiralty and had never regretted the not seeing england again the thought that she was bound thitherward enfolded her like a frosty mist but these bare walls these loud floors chill rooms dull windows and the vaultsounding of the ghostly house everywhere the absence of the faces in the house told her she had no choice she must go the appearance of her old friend the towering mountainheight up a blue nightsky compelled her swift mind to see herself far away yearning to him out of exile an exile that had no local features she would not imagine them to give a centre of warmth her wilful grief preferred the blank it resembled death in seeming some hollowness behind a shroud which we shudder at the room was lighted by a stablelantern on a kitchentable their seat near the window was a rickety gardenbench rejected in the headlong sale of the furniture and when she rose unable to continue motionless while the hosts of illuminated cloud flew fast she had to warn her brother to preserve his balance he tacitly did so aware of the necessity she walked up and down the long sevenwindowed saloon haunted by her footfall trying to think chafing at his quietness and acknowledging that he did well to be quiet they had finished their packing of boxes and of wearingapparel for the journey there was nothing to think of nothing further to talk of nothing for her to do save to sit and look and deaden her throbs by counting them she soon returned to her seat beside her brother with the marvel in her breast that the house she desired so much to love should be cold and repel her now it was a vacant shell her memories could not hang within it anywhere she shut her eyes to be with the images of the dead conceiving the method as her brothers happy secret and imitated his posture elbows propped on knees to support the chin his quietness breathed of a deeper love than her own meanwhile the high wind had sunk the moon after pushing her withered half to the zenith was climbing the dusky edge revealed fitfully threads and wisps of thin vapour travelled along a falling gale and branched from the dome of the sky in migratory broken lines like wild birds shifting the order of flight north and east where the dawn sat in a web but as yet had done no more than shoot up a glow along the central heavens in amid the waves of deepened aloud a mirror for night to see her dark self in her own hue a shiver between the silent couple pricked their wits and she said chillon shall we run out and call the morning it was an old game of theirs encouraged by their hearty father to be out in the early hour on a rise of ground near the house and call the morning her brother was glad of the challenge and upon one of the yawns following a sleepless night replied with a return to boyishness yes if you like its the last time we shall do her the service here lets go they sprang up together and the bench fell behind them swinging the lantern he carried inconsiderately the ring of it was left on his finger and the end of candle rolled out of the crazy frame to the floor and was extinguished chillon had no matchbox he said to her what do you think of the windowweve done it before carin better than groping down stairs and passages blocked with lumber im ready she said and caught at her skirts by instinct to prove her readiness on the spot a drop of a dozen feet or so from the french window to a flowerbed was not very difficult her father had taught her how to jump besides the how of many other practical things she leaped as lightly as her brother never touching earth with her hands and rising from the proper contraction of the legs in taking the descent she quoted her father mean it when youre doing it for no enemys shot is equal to a weak heart in the act chillon pursued the quotation laying his hand on her shoulder for a sign of approval she looked up at him they passed down the garden and a sloping meadow to a brook swollen by heavy rains over the brook on a narrow plank and up a steep and stony pathway almost a watercourse between rocks to another meadow level with the house that led ascending through a firwood and there the change to thicker darkness told them light was abroad though whether of the clouded moon or of the first grey of the quiet revolution was uncertain metallic light of a subterranean realm it might have been thought you remember everything of father carinthia said we both do said chillon she pressed her brothers arm we will we will never forget anything beyond the firwood light was visibly the dawns halfway down the ravines it resembled the light cast off a torrent water it lay on the grass like a sheet of unreflecting steel and was a face without a smile above their childhood ran along the tracks to the forest by the light which was neither dim nor cold but grave presenting tree and shrub and dwarf growth and grass austerely not deepening or confusing them they wound their way by borders of crag seeing in a dell below the mouth of the idle mine begirt with weedy and shrubhung rock a dripping semicircle farther up they came on the flat juniper and crossed a wet groundthicket of whortleberry their feet were in the moist moss among sprigs of heath and a great firtree stretched his length a peeled multitude of his dead fellows leaned and stood upright in the midst of scattered firestained members and through their skeleton limbs the sheer precipice of slaterock of the bulk across the chasm nursery of hawk and eagle wore a thin blue tinge the sign of warmer light abroad this way my brother cried carinthia shuddering at a path he was about to follow dawn in the mountainland is a meeting of many friends the pinnacle the foresthead the latschentufted mound rockbastion and defiant cliff and giant of the triple peak were in view clearly lined for a common recognition but all were figures of solid gloom unfeatured and bloomless another minute and they had flung off their mail and changed to various indented intricate succinct in ridge scar and channel and they had all a look of watchfulness that made them one company the smell of rockwaters and roots of herb and moss grew keen air became a wine that raised the breast high to breathe it an uplifting coolness pervaded the heights what wonder that the mountainbred girl should let fly her voice the natural carol woke an echo she did not repeat it and we will not forget our home chillon she said touching him gently to comfort some saddened feeling the plumes of cloud now slowly entered into the lofty arch of dawn and melted from brown to purpleblack the upper sky swam with violet and in a moment each stray cloudfeather was edged with rose and then suffused it seemed that the heights fronted east to eye the interflooding of colours and it was imaginable that all turned to the giant whose forehead first kindled to the sun a greeting of god and king on the morning of a farewell we fluctuate sharply between the very distant and the close and homely and even in memory the fluctuation occurs the grander scene casting us back on the modestly nestling and that when it has refreshed us conjuring imagination to embrace the splendour and wonder but the wrench of an immediate division from what we love makes the things within us reach the dearest we put out our hands for them as violentlyparted lovers do though the soul in days to come would know a craving and imagination flap a leaden wing if we had not looked beyond them shall we go down said carinthia for she knew a little cascade near the house showering on rock and fern and longed to have it round her they descended chillon saying that they would soon have the mists rising and must not delay to start on their journey the armies of the young sunrise in mountainlands neighbouring the plains vast shadows were marching over woods and meads black against the edge of golden and great heights were cut with them and bounding waters took the leap in a silvery radiance to gloom the bright and darkbanded valleys were like night and morning taking hands down the sweep of their rivers immense was the range of vision scudding the peaks and over the illimitable eastward plains flat to the very east and sources of the sun carinthia said when i marry i shall come here to live and die her brother glanced at her he was fond of her and personally he liked her face but such a confident anticipation of marriage on the part of a portionless girl set him thinking of the character of her charms and the attraction they would present to the world of men they were expressive enough at times he had thought them marvellous in their clear cut of the animating mindno one could fancy her handsome and just now her hair was in some disorder a night without sleep had an effect on her complexion its not usually the wife who decides where to live said he her ideas were anywhere but with the dream of a husband could we stay on another day my dear girl another night on that crazy stool besides mariandl is bound to go today to her new place and whos to cook for us do you propose fasting as well as watching could i cook she asked him humbly no you couldnt not for a starving regiment your accomplishments are of a different sort no its better to get over the pain at once if we cant escape it that i think too said she and we should have to buy provisions then brother instantly after breakfast only let us walk it i know the whole way and it is not more than a two days walk for you and me consent driving would be like going gladly i could never bear to remember that i was driven away and walking will save money we are not rich you tell me brother a few florins more or less he rejoined rather frowning you have good styrian boots i see but i want to be over at the baths there soon not later than tomorrow but brother if they know we are coming they will wait for us and we can be there tomorrow night or the next morning he considered it he wanted exercise and loved this mountainland his inclinations melted into hers though he had reasons for hesitating well well send on my portmanteau and your boxes in the cart well walk it youre a capital walker youre a gallant comrade i wouldnt wish for a better he wondered as he spoke whether any truehearted gentleman besides himself would ever think the same of this lonely girl her eyes looked a delighted noreally for the sweetest on earth to her was to be prized by her brother she hastened forward we will go down and have our last meal at home she said in the dialect of the country we have five eggs no meat for you dear but enough bread and butter some honey left and plenty of coffee i should like to have left old mariandl more but we are unable to do very much for poor people now milk i cannot say she is just the kind soul to be up and out to fetch us milk for an early first breakfast but she may have overslept herself chillon smiled you were right janet about not going to bed last night we might have missed the morning i hate sleep i hate anything that robs me of my will she replied youd be glad of your doses of sleep if you had to work and study to fall down by the wayside tired outyes brother a dead sleep is good then you are in the hands of god father used to say four hours for a man six for a woman and four and twenty for a lord added chillon i remember a lord of that admiralty she appealed to his closer recollection but i mean brother dreaming is what i detest so dont be detesting my dear reserve your strength said he i suppose dreams are of some use now and then i shall never think them useful when we cant get what we want my good carin then we should not waste ourselves in dreams they promise falsely sometimes thats no reason why we should reject the consolation when we cant get what we want my little sister i would not be denied theres the impossible not for you brother perhaps a halfminute after she had spoken he said pursuing a dialogue within himself aloud rather than revealing a secret you dont know her position carinthias heart stopped beating who was this person suddenly conjured up she fancied she might not have heard correctly she feared to ask and yet she perceived a novel softness in him that would have answered pain of an unknown kind made her love of her brother conscious that if she asked she would suffer greater pain the house was in sight a long white building with blinds down at some of the windows and some wide open some showing unclean glass the three aspects and signs of a houses emptiness when they are seen together carinthia remarked on their having met nobody it had a serious meaning for them formerly they were proud of outstripping the busy population of the mine coming down on them with wild wavings and shouts of sunrise they felt the death again a whole field laid low by one stroke and wintriness in the season of glad life a wind had blown and all had vanished the second green of the year shot lively sparkles off the meadows from a fringe of coloured glovelets to a warm silver lake of dews the firwood was already breathing rich and sweet in the sun the halfmoon fell rayless and paler than the fan of fleeces pushed up westward high overhead themselves dispersing on the blue in downy feathers like the mottled grey of an eagles breast the smaller of them bluish like traces of the beaked woodpigeon she looked above then below on the slim and straightgrown flocks of naked purple crocuses in bud and blow abounding over the meadow that rolled to the level of the house and two of these she gathered chapter v a mountain walk in mist and sunshine chillon was right in his forecast of the mists an overmoistened earth steaming to the sun obscured it before the two had finished breakfast which was a finish to everything eatable in the ravaged dwelling with the exception of a sly store for the midday meal that old mariandl had stuffed into chillons leather sackthe fruit of secret begging on their behalf about the neighbourhood he found the sack heavy and bulky as he slung it over his shoulders but she bade him make nothing of such a trifle till he had it inside him and you that love tea so my pretty one so that you always laughed and sang after drinking a cup with your mother she said to carinthia you will find one pinch of it in your bag at the end of the leftfoot slipper to remember your home by when you are out in the world she crossed the strap of the bag on her mistresss bosom and was embraced by carinthia and chillon in turns carinthia telling her to dry her eyes for that she would certainly come back and perhaps occupy the house one day or other the old soul moaned of eyes that would not be awake to behold her she begged a visit at her grave though it was to be in a catholic burialplace and the priests had used her dear master and mistress ill not allowing them to lie in consecrated ground affection made her a champion of religious tolerance and a little afraid of retribution carinthia soothed her kissed her gave the promise and the parting was over she and chillon had on the previous day accomplished a pilgrimage to the restingplace of their father and mother among humble protestants ironsmelters in a valley out of the way of their present line of march to the glacier of the great snowmountain marking the junction of three alpine provinces of austria josef the cartdriver with the boxes who was to pass the valley vowed of his own accord to hang a fresh days wreath on the rails he would not hear of money for the purchase and they humoured him the family had been beloved there was an offer of a home for carinthia in the castle of count lebern a friend of her parents much taken with her and she would have accepted it had not chillon overruled her choice determined that as she was english she must come to england and live under the guardianship of her uncle lord levellier of whose character he did not speak the girls cheeks were drawn thin and her lips shut as they departed she was tearless a phantom ring of mist accompanied her from her first footing outside the house she did not look back the house came swimming and plunging after her like a spectral ship on big seas and her father and mother lived and died in her breast and now they were strong consulting chatting laughing caressing now still and white caught by a vapour that dived away with them either to right or left but always with the same suddenness leaving her to question herself whether she existed for more of life seemed to be with their mystery than with her speculations the phantom ring of mist enclosing for miles the invariable lowsweeping dark sprucefir kept her thoughts on them as close as the shroud she walked fast but scarcely felt that she was moving near midday the haunted circle widened rocks were loosely folded in it and heads of trees whose round intervolving roots grasped the yellow roadside soil the mists shook like a curtain and partly opened and displayed a tapestrylandscape roughly worked of woollen crag and castle and suggested glen threaded waters very prominent foreground autumn flowers on banks a predominant atmospheric greyness the sun threw a shaft liquid instead of burning as we see his beams beneath a wave and then the mists narrowed again boiled up the valleys and streams above the mountain curled and flew and were python coils pierced by brighter arrows of the sun a spot of blue signalled his victory above to look at it was to fancy they had been walking under water and had now risen to the surface carinthias mind stepped out of the chamber of death the different air and scene breathed into her a timid warmth toward the future and between her naming of the lesser mountains on their side of the pass she asked questions relating to england and especially the ladies she was to see at the baths beyond the glacierpass she had heard of a party of his friends awaiting him there without much encouragement from him to ask particulars of them and she had hitherto abstained as she was rather shy of meeting her countrywomen the ladies chillon said were cousins one was a young widow the countess of fleetwood and the other was miss fakenham a younger lady carinthia murmured in german poor soul which one was she pitying the widow she said in the tone implying naturally her brother assured her the widow was used to it for this was her second widowhood she marries again exclaimed the girl you dont like that idea said he carinthia betrayed a delicate shudder her brother laughed to himself at her expressive present tense and marries again he said there will certainly be a third husband said she as at the incredible husband lets hope he answered she dropped from her contemplation of the lady and her look at her brother signified it will not be you chillon was engaged in spying for a place where he could spread out the contents of his bag sharp hunger beset them both at the mention of eating a bank of sloping green shaded by a chestnut proposed the seat and here he relieved the bag of a bottle of wine slices of meat bread hard eggs and lettuce a chipped cup to fling away after drinking the wine and a supply of small butlercakes known to be favourites with carinthia she reversed the order of the feast by commencing upon one of the cakes to do honour to mariandls thoughtfulness as at their breakfast they shared the last morsel but we would have made it enough for our dear old dog pluto as well if he had lived said carinthia sighing with her thankfulness and compassionate regrets a mixture often inspiring a tender babbling melancholy dogs eyes have such a sick look of love he might have lived longer though he was very old only he could not survive the loss of father i know the finding of the body broke his heart he sprang forward he stopped and threw up his head it was human language to hear him chillon he lay in the yard trying to lift his eyes when i came to him they were so heavy and he had not strength to move his poor old tail more than once he died with his head on my lap he seemed to beg me and i took him and he breathed twice and that was his end pluto old dog well for you or for me brother we could not have a better wish as for me death when we know we are to die only let my darling live that is my prayer and that we two may not be separated till i am taken to their grave father bought ground for fourhis wife and himself and his two children it does not oblige us to be buried there but could we have any other desire she stretched her hand to her brother he kissed it spiritedly look ahead my dear girl help me to finish this wine there s nothing like good hard walking to give common wine of the country a flavourand out of broken crockery i think it so good carinthia replied after drinking from the cup in england they do not grow wine are the people there kind theyre civilized people of course kindwarm to you chillon some of them when you know them warm is hardly the word winters warm on skates you must do a great deal for yourself they dont boil over by the way dont expect much of your uncle will he not love me he gives you a lodging in his house and food enough well hope you wont see company or much of him i cannot exist without being loved i do not care for company he must love me a little he is one of the warmhearted racehes mothers brother but where his heart is i ve not discovered bear with him just for the present my dear till i am able to support you i will she said the dreary vision of a home with an unloving uncle was not brightened by the alternative of her brothers having to support her she spoke of money have we none chillon we have no debts he answered we have a claim on the government here for indemnification for property taken to build a fortress upon one of the passes into italy father bought the land thinking there would be a yield of ore thereabout and they have seized it rightly enough but they dispute our claim for the valuation we put on it a small sum they would consent to pay it would be a very small sum and i m fathers son i will have justice yes carthinia joined with him to show the same stout nature we have nothing else except a bit to toss up for luck and how can i help being a burden on my brother she inquired in distress marry and be a blessing to a husband he said lightly they performed a sacrifice of the empty bottle and cracked cup on the site of their meal as if it had been a ceremony demanded from travellers and leaving them in fragments proceeded on their journey refreshed walking was now high enjoyment notwithstanding the force of the sun for they were a hardy couple requiring no more than sufficient nourishment to combat the elements with an exulting blood besides they loved mountain air and scenery and each step to the ridge of the pass they climbed was an advance in splendour peaks of ashen hue and pale dry red and pale sulphur pushed up straight forked twisted naked striking their minds with an indeterminate ghostliness of indian so strange they were in shape and colouring these sharp points were the first to greet them between the blue and green a depression of the pass to the left gave sight of the points of black fir forest below round the girths of the barren shafts mountain blocks appeared pushing up in front and a mountain wall and woods on it and mountains in the distance and cliffs riven with falls of water that were silver skeins down lower to meadows villages and spires and lower finally to the whole valley of the foaming river field and river seeming in imagination rolled out from the hand of the heading mountain but see this in winter as i did with father chillon said carinthia she said it upon loves instinct to halo the scene with something beyond present vision and to sanctify it for her brother so that this walk of theirs together should never be forgotten a smooth fold of cloud moveless along one of the upper pastures and still dense enough to be luminous in sunlight was the last of the mist they watched it lying in the form of a fish leviathan diminished as they descended their path and the head was lost the tail spread peacockwise and evaporated slowly in that likeness and soft to a breath of air as gossamer down the body became a ball a cock a little lizard nothingness the bluest bright day of the year was shining chillon led the descent with his trim and handsome figure before her carinthia remembered the current saying that he should have been the girl and she the boy that was because he resembled their mother in face but the build of his limbs and shoulders was not feminine to her admiring eyes he had a look superior to simple strength and grace the look of a great skybird about to mount a fountainlike energy of stature delightful to her contemplation and he had the mouth women put faith in for decision and fixedness she did most fully and reflecting how entirely she did so the thought assailed her some one must be loving him she allowed it to surprise her not choosing to revert to an uneasy sensation of the morning that some one her process of reasoning informed her was necessarily an english young lady she reserved her questions till they should cease this hopping and heeling down the zigzag of the slippery pathtrack when children they had been collectors of beetles and butterflies and the flying by of a royalmantle the purple butterfly grandly fringed could still remind carinthia of the event it was of old to spy and chase one chillon himself was not above the sentiment of their very early days he stopped to ask if she had been that lustrous bluewing a rarer species prized by youngsters shoot through the chestnut trees and they both paused for a moment gazing into the fairyland of infancy she seeing with her brothers eyes this prince of the realm having escaped her he owned he might have been mistaken as the brilliant fellow flew swift and high between leaves like an ordinary fritillary not the less did they get their glimpse of the wonders in the sunny eternity of a childs afternoon an auerhahn chillon she said picturing the maturer day when she had scaled perilous heights with him at night to stalk the blackcock in the prime of the morning she wished they could have had another such adventure to stamp the old home on his heart freshly to the exclusion of beautiful english faces on the level of the valley where they met the torrentriver walking side by side with him she ventured an inquiry english girls are fair girls are they not there are some dark also he replied but the bestlooking are fair perhaps they are with us mother was fair she was i have only seen a few of them once at vies and at venice and those baths we are going to and at meran i think you considered them charming not all it was touching that she should be such a stranger to her countrywomen he drew a portraitcase from his breastpocket pressing the spring and handed it to her saying there is one he spoke indifferently but as soon as she had seen the face inside it with a look at him and a deep breath she understood that he was an altered brother and that they were three instead of two she handed it back to him saying hushedly and only yes he did not ask an opinion upon the beauty she had seen his pace increased and she hastened her steps beside him she had not much to learn when some minutes later she said shall i see her chillon she is one of the ladies we are to meet what a pity carinthia stepped faster enlightened as to his wish to get to the baths without delay and her heart softened in reflecting how readily he had yielded to her silly preference for going on foot her cry of regret was equivocal it produced no impression on him they reached a village where her leader deemed it adviseable to drive for the remainder of the distance up the valley to the barrier snowmountain she assented instantly she had no longer any active wishes of her own save to make amends to her brother who was and would ever be her brother she could not be robbed of their relationship something undefined in her feeling of possession she had been robbed of she knew it by her spiritlessness and she would fain have attributed it to the idle motion of the car now and them stupidly jolting her on after the valiant exercise of her limbs they were in a land of waterfalls and busy mills a narrowing vale where the runs of grass grew short and wild and the glacierriver roared for the leap more foam than water and the savagery naturally exciting to her breathed of its lair among the rocks and icefields her brother said there he is she saw the whitecrowned king of the region of whose near presence to her old home she had been accustomed to think proudly end she looked at him without springing to him and continued imaging her english home and her loveless uncle merely admiring the scene as if the fire of her soul had been extinguishedmarry and be a blessing to a husband chillons words whispered of the means of escape from the den of her uncle but who would marry me she thought an unreproved sensation of melting pervaded her she knew her capacity for gratitude and conjuring it up in her heart there came with it the noble knightly gentleman who would really stoop to take a plain girl by the hand release her and say be mine his vizor was down of course she had no power of imagining the lineaments of that prodigy or was he a dream he came and went her mother not unkindly sadly had counted her poor girls chances of winning attention and a husband her father had doated on her face but as she argued her father had been attracted by her mother a beautiful woman and this was a circumstance that reflected the greater hopelessness on her prospects she bore a likeness to her father little to her mother though he fancied the reverse and gave her the mothers lips and hair thinking of herself however was destructive to the form of her mirror of knightliness he wavered he fled for good as the rosy vapour born of our sensibility must do when we relapse to coldness and the more completely when we try to command it no she thought a plain girl should think of work to earn her independence women are not permitted to follow armies chillon she said he laughed out what s in your head the laugh abashed her she murmured of women being good nurses for wounded soldiers if they were good walkers to march with the army and as evidently it sounded witless to him she added to seem reasonable you have not told me the christian names of those ladies he made queer eyes over the puzzle to connect the foregoing and the succeeding in her remarks but answered straightforwardly livia is one and henrietta her ear seized on the stress of his voice henrietta she chose that name for the name of the person disturbing her it fused best she thought with the new element she had been compelled to take into her system to absorb it if she could youre not scheming to have them serve as army hospital nurses my dear no chillon you cant explain it i suppose a sister could go too when you go to war chillon a sister could go if it were permitted by the authorities and be near her brother to nurse him in case of wounds others would be unable to claim the privilege that was her meaning involved with the hazy project of earning an independence but she could not explain it and chillon set her down for one of the inexplicable sex which the simple adventurous girl had not previously seemed to be she was inwardly warned of having talked foolishly and she held her tongue her humble and modest jealousy scarce deserving the title passed with a sigh or two it was her first taste of life in the world a fit of heavymindedness ensued that heightened the contrast her recent mood had bequeathed between herself ignorant as she was and those ladies their names livia and henrietta soared above her and sang the music of the splendid spheres henrietta was closer to earth for her features had been revealed she was therefore the dearer and the richer for him who loved her being one of us though an overearthly one and carinthia gave her to chillon reserving for herself a handmaidens place within the circle of their happiness this done she sat straight in the car it was toiling up the steep ascent of a glen to the mountain village the last of her native province her proposal to walk was accepted and the speeding of her blood now that she had mastered a new element in it soon restored her to her sisterly affinity with natural glories the sunset was on yonder side of the snows here there was a feast of variouslytinted sunset shadows on snow meadows rock river serrated cliff the peaked cap of the rushing rockdotted sweeps of upward snow caught a scarlet illumination one flank of the white in heaven was violetted wonderfully at nightfall under a clear black sky alive with wakeful fires round head and breast of the great alp chillon and carinthia strolled out of the village and he told her some of his hopes they referred to inventions of destructive weapons which were primarily to place his country out of all danger from a world in arms and also it might be mentioned to bring him fortune for i must have money he said sighing it out like a deliberate oath he and his uncle were associated in the inventions they had an improved rocket that would force military chiefs to change their tactics they had a new powder a rifle a model musketthe latter based on his own plans and a scheme for fortress artillery likely to turn the preponderance in favour of the defensive once again and that will be really doing good said chillon for where its with the offensive theres everlasting bullying and plundering carinthia warmly agreed with him but begged him be sure his uncle divided the profits equally she discerned what his need of money signified tenderness urged her to say henrietta chillon well he answered quickly will she wait can she you should ask is she brave who can tell till she has been tried is she quite free she has not yet been captured brother is there no one else theres a nobleman anxious to bestow his titles on her he is rich the first or second wealthiest in great britain they say is he young about the same age as mine is he a handsome young man handsomer than your brother my girl no no no said she and what if he is and your henrietta does not choose him now let me think what i long to think i have her close to me she rocked a roseate image on her heart and went to bed with it by starlight by starlight they sprang to their feet and departed the next morning in the steps of a guide carrying chillon said a better lantern than we left behind us at the smithy father exclaimed carinthia on her swift inward breath for this one of the names he had used to give to her old home revived him to her thoughts and senses fervently chapter vi the natural philosopher three parts down a swift decline of shattered slate where travelling stones loosened from rows of scree hurl away at a bound after one roll over there sat a youth dusty and torn nursing a bruised leg not in the easiest of postures on a sharp tooth of rock that might at any moment have broken from the slanting slab at the end of which it formed a stump and added him a second time to the general crumble of the mountain he had done a portion of the descent in excellent imitation of the detached fragments and had parted company with his alpenstock and plaid preserving his hat and his knapsack he was alone disabled and cheerful in doubt of the arrival of succour before he could trust his left leg to do him further service unaided but it was morning still the sun was hot the air was cool just the tempering opposition to render existence pleasant as a piece of vegetation especially when there has been a question of your ceasing to exist and the view was of a sustaining sublimity of desolateness crag and snow overhead a gloomy vale below no life either of bird or herd a voiceless region where there had once been roars at the bowling of a hill from a mountain to the deep and the third flank of the mountain spoke of it in the silence he would have enjoyed the scene unremittingly like the philosopher he pretended to be in a disdain of civilization and the ambitions of men had not a contest with earth been forced on him from time to time to keep the heel of his right foot dug in shallow shale fixed and supporting as long as it held he was happy and maintained the attitude of a guitarplayer thrumming the calf of the useless leg to accompany tuneful thoughts but the inevitable lapse and slide of the foot recurred and the philosopher was exhibited as an infant learning to crawl the seat moreover not having been fashioned for him or for any soft purpose resisted his pressure and became a thing of violence that required to be humiliatingly coaxed his last resource to propitiate it was counselled by nature turned mathematician tenacious extension solved the problem he lay back at his length and with his hat over his eyes consented to see nothing for the sake of comfort thus he was perfectly rational though when others beheld him he appeared the insanest of mortals a girls voice gave out the mountain carol ringingly above his heart and all his fancies were in motion at the sound he leaned on an elbow to listen the slide threatened him and he resumed his full stretch determined to take her for a dream he was of the class of youths who in apprehension that their bright season may not be permanent choose to fortify it by a systematic contempt of material realities unless they come in the fairest of shapes and as he was quite sincere in this feeling and election of the right way to live disappointment and sullenness overcame him on hearing mens shouts and steps despite his helpless condition he refused to stir for they had jarred on his dream perhaps his temper unknown to himself had been a little injured by his mishap and he would not have been sorry to charge them with want of common humanity in passing him or he did not think his plight so bad else he would have bawled after them had they gone by far the youths of his description are fools only upon systemhowever earnestly they indulge the present selfpunishing sentiment the party did not pass they stopped short they consulted and a feminine tongue more urgent than the others and very musical sweet to hear anywhere put him in tune she said brother brother in german our philosopher flung off his hat you see said the ladys brother ask him antonshe said to their guide and quick her brother added the guide scrambled along to him and at a closer glance shouted the englishman wheeling his finger to indicate what had happened to the tomnoddy islander his master called to know if there were broken bones as if he could stop for nothing else the cripple was raised the gentleman and lady made their way to him and he tried his hardest to keep from tottering on the slope in her presence no injury had been done to the leg there was only a stiffness and an idiotic doubling of the knee as though at each step his leg pronounced a dogged negative to the act of walking he said something equivalent to this donkey leg to divert her charitable eyes from a countenance dancing with ugly twitches she was the samaritan a sufferer discerns his friend though it be not the one who physically assists him he is inclined by nature to put material aid at a lower mark than gentleness and her brief words of encouragement the tone of their delivery yet more were medical to his blood better help than her brothers iron arm he really believed her brother and the guide held him on each side and she led to pick out the safer footing for him she looked round and pointed to some projection that would form a step she drew attention to views here and there to win excuses for his resting she did not omit to soften her brothers visible impatience as well and this was the art which affected her keenly sensible debtor most i suppose i ought to have taken a guide he said theres not a doubt of that said chillon kirby carinthia halted leaning on her staff but i had the same wish they told us at the inn of an englishman who left last night to sleep on the mountain and would go alone and did i not say brother that must be true love of the mountains these freaks get us a bad name on the continent her brother replied he had no sympathy with nonsense and naturally not with a youth who smelt of being a dreamy romancer and had caused the name of englishman to be shouted in his ear in derision and the fellow might delay his arrival at the baths and sight of the lady of his love for hours they managed to get him hobbling and slipping to the first green tuft of the base where long black tongues of slaterubble pouring into the grass like shorewaves that have spent their burden seem about to draw back to bring the mountain down thence to the level pasture was but a few skips performed sliding well now said chillon you can stand pretty well i think he tried his foot on the ground and then stretched his length saying that it only wanted rest anton pressed a hand at his ankle and made him wince but the bones were sound leg and hip not worse than badly bruised he was advised by anton to plant his foot in the first running water he came to and he was considerate enough to say to chillon now you can leave me and let me thank you half an hour will set me right my name is woodseer if ever we meet again chillon nodded a hurried goodbye without a thought of giving his name in return but carinthia had thrown herself on the grass her brother asked her in dismay if she was tired she murmured to him i should like to hear more english my dear girl youll have enough of it in two or three weeks should we leave a good deed half done chillon he shall have our guide he may not be rich ill pay anton to stick to him brother he has an objection to guides chillon cast hungry eyes on his watch five minutes then he addressed mr woodseer who was reposing indifferent to time hardby your objection to guides might have taught you a sharp lesson it s like declining to have a master in studying a sciencetrusting to instinct for your knowledge of a bargain one might as well refuse an oar to row in a boat i d rather risk it the young man replied these guides kick the soul out of scenery i came for that and not for them you might easily have been a disagreeable part of the scene why not here as well as elsewhere you dont care for your life i try not to care for it a fraction more than destiny does fatalism i suppose you care for something besides ive a slack purse and shun guides and inns when i can i care for open air colour flowers weeds birds insects mountains theres a world behind the mask i call this life and the towns a boiling pot intolerably stuffy my one ambition is to be out of it i thank heaven i have not another on earth yes i care for my notebook because its of no use to a human being except me i slept beside a spring last night and i never shall like a bedroom so well i think i have discovered the great secret i may be wrong of course and if so he had his philosophy the admission was meant to say carinthia expected the revelation of a notable secret but none came or if it did it eluded her grasphe was praising contemplation he was praising tobacco he talked of the charm of poverty upon a settled income of a very small sum of money the fruit of a compact he would execute with the town to agree to his perpetual exclusion from it and to retain his identity and not be the composite which every townsman was he talked of buddha he said here the brooks the brook the mountains the mountain they are as they always were youd have men be the same chillon remarked as to a nursling prattler and he rejoined theyve lost more than theyve gained though he admitted there has been some gain in a certain way fortunately for them young men have not the habit of reflecting upon the indigestion of ideas they receive from members of their community sometimes upon exchange they compare a view of life with their own view to condemn it summarily and he was a curious object to chillon as the perfect opposite of himself i would advise you chillon said to get a pair of styrian boots if you intend to stay in the alps those boots of yours are london make they re my fathers make said mr woodseer chillon drew out his watch come carinthia we must be off he proposed his guide and as anton was rejected he pointed the route over the head of the valley stated the distance to an inn that way saluted and strode mr woodseer partly rising presumed in raising his hat and thanking carinthia to touch her fingers she smiled on him frankly extending her open hand and pointing the route again counselling him to rest at the inn even saying you have not yet your strength to come on with us he thought he would stay some time longer he had a disposition to smoke she tripped away to her brother and was watched through the whiffs of a pipe far up the valley guiltless of any consciousness of producing an impression but her mind was with the stranger sufficiently to cause her to say to chillon at the close of a dispute between him and anton on the interesting subject of the growth of the horns of chamois have we been quite kind to that gentleman chillon looked over his shoulder hes there still hes fond of solitude and carin my dear dont give your hand when you are meeting or parting with people its not done his uninstructed sister said did you not like him she was answered with an oh the tone of which balanced lightly on the neutral line some of the ideas he has are lord fleetwoods i hear and one can understand them in a man of enormous wealth who doesnt know what to do with himself and is deadsick of flattery though it seems odd for an english nobleman to be raving about nature perhaps its because none else of them does lord fleetwood loves our mountains chillon but a fellow who probably has to make his way in the worldand he despises ambition chillon dropped him he was antipathetic to eccentrics and his soldierly and social training opposed the profession of heterodox ideas to have listened seriously to them coming from the mouth of an unambitious bootmakers son involved him in the absurdity he considered that there was no harm in the lad rather a commendable sort of courage and some notion of manners allowing for his ignorance of the convenable in putting out his hand to take a young ladys with the plea of thanking her he hoped she would be more on her guard carinthia was sure she had the name of the nobleman wishing to bestow his title upon the beautiful henrietta lord fleetwood that slender thread given her of the character of her brothers rival who loved the mountains was woven in her mind with her passing experience of the youth they had left behind them until the two became one a highly transfigured one and the mountain scenery made him very threatening to her brother a silky haired youth browneyed unconquerable in adversity immensely rich fond of solitude curled decorated bejewelled by all the elves and gnomes of inmost solitude must have marvellous attractions she feared she thought of him so much that her humble spirit conceived the stricken soul of the woman as of necessity the pursuer as shamelessly though timidly as she herself pursued in imagination the enchanted secret of the mountainland she hoped her brother would not supplicate for it struck her that the lover who besieged the lady would forfeit her roaming and hunting fancy i wonder what that gentleman is doing now she said to chillon he grimaced slightly for her sake he would have liked to inform her for the sake of educating her in the customs of the world she was going to enter that the word gentleman conveys in english a special signification her expression of wonder whether they were to meet him again gave chillon the opportunity of saying it s the unlikeliest thing possibleat all events in england but i think we shall said she my dear you meet people of your own class you dont meet others but we may meet anybody chillon in the street i suppose you would not stop to speak to him in the street it would be strange to see him in the street carinthia said strange or not chillon thought he had said sufficient she was under his protectorship otherwise he would not have alluded to the observance of class distinctions he felt them personally in this case because of their seeming to stretch grotesquely by the pretentious heterodoxy of the young fellow whom nevertheless thinking him over now that he was mentioned he approved for his manliness in bluntly telling his origin and status a chalet supplied them with fresh milk and the inn of a village on a perch with the midday meal their appetites were princely and swept over the little inn like a conflagration only after clearing it did they remember the rearward pedestrian whose probable wants chillon was urged by carthinia to speak of to their host they pushed on clambering up scurrying down tramping gaily till by degrees the chambers of carinthias imagination closed their doors and would no longer intercommunicate her head refused to interest her and left all activity to her legs and her eyes and the latter became unobservant except of foottracks animallike she felt that she was a fine machine and nothing else and she was rapidly approaching those ladies you will tell them how i walked with you she said your friends over yonder said he so that they may not think me so ignorant brother she stumbled on the helpless word in a hasty effort to cloak her vanity he laughed her desire to meet the critical english ladies with a towering reputation in one department of human enterprise was comprehensible considering the natural apprehensiveness of the halfwild girl before such a meeting as it often happens with the silly phrases of simple people the wrong word foolish although it was went to the heart of the hearer and threw a more charitable light than ridicule on her so that they may know i can do something they cannot do was the interpretation it showed her deep knowledge of her poorness in laying bare the fact anxious to cheer her he said come come you can dance you dance well mother has told me and she was a judge you ride you swim you have a voice for country songs at all events and youre a bit of a botanist too youre good at english and german you had a french governess for a couple of years by the way you understand the use of a walkingstick in selfdefence you could handle a sword on occasion father trained me said carthinia i can fire a pistol aiming with a good aim too father told me you could how fond he was of his girl well bear in mind that father was proud of you and hold up your head wherever you are i will she said he assured her he had a mind to have a bugle blown at the entrance of the baths for a challenge to the bathers to match her in warlike accomplishments she bit her lips she could not bear much rallying on the subject just then which is the hard one to please she asked the one you will find the kinder of the two henrietta he nodded has she a father a gallant old admiral admiral baldwin fakenham i am glad of that carinthia sighed out heartily and he is with her and likes you chillon on the whole i think he does a brave officer such a father would be sure to like him so the domestic prospect was hopeful at sunset they stood on the hills overlooking the basin of the baths all enfolded in swathes of pink and crimson up to the shining grey of a high heaven that had the fresh brightness of the morning we are not tired in the slightest said carinthia trifling with the vision of a cushioned rest below i could go on through the night quite comfortably wait till you wake up in your little bed tomorrow chillon replied stoutly to drive a chill from his lovers heart that had seized it at the bare suggestion of their going on chapter vii the ladys letter is not the lover a prophet he that fervently desires may well be one his hurried nature is alive with warmth to break the possible blow and if his fears were not needed they were shadows and if fulfilled was he not convinced of his misfortune by a dark anticipation that rarely erred descending the hills he remembered several omens the sun had sunk when he looked down on the villas and clustered houses not an edge of the orb had been seen the admirals quarters in the broadfaced hotel had worn an appearance resembling the empty house of yesterday the encounter with the fellow on the rocks had a bad whisper of impish tripping and what moved carinthia to speak of going on a letter was handed to chillon in the hall of the admirals hotel where his baggage had already been delivered the manager was deploring the circumstance that his rooms were full to the roof when chillon said well we must wash and eat and carinthia from watching her brothers forehead during his perusal of the letter declared her readiness for anything he gave her the letter to read by herself while preparing to sit at table unwilling to ask her for a further tax on her energiesbut it was she who had spoken of going on he thought of it as of a debt she had contracted and might be supposed to think payable to their misfortune she read off the first two sentences we can have a carriage here chillon order a carriage i shall get as much sleep in a carriage as in a bed i shall enjoy driving at night she said immediately and strongly urged it and forced him to yield the manager observing that a carriage could be had in the privacy of her room admiring the clear flowing hand she read the words delicious in their strangeness to her notwithstanding the heavy news as though they were sung out of a nightsky most picturesque of castles may none these marks efface for they appeal from tyranny we start at noon today sailing orders have been issued and i could only have resisted them in my own person by casting myself overboard i go like the boat behind the vessel you were expected yesterday at latest this morning i have seen boxes in the hall with a name on them not foreign to me why does the master tarry sir of your valliance you should have held to your good vowquoth the damozel for now you see me sore perplexed and that you did not your devoir is my affliction where lingers chivalry she should have proceeded if not with my knight i feast on your regrets i would not have you less than miserable and i fear the reason is that i am not so very very sure you will be so at all or very hugely as i would command it of you for just time enough to see that change over your eyebrows i know so well if you had seen a certain henrietta yesterday you would have the picture of how you ought to look the admiral was heard welcoming a new arrivalyou can hear him she ran down the stairs quicker than any cascade of this district she would have made a bet with livia that it could be no one elseher hand was out before she was aware of the difference it was locked in lord fs let the guilty absent suffer for causing such a betrayal of disappointment i must be avenged but if indeed you are unhappy and would like to chide the innocent i am full of compassion for the poor gentleman inheriting my legitimate feelings of wrath and beg merely that he will not pour them out on me with pen and paper but from his lips and eyes time pressing i chatter no more the destination is livias beloved baden we rest a night in the city of mozart a night at munich a night at stuttgart baden will detain my cousin full a week she has captain abrane and sir meeson corby in attendanceher long shadow and her short both devoted to lord f to win her smile and how he drives them the captain has been paraded on the promenade to the stupefaction of the foreigner princes counts generals diplomats passed under him in awe i am told that he is called st christopher why do we go thus hastilymy friend this letter has to be concealed i know some one who sees in the dark think no harm of livia she is bent upon my worldly advantage and that is plain even to the person rejecting it how much more so must it be to papa though he likes you and when you are near him would perhaps in a fit of unworldliness be almost as reckless as the creature he calls madcap and would rather call countess no sooner with a willothewisp my friend who could ever know where the man was when he himself never knows where he is he is the wind that bloweth as it listethbecause it is without an aim or always with a new one and am i the one to direct him i need direction my lord and sovereign must fix my mind i am volatile earthly not to be trusted if i do not worship he himself said to me thathe reads our characters nothing but a proved hero will satisfy henrietta his words and the hero must be shining like a beaconfire kept in a blaze quite true i own it is chillon kirby satisfied he ought to be but ohto be yoked is an insufferable thought unless we name all the conditions but to be yoked to a creature of impulses really i could only describe his erratic nature by commending you to the study of a dragonfly it would map you an idea of what he has been in the twentyfour hours since we had him here they tell me a vain sort of person is the cause can she be the cause of his resolving to have a residence here to buy up half the valleyerecting a royal palaceand marking out the siteraving about it in the wildest language poetical if it had been a little reasonableand then after a night suddenly unaccountably hating the place and being under the necessity of flying from it in hot haste tearing us all away as if we were attached to a kite that will neither mount nor fall but rushes about headlong has he heard or suspected or seen certain boxes bearing a name livia has no suspicion though she thinks me wonderfully contented in so dull a place where it has rained nine days in a fortnight i ask myself whether my manner of greeting him betrayed my expectation of another he has brains it is the greatest of errors to suppose him at all like the common run of rich young noblemen he seems to thirst for brilliant wits and original sayings his ambition is to lead all england in everything i readily acknowledge that he has generous ideas too but try to hold him deny him his liberty and it would be seen how desperate and relentless he would be to get loose of this i am convinced he would be either the most abject of lovers or a woman if it turned out not to be love would find him the most unscrupulous of yokefellows yokefellow she would not have her reason in consenting a lamb and a furious bull papa and i have had a serious talk he shuts his ears to my comparisons but admits that as i am the principal person concerned etc rich and a nobleman is too tempting for an anxious father and livias influence is paramount she has not said a syllable in depreciation of you that is to her credit she also admits that i must yield freely if at all and she grants me the use of similes but her tactics are to contest them one by one and the admirable pretender is not as shifty as the mariners breeze he is not like the wandering spark in burnt paper of which you cannot say whether it is chasing or chased it is i who am the shifty pole to the steadiest of magnets she is a princess in other things besides her superiority to physics there will be wild scenes at baden my diary of today is all bestowed on you what have i to write in it except the pair of commas under the last line of yesterdayhe has not come oh to be caring for a he o that i were with your sister now on one side of her idol to correct her extravagant idolatry i long for her i had a number of nice little phrases to pet her with you have said i have it written that men who are liked by men are the best friends for women in which case the earl should be worthy of our friendship he is liked captain abrane and sir meeson in spite of the hard service he imposes on them with such comical haughtiness incline to speak well of him and methuen rivershere for two days on his way to his embassy at viennaassured us he is the rarest of gentlemen on the point of honour of his word they have stories of him to confirm livias eulogies showing him punctilious to chivalry no man alive is like him in that they say he grieves me all that you have to fear is my pity for one so sensitive so speed sir it is not good for us to be much alone and i am alone when you are absent i hear military music how grand that music makes the dullest world appear in a minute there is a magic in it to bring you to me from the most dreadful of distanceschillon it would kill mewriting here and you perhaps behind the hill i can hardly bear iti am torn away my hand will not any more this music burst out to mock me adieu i am yours your henrietta a kiss to the sister it is owing to her carinthia kissed the letter on that last line it seemed to her to end in a celestial shower she was oppressed by wonder of the writer who could run like the rill of the mountains in written speech and her recollection of the contents perpetually hurried to the close which was more in her way of writing for there the brief sentences had a throb beneath them she did not speak of the letter to her brother when she returned it a night in the carriage against his shoulder was her happy prospect in the thought that she would be with her dearest all night touching him asleep and in the sweet sense of being near to the beloved of the fairest angel of her sex they pursued their journey soon after anton was dismissed with warm shakes of the hand and appointments for a possible year in the future the blast of the postillions horn on the dark highway moved chillon to say this is what they call posting my dear she replied tell me brother i do not understand let none these marks efface at the commencement after most picturesque of castlesthat is you they are quoted from the verses of a lord who was a poet addressed to the castle on lake leman she will read them to you will she the mention of the lord set carinthia thinking of the lord whom that beautiful she pitied because she was forced to wound him and he was very sensitive wrapped in henrietta she slept through the joltings of the carriage the grinding of the wheels the blowing of the horn the flashes of the late moonlight and the kindling of dawn chapter viii of the encounter of two strange young men and their consorting in which the male reader is requested to bear in mind what wild creature he was in his youth while the female should marvel credulously the young man who fancied he had robed himself in the plain homespun of a natural philosopher at the age of twentythree journeyed limping leisurely in the mountain maid carinthias footsteps thankful to the fates for having seen her and reproving the remainder of superstition within him which would lay him open to smarts of evil fortune if he encouraged a senseless gratitude for good seeing that we are simply to take what happens to us the little inn of the village on the perch furnished him a nights lodging and a laugh of satisfaction to hear of a young lady and gentleman and their guide who had devoured everything eatable half a day in advance of him all save the bread and butter and a few scraps of meat apologetically spread for his repast by the maid of the inn not enough for a bantam cock she said promising eggs for breakfast he vowed with an honest heart that it was more than enough and he was nourished by sympathy with the appetites of his precursors and the maids description of their deeds that name carinthia went a good way to fill him farther on he had plenty but less contentment he was compelled to acknowledge that he had expected to meet carinthia again at the baths her absence dealt a violent shock to the aerial structure he dwelt in for though his ardour for the life of the solitudes was unfeigned as was his calm overlooking of social distinctions the selfindulgent dreamer became troubled with an alarming sentience that for him to share the passions of the world of men was to risk the falling lower than most women are a cause of dreams but they are dreaded enemies of his kind of dream deadly enemies of the immaterial dreamers and should one of them be taken on board a vessel of the vapourish texture young woodseer sailed in above the clouds lightly while he was in it alone questions of past future and present the three weights upon humanity bear it down and she must go or the vessel sinks and cast out of it what was he the asking exposed him to the steadiest wind the civilized world is known to blow from merely thinking upon one of the daughters of earth he was made to feel his position in that world though he refused to understand it and assisted by two days of hard walking he reduced carinthia to an abstract enthusiasm no very serious burden his notebook sustained it easily he wrote her name in simple fondness of the name a verse and hints for more and some sentences which he thought profound they were composed as he sat by the roadway on the top of hills and in a boat crossing a dark green lake deep under wooded mountain walls things of priceless value it happened that midway on the lake he perceived his boatman about to prime a pistol to murder the mildeyed stillness and he called to the man in his best german to desist during the altercation there passed a countryman of his in another of the punts who said gravely i thank you for that it was early morning and they had the lake to themselves each deeming the other an intruder for the courtship of solitude wanes when we are haunted by a second person in pursuit of it he is discolouring matter in our pure crystal cup such is the worship of the picturesque and it would appear to say that the spirit of man finds itself yet in the society of barbarians the case admits of good pleading either way even upon the issue whether the exclusive or the vulgar be the more barbarous but in those days the solicitation of the picturesque had been revived by a poet of some impassioned rhetoric and two devotees could hardly meet as the two met here and not be mutually obscurants they stepped ashore in turn on the same small shoot of land where a farmhouse near a chapel in the shadow of cliffs did occasional service for an inn each had intended to pass a day and a night in this lonely dwellingplace by the lake but a rival was less to be tolerated there than in love and each awaited the others departure with an air that said you are in my sunlight and going deeper more sternly sir you are an offence to natures pudency woodseer was the more placable of the two he had taken possession of the bench outside and he had his notebook and much profundity to haul up with it while fish were frying his countryman had rushed inside to avoid him and remained there pacing the chamber like a lion newly caged their boatmen were brotherly in the anticipation of provision and payment after eating his fish woodseer decided abruptly that as he could not have the spot to himself memorable as it would have been to intermarry with nature in so sacred a welldepth of the mountains he had better be walking and climbing another boat paddling up the lake had been spied solitude was not merely shared with a rival but violated by numbers in the first case we detest the man in the second we fly from an outraged scene he wrote a line or so in his book hurriedly paid his bill and started full of the matter he had briefly committed to his pages at noon sitting beside the beck that runs from the lake he was overtaken by the gentleman he had left behind and accosted in the informal english style with all the politeness possible to a nervously blunt manner this book is yoursi have no doubt it is yours i am glad to be able to restore it i should be glad to be the ownerwriter of the contents i mean i have to beg your excuse i found it lying open i looked at the page i looked through the whole i am quite at your mercy woodseer jumped at the sight of his notebook felt for the emptiness of his pocket and replied thank you thank you its of use to me though to no one else you pardon me certainly i should have done it myself i cannot offer you my apologies as a stranger lord fleetwood was the name given woodseers plebeian was exchanged for it and he stood up the young lord had fair straight thin features with large restless eyes that lighted quickly and a mouth that was winning in his present colloquial mood you could have done the same i should find it hard to forgive the man who pried into my secret thoughts he remarked there they are if one puts them to paper woodseer shrugged yes yes they never last long enough with me so far im safe one page led to another you can meditate i noticed some remarks on religions you think deeply woodseer was of that opinion but modesty urged him to reply with a small flourish just a few heads of ideas when the wind puffs down a sooty chimney the air is filled with little blacks that settle pretty much like the notes in this book of mine there they wait for another puff or my fingers to stamp them i could tell you were the owner of that book said lord fleetwood he swept his forehead feverishly what a power it is to relieve ones brain by writing may i ask you which one of the universities the burden of this question had a ring of irony to one whom it taught to feel rather defiantly that he carried the blazon of a reeking tramp my university woodseer replied was a merchants office in bremen for some months i learnt more greek and latin in bremen than business i was invalided home and then tried a merchants office in london i put on my hat one day and walked into the country my college fellows were hawkers tinkers tramps and ploughmen choughs and crows a volume of our poets and a history of philosophy composed my library i had scarce any money so i learnt how to idle inexpensivelya good first lesson were at the bottom of the world when we take to the road we see men as they were in the beginningnot so eager for harness till they get acquainted with hunger as i did and studied in myself the old animal having his head pushed into the collar to earn a feed of corn woodseer laughed adding that he had been of a serious mind in those days of the alternation of smooth indifference and sharp necessity and he had plucked a flower from them his nature prompted him to speak of himself with simple candour as he had done spontaneously to chillon kirby yet he was now anxious to let his companion know at once the common stuff he was made of together with the great stuff he contained he grew conscious of an overanxiety and was uneasy recollecting how he had just spoken about his naturalness dimly if at all apprehending the cause of this disturbance within what is a lord to a philosopher but the world is around us as a cloak if not a coat in his ignorance he supposed it specially due to a lord seeking acquaintance with him that he should expose his condition doing the which appeared to subject him to parade his intellectual treasures and capacity for shaping sentences and the effect upon lord fleetwood was an incentive to the display nevertheless he had a fretful desire to escape from the discomposing society of a lord he fixed his knapsack and began to saunter the young lord was at his elbow i cant part with you will you allow me woodseer was puzzled and had to say if you wish it i do wish it an hours walk with you one does not meet a man like you every day i have to join a circle of mine in baden but theres no hurry i could be disengaged for a week and i have things to ask you owing to my indiscretionbut you have excused it woodseer turned for a farewell gaze at the great watzmann and saluted him splendid said lord fleetwood but dont clap names on the mountainsi saw written in your book a text for dada you write a despotism would procure a perfect solitude but kill the ghost that was my thought at the place where we were at the lake i had it tell methough i could not have written it and ghost is just the word the exact wordtell me are you of welsh blood dad is good welshpronounce it hard woodseer answered my mother was a glamorganshire woman my father i know walked up from wales mending boots on his road for a livelihood he is not a bad scholar he knows greek enough to like it he is a dissenting preacher when i strike a truism i ve a habit of scoring it to give him a peg or tuningfork for one of his discourses hes a man of talent he taught himself and he taught me more than i learnt at school he is a thinker in his way he loves nature too i rather envy him in some respects he and i are hunters of wisdom on different tracks and he as he says waits for me hes patient ah and i wanted to ask you lord fleetwood observed bursting with it i was puzzled by a name you write here and there near the end and permit me to ask it carinthia it cannot be the country you write after the name a beautiful gorgona haggard venus it seized me i have had the face before my eyes ever since you must mean a woman i cant be deceived in allusions to a woman they have heart in them you met her somewhere about carinthia and gave her the name you writemay i refer to the book he received the book and flew through the leaves herea panting look you write again a look of beaten flame a look of one who has run and at last beholds but that is a living face i see her here again from minute to minute she is the rock that loses the sun at night and reddens in the morning you could not create an idea of a woman to move you like that no one could i am certain of it certain if so you re a wizardi swear you are but thats a face high over beauty just to know there is a woman like her is an antidote you compare her to a rock who would imagine a comparison of a woman to a rock but rock is the very picture of beautiful gorgon haggard venus tell me you met her you saw her i want only to hear she lives she is in the world beautiful women compared to roses may whirl away with their handsome dragoons a pang from them is a thing to be ashamed of and there are men who trot about whining with it but a carinthia makes pain honourable you have done what i thought impossiblefused a womans face and grand scenery to make them inseparable she might be wicked for me i should see a bright rim round hatred of herthe rock you describe i could endure horrors and not annihilate her i should think her sacred woodseer turned about to have a look at the man who was even quicker than he at realizing a person from a hint of description and almost insanely extravagant in the pitch of the things he uttered to a stranger for himself he was open with everybody his philosophy not allowing that strangers existed on earth but the presence of a lord brought the conventional world to his feelings though at the same time the title seemed to sanction the exceptional abruptness and wildness of this lord as for suspecting him to be mad it would have been a common idea no stretching of speech or overstepping of social rules could waken a suspicion so spiritless in woodseer he said i can tell you i met her and she lives i could as soon swim in that torrent or leap the mountain as repeat what she spoke or sketch a feature of her she goes into the blood she is a new idea of women she has the face that would tempt a gypsy to evil tellings i could think of it as a history written in a line carinthia saint and martyr as for comparisons they are flowers thrown into the fire i have had thati have thought that said lord fleetwood go on talk of her pray without comparisons i detest them how did you meet her what made you part where is she now i have no wish to find her but i want thoroughly to believe in her another than woodseer would have perceived the young lords malady here was one bitten by the serpent of love and athirst for an image of the sex to serve for the cooling herb as youth will be woodseer put it down to a curious imaginative fellowship with himself he forgot the lord and supposed he had found his own likeness less gifted in speech after talking of carinthia more and more in the abstract he fell upon his discovery of the great secret of life against which his hearer struggled for a time though that was cooling to him too but ultimately there was no resistance and so deep did they sink into the idea of pure contemplation that the idea of woman seemed to have become a part of it no stronger proof of their aethereal conversational earnestness could be offered a locality was given to the great secret and of course it was the place where the most powerful recent impression had been stamped on the mind of the discoverer the shadowy valley rolling from the slaterock woodseer was too artistic a dreamer to present the passing vision of carinthia with any associates there she passed the solitude accepted her and lost her and it was the richer for the one swift gleam she brought no trouble she left no regrets she was the ghost of the rocky obscurity but now remembering her mountain carol he chanced to speak of her as a girl she is a girl cried lord fleetwood frowning over an utter revolution of sentiment at the thought of the beautiful gorgon being a girl for rapid as he was to imagine he had raised a solid fabric upon his conception of carinthia the woman necessarily the womanlogically who but the woman could look the gorgon he tried to explain it to be impossible for a girl to wear the look and his notion evidently was that it had come upon a beautiful face in some staring horror of a world that had bitten the tender woman she touched him sympathetically through the pathos woodseer flung out vociferously for the contrary who but a girl could look the beautiful gorgon what other could seem an emanation of the mountain solitude a woman would instantly breathe the world on it to destroy it hers would be the dramatic and not the poetic face it would shriek of man wake the echoes with the tale of man slaughter all quietude but a girls face has no story of poisonous intrusion she indeed may be cast in the terrors of nature and yet be sweet with nature beautiful because she is purely of nature woodseer did his best to present his view irresistibly perhaps he was not clear it was a piece of skiamachy difficult to render clear to the defeated lord fleetwood had nothing to say but gorgon a girl a gorgon and it struck woodseer as intensely unreasonable considering that he had seen the girl whom in his effort to portray her he had likened to a beautiful gorgon he recounted the scene of the meeting with her pictured it in effective colours but his companion gave no response nor a nod they ceased to converse and when the young lords hired carriage drew up on the road woodseer required persuasion to accompany him they were both in their different stations young tyrants of the world ready to fight the world and one another for not having their immediate view of it such as they wanted it they agreed however not to sleep in the city beds were to be had near the top of a mountain on the other side of the salza their driver informed them and vowing themselves to that particular height in a mutual disgust of the city they waxed friendlier with a reserve woodseer soon had experience that he was receiving exceptional treatment from lord fleetwood whose manservant was on the steps of the hotel in salzburg on the lookout for his master sir meeson has been getting impatient my lord said the man sir meeson corby appeared lord fleetwood cut him short you re in a hurry go at once dont wait for me i join you in badendo me the favour to eat with me he turned to woodseer and here corby tell the countess i have a friend to bear me company and there is to be an extra bedroom secured at her hotel that swinery of a place she insists on visiting is usually crammed with you there he turned to woodseer i might find it agreeableyou can take my man corby i shall not want the fellow positively my dear fleetwood you know sir meeson expostulated i am under orders i dont see howi really cant go on without you please yourself this gentleman is my friend mr woodseer sir meeson corby was a plump little beau of forty at war with his fat and accounting his tight blue tail coat and brass buttons a victory his tightness made his fatness elastic he looked wound up for a dance and could hardly hold on a leg but the presentation of a creature in a battered hat and soiled garments carrying a tattered knapsack half slung lank and with disorderly locks as the earl of fleetwoods friendthe friend of the wealthiest nobleman of great britainfixed him in a perked attitude of inquiry that exhausted interrogatives woodseer passed him slouching a bow the circular stare of sir meeson seemed unable to contract he directed it on lord fleetwood and was then reminded that he dealt with prickles where have you been he said blinking to refresh his eyeballs i missed you i ran round and round the town after you i have been to the lake queer fish there sir meeson dropped a glance on the capture lord fleetwood took woodseers arm do you eat with us he asked the baronet who had stayed his eating for an hour and was famished so they strode to the diningroom do you wash sir before eating sir meeson said to woodseer caressing his hands when they had seated themselves at table appliances are to be found in this hotel soap said lord fleetwood soapat least in my chamber fetch it please sir meeson of course could not hear that he requested the waiter to show the gentleman to a room lord fleetwood ordered the waiter to bring a handbasin and towel were off directly and must eat at once he said soapsoap my dear fleetwood sir meeson knuckled on the table to impress it that his appetite and his gorge demanded a thorough cleansing of those fingers if they were to sit at one board let the waiter fetch it the soap is in my portmanteau you spoke of it as a necessity for this gentleman and me bring it woodseer had risen lord fleetwood motioned him down he kept an eye deadas marble on corby who muttered you cant mean that you ask me but the alternative was forced on sir meeson by too strong a power of the implacable eye there was thunder in it a continuity of gaze forcefuller than repetitions of the word he knew lord fleetwood men privileged to attend on him were dogs to the flinty young despot they were sure to be called upon to expiate the faintest offence to him he had hastily to consider that he was banished beyond appeal with the whole torture of banishment to an adorer of the countess livia or else the mad behest must be obeyed he protested shrugged sat fast and sprang up remarking that he went with all the willingness imaginable it could not have been the first occasion he was affecting the excessively obsequious when he came back bearing his metal soapcase the performance was checked by another look solid as shot and as quick woodseer who would have done for sir meeson corby or lazarus what had been done for him thought little of the service but so intense a peremptoriness in the look of an eye made him uncomfortable in his own sense of independence the humblest citizen of a free nation has that warning at some notable exhibition of tyranny in a neighbouring state it acts like a concussion of the air lord fleetwood led an easy dialogue with him and sir meeson on their different themes immediately which was not less impressive to an observer he listened to sir meesons entreaties that he should start at once for baden and appeared to pity the poor gentleman condemned by his office to hang about him in terror of his liege ladys displeasure presently near the close of the meal drawing a ring from his finger he handed it to the baronet and said give her that she knows i shall follow that he added to himselfi shall have illluck till i have it back and he asked woodseer whether he put faith in the virtue of talismans i have never possessed one said woodseer with his natural frankness it would have gone long before this for a nights lodging sir meeson heard him and instantly urged lord fleetwood not to think of dismissing his man francis i beg it fleetwood i beg you to take the man her ladyship will receive me badly ring or no ring if she hears of your being left alone i really cant present myself i shall not go not go i say no stay then said fleetwood he turned to woodseer with an air of deference and requested the privilege of glancing at his notebook again and scanned it closely at one of the pages i believe it true he cried i had a half recollection of iti have had some such thought but never could put it in words you have thought deeply that is only a surface thought or common reflection said woodseer sir meeson stared at them in turn judging by their talk and the effect produced on the earl he took woodseer for a sort of conjuror it was his duty to utter a warning he drew fleetwood aside a word was whispered and they broke asunder with a snap francis was called his master gave him his keys and despatched him into the town to purchase a knapsack or bag for the outfit of a jolly beggar the prospect delighted lord fleetwood he sang notes from the deep chest flaunting like an opera brigand and contemplating his wretched satellites indecision with brimming amusement remember we fight for our money i carry mine he said to woodseer wouldnt it be expedient fleetwood sir meeson suggested a treasurer in the person of himself not a florin corby i should find it all gambled away at baden but i am not abrane im not abrane i never play i have no mania none it would be prudent fleetwood the slightest bulging of a pocket would show on you corby and they would be at you they would fall on you and pluck you to have another fling i d rather my money should go to a knight of the road than feed that dragons jaw a highwayman seems an honest fellow compared with your honourable corporation of flycatchers i could surrender to him with some satisfaction after a trial of the better man i ve tried these tables and couldnt stir a pulse have you it had to be explained to woodseer what was meant by trying the tables not i said he in strong contempt of the queer allurement lord fleetwood studied him half a minute as if measuring and discarding a suspicion of the young philosophers possible weakness under temptation sir meeson corby accompanied the oddly assorted couple through the town and a short way along the road to the mountain for the sake of quieting his conscience upon the subject of his leaving them together he could not have sat down a second time at a table with those hands he said ithe could not have done the thing so the best he could do was to let them go like many of his class he had a mind open to the effect of striking contrasts and the spectacle of the wealthiest nobleman in great britain tramping the road pack on back with a young nobody for his comrade a total stranger who might be a cutthroat and was avowedly next to a mendicant charged him with quantities of interjectory matter that he caught himself firing to the foreign people on the highway hundreds of thousands a year and tramping it like a pedlar with a beggar for his friend he would have given something to have an english ear near him as he watched them rounding under the mountain they were about to climb chapter ix concerning the black goddess fortune and the worship of her together with an introduction of some of her votaries in those early days of fortunes pregnant alternations of colour between the red and the black exhibited publicly as it were a petroleum spring of the ebonyfiery lake below blackforest baden was the sprightliest of the antechambers of hades thither in the ripeness of the year trooped the devotees of the sable goddess to perform sacrifice and annually among them the beautiful livia the countess of fleetwood for nowhere else had she sensation of the perfect repose which is rocked to a slumber by gales she was not of the creatures who are excited by an atmosphere of excitement she took it as the nymph of the stream her native wave and swam on the flood with expansive languor happy to have the master passions about her one or two of which her dainty hand caressed fearless of a sting the lady petted them as her swans it surprised her to a gentle contempt of men and women that they should be ruffled either by love or play a withholding from the scene will naturally arouse disturbing wishes but to be present lulls for then we live we are in our element and who could expect what sane person can desire perpetual good luck fortune the goddess and young love too are divine in their mutability and fortune would resemble a humdrum housewife love a droning husband if constancy were practised by them observe the staggering and plunging of the blindfold wretch seeking to be persuaded of their faithfulness she could make for herself a quiet centre in the heart of the whirlwind but the whirlwind was required the clustered lights at the corner of the vale under forest hills the burst of music the blazing windows of the saloons of the furies and the gamblers advancing and retreating with their totally opposite views of consequences and fashions of wearing or tearing the mask and closer the figures shifting up and down the promenade known and unknown faces and the histories half known half woven weaving fast which flew their threads to provoke speculation pleasantly embraced and diverted the coolblooded lady surrounded by her courtiers who could upon occasion supply the luminous clue or anecdote she had an intuitive liveliness to detect interchanges of eyes the shuttle of intrigue the mild hypocrisy the clever audacity the suspicion confirmed the complication threatening to become resonant and terrible and the old crossing the young and the young outwitting the old wiles of fair traitors and dark knaves of all suits of the pack a more intimate acquaintance with their lineaments inspired a regard for them such as poets may feign the throned high moon to entertain for objects causing her rays to flash the simple fools performing in character were a neutral people grotesques and arabesques wreathed about the margins of the scene venus or fortune smote them to a relievo distinguishing one from another here however as elsewhere the core of interest was with the serious population the lovers and the players in earnest who stood round the furnace and pitched themselves into it not always under a miscalculation of their chances of emerging transfigured instead of serving for fuel these the tragical children of folly were astute they played with lightning and they knew the conditions of the game victories were to be had the ulterior conditions of the game the price paid for a victory they thought little of for they were feverish worshippers of the phantasmal deity called the present a god reigning over the past appreciable only in the future whose whiff of actual being is composed of the embryo idea of the union of these two periods still he is occasionally a benevolent god to the appetites which have but to be continuous to establish him in permanence and as nothing in us more readily supposes perpetuity than the appetite rushing to destroy itself the rational nature of the most universal worship on earth is perceived at once now the price paid for a victory is this that having been favoured in a single instance by the spouse of the aforesaid eminent divinitythe black goddess of the golden fringesmen believe in her for ever after behold her everywhere they belong to her their faith as to sowing and reaping has gone and so has their capacity to see the actual as it is she has the power to attach them to her skirts the more by rewarding their impassioned devotion with cuffs and scorns they have ceased to have a first notion upon anything without a second haunting it which directs them to propitiate fortune but i am reminded by the convulsions of dame gossip that the wisdom of our ancestors makes it a mere hammering of commonplace to insist on such reflections many of them indeed took the union of the black goddess and the rosy present for the composition of the very archfiend some had a shot at the strange conjecture figuring her as tired of men in the end and challengeing him belowequally tired of his easy conquests of men since the glorious old times of the duelling saints by virtue of his one incorrigible weakness which we know him to have as long as we have it ourselves viz the belief in her existence she is to get the better of him upon this point the experience of captain abrane has a value livia was a follower of the red and black and the rounding ball in the person of the giant captain through whom she received her succession of sweetly teasing thrills and shocks as one of the adventurous company they formed together the place was known to him as the fair philistine to another muscular hero he had been shorn there before and sent forth tottering treating the friends he met as pillars to fall with him and when the operation was done thoroughly he pronounced himself refreshed by it like a more sensible samson the cooler for his clipping then it was that he relapsed undistractedly upon processes of his mind and he often said he thought fortune would beat the devil her power is shown in the moving of her solicitors to think instantly after they have made their cast that the reverse of it was what they intended it comes as though she had withdrawn the bandage from her forehead and dropped a leaden glance on them like a great dame angry to have her signal misinterpreted well then distinguished by the goddess in such a manner we have it proved to us how she wished to favour for the reverse wins and we who are pinched blame not her cruelty but our blind folly this is true worship henceforth the pain of her nip is mingled with the dream of her kiss between the positive and the imagined of her we remain confused until the purse is an empty body on a gallows honour too perhaps captain abrane was one of the countess livias numerous courtiers on the border of the promenade under the lighted saloons a colossus inactive he had little to say among the chattering circle for when seated cards were wanted to animate him and he looked entirely out of place and unfitted like a great vessels figurehead in a shipwrights yard she murmured not this evening abrane quoted promptly a line of nursery song how shall he cut it without eer a knife have we run it down so low said she with no reproach in her tone the captain shrugged over his clean abyss where nothing was yesterday their bank presented matronly proportions but an importuned goddess reduces the most voluminous to bare stitches within a few winks of an eye livia turned to a french gentleman of her court m de st ombre and pursued a conversation he was a stately cavalier of the gallicized frankish outlines ready but grave in his bearing grave in his delivery trimly moustached with a guise beard his profound internal question relating to this unenglish beauty of the british isleshad she no passion in her nature was not convinced by her apparent insensibility to fortunes whips sir meeson corby inserted a word of bull french out of place from time to time as it might be necessary to lean on the little man for weapons of war supposing lord fleetwood delayed his arrival yet another day livia was indulgent she assisted him to think that he spoke the foreign tongue mention of lord fleetwood set sir meeson harping again on his alarms in consideration of the vagabond object of the young lord had roamed away with you forget that russett has gypsy in him welsh its about the same said livia he can take excellent care of himself and his purse countess he is a good six days overdue he will be in time for the ball at the schloss sir meeson corby produced an aspect of the word if so perkily that the dejected captain abrane laughed outright and gave him double reason to fret for lord fleetwoods arrival by saying if he hangs off much longer i shall have to come on you for another fifty our two pedestrians out of salzburg were standing up in the night of cloud and pines above the glittering pool having made their way along the path from the hill anciently dedicated to the god mercury and at the moment when sir meeson put forth his frilled wrists to say if you had seen his handsthe creature fleetwood trotted off alone withyoud be a bit anxious too the young lord called his comrade to gaze underneath them there they are hard at it at their playits the word used for the filthiest gutter scramble they had come to know something of one anothers humours which are taken by young men for their characters and should the humours please they are friends until further humours develop trying these nascent conservatives hard to suit them to their moods as well as the accustomed lord fleetwood had discovered in his companion besides the spirit of independence and the powers of thought impressed on him by woodseers precocious flashes a broad playfulness that trenched on buffoonery it astonished amused and relieved him loosening the spell of reverence cast over him by one who could so wonderfully illumine his brain prone to admire and bend the knee where he admired he chafed at subjection unless he had the particular spell constantly renewed a tone in him once or twice of late different from the comrades had warned woodseer to be guarded susceptible however of the extreme contrast between the gamblers below and natures lover beside him fleetwood returned to his enthusiasm without thinking it a bondage i shall never forget the walk we ve had i have to thank you for the noblest of pleasures you ve taught mewell a thousand things the things money cant buy what mornings they were and the deadtired nights under the rock and up to see the snowy peak pink in a gap of thick mist you were right it made a crimsoning colour shine like a new idea up in those mountains one walks with the divinities you said its perfectly true i shall remember i did i have a treasure for life now i understand where you get your ideas the life we lead down there is hoggish you have chosen the right youre right over and over again when you say the dirty sweaters are nearer the angels for cleanliness than my lord and lady sybarite out of a bath in chemical scents a man who thinks loathes their high society i went through juvenal at college but youto be sure you add examplemake me feel the contempt of it more i am everlastingly indebted to you yes i wont forget you preach against the despising of anything this was pleasant in woodseers ears inasmuch as it established the young nobleman as the pupil of his philosophy for the conduct of life and to fortify him he replied set your mind on the beauty and therell be no room for comparisons most of them are unjust precious few instructive in this case they spoil both pictures and that scene down there rather hooks me though i prefer the dachstein in the wane of the afterglow you called it carinthia i did the beautiful gorgon haggard venusif she is to be a girl fleetwood rejoined she looked burnt outa spectre one of the admirably damned said woodseer and he murmured with enjoyment between the lightsthat s the beauty and the tragedy of purgatory his comrade fell in with the pictured idea you hit itnot what you called the sublimely milky and not squalid as youll see the faces of the gambling women at the tables below oblige memay i begdont clap names on the mountains weve seen it stamps guidebook on them english tourist horrors well moralize over the crowds at the tables down there on the whole its a fairish game you know the odds against you as you dont on the turf or the bourse have your fling but dont get bitten theres a virus im not open to it others are hereupon woodseer wishing to have his individuality recognised in the universality it consented to remarked on an exchequer that could not afford to lose and a disposition free of the craving to win these were no doubt good reasons for abstaining and they were grand morality they were at the same time customary phrases of the unfleshed in folly they struck fleetwood with a curious reminder of the puking inexperienced whom he had seen subsequently plunge suicidally he had a sharp vision of the attractive forces of the game and his elemental nature exulted in siding with the stronger against a pretender to the superhuman for woodseer had spoken a trifle loftily as quite above temptation to see a forewarned philosopher lured to try the swim on those tides pulled along the current and caught by the undertug of the lasher would be fun well drop down on them find our hotel and have a look at what theyre doing he said and stepped woodseer would gladly have remained the starlit black ridges about him and the dragons mouth yawing underneath were an opposition of spiritual and mundane innocent noxious exciting to the youthful philosopher he had to follow and so rapidly in the darkness that he stumbled and fell on an arm a small matter bedchambers awaited them at the hotel none of the party and fleetwoods manservant was absent gambling the rascal he said woodseer heard the first note of the place in that his leader was washed neatly dressed and knocking at his door very soon impatient to be off and he flung a promise of supper presently to one whose modest purse had fallen into a debate with this lordly hostelry counting that a supper and a night there would do for it they hurried on to the line of promenaders a river of crosscurrents by the side of seated groups and the willowy swish of silken dresses feminine perfumery cigarsmoke chatter laughter told of pleasure reigning fleetwood scanned the groups he had seen enough in a moment and his face blackened a darting waiter was called to him he said to woodseer savagely as it sounded you shall have something to joint your bones what cause of wrath he had was past a guess a wolf at his vitals bit him hardening his handsome features the waiter darted back bearing a tray and tall glasses filled each with piled particoloured liqueurs on the top of which an eggyolk swam fleetwood gave example swallowing your egg the fieryvelvet triune behind slips after it in an easy milky way like a princesss train on a statemarch and you are completely transformed very agreeably you have become a merry demon well yes its next to magic he replied to woodseers astonished snigger after the draught and explained that it was a famous viennese fourofthemorning panacea the revellers electrical restorer now you can hold on for an hour or two and then well sup at rome ay druids tomorrow cried the philosopher bewitched he found himself bowing to a most heavenly lady composed of day and night in her colouring but more of night where the western edge has become a pale steel blade men were around her forming a semicircle the world of men and women was mere timber and leafage to this flower of her sex glory of her kind how he behaved in her presence he knew not he was beyond selfcriticism or conscious reflection simply the engine of the commixed three liqueurs with parlous fine thoughts and a sense of steaming into the infinite to leave her was to have her as a moon in the heavens and to think of her creatively a swarm of images rushed about her and away took lustre and shade she was a miracle of greyness her eyes translucently grey a darkhaired queen of the twilights and his heart sprang into his brain to picture the novel beauty language became a flushed bacchanal in a ring of dancing similes lying beside a bank of silvery cinquefoil against a clear evening sky where the planet venus is a point of new and warmer light one has the vision of her or something of persephone rising to greet her mother when our beam of day first melts through her as she kneels to gather an early bud of the year would be near it or there is a lake in midforest that curls part in shadow under the foot of morning there we have her he strained to the earthly and the skyey likenesses of his marvel of human beauty because they bestowed her on him in passing all the while he was gazing on a green gamingtable the gold glittered and it heaped or it vanished contemptuous of money beyond the limited sum for his needs he gazed imagination was blunted in him to the hot drama of the business moreover his mind was engaged in insisting that the evening star is not to be called venus because of certain stories and he was vowed to defend his lady from any allusion to them this occupied him by degrees the visible asserted its authority his look on the coin fell to speculating oddly too he was often rightthe money staked on the other side would have won he considered it rather a plain calculation than a guess philosophy withdrew him from his temporary interest in the tricks of a circling white marble ball the chuck farthing of street urchins has quite as much dignity he compared the creatures dabbling over the board to summer flies on butchers meat periodically scared by a cloth more in the abstract they were snatching at a snapdragon bowl it struck him that the gamblers had thronged on an invitation to drink the round of seedtime and harvest in a gulp again they were desperate gleaners hopping skipping bleeding amid a whizz of scytheblades for small wisps of booty nor was it long before the presidency of an ancient hoary goatsatan might be perceived with skeweyes and puckermouth nursing a hoof on a knee our mediaeval enemy sat symbolical in his deformities as in old italian and dutch thickline engravings of him he rolled a ball for souls excited like kittens to catch it and tumbling into the dozens of vacant pits so it seemed to woodseer whose perceptions were discoloured by hereditary antagonism had he preserved his philosophers eye he would have known that the hoofed one is too wily to show himself owing to his ugliness the black goddess and no other presides at her own game she it is good for us to know it is the power who challenges the individual it is he who spreads the net for the mass she liquefies the brain of man he petrifies or ossifies the heart from her comes craziness from him perversity a more provocative and on the whole more contagious disease the gambler does not seek to lead his fellows into perdition the snared of the demon have pleasure in the act hence our naturally interested forecasts of the contests between them for if he is beaten as all must be at the close of an extended game with her we have only to harden the brain against her allurements and we enter a clearer field woodseer said to fleetwood that ball has a look of a nymph running round and round till she changes to one of the fates well have a run with her said fleetwood keener for business than for metaphorsat the moment he received gold for a banknote captain abrane hurriedly begged a loan both of them threw neither of them threw on the six numbers woodseer would have selected and they lost he stated that the number of had won before abrane tried the transversal enclosing this favoured number of course he cried with foul resignation and a hostile glare the ball had seated itself and was grinning at him from the lowest of the stalls fleetwood quitted the tablenumbers to throw on pair he won won again pushed his luck and lost dragging abrane with him the giant varied his tone of acquiescence in fortunes whims of course i ve only to fling luck hangs right enough till i put down my stake if the luck has gone three times the chances woodseer was rather inquiring than pronouncing lord fleetwood cut him short the chances are equally the contrary and discomposed his argumentative mind as argument in such a place was impossible he had a wild idea of examplejust to see and though he smiled his brain was liquefying upon a calculation of the chances merely for the humour of it he laid a silver piece on the first six which had been neglected they were now blest he laid his winnings on the numbed who would have expected it why the player surely woodseer comported himself like a veteran he had proved that you can calculate the chances instead of turning in triumph to lord fleetwood he laid gold pieces to hug the number and ten in the centre and it is the truth he hoped then to lose and have done with itafter proving his case the ball whirled kicked tried for seat in two in three points and entered the usual temporary wonderment flew round the table and this number was courted in dread avoided with apprehension abrane let fly a mighty breath virgin by jove success was a small matter to gower woodseer he displayed his contempt of fortune by letting his heap of banknotes lie on impair and he won abrane bade him say maximum in a furious whisper he did so as one at home with the word and winning repeatedly observed to fleetwood now i can understand what historians mean in telling us of heroes rushing into the fray and vainly seeking death i always thought death was to be had if you were in earnest fleetwood scrutinized the cast of his features and the touch of his fingers on the crispy paper come to another of these green fields he returned briefly the game here is childs play urging virgin luck not to quit his initiatory table the captain reluctantly went at their heels shortly before the tables were clad in mantles for the night he reported to livia one of the great cases of virgin luck described it from the silver piece to the big heap of notes and drew on his envy of the fellow to sketch the indomitable coolness shown in following or in quitting a run that fellow it is fleetwoods tagrag holds his head like a streetfiddler woodler or some name but theres nothing to be done if we dont cultivate him he must have pocketed a good three thousand and more they had a quarrel about calculations of chances and fleet ran the v up his forehead at a piece of impudence fellow says some highflying stuff fleet brightens like a sunday chimneysweep if i believed in black arts upon my word russett is not usually managed with ease the lady said her placid observation was directed on the pair then descending the steps be careful how you address this gentleman she counselled abrane the name is not woodier i know it must be the right name or none livias fairest smile received them she heard the captain accosting the child of luck as mr woodier and she made a rustle in rising to take fleetwoods arm we havent dined we have to sup said he you are released at the end of the lamps you redeem your ring russett and i will restore it i have to tell you henrietta is here tomorrow she might be in a better place the place where she is to be seen is not generally undervalued by men it is not her fault that she is absent the admiral was persuaded to go and attend those cavalry manoeuvres with the grand duke to whom he had been civil when in command of the mediterranean squadron you know the admiral believes he has militaryi mean soldierlygenius and the delusion may have given him wholesome exercise and helped him to forget his gout so far henrietta will have been satisfied she cannot have found much amusement among dusty troopers or at that court at carlsruhe our french milliner there has helped in retarding her quite against her will she has had to choose a balldress for the raw mountaingirl they have with them and get her fitted and its a task why take her to the ball but the admirals infatuated with this girl and wont hear of her exclusionbecause he says she understands a field of battle and the ducal party have taken to her ah russett you should not have flown no harm only henrietta does require a trifle of management she writes that she is sure of you for the night at the schloss why maam you have given your word he never breaks his lightest word she says it sounds like the beginning of respect the rarest thing men teach women to feel for them a respectable love matcheh good lord youll be civil to my friend you have struck him to the dust you have your one poetical admirer in him i am honoured russett cleared out i suppose abrane is a funnel for pouring into that bank have your fun as you like it i shall get supplies tomorrow by the way you have that boy cressett here what are you doing with him livia spoke of watching over him and guarding him he was at the table beside me bursting to have a fling and my friend mr woodseer said it was adonis come to spy the boarthe picture prompt as bugle to the breath livia proposed to bet him fifty pounds that she would keep young cressett from gambling a single louis the pretty saying did not touch her fleetwood moved and bowed sir meeson corby simulated a petrifaction of his frame at seeing the countess of fleetwood actually partly bent with her gracious acknowledgement of the tramps gawky homage chapter x small causes a clock sounded one of the later morning hours of the night as gower woodseer stood at his hotel door having left fleetwood with a band of revellers the night was now clear stars were low over the ridge of pines dropped to a league of our strange world to record the doings beneath this roof lay the starry she he was elected to lie beneath it also and he beheld his heavenly lady floating on the lull of soft white cloud among her sister spheres after the way of imaginative young men he had her features more accurately now she was hidden and he idealized her more he could escape for a time from his coil of similes and paint for himself the irids of her large long grey eyes darkly rimmed purest watergrey lucid within the ring beneath an arch of lashes he had them fast but then he fell to contemplating their exceeding rareness and the mystery of the divinely grey swung a kindled fancy to the flight with some queenwitch of woods of whom a youth may dream under the spell of twilights east or west among forest branches she had these marvellous eyes and the glamour for men she had not yet met a man with the poetical twist in the brain to prize her elementally all admitted the glamour none of her courtiers were able to name it even the poetical head giving it a name did not think of the witch in her looks as a witch in her deeds a modern daughter of the mediaeval to her giant squire the eyes of the lady were queer they were unlit glass lamps to her french suppliant and to the others they were attractively uncommon the charm for them being in her fine outlines her stature carriage of her person and unalterable composure particularly her latent daring she had the effect on the general mind of a lofty cragcastle with a history there was a whiff of gunpowder exciting the atmosphere in the anecdotal part of the history known woodseer sat for a certain time over his notebook he closed it with a thrilling conceit of the right thing written down such as entomologists feel when they have pinned the rare insect but what is butterfly or beetle compared with the chiselled sentences carved out of air to constitute us part owner of the breathing image and spirit of an adored fair woman we repeat them and the act of repeating them makes her come close on ours by virtue of the eagle thought in the stamped gold of the lines then though she is not ever to be absolutely ours and it is an impoverishing desire that she should be we have beaten out the golden sentencethe essential she and we in one but is it so precious after all a suspicious ring of an adjective drops us on a sickening descent the author dashed at his book examined approved keenly enjoyed and he murderously scratched the adjective she stood better without it as a bright planet star issuing from clouds which are perhaps an adornment to our hackneyed moon this done he restored the book to his coats breastpocket smiling or sneering at the rolls of banknotes there disdaining to count them they stuffed an inner waistcoat pocket and his trousers also they at any rate warranted that we can form a calculation of the chances let lord fleetwood rave as he may please woodseer had caught a glimpse of the elbowpoint of his coat when flinging it back to the chair there was distinctly abrasion philosophers laugh at such things but they must be the very ancient pallium philosophers ensconced in tubs if they pretend to merriment over the spectacle of nether garments gapped at the spot where man is most vulnerable he got loose from them and held them up to the candle and the rays were admitted neither winking nor peeping serviceable old clothes no doubt time had not dealt them the final kick before they scored a good record they dragged him nevertheless to a sort of confession of some weakness that he could not analyze for the swirl of emotional thoughts in the way and they had him to the ground an eagle of the poetic becomes a mere squat toad through one of these pretty material strokes where then is philosophy but who can be philosopher and the fervent admirer of a glorious lady ask again who in that frowzy garb can presume to think of her or stand within fifty miles of her orbit a dreary two hours brought round daylight woodseer quitted his restless bed and entered the abjured habiliments chivalrous enough to keep from denouncing them until he could cast the bad skin they now were to his uneasy sensations he remembered having stumbled and fallen on the slope of the hill into this vale and probably then the mischief had occurred though a brush would have been sufficient the slightest collision only it was odd that the accident should have come to pass just previous to his introduction how long antecedent was it he belaboured his memory to reckon how long it was from the moment of the fall to the first sight of that lady his window looked down on the hotel stableyard a coachhouse door was open odd or notand it certainly looked like fatethat he should be bowing to his lady so shortly after the mishap expelling him he had to leave the place a groom in the yard was hailed and cheerily informed him he could be driven to carlsruhe as soon as the coachman had finished his breakfast at carlsruhe a decent refitting might be obtained and he could return from exile that very day thanks to the praiseworthy early hours of brave old germany he had swallowed a cup of coffee with a roll of stale bread in the best of moods and entered his carriage he was calling the order to start when a shout surprised his ear the fiddler bolts captain abranes was the voice about twenty paces behind abrane fleetwood and one whom they called chummy potts were wildly waving arms woodseer could hear the captains lowered roar race you chummy couple of louis catch him first the two came pelting up to the carriage abreast they were belated revellers and had been carelessly strolling under the pinky cloudlets bedward after a prolonged carousal with the sons and daughters of hilarious nations until the apparition of virgin luck on the wing shocked all prospect of a dead fight with the tables that day here come no by jove you mr woodsir wont do not a bit cant let you go cried abrane as he puffed what cut and run and leave us post winningsbankersknock your luck on the head what a fellow cant let you countess never forgive us you promisedswore itplay for her struck all aheap to hear of your play youve got the trick her purse for you in my pocket never a fellow played like you cool as a cook over agridiron comme un phare st ombre saysthat frenchman you astonished the frenchman and now cut and run cant allow it honour of the country at stake hands off woodseer bellowed feeling himself a leaky vessel in dock his infirmities in danger of exposure if you pullwhat the deuce do you want stop out you come said the giant and laughed at the fun to his friends who were entirely harmonious when not violently dissenting as is the way with nights rollickers before their beds have reconciled them to the daybeams woodseer would have had to come and was coming he happened to say dont knock my pipe out of my mouth and touched a chord in the giant allright smoke your pipe was answered to his remonstrance during the amnesty fleetwood inquired where are you going far a driveto be sure dont you see youll return i intend to return hes beastly excited quoth abrane fleetwood silenced him though indeed woodseer appeared suspiciously restive step down and have a talk with me before you start youre not to go yet i must im in a hurry what s the hurry i want to smoke and think takes a carriage on the top of the morning to smoke and think hark at that abrane sang out oh come along quietly you fellow theres a good fellow it concerns us all every man jack were all bound up in your fortunes fellow with luck like yours cant pretend to behave independently out of reason do you give me your word you return said fleetwood woodseer replied very well i do there i give my word hang it now i know what they mean by anything for a quiet life just a shake brings us down on that canebottomed chair you return today today yes yes fleetwood signified the captives release and abrane immediately suggested pop old chummy in beside the fellow to mount guard potts was hustled and precipitated into the carriage by the pair with whom he partook this last glimmer of their nights humorous extravagances for he was an easy creature the carriage drove off keep him company they shouted escort him back said he nodding he remarked to woodseer with your permission concerning the seat he took and that a draught of morning air would do him good then he laughed politely exchanged wavy distant farewells with his comrades touched a breastpocket for his case of cigars pulled forth one obtained the loan of a light blew clouds and fell into the anticipated composure quite understanding the case and his office both agreed as to the fine morning it was woodseer briefly assented to his keepers reiterated encomium on the morning justified on oath a fine morning indeed damned if i think i ever saw so fine a morning potts cried he had no other subject of conversation with this hybrid and being equally disposed for hot discourse or for sleep the deprivation of the one and the other forced him to seek amusement in his famous reading of character which was profound among the biped equine jockeys turfmen sharpers pugilists demireps he fronted woodseer with square shoulders and wide knees an elbow on one a fist on the other engaged in what he termed the prodding of his eel or nicking of his man a method of getting straight at the riddle of the fellow by the test of how long he could endure a flat mute stare and return look for look unblinking the act of smoking fortifies and partly covers the insolence but if by chance an equable not too narrowly focussed counterstare is met our impertinent inquisitor may resemble the fisherman pulled into deep waters by his fish woodseer perused his man he was not attempting to fathom him he had besides other stuff in his head potts had naught and the poor particle he was wriggled under detection tobacco before breakfast he said disgustedly tossing his cigar to the road your pipe holds on bad thing i can tell you that smoking on an empty stomach no trainerd allow it not for a whole fee or double kills your wind let me ask you my good sir are you going to turn weve sat a fairish stretch i begin to want my bath and a shave linen and coffee thirsty as a dog he heard with stupefaction that he could alight on the spot if he pleased otherwise he would be driven into carlsruhe and now they had a lingual encounter hot against cool but the eyes of chummy potts having been beaten his arguments and reproaches were not backed by the powerful looks which are an essential part of such eloquence as he commanded they fled from his enemys currishly even while he was launching epithets his pathetic position subjected him to beg that woodseer would direct the driver to turn for he had no knowledge of their german lingo and said he youve nothing to laugh at that i can see im at your mercy you brute caught in a trap i never walkand the sun fit to fry a mackerel along that road i apologize for abusing you i cant do more youre an infernally clever playerthere and upon my soul i could drink ditchwater but if youre going in for transactions at carlsruhe mark my words your lucks gone laugh as much as you like woodseer happened to be smiling over the excellent reason for not turning back which inflicted the wofulness he was not without sympathy for a thirsty wretch and guessing at the sight of an avenue of limes to the left of the road that a wayside inn was below he said you can have coffee or beer in two minutes and told the driver where to pull up the sight of a greyjacketed greencollared sportsman dog at heel crossing the flat land to the hills of the forest pricked him enviously and caused him to ask what change had come upon him that he should be hurrying to a town for a change of clothes just as potts was about to jump out a carriage with a second behind it left the inn door he rubbed a hand on his unshaven chin tried a glance at his shirtfront and remarking it wont be any one who knows me stood to let the carriages pass in the first were a young lady and a gentleman the lady brilliantly fair an effect of auburn hair and complexion despite the signs of a storm that had swept them and had not cleared from her eyelids apparently her maid a damsel sitting straight up occupied the carriage following and this freshfaced young person twice quickly and bluntly bent her head as she was driven by potts was unacquainted with the maid but he knew the lady well or well enough for her inattention to be the bigger puzzle she gazed at the black forest hills in the steadiest manner with eyes betraying more than they saw which solved part of the puzzle of course her reasons for declining to see him were exposed by the presence of the gentleman beside her at the same time in so highly bred a girl a defenceless exposure was unaccountable half a nod and the shade of a smile would have been the proper course and her going along on the road to the valley seemed to say it might easily have been taken except that there had evidently been a bit of a scene potts ranked henriettas beauty far above her cousin livias he was therefore personally offended by her disregard of him and her bit of a scene with the fellow carrying her off did him injury on behalf of his friend fleetwood he dismissed woodseer curtly thirsting more to gossip than to drink he took a moody draught of beer at the inn and by the aid of a conveyance hastily built of rotten planks to serve his needs and drawn by a horse of the old wars as he reported on his arrival at badenreached that home of the maltreated innocents twenty minutes before the countess and her party were to start for lunch up the lichtenthal naturally he was abused for letting his bird fly but as he was shaven refreshed and in clean linen he could pull his shirtcuffs and take seat at his breakfasttable with equanimity while abrane denounced him ill bet you the fellows luck has gone said potts he s no new hand and you dont think him so either fleet ive looked into the fellows eye and seen a leery old badger at the bottom of it talks vile stuff however perhaps i didnt drive out on that sweltering carlsruhe road for nothing he screwed a look at the earl who sent abrane to carry a message and heard the story potts had to tell henrietta fakenham no mistake about her driving out from a pothouse man beside her military man might be a german and if you please quite unacquainted with your humble servant though we were as close as you to me something went wrong in that pothouse red eyes there had been a scene one could swear behind the lady another carriage and her maid never saw the girl before and sets to bowing and smirking at me as if i was thefellow of all others comical i made sure they were bound for this place they were on the strasburg road no sign of them you speak to me said fleetwood potts muttered he had put his foot into it you have a bad habit of speaking to yourself fleetwood remarked and left him he suffered from the rustics he had to deal with among his class and it was not needed that he should thunder at them to make his wrath felt livia swam in asking what has come to russett he passed me in one of his black fits the tale of the carlsruhe road was repeated by potts she reproved him how could you choose russett for such a report as that the admiral was on the road behind henriettayoure sure it was she german girls have much the same colouring the gentleman with her must have been one of the court equerries they were driving to some chateau or battlefield the admiral wanted to inspect goodlooking man military man oh the man pretty fair i dare say potts rejoined if it wasnt henrietta fakenham i see with the back of my head german girl the maid was a german girl that may well be said livia she conceived the news to be of sufficient importance for her to countermand the drive up the lichtenthal and take the carlsruhe road instead for henrietta was weak and chillon kirby an archplotter and pleader too one of the desperate lovers he was outstaying his leave of absence already she believed he had to be in england if he feared to lose henrietta he would not hesitate to carry her off livia knew him and knew the power of his pleading with a firmer woman than henrietta chapter xi the prisoner of his word nothing to rouse alarm was discovered at carlsruhe livias fair cousin was there with the redhaired gaunt girl of the mountains and it was frankly stated by henrietta that she had accompanied the girl a certain distance along the strasburg road for her to see the last of her brother chillon on his way to england livia was not the woman to push inquiries on that subject she merely said as soon as they were alone together you seem to have had the lions share of the parting yes we passed mr chumley potts was henriettas immediate answer and her reference to him disarmed livia they smiled at his name transiently but in agreement the tattlerspout of their set was a fatal person to encounter and each deemed the sudden apparition of him in the very early morning along the carlsruhe road rather magical you place particular confidence in russetts fidelity to his word rietteas you have been hearing yourself called you should be serious by this time russett wont bear much more i counted on the night of the ball for the grand effect you will extinguish every woman thereand if he is absent i shall excuse him you are not in a position to be so charitable you ought to know your position and yourself too a little better than you do how could you endure poverty chillon kirby stands in his uniform and alls told he can manoeuvre we know he got the admiral away to take him to those reviews cleverly but is he thinking of your interests when he does it he requires twenty years of active service to give you a roof to your head i hate such allusions but look for a moment at your character you must have ordinary luxuries and pleasures and if you were to find yourself grinding against common necessitiesimagine it russett is quite manageable he is trust me he is a gentleman he has more ability than most young men he can do anything he sets his mind to do he has his great estates and fortune all in his own hands we call him eccentric he is only young with a lot of power add hes in love and some one distracts him not love do you sayyou look it he worships he has no chance given him to show himself at his best perhaps he is off again now will you bet me he is not i should incline to make the bet if i betted said henrietta his pride is in his word and supposing hes in love its with his pride which never quits him theres firmness in a man who has pride of that kind you must let me take you back to baden i hold to having you with me today you must make an appearance there the admiral will bring us his miss kirby tomorrow if he is bound to remain here tonight theres no harm in his bachelor dinners i suspect his twinges of gout come of the prospect of affairs when he lands in england remember our bill with madame clemence there wont be the ghost of a banknote for me if russett quits the field we shall all be stranded henrietta inquired does it depend on my going with you today consider that he is now fancying a thousand things we wont talk of the road to paris a shot of colour swept over henrietta i will speak to papaif he can let me go he has taken to miss kirby does she taste well henrietta debated its impossible to dislike her oh she is wild she knows absolutely nothing of the world she can do everything we cantor dont dare to trymen would like her papas beginning to doat he says she would have made a firstrate soldier she fears blood as little as her morning cup of milk one of the orderlies fell rather badly from a frightened horse close by our carriage she was out in a moment and had his head on her lap calling to papa to keep the carriage fast and block the way of the squadron for the mans leg was hurt i really thought we were lost at these manoeuvres anything may happen at any instant papa will follow the horseartillery you know his vanity to be a military quite as much as a naval commander like the greeks and romans he says we took the bruised man into our carriage and drove him to camp carinthia nursing him on the way carinthia shes well fitted with her name what with her name and her hair and her build and her singular style of attire one wonders at her coming into civilized parts she s utterly unlike chillon henrietta reddened at the mention of one of her own thoughts in the contrasting of the pair they had their points of likeness she said it did not concern livia to hear what these were back to baden with means to procure the pleasant shocks of the galvanic battery there was her thought for she had a fear of the earls having again departed in a huff at henriettas behaviour the admiral consented that his daughter should go as soon as he heard that miss kirby was to stay he had when a young man met her famous father he vowed she was the old buccaneer young again in petticoats and had made prize of an english manofwar by storm all the profit however being his this he proved with a courteous clasp of the girl and a show of the salute on her cheek which he presumed to take at the nights farewell shes my tonic he proclaimed heartily she seemed to livia somewhat unstrung and toneless the separation from her brother in the morning might account for it and a man of the admirals age could be excused if he exalted the girl senility like infancy is fond of plain outlines for the laying on of its paints the girl had rugged brows a short nose red hair no young man would look at her twice she was utterly unlike chillon kissing her hand to henrietta from the steps of the hotel the girls face improved livias little squire sir meeson corby ejaculated as they were driving down the main street fleetwoods tramp there he goes now see miss fakenham the kind of object lord fleetwood picks up and calls friendcalls that object friend but what he has been to a tailor and a barber stop the coachman run tell mr woodseer i wish him to join us livia said and sir meeson had to thank his tramp for a second indignity he protested he simulated remonstrancehe had to go really feeling a sickness the singularlooking person whose necessities or sense of the decencies had unknown to himself and to the others put them all in motion that day swung round listening to the challenge to arms as the puffy little mans delivery of the countesss message sounded he was respectably clad he thought in the relief of his escape from the suit of clothes discarded and he silently followed sir meesons trot to the carriage should have mistaken you for a german today sir the latter said and trotted on a stout one woodseer replied with his happy indifference to his exterior his dark ladys eyes were kindly overlooking like the heavens her fair cousin to whom he bowed awakened him to a perception of the spectacle causing the slight quick arrest of her look in an astonishment not unlike the hiccup in speech while her act of courtesy proceeded at once he was conscious of the price he paid for respectability and saw the teuton skin on the slim cambrian baggy at shoulders baggy at seat pinched at the knees short at the heels showing outrageously every spot where he ought to have been bigger or smaller how accept or how reject the invitation to drive in such company to baden youre decided enough sir in your play they tell me the vindictive little baronet commented on his hesitation and woodseer sprang to the proffered vacant place but he had to speak of his fly waiting for him at the steps of a certain hotel best hotel in the town sir beeson exclaimed pointedly to henrietta reading her constraint with this comical object before her it was the admirals hotel they stopped at be so good as to step down and tell the admiral he is to bring madame clemence in his carriage tomorrow and on your way you will dismiss mr woodseers fly livia mildly addressed her squire he stared again he had to go muttering that nondescripts footman and his mischance in being checked and crossed and humiliated perpetually by a dirtyfisted vagabond impostor astounded him he sent the flyman to the carriage for orders admiral fakenham and carinthia descended sir meeson heard her cry out is it you and up stood the pretentious lout in the german sack affecting the graces of a born gentleman fresh from parisbowing smirking excusing himself for something and he jumped down to the young lady he talked intimately with her with a jokers air he roused the admiral to an exchange of jokes and the countess and miss fakenham more than smiled evidently at his remarks unobservant of the preposterous figure he cut sir meeson corby had intimations of the disintegration of his country if a patent tramp burlesquing in those clothes could be permitted to amuse english ladies of high station quite at home with them among the signs of englands downfall this was decidedly one what to think of the admirals favourite when having his arm paternally on her shoulder she gave the tramp her hand at parting and then blushed all that the ladies had to say about it was that a spread of colour rather went to change the character of her face carinthia had given woodseer her hand and reddened under the recollection of chillons words to her as they mounted the rise of the narrow vale after leaving the lame gentleman to his tobacco on the grass below the rocks her brother might have counselled her wisely and was to be obeyed only the great pleasure in seeing the gentleman again inspired gratitude he brought the scene to her and it was alive it chatted and it beckoned it neighboured her home she had passed it on her walk away from her home the gentleman was her link to the mountain paths he was just outside an association with her father and mother at least her thinking of them led to him he to them now that she had lost chillon no one was near to do so much besides chillon loved henrietta he was her own his heart was hers and his mind his countrys this gentleman loved the mountains the sight of him breathed mountain air to see him next day was her anticipation for it would be at the skirts of hilly forest land where pinetrees are a noble family different from the dusty firs of the weariful plains which had tired her eyes of late baden was her first peep at the edges of the world since she had grown to be a young woman she had but a faint idea of the significance of gambling the brilliant lights the band music the sitting groups and company of promenaders were novelties the ball of the ensuing night at the schloss would be a wonder she acknowledged in response to henrietta who was trying to understand her and she admired her balldress she said looking unintelligently when she heard that she would be guilty of slaying numbers of gentlemen before the night was over madame clemence thought her chances in that respect as good as any other young ladys if only she could be got to feel interested but at a word of the pine forest and saying she intended to climb the hills early with the light in the morning a pointed eagerness flushed carinthia the cold engraving became a picture of colour she was out with the earliest light yesterdays parting between chillon and henrietta had taught her to know some little about love and if her voice had been heeded by chillons beloved it would not have been a parting her only success was to bring a flood of tears from henrietta the tears at least assured her that her brothers beautiful girl had no love for the other onethe young nobleman of the great wealth who was to be at the ball and had gone flying admiral fakenham shrugged to say for lord fleetwood was nowhere seen the much talk of him on the promenade overnight fetched his name to her thoughts he scarcely touched a mind that her father filled when she was once again breathing early morning air among the stems of climbing pines broken alleys of the lowsweeping spruce branches and the bare straight shafts carrying their heads high in the march upward her old father was archpriest of such forest land always recoverable to her there the suggestion of mountains was enough to make her mind play and her old father and she were aware of one another without conversing in speech he pointed at things to observe he shared her satisfied hunger for the solitudes of the dumb and growing and wild sweetsmelling he would not let a sorrowful thought backward or an apprehensive idea forward disturb the scene a halfuprooted pinetree stem propped midfall by standing comrades and the downy drop to ground and muted scurry up the bark of longbrush squirrels cocktail on the wary watch were noticed by him as well as by her even the rotting timber drift bark and cones on the yellow pine needles and the tortuous dwarf chestnut pushing level out with a strain of the head up from a crevice of mossed rock among ivy and ferns he saw what his girl saw power of heart was her conjuring magician she climbed to the rockslabs above this was too easily done the poor bit of effort excited her frame to desire a spice of danger her walk was towering in the physical contempt of a mountain girl for petty lowland obstructions and it was just then by the chance of thingsby the direction of events as dame gossip believes it to bewhile colour expression and her proud stature marked her from her sex that a gentleman who was no other than lord fleetwood passed carinthia coming out of the deeper pine forest some distance on round a bend of the path she was tempted to adventure by a projected forked head of a sturdy blunted and twisted little rockfostered forest tree pushing horizontally for growth about thirty feet above the lower ground she looked on it and took a step down to the stem soon after fleetwood had turned and followed merely for the final curious peep at an unexpected vision he had noticed the singular shoot of thick timber from the rock and the form of the gooseneck it rose to the sprout of branches off the bill in the shape of a crest and now a shameful spasm of terror seized him at sight of a girl doing what he would have dreaded to attempt she footed coolly wellbalanced upright she seated herself and there let her be she was a german girl apparently she had an air of breeding something more than breeding german families of the nobles give out here and there as the great war showed examples of intrepid young women who have the sharp lines of character to render them independent of the graces but if a young woman out alone in the woods was hardly to be counted among the wellborn she held rank above them her face and bearing might really be taken to symbolize the forest life she was as individual a representative as the tragic and comic masks and should be got to stand between them for sign of the naturally straightgrowing untrained a noble daughter of the woods not comparable to henrietta in feminine beauty she was on an upper plateau where questions as to beauty are answered by other than the shallow aspect of a girl but would henrietta eclipse her if they were side by side fleetwood recalled the strange girls face there was in it a savage poignancy in serenity unexampled among womenor modern women one might imagine an apotheosis of a militant young princess of goths or vandals the glow of blessedness awakening her martial ardours through the languor of the gravewoodseer would comprehend and hit on the exact image to portray her in a moment fleetwood thought and longed for that fellow he walked hurriedly back to the stunted rock tree the damsel had vanished he glanced below she had not fallen he longed to tell woodseer he had seen a sort of carinthia sister cousin one of the family a single glimpse of her had raised him out of his grovelling perturbations cooled and strengthened him more than diverting the course of the poison henrietta infused and to which it disgraced him to be so subject he took love unmanfully the passion struck at his weakness in wrath at the humiliation if only to revenge himself for that he could be fiendish he knew it and loathed the desired fair creature who caused and exposed to him these cracks in his nature whence there came a brimstone stench of the infernal pits and he was made for better of this he was right well assured superior to station and to wealth to all mundane advantages he was the puppet of a florid puppet girl and he had slept at the small inn of a village hard by because it was intolerable to him to see the face that had been tearful over her lovers departure and hear her praises of the man she trusted to keep his word however grievously she wounded him he was the prisoner of his wordrather like the donkeys known as married men rather more honourable than most of them he had to be present at the ball at the schloss and behold his loathed henrietta suffer torture of chains to the rack by reason of his having promised the bitter coquette he would be there so hellish did the misery seem to him that he was relieved by the prospect of lying a whole day long in loneliness with the sunshine of the woods occasionally conjuring up the antidote face of the woodsprite before he was to undergo it but as he was not by nature a dreamer only dreamed of the luxury of being one he soon looked back with loathing on a notion of relief to come from the state of ruminating animal and jumped up and shook off another of mens delusionsthat they can if they have the heart to suffer pain deaden it with any semipoetical devices similar to those which rufus abranes fiddler fellow practised and was able to carry out because he had no blood the spite of a present entire opposition to woodseers professed views made him exult in the thought that the mouther of sentences was likely to be at work stultifying them and himself in the halls there below during the day an imp of mischief offered consolatory sport in those halls of the black goddess already he regarded his recent subservience to the conceited and tripped peripatetic philosopher as among the ignominies he had cast away on his road to a general contempt which is the position of a supreme elevation for particularly sensitive young men pleasure in the scenery had gone and the woodsprite was a flitted vapour he longed to be below there observing abrane and potts and the philosopher confounded and the legible placidity of countess livia nevertheless he hung aloft feeding where he could impatient of the solitudes till night when according to his guess the ladies were at their robing half the fun was over but the tale of it narrated in turn by abrane and his chummy potts on the promenade was a very good half the fiddler had played for the countess and handed her back her empty purse with a bow and a pretty speech nothing had been seen of him since he had lost all his own money besides as of course he would said potts a fellow calculating the chances catches at a knife in the air every francpiece he had cried abrane and how could the jackass expect to keep his luck flings off his old suit and comes back here with a rig of german bagsyou never saw such a figureshoreditch jews holidaywhy of course the luck wouldnt stand that they confessed ruefully to having backed him a certain distance notwithstanding he took it so coolly just as if paying for goods across a counter and he had something to bear braney when you fell on him said potts and murmured aside he can be smartish hears me call braney rufus and says he like a fellowchin on his fiddlecaptain mountain rufus mus not bad for a counter fleetwood glanced round he could have wrung woodseers hand he saw young cressett instead and hailed him here you are my gallant you shall flash your maiden sword tonight when i was under your age by a long count i dealt sanctimoniousness a flick o the cheek and you shall and let em know youre a man come and have your first boarhunt along with me petticoats be hanged the boy showed some recollection of the lectures of his queen but he had not the vocables for resistance to an imperative senior at work upon sneaking inclinations promised lady fdo you hear him fleetwood called to the couple behind and as gamblers must needs be parasites manly were the things they spoke to invigorate the youthful plunger and second the whim of their paymaster at halfpast eleven the prisoner of his word entered under the schloss partico having vowed to himself on the way that he would satisfy the formulas to gain release by a deferential bow to the great personages and straightway slip out into the heavenly starlight thence down among the jolly parisian and viennese bacchanals chapter xii henriettas letter treating of the great event by the first light of an autumn morning henrietta sat at her travellingdesk to shoot a spark into the breast of her lover with the story of the great event of the night for there had been one one of our biggest beyond all tongues and trumpets and possible anticipations wonder at it hammered on incredulity as she wrote it for fact and in writing had vision of her lovers eyes over the page monsieur du lac grey dawn you are greeted this if you have been tardy on the journey home will follow close on the heels of the prowest i believe truest of knights and bear perhaps to his quick mind some help to the solution he dropped a hint of seeking the ball in every way a success grand duke and duchess perfect in courtesy not a sign of the german morgue livia splendid compared to day and night but the night eclipses the day a summer sea of dancing who think you eclipsed those two i tell you the very truth when i say your carinthia did if you had seen herthe poor dear girl you sigh to speak ofwith the doleful outlook on her fortunes portionless unattractive chillon she was magical you cannot ever have seen her irradiated with happiness her pleasure in the happiness of all around her was part of the charm one should be a poet to describe her it would task an artist to paint the rosecrystal she became when threading her way through the groups to be presented this is not meant to say that she looked beautiful it was the something above beautymore unique and impressivelike the alpine snowcloak towering up from the flowery slopes you know so well and i a little you choose to think is it riette who noticed my simple sister so closely before for i suppose you to be reading this letter a second time and reflecting as you read in the first place acquaintance with her has revealed that she is not the simple persononly in her manner under the beams of subsequent events it is true i see her more picturesquely but i noticed also just a suspicion of the grenadier stride when she was on the march to make her curtsey but livia had no cause for chills and quivers she was not the very strange bird requiring explanatory excuses she dances excellently and after the first dance i noticed she minced her steps in the walk with her partner she catches the tone readily if not the image of her mother she has inherited her mothers bent for the graces she needs but a small amount of practice take my assurance of that and you know who has critical eyes your anxiety may rest she is equal to any station as expected by me my lord tyrant appeared though late near midnight i saw him bowing to the ducal party papa had led your simple sister there next i saw the tyrant and carinthia conversing soon they were dancing together talking interestedly like cheerful comrades whatever his faults he has the merit of being a man of his word he said he would come he did not wish to come and he came his word binds himi hope not fatally irrevocably it certainly does there is charm of character in that his autocrat airs can be forgiven to a man who so profoundly respects his word it occurred during their third dance your riette was not in the quadrille o but she was a snubbed young woman last night i refrainthe examples are too minute for quotation a little later and he had vanished carinthia kirby may already be written countess of fleetwood his hand was offered and hers demanded in plain terms her brother would not be so astounded if he had seen the brilliant creature she wasis i could say for when she left me here to go to her bed she still wore the afterglow she tripped over to me in the ballroom to tell me i might doubt she had no doubt whatever i fancied he had subjected her to some degree of trifling he was in a mood his moods are known to me but no he was precise her report of him strikes the ear as credible in spite of the marvel it insists on our swallowing lord fleetwood had asked me to marry him neither assurance nor bashfulness newspaper print aid an undoubting air of contentment imagine me hearing it to be his wife he said wife and you replied isaid i would tell me all he said we were plighted now wife is one of the words he abhors and he loathes the hearing of a girl as engaged however plighted carried a likeness i pressed her my dear carinthia you thought him in earnest he was how do you judge by his look when he spoke not by his words i repeat them to you she has repeated them to me here in my bedroom there is no variation she remembers every syllable he went so far as to urge her to say whether she would as willingly utter consent if they were in a church and a clergyman at the altarrails that was like him she made answer wherever it may be i am bound if i say yes she then adds he told me he joined hands with me did he repeat the word wife he said it twice i transcribe verbatim scrupulously there cannot be an error chillon it seems to show that he has embraced the serious meaning of the wordor seriously embraced the meaning reads better i have seen his lips form wife but why wonder so staringly they both love the mountains both are wildish she was looking superb and he had seen her do a daring thing on the rocks on the heights in the early morning when she was out by herself unaware of a spectator he not knowing who she wasthe fates had arranged it so that was why he took to her so rapidly so he told her she likes being admired the preparation for the meeting does really seem under direction she likes him too i do think between her repetitions of his compliments she praised his tone of voice his features she is ready to have the fullest faith in the sincerity of his offer speaks without any impatience for the fulfilment if it should happen what a change in the fortunes of a girlof more than one possibly now i must rest eyelids fall it will be with a heart galloping no rest for me till this letter flies good morning is my good night to you in a world that has turned over henrietta resumes livia will not hear of it calls up all her pretty languor to put it aside it is the same today as last night why mention russetts nonsense to me carinthia is as quietly circumstantial as at first she and the tyrant talked of her native home very desirous to see it means to build a mansion there he said it must be the most romantic place on earth i suppose i slept i woke with my last line to you on my lips and the great news thundering he named esslemont and his favouritealways uninhabitedcader argau she speaks them correctly she has an unfailing memory the point is that it is a memory do not forget alsolivia is affected by her distastethat he is a gentleman he plays with his nobility with his reputation of gentleman he has never been known to play you will understand the slightly hypocritical airit is not of sufficient importance for it to be alluded to in papas presencei put on with her yes i danced nearly all the dances one a princeling in scarlet uniform appearing fresh from under earth prussian a weighty young graf in green between sage and bottle who seemed to have run off a tree in the forest and was trimmed with silver like dewdrops one in your austrian white dragon de boheme if i caught his french rightly others as well a list they have the accomplishment they are drilled in it young as girls are and so few englishmeneven english officers how it may be for campaigning you can pronounce but for dancing the pantalon collant is the perfect uniform your critical henrietta had not to complain of her partners in the absence of the one i shall be haunted by visions of chillons amazement until i hear or we meet i serve for carinthias mouthpiece she cannot write it she says it would be related in two copybook lines if at all the amazement over london the jewel hand of the kingdom gone in a flash to a raw mountain girl as will be said i can hear lady endor lady eldritch lady cowry the reasonable woman should be lady arpington i have heard her speak of your mother seen by her when she was in frocks enter the plighted poor livia to be made a dowager of by any but a damsel of the family she may well ridicule that nonsense of russetts last night carinthia kisses embraces her brother i am to say what henrietta tells you is true chillon she is contented though she has not seen him again and has not the look of expecting to see him she still wears the kind of afterglow chillons viennese waltz was played by the band played a second time special request conveyed to the leader by prince ferdinand true most true she longs to be home across the water but be it admitted that to any one loving colour music chivalry the island of drab is an exile imagine then the strange magnetism drawing her there could warmer proof be given adieu livias archplotter will weigh the letter he reads to the smallest fraction of a fraction before he moves a step i could leave it and come to it again and add and add i foresee in livias mind a dread of the aforesaid arch and an interdict so the letter must be closed sealed and into the box with the hand i still call mine though i should doubt my right if it were contested fervently i am singing the waltz adieu ever and beyond it your obedient queen henrietta psmy lord tyrant has departedas on other occasions the prisoner of his word is sure to take his airing before he presents himself to redeem it his valet is left to pay bills fortunately for livia she entrusted her purse yesterday to a man picked up on the road by my lord that he might play for her captain abrane assured her he had a star and mr potts thought him a rush compere an adept of those dreadful gambling tables why will she continue to play the purse was returned to her without so much as a piece of silver in it the man has flown sir m corby says he is a man whose hands betray himor did to sir m expects to see him one day on the wrong side of the criminal bar he struck me as not being worse than absurd he was in any case an unfit companion and our c would help to rescue the eccentric from such complicating associates i see worlds of good she may do happily he is no slave of the vice of gambling so she would not suffer that anxiety i wish it could be subjoined that he has no malicious pleasure in misleading others livia is inconsolable over her pet young lord cressett whom he yesterday induced to try his luckwith the result we leave if bills are paid in two days captain abrane and mr potts left this afternoon just enough to carry them home papa and your blissful sister out driving riette within her four walls and signing herself the prisoner of chillon chapter xiii an irruption of mistress gossip in breach of the convention it is a dark land carinthia said on seeing our islands lowered clouds in swift motion without a break of their folds above the sheer white cliffs she said it we know that poor child carinthia jane when first she beheld old englands shores tossing in the packetboat on a wild channel sea did say it and think it for it is in the family that she did and no wonder that she should the day being showery from the bed of the sun after a frosty three days at the close of autumn we used to have an eye of our own for english weather before printed meteorological observations and forecasts undertook to supplant the shepherd and the poacher and the pilot with his worn brown leather telescope tucked beneath his arm all three would have told you that the end of a three days frost in the late season of the year and the early is likely to draw the warm winds from the atlantic over cornish lands end and lizard quite by chance of things carinthia jane looked on the land of her father and mother for the first time under those conditions there can be no harm in quoting her remark onlyi have to say itexperience causes apprehension that we are again to be delayed by descriptions and an exposition of feelings taken for grantedof course in a serious narrative which it really seems these moderns think designed for a frequent arrest of the actors in the story and a searching of the internal state of this one or that one of them who is laid out stark naked and probed and expounded like as in the celebrated picture by a great painterand we thirsting for events as we are are to stop to enjoy a lecture on anatomy and all the while the windows of the lectureroom are rattling if not the whole fabric shaking with exterior occurrences or impatience for them to come to pass every explanation is sure to be offered by the course events may take so do in mercy i say let us bide for them she thought our island all the darker because henrietta had induced her to talk on the boat of her mountain home and her last morning there for the walk away with chillon john soon it was to appear supernaturally bright a very magicians cave for brilliancy now this had happenedand comment on it to yourselves remembering always that chillon john was a lover and a lover has his excuses though they will not obviate the penalties he may incur and dreadful they were after reading henriettas letter to him he rode out of his canterbury quarters across the country to the borders of sussex where his uncle lord levellier lived on the ridge of ironstone near the wild land of a forest croridge the name of the place now chillon john knew his uncle was miserly and dreaded the prospect of having to support a niece in the wretched establishment at lekkatts or as it was popularly called leancats you can understand why but he managed to assure himself he must in duty consult with the senior and chief member of his family on a subject of such importance as the proposal of marriage to his lordships niece the consultation was short you will leave it to me his uncle said and we hear of business affairs between them involving payment of moneys due to the young man and how whenever he touched on them his uncle immediately fell back on the honour of the family and carinthia janes reputation her good name to be vindicated and especially that there must be no delays together with as close a reckoning as he could make of the value of lord fleetwoods estates in kent and in staffordshire and south wales and his house property in london he will have means to support her said the old lord shrugging as if at his own incapacity for that burden the two then went to the workshops beside a large pond where there was an island bordered with birch trees and workmens cottages near the main building and that was an arsenal containing every kind of sword and lance and musket rifle and fowlingpiece and pistol and more gunpowder than was i believe allowed by law for they were engaged in inventing a new powder for howitzer shells of tremendous explosive power nothing further did either of them say concerning the marriage nor did carinthia jane hear any mention of lord fleetwood from her brother on the landingplace at dover she was taken to admiral baldwin fakenhams house in hampshire and there she remained the delight of his life during two months patiently expecting and rebuking the unmaidenliness of her expectations as honest young women in her position used to do so did they sometimes wait for years they have waited until they withered into their graves like the vapours of a brief winters day a moving picture of a sex restrained by modesty in those purer times from the taking of one step forward unless inquired for two months she waited in our dark land january arrived and her brother henrietta communicated the news my janey you are asked by lord fleetwood whether it is your wish that he should marry you now usually a wellborn young womans answer if a willing one is an example of weak translation here it was the hearts native tongue without any roundabout simple but direct oh i will i am ready tell him remember she was not speaking publicly henrietta knew the man enough to be glad he did not hear she herself would have felt a little shock on his behalf only that answer suited the scheme of the pair of lovers how far those two were innocent in not delivering the whole of lord fleetwoods message to carinthia jane through lord levellier we are unable to learn we may suspect the miserly nobleman of curtailing it for his purposes and such is my idea but the answer would have been the same i am sure in consequence and straight away chillon john betakes him to admiral baldwin and informs him of lord fleetwoods proposal on the night at baden and renewal of it through the mouth of lord levellier not communicating however he may really not have known the story of how it had been wrung from the earl by a surprise movement on the part of the onearmed old lord who burst out on him in the street from the ambush of a clubwindow where he had been stationed every day for a fortnight indefatigably to watch for the passing of the earl as there seemed no other way to find him they say indeed there was a scene judging by the result and it would have been an excellent scene for the stage though the two noblemen were to all appearance politely exchanging their remarks but the audience hearing what passes appreciates the courteous restraint of an attitude so contrasting with their tempers behind the ostentation of civility their words were daggers for it chanced that the young earl after a period of refuge at his welsh castle supposing as he well might that his latest mad freak of the proposal of his hand and title to the strange girl in a quadrille at a foreign castle had been forgotten by her and the risks of annoyance on the subject had quite blown over returned to town happy in having done the penance for his impulsiveness and got clean againthat is to say struck off his fetters and escaped from importunitiesthe very morning of the day when lord levellier sprang upon him it shows the old campaigners shrewdness in guessing where his prey would come and not putting him on his guard by a call at his house out of the window he looked for all the hours of light during an entire fortnight in the service of my sisters child he said to save him from the cost of maintaining her say his enemies at any rate he did it he was likely to have done the worse which i suspect now the imparting of the wonderful news to admiral baldwin fakenham was we read the whiff of a tropical squall to lay him on his beam ends he could not but doubt and his talk was like the sails of a big ship rattling to the first puff of wind he had to believe and then we read he was for hours like a vessel rolling in the trough of the sea of course he was a disappointed father naturally his glance at the loss to henrietta of the greatest prize of the matrimonial market of all europe and america was vexing and saddening then he woke up to think of the fortunes of his other girl as he named her and cried crinny catches him he cried it in glee and rubbed his hands so thereupon standing before him chillon john from whom he had the news bent to him slightly as his elegant manner was and lengthened the admirals chaps with another proposal easy deliberate precise quite the respectful bandit if you please determined on having his daughter by all means only much preferring the legal formal and friendly upon that in the moment of indecision henrietta enters followed by admiral baldwins heroine his crinny whom he embraced and kissed congratulated and kissed again one sees the contrivance to soften him so it was done down in that hampshire household on the heights near the downs whence you might behold off a terra firma resembling a roll of billows englands big battleships in line fronting the island when they were a spectacle of beauty as well as power which now they are no more but will have to be if they are both to float and to fight for i have had quoted to me by a great admirer of the old buccaneer one of the dark sayings in his maxims for men where captain john peter kirby commends his fellowmen to dissatisfaction with themselves if they have not put an end to their enemy handsomely and he advises the copying of nature in this whose elements have always he says a pretty besides a thorough style of doing it when they get the better of us and the one by reason of the other he instances the horse the yacht and chiefly the sword for proof that the handsomest is the most effective and he prints large ugly is only half way to a thing to an invention i suppose he intends to say but looking on our huge foundering seamonsters and the disappearance of the unwieldy in nature and the countenances of criminals who are he bids us observe always in the long run beaten i seem to see a meaning our country might meditate on so as i said it was done for admiral baldwin could refuse his crinny nothing as little as he would deny anything to himself the heartiest of kindly hosts fathers friends carinthia janes grand good fortune covered that pit the question of money somehow and was we may conceive a champagne wine in their reasoning faculties the admiral was in debt henrietta had no heritage chillon john was the heir of a miserly uncle owing him sums and evading every application for them yet they behaved as people who had the cup of golden wishes perhaps it was because henrietta and her lover were so handsome a match as to make it seem to them and others they must marry and as to character her father could trust her to the man of her choice more readily than to the wealthy young nobleman of whose discreetness he had not the highest opinion he reconciled this view with his warm feeling for the countess of fleetwood to be by saying crinny will tame him his faith was in her dauntless bold spirit not thinking of the animal she was to tame countess livia after receiving henriettas letter of information descended on them and thought them each and all a crazed set love as a motive of action for a woman she considered the females lunacy and suicide men are born subject to it happily and thus the balance between the lordly half of creation and the frail is rectified we women dress and smile sigh if you like to excite the malady but if we are the fools to share it we lose our chance instead of the queens we are the slaves and instead of a life of pleasure we pass from fever to fever at a tyrants caprice he does rightly in despising us ay and many a worthy woman thinks the same educated in dependency as they are they come to the idea of love to snatch at it for their weapon of the mans weakness for which my lord calls them heartless and poets are angry with them rightly or wrongly it must i fear be admitted for a truth that sorrow is the portion of young women who give the full measure of love to the engagement marrying for love at least countess livia could declare subsequently she had foretold it and warned her cousin not another reflection do you hear from me if i must pay forfeit of my privilege to hurry you on past descriptions of places and anatomy of character and impertinent talk about philosophy in a story when we are startled and offended by the insinuated tracing of principal incidents to a threadbare spot in the nether garments of a man of no significance i lose patience henriettas case was a secondary affair what with her passionit was nothing lessand her lovers cunning arts and her fathers consent given and in truth the look of the two together the dissuasion of them from union was as likely to keep them apart as an exhortation addressed to magnet and needle countess livia attacked carinthia jane and the admiral backing her but the admiral having given his consent to his daughters marriage in consequence of the earls pledged word to his other girl had become a zealot for this marriage and there was only not a grand altercation on the subject because livia shunned annoyances alone with carinthia jane as she reported to henrietta she spoke to a block that shook a head and wore a thin smile and nursed its own idea of the better knowledge of edward russett earl of fleetwood gained in the run of a silly quadrille at a ball what is a young mans word to his partner in a quadrille livia put the question she put it twice rather sternly and the girl came out with oh he meant it the nature the pride the shifty and furious moods of lord fleetwood were painted frightful to her she had conceived her own image of him whether to set her down as an enamoured idiot or a creature not a whit less artful than her brother was countess livias debate her inclination was to misdoubt the daughter of the old buccaneer she might be simple at her age and she certainly was ignorant but she clung to her prize still the promise was extracted from her that she would not worry the earl to fulfil the word she supposed him to mean in its full meaning the promise was unreluctantly yielded no she would not write admiral fakenham too engaged to leave the matter to a man of honour meanwhile chillon john had taken a journey to lekkatts following which his uncle went to london lord fleetwood heard that miss kirby kept him bound he was again the fated prisoner of his word and following that not so very long there was the announcement of the marriage of chillon john kirby levellier lieutenant in the kings own hussars and henrietta daughter of admiral baldwin fakenham a county newspaper paragraph was quoted for its eulogy of the beauty of hampshirenot too strong those acquainted with her thought interest at court obtained an advancement for the bridegroom he was gazetted captain during his honeymoon and his prospects under his uncles name were considered fair though certain people said at the time it was likely to be all he would get while old lord levellier of leancats remained in the flesh now as it is good for those to tell who intend preserving their taste for romance and hate anatomical lectures we never can come to the exact motives of any extraordinary piece of conduct on the part of man or woman girls are to read and the study of a boy starts from the monkey but no literary surgeon or chemist shall explain positively the cause of the behaviour of men and women in their relations together and speaking to rescue my story i say we must with due submission accept the facts we are not a bit the worse for wondering at them so it happened that lord fleetwoods reply to lord levelliers hammerhammer by post and messenger at his door one may call it on the subject of the celebration of the marriage of the young croesus and carinthia jane in which there was demand for the fixing of a date forthwith was despatched on the day when london had tidings of henrietta pakenhams wedding the letter lost for many years turned up in the hands of a kentish auctioneer selling it on behalf of a farmserving man who had it from lord levelliers cook and housemaid among the things she brought him as her wifely portion after her masters death and this she had not found saleable in her husbands village at her price but she had got the habit of sticking to the scraps being proud of hearing it said that she had skinned leancats to some profit and her expectation proved correct after her own demise for her husband putting it up at the auction our relative on the mothers side dr glossop interested in the documents and particulars of the story as he was had it knocked down to him in contest with an agent of a london gentleman going as high as two pounds ten shillings for the sum of two pounds and fifteen shillings count the amount that makes for each word of a letter a marvel of brevity considering the purport but dr glossop was right in saying he had it cheap the value of that letter may now be multiplied by ten nor for that sum would he part with it thus it ran i need not refer to it in bundle no my lord i drive to your churchdoor on the fourteenth of the month at ten am to keep my appointment with miss c j kirby if i do not blunder the initials your lordships obedient servant fleetwood that letter will ever be a treasured family possession with us that letter was dated from lord fleetwoods kentish mansion esslemont the tenth of the month he must have quitted london for esslemont for change of scene for air the moment after the news of henriettas marriage carinthia jane received the summons without transmission of the letter from her uncle on the morning of the twelfth it was a peremptory summons unfortunately admiral fakenham a real knight and chevalier of those past times would not let her mount the downs to have her farewell view of the big ships unaccompanied by him and partly and largely in pure chivalry no doubt but her young idea of englands grandeur as shown in her great vessels of war thrilled him too and restored his youthful enthusiasm for his noble profession or made it effervesce however it was he rode beside her and rejoiced to hear the young girls talk of her father as a captain of one of englands thunderers and of the cruelty of that admiralty to him at which admiral baldwin laughed but had not the heart to disagree with her for he could belabour the admiralty in season cause or no cause altogether he much enjoyed the ride notwithstanding intimations of the approach of his visitor as he called his attacks of gout riding home however the couple passed through a heavy rainfall and the next day when he was to drive with the bride to lekkatts gout the fiercest he had ever known chained him fast to his bed such are the petty accidents affecting circumstances they are the instruments of destiny there he lay protesting that the ceremony could not possibly be for the fourteenth because countess livia had he now remembered written of her engagement to meet russett on the night of that day at a ball at mrs cowper quilletts place canleys lying south of the surrey hills a house famed for its gatherings of beautiful women whither lord fleetwood would be sure to engage to go the admiral now said and it racked him like gout in his mind and perhaps troubled his conscience about handing the girl to such a young man but he was lying on his back the posture for memory to play the fiend with us as we read in the book of maxims of the old buccaneer admiral baldwin wished heartily to be present at his crinnys wedding to see her launched if wedding it was to be and he vowed the date of the fourteenth in lord levelliers announcement of it must be an error and might be a month in advance and ought to be but it was sheer talking and raving for a solace to his disappointment or his anxiety he had to let carinthia jane depart under the charge of his housekeeper mrs carthew a staid excellent lady poorly gifted with observation her report of the performance of the ceremony at croridge village church a half mile from lekkatts was highly reassuring to the anxious old admiral still lying on his back with memory and gout at their fiends play and livid forecasts hovering he had recollected that there had been no allusion in lord levelliers message to settlements or any lawyers preliminaries and he raged at himself for having to own it would have been the first of questions on behalf of his daughter all passed off correctly mrs carthew said the responses of the bride and bridegroom were particularly articulate she was reserved upon the question of the hospitality of lekkatts the place had entertained her during her necessitated residence there and honour forbade her to smile concordantly at the rosy admirals mention of leancats she took occasion however to praise the earl of fleetwoods eminently provident considerateness for his bride inasmuch as he had packed a hamper in his vehicle which was a fourinhand driven by himself admiral baldwin inquired bride inside he was informed the countess of fleetwood sat on the box on the left of my lord she had made no moan about the absence of bridesmaids she appeared too profoundly happy to meditate an instant upon deficiencies how did the bridegroom behave lord fleetwood was very methodical he is not or was not voluntarily a talker blue coat brass buttons hothouse flower old style or new his lordship wore a rather low beaver and a buttoned white overcoat not out of harmony with the brides plain travellingdress ah hes a good whip men say keeps firstrate stables hacks and bloods esslemont hard by will be the place for their honeymoon i guess and hes a lucky dog if he knows his luck so said admiral baldwin he was proceeding to say more for he had a prodigious opinion of the young countess and the benefit of her marriage to the british race as it concerned a healthy constitution and motherhood mrs carthew coughed and retired nor do i reprove either of them the speculation and the decorum are equally commendable masculine ideas are one thing but let feminine ever be feminine or our civilization perishes at croridge village church then one of the smallest churches in the kingdom the ceremony was performed and duly witnessed names written in the vestry book the clergymans fee the clerk and the pewwoman paid by the bridegroom and thus we see how a pair of lovers blind with the one object of lovers in view and a miserly uncle all on edge to save himself the expense of supporting his niece and an idolatrous old admiral on his back with gout conduced in turn and together to the marriage gradually exciting the worlds wonder till it eclipsed the story of the old buccaneer and countess fanny which it caused to be discussed afresh mrs carthew remembered carinthia janes last maiden remark and her first bridal utterance on the way walking to the church of croridge from lekkatts the girl said going on my feet i feel i continue the mountain walk with my brother when we left our home and after leaving the church about to mount the coach she turned to mrs carthew saying as she embraced her a happy brides kiss should bring some good fortune and looking down from her place on the top of the coach adieu dear mrs carthew a day of glory it is today she must actually have had it in her sight as a day of glory and it was a day of the clouds off our rainy quarter similar in every way to the day of her stepping on english soil and saying it is a dark land for the heart is truly declared to be our colourist a day having the gale in its breast sweeping the whole country and bending the trees for the twigs to hiss like spray of the billows around our island was a day of golden splendour to the young bride of the earl of fleetwood though he scarcely addressed one syllable to her and they sat side by side all but dumb he like a coachman driving an unknown lady fare on a morning after a night when his wifes tongue may have soured him for the sex chapter xiv a pendant of the foregoing mention has been omitted or forgotten by the worthy dame in her vagrant fowls treatment of a story she cannot incubate will not relinquish and may ultimately addle that the bridegroom after walking with a disengaged arm from the little village church at croridge to his coach and four at the cross of the roads to lekkatts and the lowland abruptly and as one pursuing a deferential line of conduct he had prescribed to himself asked his bride what seat she would prefer he shouted ives a person inside the coach appeared to be effectually roused the glass of the window dropped the head of a man emerged it was the head of one of the bargefaced men of the british isles broad and battered flattish with sentinel eyes in an instant the heavyheaded but not illlooking fellow was nimble and jumped from the coach napping my lord he said heavy though the look of him might be his feet were light they flipped a bar of a hornpipe at a touch of the ground perhaps they were allowed to go with their instinct for the dance that his master should have a sample of his wakefulness he quenched a smirk and stood to take orders clad in a flat blue cap a brown overcoat and kneebreeches as the temporary bustle of his legs had revealed fleetwood heard the young lady say i would choose if you please to sit beside you he gave a nod of enforced assent glancing at the vacated box the man inquired a knee and a back for the lady to mount up my lord in was the smart command to him and he popped in with the agility of his popping out then carinthia made reverence to the grey lean figure of her uncle and kissed mrs carthew she needed no help to mount the coach fleetwoods arm was rigidly extended and he did not visibly wince when this foreign girl sprang to the first handgrip on the coach and said no my husband i can do it unaided was implied her stride from the axle of the wheel to the step higher would have been a graceful spectacle on alpine crags fleetwood swallowed that too though it conjured up a mocking recollection of the baden woods and an astonished wild donkey preparing himself for his harness a sour relish of the irony in his present position sharpened him to devilish enjoyment of it as the finest form of loathing on the principle that if we find ourselves consigned to the nether halls we do well to dance drunkenly he had cried for romancehere it was he raised his hat to mrs carthew and to lord levellier previous to the ceremony the two noblemen had interchanged the short speech of mannered duellists punctiliously courteous in the opening act their civility was maintained at the termination of the deadly work the old lords bosom thanked the young one for not requiring entertainment and a repast the young lords thanked the old one for a strict military demeanour at an execution and the abstaining from any nonsensical talk over the affair a couple of liveried grooms at the horses heads ran and sprang to the hinder seats as soon as their master had taken the reins he sounded the whip caressingly off those pretty trotters went mrs carthew watched them waving to the bride she was on the present occasion less than usually an acute or a reflective observer owing to her admiration of lordly state and masculine commandership and her thought was she has indeed made a brilliant marriage the lady thought it notwithstanding an eccentricity in the wedding ceremony such as could not but be noticeable but very wealthy noblemen were commonly perhaps necessarily eccentric for thus they proved themselves egregious which the world expected them to be lord levellier sounded loud eulogies of the illustrious drivers team his meditation as he subsequently stated to chillon was upon his vanquished antagonists dexterity in so conducting matters that he had to be taken at once with naught of the customary preface and apology for taking to himself the young lady of which a handsome settlement is the memorial we have to suppose that the curious occupant of the coach inside aroused no curiosity in the pair of absorbed observers speculations regarding the chances of a fall of rain followed the coach until it sank and the backs of the two liveried grooms closed the chapter of the wedding introductory to the honeymoon at esslemont seven miles distant by road to the right of lekkatts it was out of sight that the coach turned to the left northwestward chapter xv opening stage of the honeymoon a famous maxim in the book of the old buccaneer treating of precaution as the brave mans clean conscience with sound counsel to the adventurous has it then you sail away into the tornado happy as a sealed bottle of ripe wine it should mean that brave men entering the jaws of hurricanes are found to have cheerful hearts in them when they know they have done their best but touching the picture of happiness conceive the bounteous bacchic spirit in the devoutness of a sophocles and you find comparison neighbour closely between the sealed wineflask and the bride who is being driven by her husband to the nest of the unknown on her marriage morn seated beside him with bosom at heave and shut mouth in a strange land travelling cloudlike rushing like the showercloud to the vale this carinthia suddenly wedded passionately grateful for humbleness exalted virginly sensible of treasures of love to give resembled the inanimate and most inspiring was mindless and inexpressive past memory beyond the hopes a thing of the thrilled blood and skylark air since she laid her hand in this young mans his not speaking to her was accepted her blood rather than recollection revived their exchanges during the dance at baden for assurance that their likings were one their aims rapturously one that he was she she he the two hearts making one soul could she give as much as he it was hardly asked if we feel we can give our breath of life the strength of the feeling fully answers it bubbles perpetually from the depth like a wellspring in tumult two hearts that make one soul do not separately count their gifts for the rest her hunger to admire disposed her to an absorbing sentience of his acts the trifles gestures manner of this and that which were seized as they flew and swiftly assimilated to stamp his personality driving was the piece of skill she could not do her husbands mastery of the reins endowed him with the beauty of those harmonious trotters he guided and kept to their pace and the humming rush of the pace the smooth torrent of the brown heathknolls and reddish pits and hedgelines and grassflats and copses pouring the counterway of her advance belonged to his wizardry the bearing of her onward was her abandonment to him delicious as mountain air the wind sang it had a song of many voices quite as much as on the mountains there was the keen the blissful nerveknotting catch of the presence of danger in the steep descents taken as if swallowed without swerve or check she was in her husbands hands at times at the pitch of a rapid shelving that was like a fall her heart went down and at the next throb exalted before it rose not reasoning whyher confidence was in him she was his comrade whatever chanced up over the mountainpeaks she had known edged moments little heeded in their passage when life is poised as a crystal pitcher on the head in peril of a step then she had been dependent on herself now she had the joy of trusting to her husband his hard leftward eye had view of her askant if he cared to see how she bore the trial and so relentlessly did he take the slopes that the man inside pushed out an inquiring pate the two grooms tightened arms across their chests her face was calmly set wakeful but unwrinkled the creature did not count among timid girlsor among civilized she had got what she wanted from her madmanmad in his impulses mad in his reading of honour she was the sister of henriettas husband henrietta bore the name she had quitted could madness go beyond the marrying of the creature he chafed at her containment at her courage her silence her withholding the brazen or the fawnish lookup either of which he would have hated he however was dragged to look down neither gorgon nor venus nor a mingling of them she had the chasm of the face recalling the face of his bondage seen first that night at baden it recalled and it was not the face it was the skull of the face or the flesh of the spirit occasionally she looked for a twinkle or two the creature or vision she had been as if to mock by reminding him she was the abhorred delusion who captured him by his nerves ensnared his wordthe doing of a foul witch how had it leapt from his mouth she must have worked for it the word spokenshe must have known ithe was bound or the detested henrietta would have said not even true to his word to see her now this girl insisting to share his name for a slip of his tongue despite the warning sent her through her uncle had that face much as a leaden winter landscape pretends to be the country radiant in colour she belonged to the order of the variable animalsa woman indeedwomanish enough in that there are men who love womenthe idea of woman woman is their shepherdess of sheep he loved freedom loathed the subjection of a partnership could undergo it only in adoration of an ineffable splendour he had stepped to the altar fancying she might keep to her part of the contract by appearing the miracle that subdued him seen by light of day this bitter object beside him was a witch without her spells that is the skeleton of the seductive ghastliest among horrors and ironies let her have the credit of doing her work thoroughly before the exposure she had done it she might have helpedsuch was the stipulation of his mad freak in consenting to the bondageyes she might have helped to soften the sting of his wound she was beside him bearing his name for the perpetual pouring of an acid on the wound that vile henriettapoisoned honey of a girlhad dealt he glanced down at his possessionheaven and the yawning pit were the contrast poisoned honey is after all honey while you eat it here there was nothing but a rocky bowl of emptiness and who was she she was the sister of henriettas husband he was expected to embrace the sister of henriettas husband those two were on their bridal tour this creature was also the daughter of an ancient impostor and desperado called the old buccaneer a distinguished member of the family of the lincolnshire kirbys boasting a present representative grimly acquitted men said on a trial for murder an eminent alliance society considered the earl of fleetwood wildish though he could manage his affairs he and his lawyers had them under strict control how of himself the prize of the english marriage market had taken to his bosom for his winsome bride the daughter of the old buccaneer he was to mix his blood with the blood of the lincolnshire kirbys lying pallid under the hesitating acquittal of a divided jury how had he come to this pass which swung him round to think almost regretfully of the scorned multitude of fair besiegers in the market some of whom had their unpoetic charms he was renowned and unrivalled as the man of stainless honour the one living man of his word he had never broken itnever would there was his distinction among the herd in that a man is princely above princes the nobility of edward russett earl of fleetwood surpassed the nobility of common nobles but by all that is holy he pays for his distinction the creature beside him is a franked issue of her old pirate of a father in one respectnothing frightens her there she sits not a screw of her brows or her lips and the coach rocked they were sharp on a spill midway of the last descent it rocks again she thinks it scarce worth while to look up to reassure him she is looking over the country have you been used to driving he said she replied no it is new to me on a coach carinthia felt at once how wild the wish or half expectation that he would resume the glowing communion of the night which had plighted them she did not this time say my husband still it flicked a whip at his ears she had made it more offensive by so richly toning the official title just won from him as to ring it on the nerves one had to block it or be invaded an anticipation that it would certainly recur haunted every opening of her mouth now that it did not he felt the gap relieved and yet pricked to imagine a mimicry of her tones for the odd foreignness of the word and the sound she had a voice of her own besides her courage at the altar her responses had their music no wonder the day was hers my husband was a manner of saying my fish he spoke very civilly oblige me by telling me what name you are accustomed to answer to she seemed unaware of an arctic husband and replied my father called me carinshort for carinthia my mother called me janey my second name is jane my brother chillon says both henrietta calls me janey the creature appeared dead flesh to goads but the name of her sisterinlaw on her lips returned the stroke neatly she spared him one whip to cut him with another you have not informed me which of these names you prefer oh my husband it is as you shall please fleetwood smartened the trot of his team and there was a todo with the rakish leaders fairies of a malignant humour in former days used to punish the unhappiest of the naughty men who were not favourites by suddenly planting a hump on their backs off the bedevilled wretches pranced and they kicked they snorted whinnied rolled galloped outflying the wind but not the dismal rider marriage is our incubus now no explanation is offered of why we are afflicted we have simply offended or some one absent has offended and we are handy the spiteful hag of power ties a wife to us perhaps for the reason that we behaved in the spirit of a better time by being chivalrously honourable wives are just as inexplicable curses just as ineradicable and astonishing as humps imposed on shapely backs fleetwood lashed his horses until carinthias low cry of entreaty rose to surprise that stung him leave the coachman to his devices we have an appointment and must keep it he said they go so willingly good beasts in their way i do not like the whip i have the same objection they were on the level of the vale going along a road between farms and mansions meadows and gardenplots and parkpalings a strong warm wind drove the pack of clouds over the treetops and charged at the branches english scenery animating air a rouse to the blood and the mind carinthia did not ask for hues she had come to love of the dark land with the warm lifting wind the big trees and the hedges and the stately houses and people requiring to be studied who mean well and are warm somewhere below as chimneypots are though they are so stiff english people dislike endearments she had found it might be that her husband disliked any show of fondness he would have to be studied very much he was not like others as henrietta had warned her from thinking of him fervidly she was already past the marvel of the thought that she called him husband at the same time a curious intimation gathered she knew not whence of the word husband on a young wifes lips as being a foreign sound in england advised her to withhold it his behaviour was instructing her are you weatherwiseable to tell when the clouds will hold off or pelt he said to be very civil to a neighbour she collected her understanding apparently treating a conversational run of the tongue as a question to be pondered and the horses paid for it ordinarily he was gentle with his beasts he lashed at her in his heart for perverting the humanest of men father was she replied oh i have heard of him her face lightened father had a great name in england the old buccaneer i think i do not know he was a seaman of the navy like admiral fakenham is weather at sea weather on the mountains he could foretell it always he wrote a book i have a copy you will read it is a book of maxims he often speaks of the weather english weather and women he says but not my mother my mother he stood aside by herselfpas capricieuse du tout because she would be out in the weather and brave the weather she rode she swam best of any woman if she could have known you what pleasure for me mother learnt to read mountain weather from father i did it too but sometimes on the high fields upper snows it is very surprising father has been caught here the cloud is down near the earth and the strong wind keeps the rain from falling how long the wind will blow i cannot guess but you love the mountains we spoke and mountains adventures we both love i will talk french if you like for i think german you do not speak i may speak english better than french but i am afraid of my english with you dear me quoth fleetwood and he murmured politely and cursorily attentive to his coachman business she had a voice that clove the noise of the wheels and she had a desire to talkthat was evident talk of her father set her prattling it became clear also to his not dishonest his impressionable mind that her baby english might be natural or she was mildly playing on it to give herself an air he had no remembrance of such baby english at baden there however she was in a state of enthusiasmthe sort of illuminated transparency they show at the end of fireworks mention of her old scapegrace of a father lit her up again the girl there and the girl here were no doubt the same it could not be said that she had duped him he had done it for himselfacted on by a particular agency this creature had not the capacity to dupe he had armed a bluntwitted young woman with his idiocy and she had dealt the stroke different in scarce a degree by nature from other young women of prey but her look at times and now and then her voice gave sign that she counted on befooling him as well to reconcile him to his bondage the calculation was excessive no woman had done it yet idiocy plunged him the step which reawakened understanding and to keep his whole mind alert on guard against any sort of satisfaction with his bargain he frankly referred to the cause not female arts but natures impulses it was his passion for the wondrous in the look of a womans face the new morning of the idea of women in the look and the peep into imaginary novel character did the trick of enslaving him call it idiocy such it was once acknowledged it is not likely to recur an implacable reason sits in its place with a keen blade for efforts to carry the imposture further afield or make it agreeable yet after giving his word to lord levellier he had prodded himself to think the burden of this wild young woman might be absurdly tolerable and a laugh at the world a solicitude for the animal was marked by his inquiry you are not hungry yet oh no not yet said she oddly enlivened they had a hamper and were independent of stoppages for provision he informed her what more delightful cried her look seeing the first middays rest and meal with chillon on the walk over the mountain from their empty home she could get up enthusiasm for a stocked hamper and when told of some business that drew him to a meadow they were nearing she said she would be glad to help if she could i learn quickly i know his head acquiesced the daughter of the old buccaneer might learn the business quickly perhaps a singularly cutting smile was on his tight lips in memory of a desire he had as a boy to join hands with an amazonian damsel and be out over the world for adventures comrade and bride as one here the creature sat life is the burlesque of young dreams or they precipitate us on the roar and grin of a recognized beast world the devil possessing him gnawed so furiously that a partial mitigation of the pain was afforded by sight of waving hats on a hillrise of the road he flourished his whip the hats continued at windmill work it signified brisk news to him and prospect of glee to propitiate any number of devils you will want a maid to attend on you he said she replied i am not used to attendance on me henriettas maid would help i did not want her i had no maid at home i can do for myself father and mother liked me to be very independent he supposed he would have to hear her spelling her words out next the hilltop was gained twenty paces of pretty trotting brought up the coach beside an inn porch in the style of the finish dear to whips and even imperative upon them if they love their art two gentlemen stood in the road and a young woman at the inn door a darkhaired girl of an anxious countenance her puckers vanished at some signal from inside the coach all right madge nothing to fear fleetwood called to her and she curtseyed he alighted saying to her before he spoke to his friends ive brought him safe had him under my eye the last four and twenty hours hell do the trick today you dont bet oh my lord no help the lady down out with you ines the lightlegged bargefaced man touched ground capering he was greeted kit by the pair of gentlemen who shook hands with him after he had faintly simulated the challenge to a jig with madge she flounced from him holding her arms up to the lady landlord landlady and hostler besought the lady to stay for the fixing of a ladder carinthia stepped leaped and entered the inn fleetwood remarking we are very independent chummy potts cordy bally by jove potts cried but the moment after this disengaged ejaculation he was taken with a bewilderment at the opera he questioned of his perplexity no sir not at the opera fleetwood rejoined the ladys last public appearance was at the altar sort of a suspicion of having seen her somewhere left her husband behind has she you see she has gone in the scoring of a proposition of euclid on the forehead of potts amused him and the other gentleman who was hailed mallard and cared nothing for problems involving the female of man when such work was to the fore as the pugilistic encounter of the earl of fleetwoods chosen kit ines with lord brailstones unbeaten and wellbacked ben todds ines had done pretty things from the age of seventeen to his twentythird year remarkably clever things they were to be called great in the annals of the ring the point however was that the pockets of his backers had seriously felt his latest fight he received a dogs licking at the hands of lummy phelps his inferior in skill fighting two to one of the odds and all because of his fatal addiction to the breaking of his trainers imposed fast in liquids on the night before the battle right through his training up to that hour the rascal was devout the majoritys money rattled all on the snug safe side and how did he get at the bottle his trainers never could say but what made him turn himself into a headlong ass when he had only to wait a night to sit among friends and worshippers drinking off his tumbler upon tumbler with the honours it was past his wits to explain endurance of his privation had snapped in him or else which is more likely this genius of the ring was tempted by his genius on the summit of his perfected powers to believe the battle his own and celebrate it as became a victor despising the drubbed antagonist in any case he drank and a minor man gave him the dogs licking went into it puffy came out of it bunged the chronicle resounding over england ran old england read of an eyeless carcase heroically stepping up to time for three rounds of mashing punishment if he had won the day after all the country would have been electrified it sympathized on the side of his backers too much to do more than nod a short approval of his fortitude to sink with flag flying is next to sinking the enemy there was talk of a girl present at the fight and of how she received the eyeless almost faceless carcase of her sweetheart kit and carried him away in a little donkeycart comfortably cushioned to meet disaster this petty incident drew the attention of the earl of fleetwood then beginning to be known as the diamond of uncounted facets patron of the pick of all departments of manly activity in england the devotion of the girl madge to her sweetheart was really a fine story fleetwood touched on it to mr mallard speaking of it like the gentleman he could be while chumley potts wagged impatient acquiescence in a romantic episode of the ring that kept the talk from the hotter theme moneys bank of england today you think he interposed and had his answer after mallard had said the girl s rather goodlooking too you may double your bets chummy i had the fellow to his tea at my

potts doated on his limbs with a butchers eye for prize joints cocksure has crowed low by sunset mallard observed fleetwood offered him to take his bets youre heavy on it with brailstone said mallard three thousand id back you for your luck blindfold a ruffle of sourness shot over the features of the earl and was noticed by both eager betters who exchanged a glance potts inspected his watch and said half aloud liver ten to one that never meant bad luckexcept bad to act on we slept here last night you know it s a mile and a quarter from the royal sovereign to the field of glory pretty well

she sticks to the coach i dont know her tastes madge must see her through it thats positive potts deferred his astonishment at the things he was hearing and seeing which were only fleetwoods riddles the fight and the bets rang every other matter out of his head he beheld the lady who had come down from the coach like a columbine mount it like beanstalk jack madge was not half so clever and required a hand at her elbow after giving hurried directions to rundles the landlord of the royal sovereign fleetwood took the reins and all three gentlemen touched hats to the curtseying figure of mrs rundles you have heard i dare sayits an english scene he spoke partly turning his face to carinthia particularly select today their majesties might look on as the caesars did in rome pity we cant persuade them they ought to set the fashion here we have the english people at their grandest in prime condition if they were not drunk overnight and dogged perfectly awake magnanimous all for fair play fine fellows upon my word a little blood of course but the daughter of the old buccaneer would have inherited a tenderness for the sight of blood she should make a natural lady patroness of

rail at i would not wish to leave you said carinthia you have chosen said fleetwood chapter xvi in which the bride from foreign parts is given a taste of old england cheers at an open gate of a field saluted the familiar scarlet of the earl of fleetwoods coach in kentish land they were chorister cheers the spontaneous ringing out of english country hearts in homage to the nobleman who brightened the heaviness of life on english land with a spectacle of the noble art distinguishing their fathers he drove along over muffling turf ploughboys and blue butcherboys and smocked old men with an approach to a hundredweight on their heels at the trot to right and left all hoping for an occasional sight of the jewel called kitty that he carried inside kitty was there kittys eyes are shut think of that cradled innocence and angels dreams and the whole of the hymn just before dingdongbang on noses and jaws that means confidence looks like it but kittys not asleep you try him hes only quiet because he has got to undergo great exertion last fight he was knocked out of time because he went into it honest drunk they tell and the earl took him up to give him a chance of recovering his good name and thats christian but the earl he knows a man as well as a horse hes one to follow go to a fayte down at esslemont you wont forget your day see there hes brought a lady on the top o the coach that seems for to signify he dont expect its going to be much of a bloody business but theres no accounting anyhow broadfield ll have a name in the papers for sunday reading in comes t other lords coach theyve timed it together closes they have they were pronounced to be both the right sort of noblemen for the country lord brailstones blue coach rattled through an eastern gate to the corner of the thirtyacre meadow where lord fleetwood had drawn up a toss from the ring the meeting of the blue and scarlet coaches drew forth old englands thunders and when the costly treasures contained in them popped out heads the moment was delirious kit ines came after his head on a bound ben todds was ostentatiously deliberate his party said he was no dancingmaster he stepped out grave as a barge emerging from a lock though alive to the hurrahs of supporters and punctilious in returning the formal portion of his rivals too roguish nod their look was sharp into the eyes just an instant brailstone and fleetwood jumped to the grass and met talking and laughing precise upon points of business otherwise cordial plenipotentiaries of great powers whom they have set in motion and bind to the ceremonial opening steps according to the rules of civilized warfare they had a short colloquy with newspaper reportersan absolutely fair square upright fight of britons was to be chronicled captain abrane a tower in the crowd registered bets whenever he could curricles gigs carts ponytraps boys on ponies a swarm on legs flowed to the central point and huddled there was either champion born in kent an audacious boy proclaimed kit ines a man of kent why of course he was and that was why the earl of fleetwood backed our cocky kitty and means to land him on the top of his profession ben todds was shuffled aside as one of their londoners destitute of county savour all very well but have a spy at benny todds who looks the square man and hear what that big gentleman of the other lords party says a gentleman of his height and weight has a right to his opinion he s dead against kit ines its fists not feet he says ll do it today stamina he says benny has got the stamina todds possession of the stamina and the grand voice of captain abrane and the father christmas roastbeefofold england face of the umpire declared to be on the side of lord brailstones colour blue darkened the star of kit ines till a characteristic piece of behaviour was espied he dashed his cap into the ring and followed it with the lightest of vaults across the ropes there he was the first in the ring and that stands for promise of first blow first blood first flat knockdown and last to cry for quarter his pair of seconds were soon after him fleetwood mounted his box is it to fight said carinthia to see which is the master they fight to see generally until one or the other cant see you are not obliged to see it you can be driven away if you wish i will be here if you are here you choose it fleetwood leaned over to chumley potts on the turf abranes ruining himself potts frankly hoped that his friend might be doing so todds is jolly well backed hes in prime condition hes the favourite of the knowing ones you wouldnt have the odds if he werent no but the odds are like ten per cent they conjure the gale and be hanged said potts he swore at his betting mania which destroyed the pleasure of the show he loved all in the ring were shaking hands shots of a desire to question and comment sped through carinthias veins and hurt her she had gathered that she spoke foolishly to her husbands ear so she kept her mouth shut though the unanswered of her inquisitive ignorance in the strange land pricked painfully at her bosom she heard the girl behind her say our colours when the colour scarlet unwound with lord brailstones blue was tied to the stake and her husband nodded he smiled he liked to hear the girl potts climbed up crying toilets complete now for paws out and then at it my hearties choice of corners under the leaden low cloud counted for little a signal was given a man outside the ring eyed a watch raised a hand the two umpires were on foot in their places the pair of opposing seconds hurried out cheery or boltbusiness words to their men and the champions advanced to the scratch todds first by the courtesy of ines whose decorous control of his legs at a weighty moment was rightly read by his party their hands grasped firmly thereupon becoming fists of a hostile couple in position and simply to learn which of us two is the better man or in other words with four simple fists to compass a patent fact and stand it on the historic pedestal with a little red writing underneath you never can patent a fact without it but mark the differences of this kind of contention from all otherespecially the parliamentary this is positive it has a beginning and an end and it is goodhumoured from beginning to end trial of skill trial of stamina nature and art old english which made us what we are and no rancours no vows of vengeance the beaten man of the two bowing to the bit of history he has helped to make kittites had need to be confident in the skill of their lither lad his facer looked granite fronting that mass kit you mightnot to lash about for comparisonscall a bundle of bamboo ay but well knitted springy alive every inch of him crafty too as you will soon bear witness he knows he has got his task and hes the man to do it there was wary sparring and mirrors watched them bigger fellow but have no fear the earl said over his shoulder to madge she said in return oh i dont know im praying kit was now on his toes all himself like one who has found the key he feinted quick as lightning he landed a bolt on bens jib just at the tollbar of the bridge between the eyes and was off out of reach elastic bens counter fell short by a couple of inches cheers for first blow the earl clucked to madge her gaze at the ring was a sullen intensity will you believe itben received a second spanking cracker on the spectaclesseat neat indeed and poor payment for the compliment he managed to dig a drive at the ribs as much of that game as may suit you sturdy ben but hear the shout and behold first blood to kit ines that telltale nose of old bens has mounted the earl of fleetwoods colours and all his party are looking brailstoneblue so far said fleetwood his grooms took an indication the hamper was unfastened sandwiches were handed carinthia held one she tried to nibble in obedience to her husbands example madge refused a bite of food hearing carinthia say to her i hope he will not be beaten i hope i hope she made answer you are very good miss and the young lady flushed gentlemen below were talking up to the earl a kentish squire of an estate neighbouring esslemont introduced a welsh squire he had driven to see the fun by the name of mr owain wythan a neighbour of the earls down in wales refreshments were offered carinthia submissively sipped the sparkling wine which stings the lips when they are indisposed to it the voice of the girl madge rang on the tightened chords of her breast madge had said she was praying and to pray was all that could be done by two women her husband could laugh loudly with mr potts and the other gentlemen and the strangers he was quite sure the man he supported would win he might have means of knowing carinthia clung to his bare words for the sake of the girl a roaring peal went up from the circle of combat kit had it this time attacking bens peepers he was bent on defending his own and he caught a bodyblow that sent him hopping back to his pair of seconds five clear hops to the rear like a smashed surgewave off the rock he was respectful for the remainder of the round but hammering at the system he had formed in the very next round he dropped from a tremendous repetition of the blow and lay flat as a turbot the bets against him had simultaneously a seesaw rise bellows he appears to have none was the comment of chumley potts now for training chummy said lord fleetwood chummy signifying a crow over potts rang out of the hollows of captain abrane on lord brailstones coach carinthia put a hand behind her to madge it was grasped in gratitude for sympathy or in feminine politeness the girl murmured ive seen worse she was not speaking to ears lord fleetwood sat watch in hand up he said and as if hearing him kit rose from the ministering seconds knee he walked stiffly squared after the fashion of a man taught caution ben made play they rounded the ring giving and taking ben rushed and had an emollient spouted again and was corked again and received a neat redwaxen stopper he would not be denied at kits door found him at home and hugged him kit got himself to grass after a spell of heavy fibbing bens game it did him no great harm it might be taken for an enlivener he was dead on his favourite spot the ensuing round played postman on it so cleverly easily dancingly did he perform the double knock and the retreat that chumley potts was moved to forget his wagers and exclaim racketball by jove if he doesnt let the fellow fib the wind out of him mallard addressed his own crab eyeballs lord fleetwood heard and said coolly tightstrung i kept him fasting since he earned his breakfast you dont wind an empty rascal fit for action a sword through the lungs wont kill when theres no air in them that was printed in the few words before the encounter in the book of maxims for men carinthia hearing everything her husband uttered burned to remind him of the similarity between his opinions and her fathers she was learning that for some reason allusions to her father were not acceptable she squeezed the hand of madge and felt a pressure like a scream telling her the girls heart was with the fight beneath them she thought it natural for her she wished she could continue looking as intently she looked because her husband looked the dark hills and clouds curtaining the run of the stretch of fields relieved her sight the clouds went their way the hills were solid but like a blue smoke the scene here made them very distant and strange those two men were still hitting not hating one another only to gratify a number of unintelligible people and win a success but the earth and sky seemed to say what is the glory they were insensible to it as they are notthey are never insensible to noble grounds of strife they bless the spot they light lamps on it they put it into books of history make it holy if the cause was a noble one or a good one or supposing both those men loved the girl who loved one of them then would carinthia be less reluctantly interested in their blows her infant logic stumbled on for a reason while she repressed the torture the scene was becoming as though a reason could be found by her submissive observation of it and she was right in believing that a reason for the scene must or should exist only like other bewildered instinctive believers she could not summon the great universe or a lifes experience to unfold it her one consolation was in squeezing the hand of the girl from time to time not stealthily done it was not objected to by the husband whose eye was on all but the persistence in doing it sank her from the benignity of her station to the girls level it was conduct much too raw and grated on the deed of the man who had given her his name madge pleased him better she had the right to be excited and she was very little demonstrative she hadwell in justice the couple of them had only she had it morethe tone of the women who can be screwed to witness a spill of blood peculiarly catching to heara tone of every string in them snapped except the silver string catching to hear it is worth a stretching of them on the rack to hear that low buzzhum of their inner breast by heaven we have them at their best when they sing that note his watch was near an hour of the contest and brailstones man had scored first knockdown blow a particularly clean floorer thinking of that he was cheered by hearing chummy potts whose opinions he despised cry out to abrane yeast to him for the face of todds was visibly swelling to the ripest of plums from kits deliveries down he went he had the sturdy legs which are no legs to a clean blow odds were offered against him oh pretty play with your right kit exclaimed mallard as kit fetched his man an ugly stroke on the round of the waist behind and the crowd sent up the name of the great organs affected a sickener of a stroke if dealt soundly it meant more than showed kit was now for taking liberties light as ever on his pins he now and then varied his attentions to the yeasty part delivering a wakener in unexpected quarters masterly as the skilled cooks carving of a joint with hungry guests for admirers eh madge the earl said she kept her sight fixed replying yes i think carinthia joined with her i must believe it that he will but will the other man poor man submit i entreat him to put away his pride it is hisoh poor man ben was having it hot and fast on a torso physiognomy the voices of these alien women thrilled the fray and were a bardic harp to lord fleetwood he dropped a pleasant word on the heads in the curricle mr owain wythan looked up worthy of theocritus its the boxing twin and the bembrycian giant the style of each to the letter kit is assiduously fastening bens blinkers potts remarked he explained to the incomprehensible lady he fancied he had somewhere seen that the battle might be known as near the finish by the behaviour on board lord brailstones coach its like foreign affairs and the stock exchange he said to the more intelligent males if i want to know exactly how the country stands i turn to the money article in the papers thats a barometrical certainty no use inquiring abroad look at old rufus abrane i see the state of the fight on the old fellows mug he hasnt a bet left in him captain mountainrufus mus cried lord fleetwood and laughed at the penetrative portrait woodseers epigram sketched he had a desire for the presence of the singular vagabond the rufus mus in the captain mountain exposed his view of the encounter by growing stiller apparently growing smaller without a squeak like the entrapped and profoundly contemplative after the style of the absolutely detached who foresee the fatal crash and are calculating far ahead of events the means for meeting their personal losses the close of the battle was on the visage of rufus abrane fifteen minutes before that elgin marble under red paint in the ring sat on the knee of a succouring seconder mopped rubbed dramprimed puppypeeping inconsolably comforted preparatory to the resumption of the greatcoat he had so hopefully cast from his shoulders not downcast by any means like an old roman the man of the sheer hulk with purple eyemounds found his legs to do the manful thing show that there was no bad blood stand equal to all forms ben todds if ever man in old england looked the picture you might label bellyful it was remarked kit ines had an appearance of springy readiness to lead off again so they faced on the opening step of their march into english history vanquisher and vanquished shook hands engaged in a parting rally of goodhumoured banter the beaten man said his handsome word the best man capped it with a compliment to him they drink of different cups today both will drink of one cup in the day to come but the day went too clearly to crown the light and the tight and the right man of the two for moralizing to wag its tail at the end oldsters and youngsters agreed to that science had done it happy the backers of science not one of them alluded to the philosophical hundred years hence for when england thanks to a spirited pair of our young noblemen has exhibited one of her characteristic performances consummately philosophy is bidden fly she is a foreign bird chapter xvii records a shadow contest close on the foregoing kit ines cocked an eye at madge in the midst of the congratulations and the paeans pumping his arms as he had been little mauled he could present a face to her expecting a wreath of smiles for the victor what are we to think of the contrarious young woman who when he lay beaten drove him off the field and was all tenderness and devotion she bobbed her head hardly more than a trifle pleased one might say just like females theyre riddles not worth spelling then drunk ill get tonight my pretty dear the man muttered soured by her inopportune staidness as an opponents bruisings could never have rendered him she smiled a lively beam in answer to the earl oh yes i m glad its your doing my lord him it was that she thanked and for the moment prized most the female riddle is hard to read because it is compounded of sensations and they rouse and appeal to the similar cockatrices in us which either hiss back or coil upon themselves she admired kit ines for his valour she hated that ruinous and besotting drink it flung skeletons of a married couple on the wall of the future nevertheless her love had been all maternal to him when he lay chastised and disgraced on account of his vice pity had done it pity not being stirred her admiration of the hero declared victorious whose fortunes in uncertainty had stopped the beating of her heart was eclipsed by gratitude toward his preserver and a sentiment eclipsed becomes temporarily coldish against our wish and our efforts in a way to astonish making her think that she cannot hold two sentiments at a time when it is but the fact that she is unable to keep the two equally warm carinthia said to her he is brave oh yes hes brave madge assented lord brailstone flourishing his whip cried out at canleys tonight the earl nodded i shall be there you too chummy came from abrane to see you dance potts rejoined and mumbled but will he dance old braneys down on his luck hes a specimen of a fellow emptier and not lighter and wont be till suppertime but i say fleet how the deucefunny sort of proceedingyou havent introduced me the lady bears my name mr chumley potts with a bow to the ladys profile and a mention of a glimpse at baden potts ejaculated it happened this morning you allude to the marriage it happened this morning how do i get to canleys i drive you another team from the esslemont stables is waiting at the royal you stay at canleys no no oh funny upon my word though i dont know why notexcept that people count your winnings chummy fleetwood remarked to his bride our friend has the habit of soliloquizing in company i forgot to tell you of an appointment of mine at a place called canleys about twenty miles or more from here i gave my word so i keep it the landlady at the inn mrs rundles motherly kind of woman she will be attentive they dont cook badly for an english inn i have heard madge here will act as your ladysmaid for the time you will find her serviceable shes a bruisers lass and something above it ines informed me madge you were going to friends of yours at the wells you will stay at the royal and wait on this lady who bears my name you understanda girl i can trust for courage if the article is in request he resumed to his bride and talked generally of the inn and the management of it and its favoured position outside the village and contiguous to the river upon which it subsisted carinthia had heard she was more than ever the stunned young woman she had been since her mounting of the coach between the village church and lekkatts she said not a word why should she her object was won give her that and a womans tongue will consent to rest the dreaded weapon rest also when she is kept spinning by the whip she gives out a pleasant hum too her complexion must be pronounced dull in repose a bride on her travels with an aspect of wet chalk rather helps to scare mankind from marriage which may be good or bad but she reflects a sicklier hue on the captured chessman calling her his own let her shine in privacy fleetwood drew up at the royal sovereign whereof the reigning monarch in blue uniform on the signboard curtseyed to his equally windy subjects and a small congregation of the aged and some cripples and infants greeted the patron of old englands manfullest display cheering at news of the fight brought them by many little runners your box has been conveyed to your room he said to his bride she bowed this time she descended the coach by the aid of the ladder ines victorious in battle had scant notice from his love yes i m glad and she passed him to follow her newly constituted mistress his pride was dashed all the foam of the first draw on the top of him blown off as he figuratively explained the cause of his gloom to the earl i drink and i gets a lickingthat girl nurses and cossets me i dont drink and i whops my manshe shows me her back aint it encouragement my lord you ought to know them by this time you dolt returned his patron and complimented him on his bearing in the fight you shall have your two hundred and something will be added hold handy here till i mount i start in ten minutes whether to speak a polite adieu to the bride whose absurd position she had brought on her own head was debated for half a minute he considered that the wet chalkquarry of a beauty had at all events the merit of not being a creature to make scenes he went up to the sittingroom if she was not there he would leave his excuses she was there and seated neither crying nor smiling nor pointedly serious in any way not conventionally at her ease either and so clearly was he impressed by her transparency in simplicity of expression that he took without a spurn at it the picture of a woman half drained of her blood veiling the wound and a young woman a stranger to suffering perhapsas the creatures do looking for the usual flummery tenderness what they call happiness wondering at the absence of it and the shifty ghost of a husband she has got by floundering into the bog known as marriage she would have it and here she was he entered the situation and was possessed by the shivering delicacy of it surface emotions were not seen on her she might be a creature with a soul here and there the thing has been found in women it is priceless when found and she could not be acting one might swear the creature had no power to act she spoke without offence the simplest of words affected no solicitudes put on no gilt smiles wore no reproaches spoke to him as if so it happenedhe had necessarily a journey to perform one could see all the while big drops falling from the wound within one could hear it in her voice imagine a crack of the string at the bows deep stress or imagine the bow paralyzed at the moment of the deepest sounding and yet the voice did not waver she had now the richness of tone carrying on a music through silence well then at least he had not been the utterly duped fool he thought himself since the consent was pledged to wed her more she had beautyof its kind or splendour or grandeur was the term for it but it bore no name none of her qualitiesif they were qualitieshad a name she stood with a dignity that the word did not express she endured meekly when there was no meekness pain breathed out of her and not a sign of pain was visible she had under his present observation of her beauty with the lines of her face breaking in revolt from beautyor requiring a superterrestrial illumination to show the harmony he as he now saw had erred grossly in supposing her insensitive and therefore slow of a womans understanding she drew the breath of pain through the lips red lips and well cut her brown eyes were tearless not alluring or beseeching or repelling they did but look much like the skies opening high aloof on a wreck of storm her reddish hairchestnut if you willlet fall a skein over one of the rugged brows and softened the ruggedness by making it wilder as if a great bird were winging across a shoulder of the mountain ridges conceived of the mountains built in their image the face partook alternately of mountain terror or splendour wholly he remembered of the splendour when her blood ran warm no longer the chalkquarry faceits paleness now was that of night alps beneath a moon chasing the shadows she might be casting her spells again you remember i told you he said i have given my wordi dont break itto be at a ball your uncle was urgent to have the ceremony over these clashes occur the people herei have spoken of that people of good repute for attention to guests i am uncertain of the time we have all to learn to wait so then goodbye till we meet he was experiencing a novel nip of torment of just the degree which takes a partial appeasement from the inflicting of it and calls up a loathed compassion she might have been in his arms for a step though she would not have been the better loved he was allowed his escape bearing with him enough of husband to execrate another enslaving pledge of his word that begat a frenzy to wreak some caresses on the creatures intolerably haunting image of course he could not return to her how would she receive him there was no salt in the thought of it she was too submissive however there would be fun with chummy potts on the drive to canleys fun with rufus abrane at mrs cowper quilletts and with the countess livia smothered struggling fighting for life with the title of dowager a desire for unbridled fun had hold of any amount of it to excess in any direction and though this cloud as a dry tongue after much wine craves water glimpses of his tramps walk with a fellow tramp on a different road enjoying strangely healthy vagabond sensations and vast ideas brought the vagrant philosopher refreshfully to his mind chiefly for the reason that while in woodseers company he had hardly suffered a stroke of pain from the thought of henrietta she was now a married woman he was a married man by the register stronger proof of the maddest of worlds could not be furnished sane in so mad a world a man is your flabby citizen among outlaws good for plucking fun at any cost is the one object worth a shot in such a world and the fun is not to stop if it does we are likely to be got hold of and lugged away to the altarthe terminus that foul disaster has happened through our having temporarily yielded to a fit of the dumps and treated a mad worlds lunatic issue with some seriousness but fun shall be had with the aid of his highness below the madder the world the madder the fun and the mixing in it of another element which it has to beguile usromanceis not at all bad cookery poetic romance is delusiona tale of a corsair a poets brain a bottle of gin and a theatrical wardrobe comic romance is about us everywhere alive for the tapping a daughter of the old buccaneer should participate in it by right of birth she would expect it in order to feel herself perfectly at home then be sure she finds an english tongue and prattles away as merrily as she does when her old scapegrace of a father is the theme soninlaw to him but the path of wisdom runs in the line of facts and to have wild fun and romance on this pantomime path instead of kicking to break away from it we follow things conceived by the genius of the situation for the delectation of the fair countess of fleetwood and the earl her delighted husband quite in the spirit of the old buccaneer father of the bride carinthia sat beside the fire seeing nothing in the room or on the road up in her bedchamber the girl madge was at her window she saw lord fleetwood standing alone laughing it seemed at some thought he threw up his head was it a newly married man leaving his bride and laughing the bride was a dear lady fit for better than to be driven to look on at a prizefighta terrible scene to a lady she was left solitary and this her wedding day the earl had said it he had said she bore his name spoke of coming from the altar and the lady had blushed to hear herself called miss the pressure of her hand was warm with madge her situation roused the fervid latent sisterhood in the breast of women before he mounted the coach lord fleetwood talked to kit ives he pointed at an upper window seemed to be issuing directions kit nodded he understood it whatever it was you might have said a pair of burglars the girl ran downstairs to bid her lover goodbye and show him she really rejoiced in his victory kit came to her saying given my word of honour i wont make a beast of myself tonight got to watch over you and your lady lord fleetwood started his fresh team casting no glance at the windows of the room where his bride was he and the gentlemen on the coach were laughing his leaving of his young bride to herself this day was classed among the murky flashes which distinguished the deeds of noblemen but his laughter on leaving her stamped it a cruelty of the kind that plain mortals who can be monsters commit madge conceived a pretext for going into the presence of her mistress whose attitude was the same as when she first sat in the chair the lady smiled and said he is not hurt much she thought for them about her the girls heart of sympathy thumped and her hero became a very minute object he had spoken previously of the making or not making a beast of himself without inflicting a picture of the beast his words took shape now and in consequence a little selfpity began to move it stirred to swell the great wave of pity for the lady that was in her bosom oh he she said and extinguished the thought of him and at once her underlip was shivering her eyes filled and poured carinthia rose anxiously the girl dropped at her feet you have been so good to me today my lady so good to me today i cant help iti dont often just for this moment ive been excited oh hes well he will do hes nothing you say poor child but im not its only excitement i do long to serve you the best i can she stood up in obedience and had the arms of her young mistress pressing her tears also were streaming from carinthias eyes heartily she thanked the girl for the excuse to cry they were two women on the road to canleys the coach conveying men spouted with the lusty anecdote relieved of the interdict of a tyrannical sex chapter xviii down whitechapel way contention begets contention in a land of the pirate races gigs were at high rival speed along the road from the battlefield to london they were the electrical wires of the time for an expectant population bursting to have report of so thundering an event as the encounter of two champion light weights nursed and backed by a pair of gallant young noblemen pick of the whole row of coronets above london panted gaping and the gigs flew with the meat to fill it chumley potts offered ambrose mallard fair odds that the neat little trap of the chief sporting journal which had a reputation to maintain would be over one or other of the bridges crossing the thames first mallard had been struck by the neat little trap of an impudent new and lowerpriced journal which had a reputation to gain he took the proffered odds on the cry as of a cracker splitting enormous difficulties in regard to the testimony and the verifications were discussed they were overcome potts was ready for any amount of trouble mallard the same there was clearly a race there would consequently be a record visits to the offices of those papers perhaps half a day at the south end of london or on westminster bridge examining witnesses corner shopmen watermen and the like would or should satisfactorily establish the disputed point fleetwood had his fun insomuch that he laughed himself into a sentiment of humaneness toward the couple of donkeys and forgot his contempt of them their gamblings and their bets increased his number of dependents and imbeciles were preferable to dolts or the dry gilt figures of the circle he had to move in matter for some astonishment had been furnished to the latter this day and would cause an icy signor stare and rather an angry signora flutter a characteristic of that upper circle as he knew it is that the good are dull the vicious very bad they had nothing to please him but manners elsewhere this land is a land of no manners take it and make the most of it then for its quality of brute honesty which is found to flourish best in the british prizering his irony landed him there it struck the country a ringing blow but it struck an almost effacing one at the life of the young nobleman of boundless wealth whose highest renown was the being a patron of prizefighters husband of the daughter of the old buccaneer as well perchance as a result that philosopher tramp named her beautiful gorgon she has no beauty and as for gorgon the creature has a look of timid softness in waiting behind her rocky eyes a barbaric damsel beginning to nibble at civilization is nearer the mark and ought she to be discouraged fleetwoods wrath with his position warned him against the dupery of any such alcove thoughts for his wrath revenged him and he feared the being stripped of it lest a certain fund of his own softness that he knew of though few did should pull him to the creatures feet she belonged to him indeed so he might put her to the trial of whether she had a heart and personal charm without the ceremony of wooingwhich in his case tempted to the feeling desperately earnest and becoming enslaved he speculated upon her eyelids and lips and her voice when melting as women do in their different ways here and there with an execrableperhaps pardonableart one or two divinely the vision drew him to a headlong plunge and swim of the amorous mind occupying a minute filling an era he corrected the feebleness and at the same time threw a practical coachmans glance on peculiarities of the road requiring some knowledge of it if traversed backward at a whipping pace on a moonless night the drive from canleys to the royal sovereign could be done by good pacers in an hour and a half little morewith ives and the stables ready and some astonishment in a certain unseen chamber fleetwood chuckled at a vision of romantic devilryperfectly legitimate too something more to inflict than enjoy was due to him he did not phrase it that a talk with the fellow woodseer of his mountains and his forests and nature philosophy poetry would have been particularly healthy for him almost as good as the good counsel be needed and solicited none to give him it swept among his ruminations while he pricked potts and mallard to supply his craving for satanical fare gower woodseer the mention of whom is a dejection to the venerable source of our story was then in the act of emerging from the eastward into the southward of the line of canterburys pilgrims when they set forth to worship on his homeward course after a walk of two days out of dover he descended londons borough having exactly twopence halfpenny for refreshment following a term of prudent starvation at the end of the walk it is not a district seductive to the wayfarers appetite as for example one may find the jews fry of fish in oil inspiriting the shoreditch region to be nourishment is afforded according to the laws of englands genius in the arts of refection at uninviting shops to the necessitated stomach a pennorth of crumb of bread assisted on its laborious passage by a pennorth of the rinsings of beer left the natural philosopher a hapenny for dessert at the stall of an applewoman where he withstood an inclination toward the juicy fruit and chose nuts they extend a meal as a grimace broadens the countenance illusorily but they help to cheat an emptiness in time where it is nearly as offensive to our sensations as within us and that prolonged occupation of the jaws goes a length to persuade us we are filling all the better when the substance is indigestible tramps of the philosophical order who are the practically sagacious prefer tough grain for the teeth woodseers munching of his nuts awakened to fond imagination the picture of his fathers dinner seen one day and little envied a small slice of cold boiled muttonflesh in a crescent of white fat with a lump of dry bread beside the plate thus he returned to the only home he had not disheartened and bearing scenes that outvied londons printshops for polychrome splendour an exultation to recall his condition moreover threw his fathers life and work into colour the lean whitechapel house of the minister among the poor the joy in the saving of souls if he could persuade himself that such good labour advanced and at the fall of light the pastime task of bootmakinga desireable occupation for a thinker thought flies best when the hands are easily busy cobblers have excursive minds their occasional rap at the pegs diversifies the stitchings and is often happily timed to settle an internal argument seek in a village for information concerning the village or the state of mankind you will be less disappointed at the cobblers than elsewhere it has been said as gower had anticipated with lively feelings of pleasure mr woodseer was at the wonted corner of his back room on the stool between two tallow candleflames leather scented strongly when the wanderer stood before him in the image of a ball that has done with circling about a stable point back the minister sang out at once and his wrinkles gleamed their hands grasped hungry sir rather to be sure you are one can read it on your boots mrs jones will spread you a table how many miles today show the soles they tell a tale of wear they had worn to resemble the thinedged layers of still upper cloud round the peep of coming sky about forty odd today sir theyve done their hundreds of miles and have now come to dock i ll ask mrs jones to bring me a plate here gower went to the housekeeper in the kitchen his fathers front door was unfastened by day she had not set eyes on him yet and mr woodseer murmured now shes got the boy there s clasping and kissing hes all wild wales to her the plate of meat was brought by mary jones with gower beside her and a sniffle of her happiness audible she would not although invited to stay and burning to hear gower wait in the room where father and son had to talk together after a separation long to loves counting she was a welshwoman of the pure blood therefore delicately mannered by nature yes dear lad tobacco helps you on to the marrow of your story and i too will blow the cloud said mr woodseer when the plate was pushed aside and the pipe appeared so gowers recital of his wanderings began more puffs than speech at the commencement he was alternately picturesque and sententious until he reached baden there he became involved from thinking of a revelation of beauty in woman mr woodseer rapped the leather on his block a place where they have started public gambling i am told we must look into all the corners of the world to know it sir and the world has to be riddled or it riddles us ah did you ever tell a lie gower woodseer i played you played the lord be thanked you have kept your straight tongue the lord can always enter a heart of truth sin cannot dwell with it but you played for gain and that was a licenced thieving and that was a backsliding and there will have to be a climbing up and what that means your hold on truth will learn touch sin and you accommodate yourself to its vileness ay you love nature nature is not anchorage for vessels like men if you loved the book you would float in harbour you played i do trust you lost you have your wish sir to have won their money gower rather starve i did your reason for playing poor lad the reason eludes reason not in you sight of the tables an itch to try themones self as well a notion that the losers were playing wrong in fine a bit of a whirl of a medley of atoms i cant explain it further ah the tipplers fumes in his head spotty business gower woodseer lead us not into temptation is worldly wisdom in addition to heavenly after listening to an extended homily with a general assent and tobaccos phlegm gower replied to his fathers you starved manfully nodding from baden to nancy an alsatian cottager at times helped me along milk and bread wholesome for body and for soul entering nancy i subscribed to the dictum of our first fathers which dogs would deliver if they could speak that there is no driver like stomach and i went head on to the college saw the principal plea of urgency no engagement possible to teach either french or english but he was inquisitive touching the urgency that was my chance the french are humane when they are not suspicious of you they are generous if you put a light to their minds as i was dealing with a scholarly one i made use of such ornamental literary skill as i possessed to prove urgency he supplied me with bread fruit and wine in the end he procured me pupils i lodged over a bakers shop i had food walks and learnt something of forestry therea taking study when i had saved enough to tramp it home i said my adieux to that good friend and tramped away entering london with about the same amount in small coin as when i entered nancy a manner of exactly hitting the mark that some would not find so satisfactory as it is to me the minister sighed there comes in the philosophy i suppose when will you understand that this philosophy is only the passive of a religious faith it seems to suit you gentlemen of the road while you are young work among the whitechapel poor it would be a way for discovering the shallows of your philosophy earlier gower asked him going badly here sir murders robberies misusage of women and misconduct of womendrink in short about the same amount drink is their deaths river rolling them on helpless as corpses on tomay they find mercy i and a few standits in the tide we stand here to stop them pluck them out make life a bit sweet to them before the poor bodies go beneath but come alls not dark we have our gleams i speak distressed by one of our girls a good girl i believe and the wilfullest that ever had command of her legs a wellfavoured girl youll laugh she has given her heart to a prizefighter well you can say she might have chosen worse he drinks she hates it she loves the man and hates his vice he swears amendment is hiccupping at night fights a match on the morrow and gets beaten out of formation no matter whenever wherever that man goes to his fight that girl follows to nurse him after it hes her hero women will have one and its their lottery you read of such things here we have it alive and walking i am led to think they re an honest couple they come of established families her mother was out of caermarthen died under my ministration saintly forgiving the drunkard you may remember the greengrocer tobias winch he passed away in shrieks for one drop i had to pitch my voice to the top notes to get hearing for the hymn he was a reverent man with the craving by fits that should have been a lesson to madge a little girl at the greengrocers hard by she sold me apples rather pretty said gower a fine grown girl nowmadge winch a comely wench she is it breaks her sister sarahs heart they both manage the little shop they make it prosper in a small way enough and what need they more then christopher ines has on one of his matches madge drives her cart out if it s near town shes off down into kent today by coach sarah tells me a great nobleman patronizes christopher a lord fleetwood a lord of wealth and he must be thoughtful for these people he sent sarah word that christopher should not touch drink you may remember a butcher ines in the street next to us christopher was a wild lad always at best man with every boy he met went to searan away he returned a pugilist the girl will be nursing him now i have spoken to her of him and i trust to her but i mourn her attachment to the man who drinks the lords name said gower lord fleetwood sarah named him and so it pleases him to spend his money he has other tastes i know something of him sir he promises to be a patron of literature as well his mother was a south wales woman could he be persuaded to publish a grand edition of the triads mr woodseer said at once no man more likely if you see him suggest it very little chance of my meeting him again but those triads theyre in our blood they spring to tie knots in the head they push me to condense my thoughts to a tight ball they were good for primitive times but theyor the trick of the mind engendered by themtrip my steps along the lines of composition i produce pellets instead of flowing sheets itll come right at present i m so bent to pick and perfect polish my phrase that i lose my survey as a consequence my vocabulary falters ah mr woodseer breathed and smote this literature is to be your profession for the means of living nothing else and im so low down in the market way of it that i could not count on twenty pounds per annum fifty would give me standing an independent fifty to whom are you crying gower not to gamble you may be sure you have a home good work of the head wants an easy conscience ive too much of you in me for a comfortable pensioner or is it not that you have been living the gentleman out there with just a holiday title to it gower was hit by his fathers thrust i shall feel myself a piemans chuckpenny as long as im unproductive now i ve come back and have to own to a home he said tea brought in by mrs mary jones rather brightened him until he considered that the enlivenment was due to a purchase by money of which he was incapable and he rejected it like an honourable man simultaneously the state of depression threw critic shades on a prized sentence or two among his recent confections it was rejected for the best of reasons and the most discomforting because it racked our english signifying that he had not yet learnt the right use of his weapons he was in this wrestle under a placid demeanour for several days hearing the shouts of whitechapel kits victory and hearing of sarah winchs anxiety on account of her sister madge unaffected by sounds of joy or grief in his effort to produce a supple english with badens madonna for sole illumination of his darkness to her to the illimitable goldmist of perspective and the innumerable images the thought of her painted for him he owed the lift which withdrew him from contemplation of himself in a very disturbing stagnant pool of the wastes wherein often will strenuous youth grown faint behold a face beneath a scroll inscribed impostor all whose aim was high have spied into that pool and have seen the face his glorious lady would not let it haunt him the spell she cast had likewise power to raise him clean out of a neighbourhood hinting erebus to the young man with thirst for air solitudes and colour scarce imaginable as she was she reigned here in the idea of her more fixedly than where she had been visible as it were by right of her being celestially removed from the dismal place he was at the same time not insensible to his fathers contented ministrations among these homes of squalor they pricked the curiosity which was in the youthful philosopher a form of admiration for his father like all welshmen loved the mountains yet here he lived exhorting ministering aiding supported up to high good cheer by some it seemed superhuman backbone of uprightnesshis religious faith well if so the thing might be studied but things of the frozen senses lean and hueless things were as repellent to gowers imagination as his fathers dishes to an epicure what he envied was the worthy old mans heart of feeling for others his feeling at present for the girl sarah winch and her sister madge who had not been heard of since she started for the fight mr woodseer had written to her relatives at the wells receiving no consolatory answer he was relieved at last and still a little perplexed madge had returned he informed gower she was well she was well in health he had her assurances that she was not excited about herself she has brought a lady with her a great lady to lodge with her she has brought the countess of fleetwood to lodge with her gower heard those words from his father and his father repeated them to the prostrate worshipper of the countess of fleetwood they were a blow on the head madness had set in here was his first recovering thought or else a miracle had come to pass or was it a sham countess of fleetwood imposing upon the girl his father was to go and see the great lady at the greengrocers shop at her request according to madge conjectures shot their perishing tracks across a darkness that deepened and made shipwreck of philosophy was it the very countess of fleetwood penitent for her dalliance with the gambling passion in feminine need of pastors aid having had report from madge of this good shepherd his father expressed a certain surprise his countenance was mild he considered it a merely strange occurrence perhaps in a crisis a minister of religion is better armed than a philosopher gower would not own that but he acknowledged the evidences and owned to envy especially when he accompanied his father to the greengrocers shop and mr woodseer undisturbedly said here is the place the small stuffed shop appeared to grow portentously cavernous and waveringly illumined chapter xix the girl madge customers were at the counter of the shop and these rational figures together with the piles of cabbages the sacks of potatoes the pale small oranges here and there the dominant smell of red herrings denied the lurking of an angelical presence behind them sarah winch and a boy served at the counter sarah led the mr woodseers into a corner knocked off the shop and called a room below the top bars of a wizened grate was a chilly fire londons light came piecemeal through a smutstreaked window if the wonderful was to occur this was the place to heighten it my son may be an intruder mr woodseer said he is acquainted with a lord fleetwood madge will know sir replied sarah and she sent up a shrill cry for madge from the foot of the stairs the girl ran down swiftly she entered listening to sarah looking at gower to whom after a bob and pained smile where reverence was owing she said can you tell me sir please where we can find lord fleetwood now gower was unable to tell madge turned to mr woodseer saying soon after oh she wont mind shell be glad if he knows lord fleetwood ill fetch her the moments were of the palpitating order for gower although his common sense lectured the wildest of hearts for expecting such a possibility as the presence of his lofty lady here and of course common sense proved to be right the lady was quite another but she struck on a sleeping day of his travels her face was not one to be forgotten and to judge by her tremble of a smile she remembered him instantly they were soon conversing each helping to paint the scene of the place where they had met lord fleetwood has married me she said gower bent his head all stood silent may i said madge to her it is lord fleetwoods wedded wife sir he drove her from her uncles on her wedding day the day of a prizefight where i was he told me to wait on his lady at an inn there as i ve done and will he drove away that evening and he hasntthe girls black eyebrows worked ive not seen him since hes a great nobleman yes he left his lady at the inn expenses paid he left her with no money she stayed on till her heart was breaking she has come to london to find him she had to walk part of the way she has only a change of linen we brought in a parcel shes a stranger to england she knows nobody in london she had no place to come to but this poor hole of ours she s so good as let welcome her we cant do better and it s no use to be ashamed she s not a lady to scorn poor people the girls voice hummed through gower he said lord fleetwood may not be in london and chafed at himself for such a quaver its his house we want sir he has not been at his house in kent we want his london house my dear lady said mr woodseer it might be as well to communicate the state of things to your family without delay my son will call at any address you name or if it is a country address i can write the items with my assurances of your safety under my charge in my house which i beg you to make your home my housekeeper is known to sarah and madge for an excellent christian woman carinthia replied you are kind to me sir i am grateful i have an uncle i would not disturb my uncle he is inventing guns and he wishes peace it is my husband i have come to find he did not leave me in anger she coloured with a dimple of tenderness at one cheek looking from sarah to madge she said i would not leave my friends they are sisters to me sarah at these words caught up her apron madge did no more than breathe deep and fast an unoccupied cold parlour in mr woodseers house that would be heated for a guest urged him to repeat his invitation but he took the check from gower who suggested the doubt of mary jones being so good an attendant upon lady fleetwood as madge and madge has to help in the shop at times madge nodded looked into the eyes of her mistress which sanctioned her saying she will like it best here she is my lady and i understand her best my lady gives no trouble she is hardy shes not like other ladies i and sarah sleep together in the room next i can hear anything she wants she takes us as if she was used to it sarah had to go to serve a customer madge made pretence of pricking her ears and followed into the shop your first visit to london is in ugly weather lady fleetwood said gower it is my first she answered how the marriage came about how the separation could not be asked and was not related our district is not all london my dear lady said mr woodseer good hearts are here as elsewhere and as many if one looks behind the dirt i have found it since i laboured amongst them now twenty years unwashed human nature though it is natural to us to wash is the most human we find gower questioned the naturalness of human natures desire to wash and they wrangled goodhumouredly carinthias eyes dwelling on them each in turn until mr woodseer pursuing the theme started by him to interest her spoke of consolations derived from his labours here in exchange for the loss of his mountains her face lightened you love the mountains i am a son of the mountains ah i love them father called me a daughter of the mountains i was born in the mountains i was leaving my mountains on the day i think it yesterday when i met this gentleman who is your son a glorious day it was gower exclaimed it was a day of great glory for me said carinthia your foot did not pain you for long the length of two pipes you were with your brother with my brother my brother has married a most beautiful lady he is now travelling his happy timemy chillon there came a radiance on her undereyelids there was no weeping struck by the contrast between the two simultaneous honeymoons and a vision of the highspirited mountain girl seen in this place a young bride seeking her husband gower woodseer could have performed that unphilosophical part he had to shake himself she seemed really a soaring bird brought down by the fowler lord fleetwoods manner of abandoning her was the mystery gower stood waiting for her initiative when the minister interposed there are books books of our titled peoplethe peers books of the peerage they would supply the address my son will discover where to examine them he will find the address most of the great noblemen have a london house my husband has a house in london carinthia said i know him to some degree said gower she remarked i have heard that you do her lips were shut as to any hint at his treatment of her gower went into the shop to speak with madge the girl was talking in the business tone to customers she finished her commission hurriedly and joined him on the pavement by the doorstep her voice was like the change for the swing of a door from street to temple youve seen how brave she is sir she has things to bear never cries never frets her marriage dayleastways i cant no girl can tell a great nobleman yes she waited believing in him she does she hasnt spoken to me of what shes had to bear i dont know i guess im sure im rightand him a man girls learn to know men call them gentlemen or sweeps she thinks she has only to meet him to persuade him she s fit to be loved by him she thinks of love would heour tongues are tied except among ourselves to a sister leaves her by herself with only me afterit knocks me dumb many a man commits a murder wouldnt do that she could force him tono it isnt a house she wants she wants him hes her husband mr woodseer you will do what you can to help i judge by your father i and sarah ll slave for her to be as comfortableas wecan make her we cant give her what she s used to i shall count the hours you sold me apples when your head was just above the counter said gower did iyou wont lose time sir she rejoined her box is down at the beastly inn in kent kind people i dare say their bill was paid any extent they said and he might do as he liked in itenter it like a thief if it pleased him and off like one and they no wiser she walked to his big house esslemont for news of him and im not a snivelling wench either but she speaks of him a way to make a girl drink her tears if they aint to be let fall but you had a victory down there gower hinted congratulations ah said she christopher ines is all right now ive as good as lost my good name for kit ines mr woodseer not with my dad madge the minister reads us at the heart shall we hear the street of his house in london before night i may be late ill be up any hour for a rap at the shutters i want to take her to the house early next morning she wont mind the distance she lies in bed her eyes shut or open never sleeping hears any mouse it shouldnt go on if we can do a thing to help im off said gower unwontedly vexed at his empty pocket that could not offer the means for conveyance to a couple of young women the darkbrowed girl sent her straight eyes at him they pushed him to hasten on second thoughts he stopped and hailed her he was moved to confirm an impression of this girls features his mind was directed to the business burning behind them honestly enough as soon as he had them in sight again i ought to have the address of some of her people in case he said she wont go to her uncle i m sure of that said madge he s a lord and cant be worried it s her husband to find first if hes to be foundhes a lord too has she no other relatives or friends she loves her brother hes an officer hes away on honeymoon there s an admiral down hampshire way a place ive been near and seen id not have you go to any of them sir without trying all we can do to find lord fleetwood its admiral fakenham she speaks of shes fond of him shes not minded to bother any of her friends about herself i shall see you tonight said gower and set his face westward remembering that his father had named caermarthen as her mothers birthplace just in that tone of hers do welshwomen talk of their country of its history when at home of its mountains when exiled and in a language like hers bare of superlatives to signify an ardour conveyed by the fire of the breath her quick devotion to a lady exciting enthusiasm through admiring pity for the grace of a muchtried quiet sweetness was explained apart from other reasons feminine or hidden which might exist only a welsh girl would be so quick and all in it with a voice intimating a heated cauldron under her mouth none but a welshblooded girl risking her good name to follow and nurse the man she considered a hero would carry her head to look virgin eyes as she did one could swear to them gower thought contact with her spirited him out of his mooniness he had the cymric and celtic respect of character which puts aside the persons environments to face the soul he was also an impressionable fellow among his fellows a philosopher only at his leisure in his courted solitudes getting away some strides from this girl of the drilling voicethe shuddervoice he phrased itthe lady for whom she pleaded came clearer into his view and gradually absorbed him though it was an emulation with the girl madge of which he was a trifle conscious that drove him to do his work of service in the directest manner he then fancied the girl had caught something of the tone of her lady the savage intensity or sincerity and he brooded on carinthias position the mixture of the astounding and the woful in her misadventure one could almost laugh at our human fate to think of a drop off the radiant mountain heights upon a whitechapel greengrocers shop gathering the title of countess midway but nothing of the ludicrous touched her no and if we bring reason to scan our laugh at pure humanity it is we who are in the place of the ridiculous for doing what reason disavows had he not named her carinthia saint and martyr from a first perusal of her face and lord fleetwood had read and repeated it lord fleetwood had become the instrument to martyrize her that might be there was a hoard of bad stuff in his composition besides the precious and this was a nobleman owning enormous wealth who could vitiate himself by disposing of a multitude of men and women to serve his will a shifty will wealth creates the magician and may breed the fiend within him in the hands of a young man wealth is an invitation to devilry gowers idea of the story of carinthia inclined to charge lord fleetwood with every possible false dealing he then quashed the charge and decided to wait for information at the second of the aristocratic clubs of londons west into which he stepped like an easy member the hallporter did not examine his clothing from german hat to boots and gave him lord fleetwoods town address he could tell madge at night by the door of the shuttered shop that lord fleetwood had gone down to wales it means her having to wait she said the minister has been to the coachoffice to order up her box from that inn he did it in his name they cant refuse no moneys owing she must have a change sally has fifteen pounds locked up in case of need sallys capacity and economy fetched the penniless philosopher a slap youve taken to this lady he said she held my hand while kit ines was at his work and i was new to her and a prizefighters lass they call meupon the top of that noblemans coach where he made me sit behind her to see the fight and she his wedded lady that morning a queer groom he may keep kit ines from drink hes one of you men and rides over anything in his way i cant speak about it i could swear it before a judge from what i know those rundles at that inn dont hear anything it suits him to do all the people down in those parts are slaves to him and i thought he was a real st george beforeyes ready i was to kiss the ground his feet crossed if you could its chinningfold near where admiral fakenham lives down hampshire way her friends ought to hear whats happened to her theyll find her in a queer place she might go to the ministers i believe shes happier with us girls gower pledged his word to start for chinningfold early as the light next day he liked the girl the better in an amicable fashion now that his nerves had got free of the transient spell of her kettle tonethe hardly varied one note of a heart boiling with sisterly devotion to a misused stranger of her sexand after the way of his race imagination sprang up in him at the heels of the quieted senses releasing him from the personal and physical to grasp the general situation and place the protagonist foremost he thought of carinthia with full vision of her some wrong had been done or some violation of the right to guess from the girl madges molten words in avoidance of the very words it impliedthough it might be but one of loves shrewder discordssuch suspected traitorous dealing of a man with their sister woman as makes the world of women all woman toward her they can be that and their being so illuminates their hidden sentiments in relation to the mastering male whom they uphold but our uninformed philosopher was merely picking up scraps of sheddings outside the dark wood of the mystery they were to him and playing imagination upon them this primary element of his nature soon enthroned his chosen lady above their tangled obscurities beneath her tranquil beams with the rapture of the knowledge that her name on earth was livia he threaded east londons thoroughfareson a morning when day and night were made one by fog to journey down to chinningfold by coach in the service of the younger countess of fleetwood whose right to the title he did not doubt though it directed surprise movements at his understanding from time to time chapter xx studies in fog gout an old seaman a lovely serpent and the moral effects that may come of a borrowed shirt money of his fathers enabled gower to take the coach and studies in fog from the specked brown to the woolly white and the dripping torn were proposed to the traveller whose preference of natures face did not arrest his observation of her domino and petticoats across which blank sheets he curiously read backward that he journeyed by the aid of his fathers hardearned ungrudged piece of gold without it he would have been useless in this case of need the philosopher could starve with equanimity and be the stronger but one had it seemed here clearly to put on harness and trudge along a line if the unhappy were to have ones help gradual experiences of his business among his fellows were teaching an exercised mind to learn in regions where minds unexercised were doctorial giants beside it the study of gout was offered at chinningfold admiral fakenhams butler refused at first to take a name to his master gower persisted stating the business of his mission and in spite of the very suspicious glib good english spoken by a man wearing such a hat and suit the butler was induced to consult mrs carthew she sprang up alarmed after having seen the young lady happily married and off with her lordly young husband the arrival of a messenger from the bride gave a stir the wrong way to her flowing recollections the scenes and incidents she had smothered under her love of the comfortable stood forth appallingly the messenger the butler said was no gentleman she inspected gower and heard him speak an anomaly had come to the house for he had the language of a gentleman the appearance of a nondescript he looked indifferent he spoke sympathetically and he was frank as soon as the butler was out of hearing in return for the compliment she invited him to her sittingroom the story of the young countess whom she had seen driven away by her husband from the church in a coach and four as being now destitute praying to see her friends in the whitechapel of londonthe noted haunt of thieves and outcasts bankrupts and the abandoned set her asking for the first time who was the man with dreadful countenance inside the coach a previously disregarded horror of a man she went trembling to the admiral though his health was delicate his temper excitable it was she considered an occasion for braving the doctors interdict gower was presently summoned to the chamber where admiral fakenham reclined on cushions in an edifice of an armchair he told a plain tale its effect was to straighten the admirals back and enlarge in grey glass a pair of seablue eyes and whats that whitechapel the admiral exclaimedat high pitch far above his understanding the particulars were repeated whereupon the sickroom shook with greengrocer he stunned himself with another of the monstrous points in his pet girls honeymoon a prizefight to refresh a saving incredulity he took a closer view of the messenger gowers habiliments were those of the queer fish the admiral saw but the meeting at carlsruhe was recalled to him and there was a worthy effort to remember it prizefightgreengrocer whitechapel he rang the changes rather more moderately till swelling and purpling he cried wheres the husband that was the emissarys question likewise if i could have found him sir i should not have troubled you disappeared plays the man of his word then plays the madman prizefight the first day of her honeymoon good lord leaves her at the inn she was left when was she left as soon as the fight was overas far as i understand the admiral showered briny masculine comments on that bridegroom her brothers travelling somewhere in the pyreneesmarried my daughter she has an uncle a hermit he became pale i must do it the rascal insults us all flings her off the day he married her it s a slap in the face to all of us you are acquainted with the lady sir would you call her a redhaired girl redgold of the ballads chestnutbrown with threads of fire she has the eyes for a man to swear by i feel the loss of her i can tell you she was wine and no penalty to me is she much broken under itif i m to credit i suppose i must it floors me admiral baldwins frosty stare returned on him gower caught an image of it as comparable without much straining to an arctic region smitten by the beams nothing breaks her courage he said to be sure my poor dear who could have guessed when she left my house she was on her way to a prizefight and a greengrocers in whitechapel but the dogs not mad though his bite s bad he s an eccentric mongrel he wants the whip ought to have had it regularly from his first breeching he shall whistle for her when he repents and he will mark me this gout here will be having a snap at the vitals if i dont start tonight oblige me half a minute the admiral stretched his hand for an arm to give support stood and dropped into the chair signifying a fit of giddiness in the word head before the stupor had passed mrs carthew entered anxious lest the admittance of a messenger of evil to her invalid should have been an error of judgement the butler had argued it with her she belonged to the list of persons appointed to cut lifes thread when it strains their general kindness being so liable to misdirection gower left the room and went into the garden he had never seen a death and the admirals peculiar pallor intimated events proper to days of cold mist and a dripping stillness how we go was the question among his problemsif we are to go his youthful frame insistingly added the fog down a wet laurelwalk contracted his mind with the chilling of his blood and he felt that he would have to see the thing if he was to believe in it of course he believed but life throbbed rebelliously and a picture of a desk near a lively firegrate books and pen and paper and a piece of writing to be approved of by the hesper of ladies held ground with a pathetic heroism against the inevitable he got his wits to the front by walking faster and then thought of the young countess and the friend she might be about to lose she could number her friends on her fingers admiral fakenhams exclamations of the name of the place where she now was conveyed an inky idea of the fall she had undergone counting her absent brother with himself his father and the two whitechapel girls it certainly was an unexampled fall to say of her that they and those two girls had become by the twist of circumstances the most serviceable of her friends her husband was the unriddled riddle we have in the wealthy young lordburning to possess and making tatters of all he grasped the moment it was his own glints of the devilish had shot from him at the gamingtablesfine haunts for the study of our lower man he could be magnificent in generosity he had little humaneness he coveted beauty in women hungrily and seemed to be born hostile to them or so gower judged by the light of the later evidence on unconsidered antecedent observations of him why marry her to cast her off instantly the crude philosopher asked it as helplessly as the admiral and further what did the girl madge mean by the drop of her voice to a hum of enforced endurance under injury like the furnace behind an iron door older men might have understood as he was aware he might have guessed only he had the habit of scattering meditation upon the game of hawk and fowl dame gossip boils her one idea of animation is to have her dramatis persona in violent motion always the biggest foremost and indeed that is the way to make them credible for the wind they raise and the succession of collisions the fault of the method is that they do not instruct so the breath is out of them before they are put aside for the uninstructive are the humanly deficient they remain with us like the tolerated old aristocracy which may not govern and is but socially seductive the deuteragonist or secondary person can at times tell us more of them than circumstances at furious heat will help them to reveal and the dame will have him only as an indexpost hence her endless ejaculations over the mystery of life the inscrutability of characterin a plain world in the midst of such readable people to preserve romance we exchange a sky for a ceiling if we let it go we must be inside the heads of our people as well as the hearts more than shaking the kaleidoscope of hurried spectacles in days of a growing activity of the head gower woodseer could not know that he was drawn on to fortune and the sight of his hesper by admiral fakenhams order that the visitor was to stay at his house until he should be able to quit his bed and journey with him to london doctor or no doctor the doctor would not hear of it the admiral threatened it every night for the morning every morning for the night and gower had to submit to postponements balefully affecting his linen remonstrance was not to be thought of for at a mere show of reluctance the courtly admiral flushed frowned and beat the bed where he lay a gouty volcano gowers one shirt was passing through the various complexions and had approached the nubian on its way to negro his natural candour checked the downward course he mentioned to mrs carthew with incidental gravity on a morning at breakfast that this article of his attire was beginning to resemble london snow she was amused she promised him a change more resembling country snow it will save me from buttoning so high up he said as he thanked her she then remembered the daily increase of stiffness in his figure and a reflection upon his patient waiting and simpleness and lexicographer speech to expose his minor needs touched her unused sense of humour on the side where it is tender in women from being motherly in consequence she spoke of him with a pleading warmth to the countess livia who had come down to see the admiral concerning an absurd but annoying rumour running over london gower was out for a walk he knew of the affair mrs carthew said for an introduction to her excuses of his clothing but i know the man said livia lord fleetwood picked him up somewhere and brought him to us clever why is he here he is here sent to the admiral as i understand my lady sent by whom having but a weak vocabulary to defend a delicate position mrs carthew stuttered into evasions after the way of illarmed persons and naming herself a stranger to the circumstances she feebly suggested that the admiral ought not to be disturbed before the doctors next visit mr woodseer had been allowed to sit by his bed yesterday only for ten minutes to divert him with his talk she protected in this wretched manner the poor gentleman she sacrificed and emitted such a smell of secresy that livia wrote three words on her card for it to be taken to admiral baldwin at once mrs carthew supplicated faintly she was unheeded the countess of fleetwood mounted the stairsto descend them with the knowledge of her being the dowager countess of fleetwood henrietta had spoken of the countess of fleetwoods hatred of the title of dowager but when lady fleetwood had the fact from the admiral would she forbear to excite him if she repudiated it she would provoke him to fire one of his broadsidesas they said in the family to assert its and that might exhaust him and there was peril in that and who was guilty mrs carthew confessed her guilt asking how it could have been avoided she made appeal to gower on his return transfixing him not only is he no philosopher who has an idol he has to learn that he cannot think rationally his due sense of weight and measure is lost the choice of his thoughts as well he was in the house with his devoutly simply worshipped pearl of women and his whole mind fell to work without ado upon the extravagant height of the admirals shirtcollar cutting his ears the very beating of his heart was perplexed to know whether it was for rapture or annoyance as a result he was but histrionically master of himself when the countess livia or the nimbus of the lady appeared in the room she received his bow she directed mrs carthew to have the doctor summoned immediately the remorseful woman flew admiral fakenham is very ill mr woodseer he has had distracting news oh no the messenger is not blamed you are lord fleetwoods friend and will not allow him to be prejudged he will be in town shortly i know him well you know him and could you hear him accused of crueltyand to a woman he is the soul of chivalry so in his way is the admiral if he were only more patient let us wait for lord fleetwoods version i am certain it will satisfy me the admiral wishes you to step up to him be very quiet you will be consent to everything i was unaware of his condition the things i heard were incredible i hope the doctor will not delay now go beg to retire soon livia spoke under her breath she had fears admiral baldwin lay in his bed submitting to a nursewomansign of extreme exhaustion he plucked strength from the sight of gower and bundled the woman out of the room muttering kill myself not half so quick as theyd do it i cant rest for that whitechapel of yours please fetch pen and paper its a letter the letter began dear lady arpington the dictation of it came in starts atone moment it seemed as if lifes ending shook the curtains on our stage and were about to lift an old friend in the reader of the letter would need no excuse for its jerky brevity it said that his pet girl miss kirby was married to the earl of fleetwood in the first week of last month and was now to be found at a shop no longways whitechapel that the writer was ill unable to stir that he would be in london within eightandforty hours at furthest he begged lady arpington to send down to the place and have the young countess fetched to her and keep her until he came admiral baldwin sat up to sign the letter yes and write miracles happen when the devils abroaddone it he said sinking back now seal youll find waxthe ring at my watchchain he sighed as it were the sound of his very last he lay like a sleeper twitched by a dream there had been a scene with livia the dictating of the letter took his remainder of strength out of him gower called in the nurse and went downstairs he wanted the address of lady arpingtons town house you have a letter for her said livia and held her hand for it in a way not to be withstood theres no superscription he remarked i will see to that mr woodseer i fancy i am bound lady fleetwood by no means she touched his arm you are lord fleetwoods friend a slight convulsion of the frame struck the admirals shirtcollar at his ears it virtually prostrated him under foot of a lady so benign in overlooking the spectacle he presented still he considered he had wits alive enough just to perceive a duty the letter was entrusted to me lady fleetwood you are afraid to entrust it to the post i was thinking of delivering it myself in town you will entrust it to me anything on earth of my own the treasure would be valued this you confide to my care it is important no indeed it is say that it is then it is quite safe with me it may be important that it should not be delivered are you not lord fleetwoods friend lady arpington is not so very very prominent in the list with you and me besides i dont think she has come to town yet she generally sees out the end of the hunting season leave the letter to me it shall go you with your keen observation missing nothing have seen that my uncle has not his whole judgement at present there are two sides to a case lord fleetwoods friend will know that it would be unfair to offer him up to his enemies while he is absent things going favourably here i drive back to town tomorrow and i hope you will accept a seat in my carriage he delivered his courtliest he was riding on cloud they talked of baden his honourable surrender of her defeated purse was a subject for gentle humour with her venturesome compliment with him he spoke well and though his hands were clean of sir meeson corbys reproach of them the caricature of presentable men blushed absurdly and seemed uneasy in his monstrous collar the touching of him again would not be required to set him pacing to her steps his hang of the head testified to the unerring stamp of a likeness captain abrane could affix with a stroke he looked the fiddler over his bow playing wonderfully to conceal the crack of a string the merit of being one of her army of admirers was accorded to him the letter to lady arpington was retained gower deferred the further mention of the letter until a visit to the admirals chamber should furnish an excuse and he had to wait for it admiral baldwins condition was becoming ominous he sent messages downstairs by the doctor forbidding his guests departure until they two could make the journey together next day the tortured and blissful young man stripped of his borrowed philosophers cloak hung conscienceridden in this delicious bower which was perceptibly an antechamber of the vaults offering him the study he thirsted for shrank from and mixed with his cup of amorous worship chapter xxi in which we have further glimpses of the wondrous mechanism of our younger man the report of admiral baldwin fakenham as having died in the arms of a stranger visiting the house hit nearer the mark than usual he yielded his last breath as gower woodseer was lowering him to his pillow shortly after a husky whisper of the letter to lady arpington and that was one of gowers crucial trials it condemned him for the pacifying of a dying man to the murmur and shuffle which was a lie and the lie burnt him contributed to the brand on his race he and his father upheld a solitary bare staff where the cambrian flag had flown before their people had been trampled in mire to do as the worms his loathing of any shadow of the lie was a protest on behalf of welsh blood against an english charge besides the passion for spiritual cleanliness without which was no comprehension therefore no enjoyment of nature possible to him for nature is the truth he begged the countess to let him have the letter he held to the petition with supplications he spoke of his pledged word his honour and her countenance did not deny to such an object as she beheld the right to a sense of honour we all have the sentiment i hope mr woodseer she said stupefying the worshipper who did not see it manifested there was a look of gentle intimacy expressive of common grounds between them accompanying the dead words mistress of the letter and the letter safe under lock the admiral dead she had not to bestow a touch of her hand on his coatsleeve in declining to return it a face languidly and benevolently querulous was bent on him when he so clever a man resumed his very silly petition she was moon out of cloud at a change of the theme gower journeyed to london without the letter intoxicated and conscious of poison enamoured of it and straining for health he had to reflect at the journeys end that he had picked up nothing on the road neither a thing observed nor a thing imagined he was a troubled pool instead of a flowing river the best help to health for him was a day in his fathers house we are perpetually at our comparisons of ourselves with others and they are mostly profitless but the man carrying his religious light to light the darkest ways of his fellows and keeping good cheer as though the heart of him ran a mountain water through the grimy region plucked at gower with an envy to resemble him in practice his philosophy too reproached him for being outshone apart from his philosophy he stood confessed a bankrupt and it had dwindled to near extinction adoration of a woman takes the breath out of philosophy and if one had only to say sheer donkey he consenting to be driven by her one has to say worse in this case for the words are liar and traitor carinthias attitude toward his father conduced to his emulous respect for the old man below whom and indeed below the roadway of ordinary principles hedged with dull texts he had strangely fallen the sight of her lashed him she made it her business or it was her pleasure to go the rounds beside mr woodseer visiting his poor people she spoke of the scenes she witnessed and threw no stress on the wretchedness having only the wish to assist in ministering probably the great wretchedness bubbling over the place blunted her feeling of loss at the word of admiral baldwins end her bosom sprang up he was next to father was all she said and she soon reverted to this and that house of the lodgings of poverty she had descended on the world there was of course a world outside whitechapel but whitechapel was hot about her the nests of misery the sharp note of want in the air tricks of an urchin who had amused her as to the place itself she had no judgement to pronounce except that they have no mornings here and the childish remark set her quivering on her heights like one seen through a tear in gowers memory scarce anything of her hungry impatience to meet her husband was visible she had come to london to meet him she hoped to meet him soon before her brothers return she could have added she mentioned the goodness of sarah winch in not allowing that she was a burden to support money and its uses had impressed her the quantity possessed by some the utter need of it for the first of human purposes by others her speech was not of so halting or foreign an english she grew rapidly wherever she was planted speculation on the conduct of her husband empty as it might be was necessitated in gower he pursued it and listened to his father similarly at work a young lady fit for any station the kindest of souls a born charitable human creature void of pride near in all shedoes and thinks to the shaping hand why should her husband forsake her on the day of their nuptials she is most gracious the simplicity of an infant can you imagine the doing of an injury by a man to a woman like her then it was that gower screwed himself to say yes i can imagine it im doing it myself i shall be doing it till ive written a letter and paid a visit he took a meditative stride or two in the room thinking without revulsion of the countess livia under a similitude of the bell of the plant henbane and that his father had immunity from temptation because of the insensibility to beauty out of which he passed to the writing of the letter to lord fleetwood informing his lordship that he intended immediately to deliver a message to the marchioness of arpington from admiral baldwin fakenham in relation to the countess of fleetwood a duty was easily done by gower when he had surmounted the task of conceiving his resolution to do it and this task involving an offence to the lady livia and intrusion of his name on a noblemans recollection ranked next in severity to the chopping off of his fingers by a man suspecting them of the bite of rabies an interview with lady arpington was granted him the following day she was a florid aquiline loudvoiced lady evidently having no seat for her wonderments after his account of the origin of his acquaintance with the admiral had quieted her suspicions the world had only to stand beside her and it would hear what she had heard she rushed to the conclusion that lord fleetwood had married a person of no family really really that young mans freaks appear designed for the express purpose of heightening our amazement she exclaimed he wont easily get beyond a wife in the east of london at a shop but theres no knowing any wish of admiral baldwin fakenhams i hold sacred at least i can see for myself you cant tell me more of the facts if lord fleetwoods in town i will call him here at once i will drive down to this address you give me she is a civil person her breeding is perfect said gower perfect breeding you say lady arpington was reduced to a murmur she considered the speaker his outlandish garb his unprotesting selfpossession he spoke good english by habit her ear told her she was of an eminence to judge of a man impartially even to the sufferance of an opinion from him on a subject that lesser ladies would have denied to his clothing outwardly simple naturally frank though a tangle of the complexities inwardly he was a touchstone for true aristocracy as the humblest who bear the main elements of it must be certain humorous turns in his conversation won him an amicable smile when he bowed to leave they were the needed finish of a favourable impression one day later the earl arrived in town read gower woodseers brief words and received the consequently expected summons couched in a great ladys plain imperative she was connected with his family on the paternal side he went obediently not unwillingly let the deputed historian of the marriage turning over documents here say he went to lady arpington disposed for marital humaneness and jogtrot harmony by condescension equivalent to a submitting to the drone of an incessant psalm at the drum of the ear he was in fact rather more than inclined that way when very young at the age of thirteen a mood of religious fervour had spiritualized the dulness of protestant pew and pulpit for him another fit of it in the roman catholic direction had proposed during his latest dilemma to relieve him of the burden of his pledged word he had plunged for a short space into the rapturous contemplation of a monastic lifethe clean soul for the macerated flesh as that fellow woodseer said once and such as his friend the roman catholic lord feltre moodily talked of getting in his intervals he had gone down to a young and novel trial establishment of english penitents in the forest of a midland county and had watched and envied and seen the escape from a lifelong bondage to the beautiful gorgon under cover of a white flannel frock the world pulled hard and he gave his body into chains of a woman to redeem his word but there was a plea on behalf of this woman the life she offered might have psalmic iteration the dead monotony of it in prospect did nevertheless exorcise a devil carinthia promised it might seem to chase and keep the black beast out of him permanently as she could he now conceived for since the day of the marriage with her the devil inhabiting him had at least been easier up in a corner he held an individual memory of his bride roseveiled secret to them both that made them one by subduing him for it was a charm an actual feminine an unanticipated personal charm past reach of tongue to name wordless in thought there among the folds of the incense vapours of our hearts holy of holies it hung and it was rare it was distinctive of her and alluring if one consented to melt to it and accepted for compensation the exorcising of a devil oh but no mere devil by titlea very devil it was alert and frisky flushing filling the thin cold idea of henrietta at a thought and in the thought it made carinthias intimate charm appear as no better than a thing to enrich a beggar while he knew that kings could never command the charm not love only the bathing in henriettas incomparable beauty and the desire to be desire to have been the casket of it broke the world to tempest and lightnings at a view of henrietta the married womanmarried to the brother of the woman calling him husbandit is my husband the young tyrant of wealth could have avowed that he did not love henrietta but not the less was he in the swing of a whirlwind at the hint of her loving the man she had married did she it might be tried she that henrietta is one of the creatures who love pleasure love flattery love their beauty they cannot love a man or the love is a ship that will not sail a sea now if the fact were declared and attested if her shallowness were seen proved one might get free of the devil she plants in the breast absolutely to despise her would be release and it would allow of his tasting carinthias charm reluctantly acknowledged not money of the country beside that golden henriettas yet who can saywomen are such deceptions often their fairest apparently sweetest when brought to the keenest of the tests are graceless or worse artificially consonant in either instance barren of the poetic thousands of the confidently expectant among men have been unbewitched a lamentable process and the grimly reticent and the loudly discursive are equally eloquent of the pretty general disillusion how they loathe and tear the mask of the sham attraction that snatched them to the hag yoke and fell away to show its grisly horrors within the round of the month if not the second enumeration of twelve by the clock fleetwood had heard certain candid seniors talk delivering their minds in superior appreciation of unpretentious boor wenches natures products not esteemed by him well of a truth shered hair and rugged brows as the fellow woodseer had called her in alternation with mountain face to sunshe at the unveiling was gentle surpassingly graceful in the furnace of the trial she wore through the critic ordeal his burning sensitiveness to grace and delicacy cast about a woman and was rather better than not withered by it on the borders between maidenly and wifely she a thing of flesh like other daughters of earth had impressed her sceptical lord inclining to contempt of her and detestation of his bargain as a flitting hue ethereal a transfiguration of earthliness in the core of the earthly furnace and howbut that it must have been the naked shining forth of her character startled to show itselfit is my husbandit must have been love the love that they versify and strum on guitars and go crazy over and end by roaring at as the delusion this common bloom of the ripeness of a season this would never have utterly captured a sceptic to vanquish him in his mastery snare him in her surrender it must have been the veritable passion a flame kept alive by vestal ministrants in the yewwood of the forest of old romance planted only in the breasts of very favourite maidens love had eyes love had a voice that nightlove was the explicable magic lifting terrestrial to seraphic though true she had not henriettas golden smoothness of beauty henrietta illumined with such a love would outdo all legends all dreams of the tale of love would she for credulous men she would be golden coin of the currency she would not have a particular wild flavour charm as of the running doe that has taken a dart and rolls an eye to burst the hunters heart with pity fleetwood went his way to lady arpington almost complacently having fought and laid his wilder self he might be likened to the doctors patient entering the chemists shop with a prescription for a drug of healing virtue upon which the palate is as little consulted as a robustious lollypop boy in the household of ceremonial parents who have rung for the troop of their orderly domestics to sit in a row and hearken the intonation of good words chapter xxii a rightminded great lady the bow the welcome and the introductory remarks passed rapidly as the pull at two sides of a curtain opening on a scene that stiffens courtliness to hard attention after the names of admiral baldwin and the mr woodseer the name of whitechapel was mentioned by lady arpington it might have been the name of any other place ah so far then i have to instruct you she said observing the young earl i drove down there yesterday i saw the lady calling herself countess of fleetwood by right she was a miss kirby she has the right fleetwood said standing well up out of a discharge of musketry marriage not contested you knew of her being in that placei cant describe it your ladyship will pardon me londons frontier of barbarism was named for him again and in a tone to penetrate he refrained from putting the question of how she had come there as iron as he looked he said she stays there by choice the great lady tapped her foot on the floor you are not acquainted with the district one of my men comes out of it the coming out of it however i understand her story that she travelled from a village inn where she had been leftwithout resources she waited weeks i forget how many she has a description of maid in attendance on her she came to london to find her husband you were at the mines we heard her one desire is to meet her husband but goodness fleetwood why do you frown you acknowledge the marriage she has the name of the church she was married out of that old lord levelliers house you drove heri wont repeat the flighty business you left her and she did her best to follow you will the young men of our time not learn that life is no longer a game when they have a woman for partner in the match you dont complain of her flavour of a foreign manner she cant be so very admiral baldwins daughter has married her brother and he is a military officer she has germs of breeding wants only a little rub of the world to smooth her speak to the pointdo you meet her here do you refuse at present i do something has to be done she was bound to stay where i left her you are bound to provide for her becomingly provision shall be made of course the story will unlessand quickly too i know i know fleetwood had the clang of all the bells of london chiming whitechapel at him in his head and he betrayed the irritated tyrant ready to decree fire and sword for the defence or solace of his tender sensibilities the black flash flew it s a thing to mend as well as one can lady arpington said i am not inquisitive you had your reasons or chose to act without any get her away from that place she wont come to me unless it s to meet her husband ah well temper does not solve your problem husband you are if you married her well leave the husband undiscussed with this reserve that it seems to me men are now beginning to play the misunderstood i hope they know themselves better said fleetwood and he begged for the name and number of the house in the whitechapel street where she who was discernibly his enemy and the deadliest of enemies had now her dwelling her immediate rush to that place the fixing of herself there for an assault on him was a move worthy the daughter of the rascal old buccaneer it compelled to urgent measures he as he felt horribly in pencilling her address acted under compulsion and a woman prodded the goad her mask of ingenuousness was flung away for a look of craft which could be power and with her changed aspect his tolerance changed to hatred a shop lady arpington explained for his better direction potatoes vegetable stuff honest people i am to believe she is indifferent to her food she says she works helping one of their ministersone of their denominations heaven knows what they call themselves anything to escape from the church shes likely to become a methodist with lord feltre proselytizing for his papist creed lord pitscrew a declared mohammedan we shall have a pretty english aristocracy in time well she may claim to belong to it now she would not be persuaded against visitations to pestiferous hovels what else is there to do in such a place she goes about catching diseases to avoid bilious melancholy in the dark back room of a small greengrocers shop in whitechapel thereyou have the word for the countess of fleetwoods present address it drenched him with ridicule i am indebted to your ladyship for the information he said and maintained his rigidity the great lady stiffened i am obliged to ask you whether you intend to act on it at once the admiral has gone i am in some sort deputed as a guardian to her and i warn youvery well very well in your own interests it will be if she is left there another two or three days the name of the place will stick to her she has baptized herself with it already i imagine said fleetwood she will have esslemont to live in there will be more than one to speak as to that you should know her i do not know her you married her the circumstances are admitted if i may hazard a guess she is unlikely to come to terms without a previous interview she is bent on meeting you i am to be subjected to further annoyance or she will take the name of the place she at present inhabits and bombard me with it those are the terms she has a brother living i remind you state the deduction if you please my lady she is not of a totally inferior family she had a father famous over england as the old buccaneer and is a diligent reader of his book of maxims for men dear me then kirbycaptain kirby i remember thats her origin is it the great lady cried illumined my mother used to talk of the cressett scandal old lady arpington too at any rate it ended in their unionthe formalities were properly respected as soon as they could be i am unaware i detest such a tone of speaking speaking as you do nowmarried to the daughter you are not yourself lord fleetwood quite maam let me assure you otherwise the kirbycressetts would be dictating to me from the muzzle of one of the old rapscallions maxims they will learn that i am myself you dont improve as you proceed i tell you this youll not have me for a friend you have your troops of satellites but take it as equal to a prophecy you wont have london with you and youll hear of lord fleetwood and his whitechapel countess till your ears ache the preluding box on them reddened him she will have the offer of esslemont undertake to persuade her in person i have spoken on that head well i may be mistakeni fancied it before i knew of the pair she springs from you wont get her consent to anything without your consenting to meet her surely its the manlier way it might be settled for tomorrow here in this room she prays to meet you with an indicated gesture of save me from it fleetwood bowed he left no friend thinking over the riddle of his conduct she was a loudvoiced lady given to strike out phrases the whitechapel countess of the wealthiest nobleman of his day was heard by her on londons wagging tongue she considered also that he ought at least have propitiated her he was in the position requiring of him to do something of the kind and he had shown instead the dogged pride which calls for a whip fool as he must have been to go and commit himself to marriage with a girl of whom he knew nothing or little the assumption of pride belonged to the order of impudent disguises intolerable to behold and not in a modern manner castigate notwithstanding a dislike of the dowager countess of fleetwood lady arpington paid livia an afternoon visit and added thereby to the stock of her knowledge and the grounds of her disapprobation down in whitechapel it was known to the winch girls and the woodseers that captain kirby and his wife had spent the bitterest of hours in vainly striving to break their immoveable sisters will to remain there at the teatime of simple people who make it a meal gowers appetite for the homemade bread of mary jones was checked by the bearer of a short note from lord fleetwood the halfdozen lines were cordial breathing of their walk in the austrian highlands and naming a renowned city hotel for dinner that day the hour seven the reply yes or no by messenger but we are man to man so theres no no between us two the note said reviving a scene of rosy crag and pine forest where there had been philosophical fun over the appropriate sexes of those our most important fightingultimately we will hope to be unitedsyllables and the when for men the when for women to select the one of them as their weapon under the circumstances gower thought such a piece of writing to him magnanimous it may be the solution his father remarked both had the desire and gowers reply was the yes our brave male word supposed to be not so compromising to men in the employment of it as a form of acquiescence rather than insistent pressure chapter xxiii in dame gossips vein right soon the london pot began to bubble there was a marriage there are marriages by the thousand every day of the year that is not consecrated to prayer for the forgiveness of our sins the old buccaneer writing it with simple intent says by way of preface to a series of maxims for men who contemplate acceptance of the yoke this was a marriage high as the firmament over common occurrences black as erebus to confound it involved the wreck of expectations disastrous eclipse of a sovereign luminary in the splendour of his rise phaethons descent to the shades through a smoking and a crackling world asserted here verified there the rumour gathered volume and from a serpent of vapour resolved to sturdy concrete before it was tangible contradiction retired into corners only to be swept out of them for this marriage abominable to hear of was of so wonderful a sort that the story filled the mind and the discrediting of the story threatened the great worlds cranium with a vacuity yet more monstrously abominable for he the planet croesus of his time recently scarce later than last night a glorious object of the midheavens above the market has been enveloped caught gobbled up by one of the nameless little witches riding after dusk the way of the wind on broomsticksby one of them she caught him like a fly in the hand off a pane of glass gobbled him with the customary facility of a pecking pullet but was the planet croesus of his time a young man to be so caught so gobbled there is the mystery of it on his coming of age that young man gave sign of his having a city head he put his guardians deliberately aside had his lawyers and bailiffs and stewards thoroughly under control managed a particularly difficult stepmother escaped the snares of her lovely cousin and drove his team of sycophants exactly the road he chose to go and no other he had a will the world accounted him wildish always from his own offset to his own ends never for anothers dictation or beguilement never for a woman he was born with a suspicion of the sex poetry decorated women he said to lime and drag men in the foulest ruts of prose we are to believe he has been effectively captured it is positively a marriage he admits it where celebrated there we are at hoodmanblind for the moment three counties claim the church two ends of london she is not a person of society lineage nor of beauty she is a witch ordinarily petticoated and not squeaking like a shrewmouse in her flights but not a whit less a moonshade witch the kind is famous fairy tales and terrible romances tell of her she is just as much at home in life and springs usually from the mire to enthral our knightliest is it a popular hero she has him sooner or later a planet croesus he falls to her that is if his people fail to attach him in legal bonds to a damsel of a corresponding birth on the day when he is breeched small is her need to be youngespecially if it is the man who is very young she is the created among women armed with the deadly instinct for the motive force in men and shameless to attract it selfrespecting women treat men as their tamed housemates she blows the horn of the wild old forest irresistible to the animal o the droop of the eyelids the curve of a lip the rustle of silks the much heart the neat ankle and the sparkling agreement the reservethe motherly feminine petition that she may retain her own small petted babe of an opinion legitimate or not by permission of superior authorityproof at once of her intelligence and her appreciativeness her infinitesimal spells are seen yet despite experience the magnetism in their repulsive display is barely apprehended by sedate observers until the astounding capture is proclaimed it is visible enough thenand o men o morals if she can but trick the smallest bit in stooping she has the pick of men our present sample shows her to be young she is young and a foreigner mr chumley potts vouches for it speaks foreign english he thinks her more ninny than knave she is the tool of a wily plotter picked up off the highway road by lord fleetwood as soon as he had her in his eye sir meeson corby wrings his frilled hands to depict the horror of the hands of that tramp the young lord had her from they afflict him malariously still the man he says the man as well was an infatuation because he talks like a dictionary cheap jack and may have had an education and dropped into vagrancy owing to indiscretions lord fleetwood ran about in germany repeating his remarks but the man is really an accomplished violinist we hear she dances the tambourine business a sister of the man perhaps if we must be charitable they are some say a couple of hungarian gypsies lord f found at a show and brought over to england and soon had it on his conscience that he ought to marry her like the quixote of honour that he is which is equal to saying crazy as there is no doubt his mother was the marriage is no longer disputable poor lady fleetwood whatever her faults as a stepmother does no longer deny the celebration of a marriage though she might reasonably discredit any such story if he on the evening of the date of the wedding day was at a ball seen by her at the suppertable though it is admitted he left the ballroom at night but the next day he certainly was in his place among the peers and voted against the government and then went down to his estates in wales being an excellent holder of the reins whether on the coach box or over the cash box more and more wonderful we hear that he drove his bride straight from the church to the field of a prizefight arranged for her special delectation she doats on seeing bloodshed and drinking champagne young mr mallard is our authority and he says she enjoyed it and cheered the victor for being her husbands man and after the shocking exhibition goodbye the countess of fleetwood was left sole occupant of a wayside inn and may have learnt in her solitude that she would have been wise to feign disgust for men to the smallest degree cultivated are unable to pardon a want of delicacy in a woman who has chosen them as they are taught to think by their having chosen her so talked so twittered piped and croaked the london world over the early rumours of the marriage this amazing marriage which it got to be called from the number of items flocking to swell the wonder ravens ravening by night poised peregrines by

period avenged and scourged both innocence and naughtiness innocence on the whole the least when their withering suspicion of it had hunted the unhappy thing to the bank of ophelias ditch mallard and chumley potts captain abrane sir meeson corby lord brailstone were plucked at and rattled put to the blush by a pursuit of inquiries conducted with beaks highnosed dames will surpass eminent judges in their temerity on the borderline where ahem sounds the warning note to curtained decency the courtly m de st ombre had to stand confused he however gave another version of captain abranes fiddler and precipitated the great ladies into the reflection that french gentlemen since the execrable french revolution have lost their proper sense of the distinctions of class homme desprit applied to a roving adventurer a scarce other than vagabond was either an undiscriminating epithet or else a further example of the french deficiency in humour dexterous contriver he undoubtedly is lady cowry has it from sir meeson corby who had it from the poor dowager that lord fleetwood has installed the man in his house and sits at the opposite end of his table fished him up from whitechapel where the countess is left serving oranges at a small fruitshop with her own eyes lady arpington saw her there and she cant be got to leave the place unless her husband drives his coach down to fetch her that he declines to do so she remains the whitechapel countess all on her hind heels against the offer of a shilling of her husbands money if she s not to bring him to his knees and goes about at night with a low methodist singing hymns along those dreadful streets while lord fleetwood gives gorgeous entertainments one signal from the man he has hired and he stops drinkinghe will stop speaking as soon as the mans mouth is open he is under a complete fascination attributable some say to passes of the hands which the man wont wash lest he should weaken their influence for it cannot be simply his violin playing they say he was a pupil of a master of the dark art in germany and can practise on us to make us think his commonest utterances extraordinarily acute and precious lord fleetwood runs round quoting him to everybody quite ridiculously but the mans influence is sufficient to induce his patron to drive down and fetch the whitechapel countess home in state as she insistsif the man wishes it depend upon it he is the key of the mystery totally the contrary lady arpington declares the man is a learned man formerly a professor of english literature in a german university and no connection of the whitechapel countess whatever a chance acquaintance at the most he operates on lord fleetwood with doses of german philosophy otherwise a harmless creature and has consented to wash and dress it is my lord who has had the chief influence and the countess livia now backs him in maintaining that there is nowhere a more honest young man to be found she may have her reasons as for the whitechapel countess the whole story of the old buccaneer and countess fanny was retold and it formed a terrific halo presage of rains and hurricane tempest over the girl the young earl had incomprehensibly espoused to discard those two had a son and a daughter born aboardin wedlock we trust the girl may be as wild a one as the mother she has a will as determined as her husbands she is offered esslemont the earls kentish mansion for a residence and she will none of it until she has him down in the east of london on his knees to entreat her the injury was deep on one side or the other it may be almost surely prophesied that the two will never come together will either of them deal the stroke for freedom and which is the likelier meanwhile lord fleetwood and his whitechapel countess composed the laugh of london straightway invention the violent propagator sprang from his shades at a call of the great worlds appetite for more and rushing upon stationary fact supplied the required marvel upon marvel was recounted the mixed origin of the singular issue could not be examined where all was increasingly funny always the shout for more produced it she and her band of whitechapel boys were about in ambush to waylay the earl wherever he went she stood knocking at his door through a whole night he dared not lug her before a magistrate for fear of exposure once riding in the park with a troop of friends he had a young woman pointed out to him and her finger was levelled and she cried there is the english nobleman who marries a girl and leaves her to go selling cabbages he left town for the island and beheld his yacht sailing the solentmy lady the countess was on board a pair of tyrolese minstrels in the square kindled his enthusiasm at one of his dinners he sent them a sovereign their humble hearty thanks were returned to him in the name of die grafin von fleetwood the ladies endor eldritch and cowry sifted their best they let pass incredible stories among others that she had sent cards to the nobility and gentry of the west end of london offering to deliver sacks of potatoes by newlyestablished donkeycart at the doors of their residences at so much per sack bills quarterly with the postscript vive laristocratie their informant had seen a card and the stamp of the fleetwood dragoncrest was on it he has enemies was variously said of the persecuted nobleman but it was nothing worse than the parasite that he had this was the parasites gentle treason he found it an easy road to humour it pricked the slug fancy in him to stir and curl gave him occasion to bundle and bustle his patron kindly abrane potts mallard and sir meeson corby were personages during the towns excitement besought for having something to say petrels of the sea of tattle they were buoyed by the hubbub they created and felt the tipsy happiness of being certain to rouse the laugh wherever they alighted sir meeson corby important to himself in an eminent degree enjoyed the novel sense of his importance with his fellows they crowded round the bore who had scattered them he traced the miserable catastrophe in the earls fortunes to the cunning of the rascal now sponging on fleetwood and trying to dress like a gentleman a convicted tramp elevated by the caprice of the young nobleman he was plotting to ruin sir meeson quoted captain abranes latest effort to hit the dirty objects name by calling him fleetwoods mr woodlouse and was the rascal a sorcerer sir meeson spoke of him in the hearing of the countess livia and she previously echoing his disgust corrected him sharply and said i begin to be of russetts opinion that his fault is his honesty the rascal had won or partly won the empress of her sex this lady livia haughtiest and most fastidious of our younger great dames had become the indulgent critic of the tramps borrowed plumes nay she would not listen to a depreciatory word on him from her cousin henrietta kirbylevellier perhaps after all of all places for an encounter between the earl of fleetwood and the countess those vulgar gardens across the water long since abandoned by the fashion were the most suitable thither one fair june night for the sake of showing the dowager countess and her beautiful cousin the french nobleman sir meeson corby and others what were the pleasures of the london lower orders my lord had the whim to conduct themmerely a parade of observation once roundthe ladies veiled the gentlemen with sticks and two servants following one of whom dressed in quiet black like the peacefullest of parsons was my lords pugilist christopher ives now here we come to history though you will remember what history is the party walked round the gardens unmolested nor have we grounds for supposing they assumed airs of state in the style of a previous generation only as it happened a gentleman of the party was a wag no less than the famous wellseasoned john rose mackrell bent on amusing mrs kirbylevellier to hear her lovely laughter and his wit and his anecdotes both inexhaustible proved as he said that a dried fish is no stale fish and a smoky flavour to an old chimney story will often render it more piquant to the taste than one jumping fresh off the incident his exact meaning in smoky flavour we are not to know but whether that m de st ombre should witness the effect of english humour upon them or that the ladies could permit themselves to laugh their voices accompanied the gentlemen in silvery volleys there had been mackrell at fleetwoods dinnertable which was then a way of saying that dry throats made no count of the quantity of champagne imbibed owing to the fits rose mackrell caused however there was loud laughter as they strolled and it was noticed and fleetwood crying out mackrell mackrell in delighted repudiation of the wags last sally the cry of hooray mackrell was caught up by the crowd they were not the primary offenders for loud laughter in an isolated party is bad breeding but they had not the plea of a copious dinner so this affair began inoffensively at the start for my lord was goodhumoured about it kit ines of the mercurial legs must now give impromptu display of his dancing he seized a partner in the manner of a roman the sabine sure of pleasing his patron and the maid passing from surprise to merriment entered the quadrille perforce all giggles not without emulation for she likewise had the passion for the dance whereby it befell that the pair footed in a way to gather observant spectators and if it had not been that the man from whom the maid was willynilly snatched conceived resentment things might have passed comfortably for kits quips and cuts and high capers and the sunday gravity of the barge face while the legs were at their impish trickery double motion to the music won the crowd to cheer they conjectured him to be a british sailor but the destituted man said sailor or no sailorbosen be hanged he should pay for his whistle honourably at the close of the quadrille kit brought her back none the worse for it he boldly affirmed and he thanked the man for the short loan of herthe man had an itch to strike choosing rather to be struck first he vented nasty remarks my lord spoke to kit and moved on at the moment of the step rose mackrell uttered something a waggery of some sort heard to be forgotten but of such instantaneous effect that the prompt and immoderate laugh succeeding it might reasonably be taken for a fling of scorn at himself by an injured man they were a party he therefore proceeded to make one appealing to english sentiment and right feeling the blameless and repentant maid plucked at his coat to keep him from dogging the heels of the gentlemen fun was promised consequently the crowd waxed my lord had been let fall by kit ines conjoined to mackrell it rang finely and a trumpeting of lord mackrell resounded lord mackrell was asked for more capers and not so much sauce various fish took part in his title of nobility the wag mackrell continuing to be discreetly silent and kit ines acting as a pacific rearguard the crowd fell in love with their display of english humour disposed to the surly satisfaction of a big street dog that has been appeased by a smaller ones total cessation of growls all might have gone well but for the sudden appearance of two figures of young women on the scene they fronted the advance of the procession they wanted to have a word with lord mackrell not a bit of ithe wont listen turns away and one of the pair slips round him its regular imploring my lord my lord o you naughty surrey melodram villain of a lord mackrell listen to the young woman you mackrell or youll get billingsgate heres mr jigandreel behind here says shes done him by gosh whats up now one of the young ladies of the party ahead had rushed up to the young woman dodging to stand in lord mackrells way the crowd pressed to see kit ines and his mate shouldered them off they performed an envelopment of the gentlemen and ladies including the two young women kit left his mate and ran to the young woman hitherto the quieter of the two he rattled at her but she had a tongue of her own and rattled it at him what did she say merely to hear for no other reason a peaceloving crowd of clerks and tradesmen workmen and their girls young aspirants to the professions nightlarks of different classes both sexes there in that place for simple entertainment animated simply by the spirit of english humour contracted so closing upon the mackrell party as to seem threatening to the most orderly and apprehensive member of it who was the baronet sir meeson corby he was a man for the constables in town emergencies and he shouted cock robin crowing provoked a jolly round of barking chaff the noise in a dense ring drew fleetwoods temper he gave the word to kit ines and immediately two men dropped a dozen staggered unhit the fists worked right and left such a clearing of ground was never seen for sickle or scythe and it was taken respectfully for science proclaimed her venerable self in the style and the perfect sufficiency of the strokes a bruiser delivered them no shame to back away before a bruiser there was rather an admiring envy of the party claiming the nimble champion on their side until the very moderate lot of the mackrells went stepping forward along the strewn path with sticks pointed if they had walked it like gentlemen they would have been allowed to get through an aggressive minority and with cock robin squealing for constables in the midst is that insolent upstart thing which howls to have a lesson the sticks were fallen on bump came the mass kit ines had to fight his way back to his mate and the couple scoured a clearish ring but the gentlemen were at short thrusts affable in tone to cheer the spirits of the ladiesall right my friend youre a trifle mistaken it s my stick not yours therewith the wrestle for the stick the one stick not pointed was wrenched from the grasp of sir meeson corby and by a woman the young woman who had accosted my lord not a common young woman either as she appeared when beseeching him her stature rose to battle heights she made play with sir meeson corbys ebony stick using it in one hand as a dwarf quarterstaff to flail the sconces then to dash the point at faces and she being a woman a girl perhaps a lady her cool warrior method of cleaving way without so much as tightening her lips was found notable and to this degree vouched for by rose mackrell who heard it that a fellow rubbing his head cried damn it all shes clever though she took her station beside lord fleetwood he had been as cool as she or almost now he was maddened she defended him she warded and thrust for him only for him to save him a touch unasked undesired detested for the box on his ears of tomorrows public mockery as she would be overwhelming him with ridicule have you seen the kick and tug at the straps of the mettled pony in stables that betrays the mishandling of him by his groom something so did fleetwood plunge and dart to be free of her and his desperate soul cried out on her sticking to him like a plaster welcome were the constables his guineas winked at their chief as fair women convey their meanings with no motion of eyelids and the officers of the law knew the voice habituated to command and answered two words of his right my lord smelling my lord in the unerring manner of those days my lords party were escorted to the gates not a little jeered though they by no means had the worst of the tussle but the puffing indignation of sir meesan corby over his battered hat and torn frill and buttons plucked from his coat and his threat of the magistrates excited the crowd to derisive yells my lord spoke something to his man handing his purse the ladies were spared the hearing of bad language they according to the joint testimony of m de st ombre and mr rose mackrell comported themselves throughout as became the daughters of a warrior race both gentlemen were emphatic to praise the unknown britomart who had done such gallant service with sir meesons ebony wand he was beginning to fuss vociferously about the loss of the sticka family stick goldheaded the family crest on it priceless to the familywhen mrs kirbylevellier handed it to him inside the coach but where is she m de st ombre said and took the hint of livias touch on his arm in the dark at the silence following the question mr rose mackrell murmured ah he and the french gentleman understood that there might have been a manifestation of the notorious whitechapel countess they were two and a slowerwitted third was travelling to his ideas on the subject three men witnesses of a remarkable incident in connection with a boiling topic of current scandalglaringly illustrative of it moreoverwere unlikely to keep close tongues even if they had been sworn to secresy fleetwood knew it and he scorned to solicit them an exaction of their idle vows would be merely the humiliation of himself so he tossed his dignity to recklessness as the ultraconvivial give the last wink of reason to the winecup persecuted as he was nothing remained for him but the nethersublime of a statuesque desperation that was his feeling and his way of cloaking it under light sallies at sir meeson and easy chat with henrietta made it visible to her from its being the contrary of what the world might expect a proud young nobleman to exhibit she pitied him she had done him some wrong she read into him too as none else could seeing the solitary tortures behind the pleasant social mask she was drawn to partake of them and the mask seemed pathetic she longed to speak a word in sympathy or relieve her bosom of tears carinthia had sunk herself was unpardonable hardly mentionable any of the tales told of her might be credited after this the incorrigible cause of humiliation for everybody connected with her pictured at a word of her name the crowd pressing and the london world acting audience livia spoke the name when they had reached their house and were alone henrietta responded with the imperceptible shrug which is more eloquent than a cry to tell of the most monstrous of loads my lord it was thought by the ladies had directed his man to convey her safely to her chosen home whence she might be expected very soon to be issuing and striking the gong of london again chapter xxiv a kidnapping and no great harm ladies who have the pride of delicate breeding are not more than rather violently hurled back on the fortress it is when one or other of the gross mishaps of circumstance may subject them to a shock and this happening in the presence of gentlemen they are sustained by the within and the without to keep a smooth countenance however severe their affliction men of heroic nerve decline similarly to let explosions shake them though earth be shaken dragged into the monstrous grotesque of the scene at the gardens livia and henrietta went through the ordeal masking any signs that they were stripped for a flagellation only the fair cousins were unable to perceive a comic element in the scene and if the world was for laughing as their instant apprehension foresaw it the world was an ignoble beast they did not discuss carinthias latest craziness at night hardly alluded to it while they were in the interjectory state henrietta was livias guest her husband having hurried away to vienna to get money money her angry bluntness explained his absence and dealt its blow at the sudden astounding poverty into which they had fallen she was compelled to practise an excessive an incredible economythink of the smallest trifles so that her chillon travelled unaccompanied they were separated her iterations upon money were the vile constraint of an awakened interest and wonderment at its powers she the romantic riette banner of chivalry reader of poetry struck a line between poor and rich in her talk of people and classed herself with the fallen and pinched she harped on her slender means on the enforced calculations preceding purchases on the living in lodgings and that miserly lord levelliers indebtedness to chillonlarge sums and chillons praiseworthy resolve to pay the creditors of her fathers estate and of how he travelled like a common man in consequence of the money he had given janeyweakly for her obstinacy was past endurance but her brother would not leave her penniless and penniless she had been for weeks because of her stubborn resistance to the earlquite unreasonably whether right or wrongin the foul retreat she had chosen apparently with a notion that the horror of it was her vantage ground against him and though a single sign of submission would place the richest purse in england at her disposal she refuses esslemont she insists on his meeting her no child could be so witless let him be the one chiefly or entirely to blame she might show a little tactfor her brothers sake she loves her brother no deaf to him to me to every consideration except her blind will here was the skeleton of the love match earlier than livia had expected it refreshed a phlegmatic ladys disposition for prophecy lovers abruptly tossed between wind and wave may still be lovers she knew but they are or the weaker of the two is hard upon any third person who tugs at them for subsistence or existence the condition if they are much beaten about prepares true lovers through their mutual tenderness to be bitterly misanthropical livia supposed the novel economic pinches to be the cause of henriettas unwonted harsh judgement of her sisterinlaws misconduct or the crude expression of it she could not guess that carinthias unhappiness in marriage was a spectre over the married happiness of the pair fretted by the conscience which told them they had come together by doing much to bring it to pass henrietta could see herself less the culprit when she blamed carinthia in anothers hearing after some repose the cousins treated their horrible misadventure as a piece of history livia was cool she had not a husband involved in it as henrietta had and londons hoarse laugh surely coming on them spared her the dread henrietta suffered that chillon would hear the most sensitive of men on any matter touching his family and now a sister added to the list will there be names livia the newspapers livias shoulders rose we ought to have sworn the gentlemen to silence m de st ombre is a tomb until he writes his memoirs i hold sir meeson under lock but a spiced incident a notorious couplean anecdotal witness to the scenecould you expect mr rose mackrell to contain it the sacredest of oaths my dear that relentless force impelling an anecdotist to slaughter families for the amusement of dinnertables was brought home to henrietta by her prospect of being a victim and livia reminding her of the excessive laughter at rose mackrells anecdotes overnight she bemoaned her having consented to go to those gardens in mourning how could janey possibly have heard of the project to go you went to please russett he to please you and that wildcat to please herself said livia she haunts his door i suppose and follows him like a running footman every step she takes widens the breach he keeps his temper yes keeps his temper as he keeps his word and one morning it breaks loose and all thats done has to be undone it will bemust that extravaganza as she is called is fatal dogs him with burlesqueof all men why not consent to meet her once chillon asks you are asking russett to yield an inch on demand and to a woman my husband would yield to a woman what he would refuse to all the men in europe and america said henrietta and she enjoyed her thrill of allegiance to her chivalrous lord and courtier no very extraordinary specimen of a newly married man who has won the beauty of england and america for his wifeat some cost to some people livia rejoined there came a moisture on the eyelashes of the emotional young woman from a touch of compassion for the wealthy man who had wished to call her wife and was condemned by her rejection of him to call another woman wife to be wifeless in wedding her despite his wealth she thinks he loves her it is pitiable but she thinks itafter the treatment she has had she begs to see him once and subdue him with a fit of weeping livia was moved to say by sight of the tear she hated it would harden russetton other eyes too saltwater drops are like the forced agony scenes in a play they bring down the curtain they dont win the critics i heard her my husband and saw his face you didnt hear a whimper with it henrietta said shes a mountain girl not your city madam on the boards chillon and i had her by each hand implored her to leave that impossible whitechapel and she trembled not a drop was shed by her i can almost fancy privation and squalor have no terrors for janey she sings to the people down there nurses them she might be occupying esslemontour dream of an english home she is the destruction of the idea of romantic in connection with the name of marriage i talk like a simpleton janey upsets us all my lord was onlya little queer before he knew her his mr woodseer may be encouraging her you tell me the creature has a salary from him equal to your jointure be civil to the man while it lasts livia said attentive to a degradation of tonein her cousin formerly of supreme selfcontainment the beautiful young woman was reminded of her holiday in town she brightened and the little that it was and the meanness of the satisfaction darkened her envy of the lucky adventurer mr woodseer on her husbands behalf grew horridly conscious for being reproved so she plucked resolution to enjoy her holiday and forget the contrasts of lifepalaces running profusion lodgings hammered by duns the pinch of poverty distracting every simple look inside or out there was no end to it for her husbands chivalrous honour forced him to undertake the payment of her fathers heavy debts he was right and admirable it could not be contested but the prospect for them was a grinding gloom an unrelieved drag as of a coach at night on an interminable uphill flinty road these were her sensations and she found it diverting to be admired admired by many while she knew herself to be absorbed in the possession of her by one it bestowed the before and after of her marriage she felt she was really had rapidly become the young woman of the world armed with a husband to take the flatteries of men for the needed diversion they brought none moved her none could come near to touching the happy insensibility of a wife who adored her husband wrote to him daily thought of him by the minute her former worshippers were numerous at livias receptions lord fleetwood lord brailstone and the rest odd to reflect onthey were the insubstantial but coveted wealth of the woman fallen upon poverty ignoble poverty she could not discard her wealth she wrote amusingly of them and fully vivacious descriptions to chillon hardly so much writing to him as entering her hearts barred citadel where he resided at his ease heard everything that befell about her if she dwelt on lord fleetwoods kindness in providing entertainments her object was to mollify chillons anger in some degree she was doing her utmost to gratify him for the purpose of paving a way to plead janeys case she was almost persuading herself she was enjoying the remarks of his friend confidant secretary or what not livias worshipper mr woodseer who does as he wills with my lord directs his charities his pleasures his opinions all because he is believed to have wonderful ideas and be wonderfully honest henrietta wrote situation unchanged janey still at that place and before the letter was posted she and livia had heard from gower woodseer of the reported disappearance of the countess of fleetwood and her maid gowers father had walked up from whitechapel bearing news of it to the earl she said and the earl is much disturbed was livias inquiry he has driven down with my father gower said carelessly ambiguously in the sound troubled enough to desire the show of a corresponding trouble henrietta read at their faces may it not bedown therea real danger the drama he could inform her was only too naked down there for disappearances to be common will it be published that she is missing she has her maid with her a stouthearted girl both have courage i dont think we need take measures just yet not before it is public property henrietta could have bitten her tongue for laying her open to the censure implied in his muteness janey perverted her women were an illegible manuscript and ladies a closed book of the binding to this raw philosopher or he would not so coldly have judged the young wife anxious on her husbands account that they might escape another scorching he carried away his impression livia listened to a remark on his want of manners russett puts it to the credit of his honesty she said honesty is everything with us at present the man has made his honesty an excellent speculation he puts a piece on zero and the bank hands him a sackful we may think we have won him to serve us up comes his honesty thats how we have lady arpington mixed in ittoo long a tale but be guided by me condescend a little my dear my whole mind is upon that unhappy girl it would break chillons heart livia pished there are letters we read before we crack the seal she is out of that ditch and it suits russett that she should be hes not often so patient a woman foot to foot against his willi see him throwing high stakes tyrants are brutal and really she provokes him enough you neednt be alarmed about the treatment she ll meet he wont let her beat him be sure neither livia nor gower wondered at the clearing of the mystery before it went to swell the scandal a young nobleman of ready power quick temper few scruples and a taxed forbearance was not likely to stand thwarted and goadedand by a woman lord fleetwood acted his part inscrutable as the blank of a locked door he could not conceal that he was behind the door chapter xxv the philosopher man of action gowers bedroom window looked over the shrubs of the square and as his form of revolt from a city life was to be up and out with the sparrows in the early flutter of morning for a stretch of the legs where grass was green and trees were not enclosed he rarely saw a figure below when he stood dressing now there appeared a petticoated one stationary against the rails with her face lifted she fronted the house and while he speculated abstractedly recognition rushed on him he was down and across the roadway at leaps its madge here the girl panted for her voice mr woodseer im glad i thought i should have to wait hours shes safe where will you come sir step ahead madge set forth to north of the square he judged of the wellfavoured girl that she could steer her way through cities mouth and brows were a warning to challenger pirate craft of a vessel carrying guns and the red lips kept their firm line when they yielded to the pressure for speech its a distance shes quite safe no harm shes a prisoner shes well fed shes not ill treated you re out thats as it happens im lucky in seeing you early he dont mean to hurt her he wont be beaten all she asks is ten minutes with him if he wouldhe wont she didnt mean to do him offence t other night in that placeyouve heard kit ines told me he was on duty theregoing she couldnt help speaking when she had eyes on her husband she kisses the ground of his footsoles you may say let him be ever so unkind she and i were crossing to the corner of roper street a rainy night on way to mile end away down to one of your fathers families mother davis and her sick daughter and the little ones and close under the publichouse goat and beard we were seized on and hustled into a covered carriage that was there and they drove sharp she s not one to scream we werent frightened we both made the same guess they drove us to the house she s locked in and me too up till three oclock this morning youve seen nobody madge he s fixed she s to leave london mr woodseer ive seen kit ines and she s to have one of the big houses to her use i guessed kit ines was his broom he defends it because he has his money to makeand be a dirty broom for a fortune but any womans sure of decent handling with kit inesnot to speak of lady he and a mate guard the house an old woman cooks he guards the house and he gave you a pass not he his prides his obedience to his paytronhe calls his master and wont hear that name abused we are on the first floor all the lower doors are locked day and night new street not much neighbours she wouldnt cry out of the window she s to be let free if shell leave london you jumped it if id broke a leg mr kit ines would have had to go to his drams it wasnt very high and a flowerbed underneath my mistress wanted to be the one she has to be careful she taught me how to jump down not to hurt she makes you feel you can do anything i had a bother to get her to let me and be quiet herself shes not one to put it upon others youll learn when i was down i felt like a stick in the ground and sat till i had my feet she at the window waiting and i started for you she kissed her hand i was to come to you and then your father you nowhere seen i wasnt spoken to i know empty london kit ines was left sleeping in the house snoring i dare say he dont drink on duty he must be kept on duty drink or that kind of duty its a poor choice youll take him in charge madge ive got a mistress to look after youve warmed to her thats not new mr woodseer i do trust you and you his friend but you are the ministers son and any man not a great nobleman must have some heart for her youll learn he kills her so because shes fond of himloves him however he strikes no not like a dog as men say of us shed die for him this night need were live with her you wont find many men match her for brave and shes good my sally calls her a bible saint i could tell you stories of her goodness short the time though shes been down our way and better there for her than at that inn he left her at to pine and watch the royal sovereign come swing come smirk in sailor blue and star to meet the rainwould make anybody disrespect royalty or else go mad hes a great nobleman he cant buy what shes ready to give and if he thinks he breaks her will now its because she thinks shes obeying a higher than him or no lord alive and kit ines to back him d hold her women want a priest to speak to men certain times i wish i dared we have to bite our tongues hes master now but as i believe gods above if he plays her false hes the one to be brought to shame i talk talk on madge said gower to whom the girls shortsyllabled run of the lips was a mountain rill compared with london park waters you wont let him hurry her off where shell eat her heart for never seeing him again she prays to be near him if shes not to see him she speaks in that way i get it by bits im with her so its as good as if i was inside her she cant obey when it goes the wrong way of her heart to him love and wisdom wont pull together and they part company for good at the church door said gower this matrimonys a bad business madge hummed a moan of assent and my poor sally ll have to marry i cant leave my mistress while she wants me and sally cant be alone it seems we take a step and harms done though its the right step we take it seems to me youve engaged yourself to follow sallys lead madge girls minds turn corners mr woodseer he passed the remark what it was that girls minds occasionally or habitually did or whether they had minds to turn or whether they took their whims for minds were untroubled questions with a young man studying abstract and adoring surface nature too exclusively to be aware of the manifestation of her spirit in the flesh as it is not revealed so much by men however she had a voice and a face that led him to be thoughtful over her devotedness to her mistress after nearly losing her character for the prizefighter and he had to thank her for invigorating him his disposition was to muse and fall slack helpless to a friend here walked a creature exactly the contrary he listened to the steps of the dissimilar pair on the detonating pavement and eyed a church clock shining to the sun she was sure of the direction out camden way where the murder was they walked at a brisk pace conversing or not tired you must be he said not when im hot to do a thing theres the word of the thoroughbred you dont tire sir said she sally and i see you stalking out for the open country in the still of the morning she thinks you look pale for want of food and ought to have some one put a biscuit into your pocket overnight whod have guessed i was under motherly observation you shouldnt go so long empty if you listen to trainers capital doctors no doubt but i get a fine appetite you may grind the edge too sharp he was about to be astonished and reflected that she had grounds for her sagacity his next thought plunged him into contempt for kit ines on account of the fellows lapses to sottishness but there would be no contempt of kit ines in a tussle with him nor could one funk the tussle and play cur if kits engaged young woman were looking on we get to our courage or the show of it by queer screws contemplative over these matters the philosopher transformed to man of action heard madge say she read directions in london by churches and presently exclaiming disdainfully and yet relieved spooner villas she turned down a row of small detached houses facing a brickfield that had just contributed to the erection of them and threatened the big city with further defacements madge pointed to the marks of her jump deep in flowerbed earth under an open window gower measured the height with sensational shanks she smote at the door carinthia nodded from her window close upon that kit ines came bounding to the parlour window he spied and stared gower was known to him as the earls paymaster so he went to the passage and flung the door open blocking the way any commands your honour you bring the countess to my lord immediately said gower kit swallowed his mouthful of surprise in a second look at madge and the ploughed gardenbed beneath the chamber window are the orders written sir to mefor me to deliver to youfor you to do my lords bidding wheres your head kits fingernails travelled up to it madge pushed past him she and her mistress and kits mate and the old woman receiving the word for a cup of tea were soon in the passage kits mate had a ready obedience for his pay nothing elseno counsel at all not a suggestion to a head knocked to a pudding by madges jump and my lords paymaster here upon the scene my lady was to go down wales way sir that may be ordered after i m to take my lady to my lord and does it mean my lady wants a fly kit asked and harked back on whether madge had seen my lord at five in the morningdont sham donkey with me said gower the business looked inclined to be leaky but which the way for proving himself other than a donkey puzzled kit so much so that a shove made him partly grateful madges clever countermove had stunned his judgement he was besides acting subordinate to his patrons paymaster and by the luck of it no voice of woman interposed the countess and her maid stood by like a disinterested couple why be suspicious if he was to keep the countess in sight she was a nice lady and he preferred her good opinion she was brave and he did her homage it might be my lord had got himself round to the idea of thanking her for saving his nob that night and his way was to send and have her up to tell her he forgave her after the style of lords gower pricked into him by saying aside mad i suppose in case of a noise and he could not answer quite manfully lost his eyes and coloured neighbours might have required an explanation of shrieks he confessed men have sometimes to do nasty work for their patrons they were afoot walking at carinthias pace before halfpast seven she would not hear of any conveyance she was cheerful and as it was pitiful to see enjoyed her walk hearing of her brothers departure for the austrian capital she sparkled her snatches of speech were short flights out of the meditation possessing her gower noticed her easier english that came home to the perpetual student he was she made use of some of his fathers words and had assimilated them mentally besides appropriating them the verbalizing of purpose then peculiar to his father for example she said in reply to a hint from him if my lord will allow me an interview i purpose to be obedient no one could imagine of her that she spoke brokenspiritedly her obedience was to a higher than a mortal lord and gower was touched to the quick through the use of the word contrasting her with countess livia and her cousin the earl might think her inferior on the one small square compartment called by them the world but she carried the promise of growth a character in expansion and she had at least natural grace a deerlike step although her picturesqueness did not swarm on him with images illuminating night subduing day like the countess livias it was marked it could tower and intermittently eclipse and it was of the uplifting and healing kind by comparison not a delicious balefulness the bigger houses larger shops austere streets of private residences were observed by the recent inhabitant of whitechapel my lord lives in a square she said we shall soon be there now he encouraged her doubtful though the issue appeared it is a summer morning for the ortler the grossglockner the venedigerall our alps mr woodseer if we could fly we love them why then we beat a wingyes for i have them when i want them to sight it is the feet are so desirous i feel them so this morning after prisonership i could not have been driven to my lord i know the feeling said gower any movement of us not our own impulse hurries the body and deadens the mind and by the way my dear lady i spoke of the earls commands to this man behind us walking with your madge my father would accuse me of jesuitry ines mentioned commands and i took advantage of it i feared said carinthia i go for my chance gower had a thought of the smaller creature greater by position to whom she was going for her chance he alluded to his experience of the earls kindness in relation to himself from a belief in his honesty dotted outlines of her husbands complex character or unmixed and violently opposing elements she remarked i will try and learn the name of the street of beautiful shops woke a happy smile on her mouth father talked of it my mother too he has it written down in his book of maxims when i was a girl i dreamed of one day walking up bond street they stepped from the pavement and crossed the roadway for a sidestreet leading to the square with the swift variation of her aspect at times her tone changed we are near my lord will not be troubled by me he has only to meet me there has been misunderstanding i have vexed him i could not help it i will go where he pleases after i have heard him give orders he thinks me a frightful woman i am peaceful gower muttered her word misunderstanding they were at the earls house door one tap at it and the two applicants for admission would probably be shot as far away from lord fleetwood as when they were on the styrian heights last autumn he delivered the tap amused by the idea it was like a summons to a genie of doubtful service my lord was out riding in the park only the footman appeared at that early hour and his countenance was blank whitewash as he stood rigid against the wall for the lady to pass madge followed into the morning room ines remained in the hall where he could have the opening speech with his patron and where he soon had communication with the butler this official entered presently to gower presenting a loaded forehead a note addressed to mrs kirbylevellier at the countess livias house hard by was handed to him for instant despatch he signified a deferential wish to speak you can speak in the presence of the countess of fleetwood mr waytes gower said waytes checked a bend of his shoulders he had not a word and he turned to send the note he was compelled to think that he saw a wellgrown young woman in the whitechapel countess gowers note reached henrietta on her descent to the breakfasttable she was alone and thrown into a torture of perplexity for she wanted advice as to the advice to be given to janey and livia was an utterly unprofitable person to consult in the case she thought of lady arpington not many doors distant drinking one hasty cup of tea she sent for her bonnet and hastened away to the great lady whom she found rising from breakfast with the marquis lady arpington read gowers note she unburdened herself oh so it s no longer a bachelors household henrietta heaved the biggest of sighs i fear the poor dear may have made matters worse to which lady arpington said worse or better my child and shrugged for the present situation strained to snapping she proposed to go forthwith and give what support she could to the countess of fleetwood they descended the steps of the house to the garden and the green parks gravel walk up to piccadilly there they had view of lord fleetwood on horseback leisurely turning out of the main ways tide they saw him alight at the mews as they entered the square he was met some doors from the south corner by his good or evil genius whose influence with him came next after the marriage in the amazement it caused and was perhaps to be explained by it for the wealthiest of young noblemen bestowing his name on an unknown girl would be the one to make an absurd adventurer his intimate lord fleetwood bent a listening head while mr gower woodseer apparently a good genius for the moment spoke at his ear how do we understand laughter at such a communication as he must be hearing from the man signs of a sharp laugh indicated either his cruel levity or that his presumptuous favourite trifledand the mans talk could be droll lady arpington knew it had she recollected angrily diverted her and softened her to tolerate the intruder into regions from which her class and her periods excluded the lowly born except at the dinnertables of stale politics and tattered scandal nevertheless lord fleetwood mounted the steps to his house door still listening his asmodeus on the tongue of the world might be doing the part of mentor really the house door stood open fleetwood said something to gower he swung round beheld the ladies and advanced to them saluting my dear lady arpington quite so you arrive opportunely when the enemy occupies the citadel its proper to surrender say i beg she can have the house if she prefers it i will fall back on esslemont arrangements for her convenience will be made i thank you by anticipation his bow included henrietta loosely lady arpington had exclaimed enemy fleetwood and gower in his ignorance of the smoothness of aristocratic manners expected a remonstrance but fleetwood was allowed to go on with his air of steely geniality and a decision that his friend imagined he could have broken down like an old partition board under the kick of a sarcasm sharpening an appeal lord fleetwood was on the point of going in he assured the great lady lord fleetwood may regret his change of mind said she the countess of fleetwood will have my advice to keep her footing in this house she and henrietta sat alone with carinthia for an hour coming forth lady arpington ejaculated to herself villany somewhereyou will do well henrietta to take up your quarters with her a day or two she can hold her position a month longer is past possibility a shudder of the repulsion from men crept over the younger lady but she was a warriors daughter and observed my husband her brother will be back before the month ends no need for hostilities to lighten our darkness lady arpington rejoined you know her trust her one cannot doubt her face she is my husbands sister yes i do trust her i nail my flag to her cause the flag was crimson as it appeared on her cheeks and that intimated a further tale though not of so dramatic an import as the cognizant short survey of carinthia had been these young women with the new complications obtruded by them irritated a benevolent great governing lady who had married off her daughters and embraced her grandchildren comfortably finishing that chapter and beheld now the apparition of the sexs ancient tripping foe when circumstances in themselves were quite enough to contend against on their behalf it seemed to say that natures most burdened weaker must always be beaten despite henriettas advocacy and carinthias clear face it raised a spectral form of a suspicion the more effective by reason of the much required justification it fetched from the shades to plead apologies for lord fleetwoods erratic if not mad and in any case ugly conduct what otherwise could be his excuse such was his need of one that the wife he crushed had to be proposed for sacrifice in the mind of a lady tending strongly to side with her and condemn her husband lady arpington had counselled carinthia to stay where she was the fates having brought her there henrietta was too generous to hesitate in her choice between her husbands sister and the earl she removed from livias house to lord fleetwoods my lord was at esslemont two days then established his quarters at scropes hotel five minutes walk from the wedded lady to whom the right to bear his title was granted an interview with him refused such a squaring for the battle of spouses had neveror not in mighty londonbeen seen since that old fight began chapter xxvi after some fencing the dame passes our guard dame gossip at this present pass bursts to give us a review of the social world siding for the earl or for his countess and her parrot cry of john rose mackrell with her heads loose shake over the smack of her lap to convey the contemporaneous tipsy relish of the rich good things he said on the subject of the contest indicates the kind of intervention it would be to save the story from having its vein tied we may accept the reminder that he was the countesss voluble advocate at a period when her friends were shy to speak of her after relating the vauxhall gardens episode in burlesque homeric during the freshness of the scandal rose mackrells enthusiasm for the heroine of his humour set in he tracked her to her parentage which was new breath blown into the sunken tradition of some old buccaneer and his countess fanny and a turn of great good luck helping him to a copy of the book of the maxims for men he would quote certain of the racier ones passages of captain john peter kirbys personal adveres in various lands and waters illustrating the text to prove that the old warrior acted by the rule of his recommendations they had the repulsive attraction proper to rusty lumber swords and truncehons that have tasted brains they wove no mild sort of halo for the head of a shillelaghflourishing whitechapel countess descended from the writer and doer people were willing to believe in her jump of thirty feet or more off a suburban housetop to escape durance and her midnight storming of her lords town house and ousting of him to go find his quarters at scropes hotel he too had his band of pugilists as it was known and he might have heightened a rageing scandal the nobleman forbore a womans blow gracefully taken adds a score of inches to our stature floor us as it may we win the worlds afterthoughts rose mackrell sketched the earlalways alert smart quick to meet a combination and protect a dignity never obtruded and in spite of himself the laugh of the town his humour flickered wildly round the ridiculous position of a prominent young nobleman whose bearing and character were foreign to a position of ridicule nevertheless the earls figure continuing to be classic sculpture it allied him with the aristocracy of martyrs that burn and do not wince he propitiated none and as he could not but suffer shrewdly he gained esteem enough to shine through the womans pitiless drenching of him during his term at scropes hotel the carousals there were quite oldcentury and matter of discourse he had proved his return to sound sense in the dismissal of the fiddler notoriously the womans lieutenant or more and nightly the revelry closed at the great gaming tables of st jamess street while whitechapel held the coroneted square well on her way to the law courts as abrane and potts reported and positively so clear case that was the coming development and finale of the marriage london waited for it a rich mans easy smile over losses at play merely taught his emulous troop to feel themselves poor devils in the pocket but fleetwoods contempt of sleep was a marvel superhuman and accused them of an inferior vigour hard for young men to admit by the example he never went to bed issuing from fortunes halldoors in the bright lively summer morning he mounted horse and was away to the hills or he took the arm of a roman catholic nobleman lord feltre and walked with him from the green tables and the establishments renowned dry still sillery to a papist chapel as it was not known that he had given his word to abjure his religion the pious gamblers did no worse than spread an alarm and quiet it by the citation of his character for having a try at everything henrietta despatched at this period the following letter to chillon i am with livia tomorrow janey starts for wales tomorrow morning a voluntary exile she pleaded to go back to that place where you had to leave her promising she would not come westward but was persuaded lady arpington approves the situation was getting too terribly strained we met and passed my lord in the park he was walking his horseelegant cavalier that he is would not look on his wife a woman pulled by her collar should be passive if she pulls her way she is treated as a dog i see nothing else in the intention of poor janeys last offence to him there is an opposite counsel and he can be eloquent and he will be heard on her side how could she manage the most wayward when she has not an idea of ordinary men but my husband they have our tie between them it may move him it subdues herand nothing else would have done that if she had been in england a year before the marriage she would i think have understood better how to guide her steps and her tongue for his good pleasure she learns daily very quickly observes assimilates she reads and has her commentswould have shot far ahead of your riette with my advantages your unclebut he will bear any charge on his conscience as long as he can get the burden off his shoulders do not fret my own reperuse the aboveyou will see we have grounds for hope he should have looked down on her no tears from her eyes but her eyes were tears she does not rank among beautiful women she has her moments for outshining themthe loveliest of spectres she caught at my heart i cannot forget her face looking up for him to look down a great painter would have reproduced it a great poet have rendered the impression nothing short of the greatest that is odd to say of one so simple as she but when accidents call up her reserves you see mountain heights where mists wereshe is actually glorified her friendi do believe a friendthe mr woodseer you are to remember meeting somewherea sprained anklehas a dozen similes ready for what she is when pain or happiness vivify her or it may be tender charity she says that if she feels for suffering people it is because she is the child of chillons mother in like manner chillon is the son of janeys father mr woodseer came every other evening our only enlivenment livia followed her policy in refusing to call we lived luxuriously no money not enough for a box at the opera though we yearnedyou can imagine chapters of philosophy read out and expounded instead janey likes them he sets lessons to her queer maidreading writing pronunciation of english an inferior language to welsh for poetical purposes we are informed so janeydetermining to apply herself to welsh and a chameleon riette dreading that she will be taking a contrary view of the honest soulsas she feels them to bewhen again under livias shadow the message from janey to scropes hotel was despatched halfanhour after we had driven in from the park fruit of a brown meditation i wrote itthird persona single sentence arrangements are made for her to travel comfortably it is funnythe shops for her purchases of clothes necessaries etc are specified she may order to any extent not a shilling of money for her poor purse what can be the secret of that he does nothing without an object to me uniformly civil no irony few compliments livia writes that i am commended for keeping janey company what can be the secret of a man scrupulously just with one hand and at the same time cruel with the other mr woodseer says his wealthmore money than is required for their needs men go into harness to plutusif that is clever i have written my husbandas janey ceases to call her own and it was pretty and touching to hear her my husbandoh a dull letter but he is my husband though he keeps absentto be longed forhe is my husband still my husband always chillon is henriettas husband the world cries out and when she is flattered she does the like for then it is not too presumptuous that she should name henrietta chillons wife in my ears husband has the sweeter sound it brings an angel from overhead will it bring him onehalf hour sooner my love my dear if it did i should be lisping husband husband husband from cockcrow to owls cry livia thinks the word foolish if not detestable she and i have our different opinions she is for luxury i choose poverty and my husband poverty has its beauty if my husband is the sun of it elle radote she would not have written so dull a letter to her husband if she had been at the opera last night or listened to a distant streetband no morethe next line would be bleeding he should have her blood too if that were her husbandsit would never be but if it were for his good in the smallest way chillons wish is to give his blood for them he loves never did woman try more to write worthily to her absent lord and fall so miserably into the state of dripping babe from bath on nurses knee cover me my lord and love my cause forno my excuse my refuge from myself we are one oh we are oneand we have been separated eight and twenty days henrietta kirbylevellier that was a letter for the husband and lover to receive in a foreign land and be warmed the tidings of carinthia washed him clean of the grimy district where his waxen sister had developed her stubborn insensibilityresembling craziness every perversion of the refinement demanded by young englishmen of their ladies and it pacified him with the belief that she was now at rest the disturbed history of their father and mother at rest as well his conscience in relation to the marriage likewise at rest chillon had a wife her writing of the welcome to poverty stirred his knowledge of his wifes nature carinthia might bear it and harden to flint henrietta was a butterfly for the golden rays his thoughts all his energies were bent on the making of money to supply her need for the pleasure she flew ina butterflys grub without it accurately so did the husband and lover read his wifeadoring her the more her letters embracing close was costly to them it hurried him to the compromise of a debateable business and he fell into the austrian governments terms for the payment of the inheritance from his father calculating thathis sisters share deductedmoney would be in hand to pay pressing debts and enable henrietta to live unworried by cares until he should have squeezed debts long due and increasing out of the miserly old lord his uncle a prospect of supplies for twelve months counting the hack and carriage henrietta had always been used to seemed about as far as it was required to look by the husband hastening homeward to his wifes call her letter was a call in the night besides there were his yet untried inventions the new gunpowder testing at croridge promised to provide henrietta with many of the luxuries she could have had and had abandoned for his sake the new blasting powder and a destructive shell might build her the palace she deserved his uncle was no doubt his partner if however the profits were divided sufficient wealth was assured but his uncle remained a dubious image the husband and lover could enfold no positive prospect to suit his wifes tastes beyond the twelve months we have dame gossip upon us one minute let mention be of the excitement over protestant england when that rumour disseminated telling of her wealthiest noblemans visit to a monastery up in the peaks and snows and of his dwelling among the monks and assisting in all their services day and night hymning and chanting uttering not one word for one whole week his papistical friend lord feltre with him of course after jesuit arts had allured him to that place of torrents and lightnings and canticles and demon echoes all as though expressly contrived for the horrifying of sinners into penitence and confession and the monkish cowl up to lifes end not to speak of the abjuration of worldly possessions and donation of them into the keeping of the shaven brothers when either they would have settled a band of them here in our very midst or they would have impoverishedis not too strong a wordthe country by taking the moneys worth of the mines estates mansions freehold streets and squares of our metropolis out of it without scruple rejoicing so to bleed the protestant faith underrate it nowthen it was a truly justifiable anxiety insomuch that you heard people of station eminent titled persons asking like the commonest low radicals whether it was prudent legislation to permit of the inheritance of such vast wealth by a young man little more than a boy and noted for freaks and some declared it could not be allowed for foreign monks to have a claim to inherit english property there was a general consent that if the earl of fleetwood went to the extreme of making over his property to those monks he should be pronounced insane and incapable ultimately the world was a little pacified by hearing that a portion of it was entailed esslemont and the welsh mines so it might be but what if he had no child the marriage amazing everybody scarcely promised fruit it was thought countess livia much besought for her opinion scouted the possibility and carinthia jane was proclaimed by john rose mackrell to his dying day the poor gentleman tried vainly to get the second syllable of his name accentuated a young woman who would outlive twice over the husband she had he said of his name it was destined to pass him down a dead fish in the nose of posterity and would affect his best jokes which something has done or the present generation has lost the sense of genuine humour thanks to him the talk of the whitechapel countess again sprang up merrily as ever and after her having become as he said a desiccated celebrity she outdid cabinet ministers and naughty wives for a living morsel in the worlds mouth she was denounced by the patriotic party as the cause of the earls dalliance with rome the earl you are to know was then coasting along the mediterranean on board his beautiful schooner yacht with his lord feltre bound to make an inspection of syrian monasteries and forget if he could the face of all faces anothers possession by the law those two lords shut up together in a yacht were advised by their situation to be bosom friends and they quarrelled violently and were reconciled and they quarrelled again they were explosive chemicals until the touch of dry land relieved them of what they really fancied the spell of the fiend for their argumentative topic during confinement was woman when it was not theology and even off a yacht those are subjects to kindle the utmost hatred of dissension if men are not perfectly concordant they agreed upon land to banish any talk of women or theology where it would have been comparatively innocent so they both desiring to be doing the thing they had sworn they would not do the thoughts of both were fastened on one or the other interdicted subject they hardly spoke they perceived in their longing minds that the imagined spell of the fiend was indeed the bile of the sea secreted thickly for want of exercise and they both regretted the days and nights of their angry controversies unfit pilgrims of the holy land they owned to such effect lord fleetwood wrote to gower woodseer as though there had been no breach between them from jerusalem expressing the wish to hear his cool woodnotes of the philosophy of life fresh drawn from natures breast and urgent for an answer to be addressed to his hotel at southampton that he might be greeted on his return home first by his friend gower he wrote in the month of january his arrival at southampton was on the thirteenth day of march and there he opened a letter some weeks old the bearer of news which ought by rights to make husbands proudly happy chapter xxvii we descend into a steamers engineroom fleetwood had dropped his friend lord feltre at ancona his good fortune was to be alone when the clang of bells rang through his head in the reading of gowers lines other letters were opened from the countess livia from lady arpington from captain kirbylevellier there was one from his lawyers informing him of their receipt of a communication dated south wales december th and signed owain wythan to the effect that the birth of a son to the earl of fleetwood was registered on the day of the date with a copy of the document forwarded livia scornfully stated the tattling worlds latest the captain was as brief in ordinary words whose quick run to the stop could be taken for a challenge of the eye it stamped the adversarys frown on fleetwood reading lady arpington was more politic she wrote of a healthy boy and the healthy mother giving him breast this being the way for the rearing of strong men she condescended to the particulars that she might touch him the earl had not been so reared his mother was not the healthy mother one of his multitudinous shifty but ineradicable ambitions was to exhibit an excellingly vigorous tireless constitution he remembered the needed refreshment of the seabreezes aboard his yacht during the week following the sleepdiscarded nights at scropes and the green tables for a week he hung to the smell of brine in rapturous amity with feltre until they yellowed differed wrangled hated a powerful leaven was put into him by the tidings out of wales gower good fellow had gone down to see the young mother three weeks after the birth of her child she was already renewing her bloom she had produced the boy in the worlds early manner lightly without any of the tragic modern hovering over death to give the life gower compared it to a flush of the vernal orchard after a days drink of sunlight that was well that was how it should be one loathes the idea of tortured women the good fellow was perhaps absurdly poetical still we must have poetry to hallow this and other forms of energy or say if you like the right view of them impels to poetry otherwise we are in the breeding yards among the litters and the farrows it is a question of looking down or looking up if we are poor creaturesas we are if we do but feast and gamble and begetwe shall run for a time with the dogs and come to the finish of swine better say life is holy why then have we to thank her who teaches it he gazed at the string of visions of the woman naming him husband making him a father the imagined carinthiabeautiful gorgon haggard venus the carinthia of the precipice treeshoot carinthia of the ducal dancinghall and she at the altar rails she on the coach box she alternately softest of brides doughtiest of amazons a mate for the caress an electrical heroine fronted him yes and she was lord fleetwoods wife cracking sconcesa demoiselle moll flandersthe worlds whitechapel countess out for an airing infernally earnest about it madly ludicrous the schemer to catch his word the petticoated shylock to bind him to the letter of it now persecuting haunting him now immoveable for obstinacy malignant to stay down in those vile slums and direct tons of sooty waters on his head from its mains in the sight of london causing the least histrionic of men to behave as an actor he beheld her a skull with a lamp behind the eyeholes but this woman was the woman who made him a father she was the mother of the heir of the house and the boy she clasped and suckled as her boy was his boy they met inseparably in that new life truly there could not be a woman of flesh so near to a likeness with the beatific image of feltres worshipped madonna the thought sparkled and darkened in fleetwoods mind as a star passing into cloud for an uproarious world claimed the woman jeered at all allied with her at her husband most of coursethe punctilious noodle the golden jackass tethered and goaded he had choice among the pick of women the daughter of the old buccaneer was preferred by the wiseacre coelebs she tricked him cunningly and struck a tremendous return blow in producing her male infant by the way was she actually born in wedlock lord levelliers assurances regarding her origin were by the calculation a misers shuffles to clinch his bargain assuming the representative of holy motherhood to be a woman of illegitimate birth the history of the house to which the spotted woman gave an heir would suffer a jolt when touching on her and altogether the history fumed rank vapours imagine her boy in his fathers name a young collegian no commonly sensitive lad could bear the gibes of the fellows raking at antecedents fleetwood would be the name to start roars smarting for his name the earl chafed at the boys mother her production of a manchild was the further and grosser offence the world sat on him his confession to some degree of weakness even to folly stung his pride of individuality so that he had to soothe the pain by tearing himself from a thought of his follys partner shutting himself up and away from her then there was a cessation of annoyance flatteringly agreeable which can come to us only of our having done the right thing young men will think he felt at once warmly with the world enjoyed the worlds kind shelter and in return for its eulogy of his unprecedented attachment to the pledge of his word admitted an understanding of its laughter at the burlesque edition of a noble lady in the person of the whitechapel countess the world sat on him heavily he recurred to gower woodseers letter the pictures and images in it were not the principal matterthe impression had been deep a plain transcription of the young mothers acts and words did more to portray her the reader could supply reflections would her boys father be very pleased to see him she had asked and she spoke of a fear that the father would try to take her boy from her never thatyou have my word fleetwood said and he nodded consentingly over her next remark not while i live till he must go to school the stubborn wife would be the last of women to sit and weep as a rifled mother a child of the countess carinthia he phrased it would not be deficient in will nor would the youngster lack bravery for his part comparison rushing at him and searching him he owned that he leaned on pride to think that he did became a theme for pride the mother had the primitive virtues the father the developed he was the richer mine and besides he was he the unriddled complex individual he she was the plain barbarian survival good for giving her offspring bone muscle stout heart shape the hypothesis of a fairer woman the mother of the heir to the earldom henrietta was analyzed in a glimpse courage animal healthfulness she too mighther husband not obstructingtransmit and good looks eyes of the sapphire aegean and therewith such pliability as the mother of love requires of her servants could that woman resist seductions fleetwoods wrath with her for refusing him and inducing him in spite to pledge his word elsewhere haphazard pricked a curiosity to know whether the woman could beand easily easily he wageredled to make her conduct warrant for his contempt of her ledthat is misled you might say if you were pleading for a doll but it was necessary to bait the pleasures for the woman in order to have full view of the precious fine fate one has escaped also to get well rid of a sort of hectic in the blood which the womans beauty has cast on that reflecting tide a feversign where the fever has become quite emotionless and is merely desirous for the stain of it to be washed out as this is not the desire to possess or even to taste contempt will do it when we know that the weaver of the fascinations is purchasable we toss her to the market where men buy and we walk released from vile subjection to one of the female heap subjection no longer doubtless and yet a stain of the past flush often colouring our reveries creating active phantasms of a passion absolutely extinct if it ever was the veritable passion the plotformless plotto get release by the sacrifice or at least a crucial temptation of the woman that should wash his blood clean of her image had a shade of the devilish he acknowledged and the apology offered no improvement of its aspect she might come out of the trial triumphant and benefit for himself even a small privilege even the pressure of her hand he not only shrank from the thought of winninghe loathed the thought he was too delicate over the idea of the married woman whom he fancied he loved in her maidenhood others might press her hand lead her the dance he simply wanted his release she had set him on fire he conceived a method for trampling the remaining sparks and erasing stain and scars that was all henrietta rejected her wealthy suitor she might some day hence be seen crawling abjectly to wealth glad of a drink from the cup it holds intoxicated with the draught an injured pride could animate his wealth to crave solace of such a spectacle devilish if you like he had expiated the wickedness in cistercian seclusion his wife now drove him to sin again she had given him a son that fluted of home and honourable life she had her charm known to him alone but how supposing she did not rub him to bristle with fresh irritations how go to his wife while henrietta held her throne consideration was due to her until she stumbled enough if she wavered almost enough is she stood firm as a statue in the winds and proved that the first page of her was a false introduction the surprising apparition of a beautiful woman with character a lightlythrilled pleasureloving woman devoted to her husband or protected by her rightful selfesteem would loosen him creditably it had to be witnessed for faith in it he reverenced our legendary good women and he bowed to noble deeds and he ascribed the former to poetical creativeness the latter operated as a scourging to his flesh to yield its demoniacal inmates nothing of the kind was doing at present or stay a studious reperusal of gower woodseers letter enriched a little incident fleetwood gave his wife her name of carinthia when he had read deliberately and caught the scene mrs wythan down in wales related it to gower carinthia and madge trudging over the treeless hills came on a birchen clump round a deep hollow or gullypit precipitous the earl knew he had peeped over the edge in his infant days there at the bottom in a foot or so of water they espied a lamb and they rescued the poor beastie by going down to it one or both it must have been the mountainfooted one a man would hesitate spying below fleetwood wondered how she had managed to climb up and carrying the lamb down pitches madge winch to helpthey did it between them we who stand aloof admire stupidly to defend himself from admiring he condemned the two women for the risk they ran to save a probably brokenlegged little beast and he escaped the melting mood by forcing a sneer at the sort of stuff out of which popular ballads are woven carinthia was accused of letting her adventurous impulses and sentimental female compassion swamp thought of a mothers duties if both those women had broken their legs the child might have cried itself into fits for the mother there she would have remained gower wrote in a language transparent of the act addressed to a reader whose memory was to be impregnated his reader would have flown away from the simple occurrence on arabesques and modulated tones and then envisaging them critically would have tossed his poor little story to the

exemplars are the lately breeched youngsters with two pence in their pockets for the gingerbreadnut booth on a fair day i learn more from one of them than you can from the whole cavalcade of your attendant ixionides mounting the box of his coach for the drive to london fleetwood had the new name for the parasitic and sham vital troop at his ears my ixionides he repeated and did not scorn them so much as he rejoiced to be enlightened by the title he craved the presence of the magician who dropped illumination with a single word wholesomer to think of than the whole body of those ixionidesnot bad fellows here and there he reflected tolerantly half laughing at some of their clownish fun gower woodseer and he had not quarrelled no they had merely parted at one of the crossways the plebeian could teach that son of the genuflexions lord feltre a lesson in manners woodseer was the better comrade and director of routes into the forest up on the heights and free not locked and not parroting day and night but quick for all that the world has learnt and can tell though twothirds of it be composed of ixionides that way lies wisdom and his index was cut that way arrived in town he ran over the headings of his letters in no degree anxious for a communication from wales there was none why none she might as well have scrawled her announcement of an event pleasing to her and by the calculation important to him if not particularly interesting the mothers wifeish lines would perhaps have been tested in a furnace he smarted at the blank of any of even two or three formal words she sulked i am not a fallen lamb he said evidently one had to be a shivering beast in trouble to excite her to move a hand through so slight a fissure as this piece of discontent cracked in him the crowd of his grievances with the woman rushed pellmell deluging young shoots of sweeter feelings she sulked if that woman could not get the command he was to know her incapable of submission after besmutting the name she had filched from him she let him understand that there was no intention to repent possibly she meant war in which case a man must fly or stand assailed by the most intolerable of vulgar farcesto be compared to a pelting of one on the stage the time came for him to knock at doors and face his public chapter xxviii by concessions to mistress gossip a further intrusion is averted livia welcomed him with commiserating inquiry behind her languid eyelids you have all the latest it said he struck on the burning matter you wish to know the part you have to play maam tell me russett you will contradict nothing her eyebrows asked it means you have authority from me to admit the facts they are facts she remarked women love teasing round certain facts apparently like the law

leading strings she turned to a brighter subject of no visible connection with the preceding henrietta comes in may the month of her colours her money troubles are terrible both of you appear unlucky in your partnersif winning was the object she shall have all the distractions we can offer your visit to the chartreuse alarmed her she has rejoiced her husband a girl she feared the jesuit in your friend feltre and she are about equally affected by music they shall meet russett this once i do entreat you to take counsel with your good sense and remember that you stand where you are by going against my advice it is a perfect storm over london the world has not to be informed of your generosity but a chivalry that invites the most horrible of sneers at a man and what can i say i have said it was impossible add the postscript you find it was perfectly possible i have to learn more than i care to hear your knowledge is not in request you will speak in my name will you consult your lawyers russett before you commit yourself i am on my way to lady arpington you cannot be thinking how serious it is i rather value the opinion of a hardheaded woman of the world why not listen to me you have your points maam shes a torch she serves my purpose livia shrugged sadly i suppose it serves your purpose to be unintelligible to me he rendered himself intelligible immediately by saying before i goa thousand oh my dear russett she sighed state the amount she seemed to be casting unwieldly figures and he helped her with mr isaacs not less than three i fear has he been pressing you are always good to us russett you are always considerate for the honour of the family maam order for the money with you here tomorrow and i thank you for your advice do me the favour to follow mine commands should be the word phrase it as you please you know i hate responsibility the chorus in classical dramas had generally that sentiment but the singing was the sweeter for it whom do you not win when you condescend to the mood you dear boy he restrained a bitter reply touching the kind of persons he had won a girl from the mountains a philosophical tramp of the roads troops of the bought livia spelt at the problem he was she put away the task of reading it he departed to see lady arpington and thereby rivet his chains as livia had said she was a torch lady endor lady eldritch lady cowry kindled at her again there were flights of the burning brands over london the very odd marriage the nomarriage the twoendsofthetown marriage and the maiden marriage a fruitful marriage the monstrous marriage of the countess productive in banishment and the unreadable earl accepting paternity this amazing marriage was again the riddle in the cracker for tattlers and gapers it rattled upon the worlds native wantonness the worlds acquired decorum societys irrepressible original and its powerfully resisting second nature all the rogues of the fine sphere ran about with it male and female and there was the narrative that suggestively skipped and that which trod the minuet measure dropping a curtsey to ravenous curiosity the apology surrendering its defensible cause in supplications to benevolence and the benevolence damnatory in a too eloquent urgency followed by the devout objection to a breath of the subject so blackening it as to call forth the profanely circumstantial exposition smirks blushes dead silences and in the lower regions roars hung round it but the lady though absent did not figure poorly at all granting whitechapel and the shillelagh affair certain whispers of her good looks contested only to be the more violently asserted and therewith rose mackrells tale of her being a young woman of birth having a romantic story to tell of herself and her parentage made her latest performance the champagne event of it hitherto men sparkled when they had it on their lips how then london asked would the earl of fleetwood move his pieces in reply to his countesss particularly clever indication of the check threatening mate his move had no relation to the game it was thought at first the world could not suppose that he moved a simple pawn on his marriage board he purchased a shop in piccadilly for the sale of fruit and flowers lady arpington was entreated to deal at the shop countess livia had her orders his friends his parasites and satellites were to deal there intensely earnest as usual he besought great ladies to let him have the overflow of their hothouses and they classing it as another of the mystifications of a purse crazy for repleteness inquired but is it you we are to deal with and he quite seriously said with me yes at present something was behind the curtain of course his gravity had the effect of the ultracomical in concealing it the shop was opened we have the assurance of rose mackrell that he entered and examined the piles and pans of fruit and the bouquets cunningly arranged by a hand smelling french the shop was roomy splendid windows lighted the yellow the golden the green and particoloured stores four doors off a chemists motley in bellied glasses crashed on the sight passengers along the pavement had presented to them such a contrast as might be shown if we could imagine the lethean ferryboatload brought sharp against pomonas lapful in addition to the plucked flowers and fruits of the shop rose mackrell more attentively examined the samples doing service at the counters they were three under supervision of a watchfuleyed fourth dame gossip is for quoting his wit but the conclusion he reached after quitting the shop and pacing his dozen steps is important for it sent a wind over the town to set the springs of tattle going as wildly as when the heralds trumpet blew the announcement for the world to hear out of wales he had observed that the young woman supervising was deficient in the ease of an established superior her brows were troubled she was therefore a lieutenant elevated from a lower grade and to his thinking conducted the business during the temporary retirement of the mistress of the shop and the mistress of the shop the question hardly needs be put rose mackrell or his humour answered it in unfaltering terms london heard with the variety of feelings which are indistinguishable under a flooding amazement that the beautiful new fruit and flower shop had been purchased and stocked by the fabulously wealthy young earl of fleetwood to give his whitechapel countess a taste for business an occupation and an honourable means of livelihood there was dame gossip thumps to say a general belief in this report crowds were on the pavement peering through the shopwindows carriages driving by stopped to look my lord himself had been visible displaying his array of provisions to friends nor was credulity damped appreciably when over the shop in gold letters appeared the name of sarah winch it might be the countesss maiden name if she really was a married countess but in truth the better informed of the town having begun to think its croesus capable of any eccentricity chose to believe they were at the pitch of excitement which demands and will swallow a succession of wilder extravagances to accelerate the delirium of the fun nothing was too much because any absurdity was anticipated and the earls readiness to be complimented on the shops particular merits his gratified air at an allusion to it whirled the fun faster he seemed entirely unconscious that each step he now took wakened peals for such is the fate of a man who has come to be dogged by the humourist for the provision he furnishes and as it happens he is the more laughable if not in himself a laughable object the earls handsome figure fine style and contrasting sobriety heightened the burlesque of his call to admiration of a shop where whitechapel would sit in stateaccording to the fiction so closely under the lee of fact that they were not strictly divisible moreover sarah winch whom chumley potts drew into conversation said he vowed she came up west from whitechapel she said it a little nervously but without blushing always on the side of the joke he could ask who can doubt indeed scepticism poisoned the sport the old buccaneer has written friends may laugh i am not roused my enemys laugh is a bugle blown in the night our enemys laugh at us rouses to wariness he would say he can barely mean that a condition of drowsihead is other than providently warned by laughter of friends an old warriors tough fibre would perhaps be insensible to that small crackle in civil life however the friends laugh at us is the loudest of the danger signals to stop our course and the very wealthy nobleman who is known for not a fool is kept from hearing it unless he does hear it he can have no suspicion of its being about him he cannot imagine such lesemajeste in the subservient courtiers too prudent to betray a sign so fleetwood was unwarned and his childlike unconsciousness of the boiling sentiments around seasoned pricked and maddened his parasites under compression to invent for a faint relief he had his title for them they their tales of him dame gossip would recount the tales she is of the order of persons inclining to suspect the tittle of truth in prodigies of scandal she is rustling and bustling to us of carinthia janes run up to london to see sarah winchs grand new shop an eclipse of all existing grand london western shops and of rose mackrells account of her dance of proud delight in the shop ending with a lovely cheese just as my lord enters and then a scene wild beyond any conceivable for pathos and humourher pet pair of the dissimilar twins both banging at us for teardrops by different roads through a common apertureand the earl has the whitechapel baby boy plumped into his arms and the countess fetches him a splendid bobdip and rises out of a second cheese to twirl and fandango it and all serious on a sudden request whimperingly beseech his thanks to her for the crowing successor she has presented him with my lord ultimately but carefully depositing the infant on a basket of the last oranges of the season fresh from the azores by delivery off my lords own schooneryacht in southampton water and escaping leaving his goldheaded stick behind hima trophy for the countess a weapon it may be quick she tucks up her skirts she is after him dame gossip speaks amusingly enough of the chase and many eyewitnesses to the earls flight at top speed down the right side of the way along by the green park and of a prince of the blood a portly royal duke on foot bumped by one or the other of them she cannot precisely say which but thinks it to have been carinthia jane because the exalted personage his shock of surprise abating turned and watched the chase in much merriment and it was called we are informed the piccadilly hare and hound from that day some tradition of an extenuated nobleman pursued by a lightfooted lady amid great excitement there is the dame attaches importance also to verses of one of the ballads beginning to gain currency at the time issuing ostensibly from londons poetic centre the seven dials which had we are to conjecture got the story by discolouring filtration through footmen retailing in publichouses the stock of anecdotes they gathered when stationed behind rose mackrells chair or captain abranes or chumley pottss and would have the whole of it quoted tho fair i be a powdered peruke and once was a gaping silly your whitechapel countess will prove lord duke shes a regular tigerlily shell fight you with cold steel or shell run you off your legs down the length of piccadilly that will satisfy and perhaps indicate the hand popular sympathy of course was all on the side of the fair as ever in those days when women had not forfeited it by stepping from their sanctuary seclusion the dame shall expose her confusions she really would seem to fancy that the ballad verifies the main lines of the story which is an impossible one carinthia had not the means to travel she was moneyless every bill of her establishment was paid without stint by mr howell edwards the earls manager of mines but she had not even the means for a journey to the gowerland rocks she longed to see she had none since she forced her brother to take the half of her share of their inheritance l and sent him the remainder accepted by chillon john as a loan says dame gossip and no sooner received than consumed by the pressing necessities of a husband with the rose beauty of england to support in the comforts and luxuries he deemed befitting still the dame leans to her opinion that carinthia jane may have been seen about london for where we have much smoke there must be fire and the countess never denying an imputation not brought against her in her hearing the ballad was unchallenged and londons wags had it their own way among the reasons why they so persistently hunted the earl his air of a smart correctness shadowed by this new absurdity invited them as when a spot of mud on the trimmest of countenances arrests observation humour plucked at him the more for the good faith of his handsome look under the prolific little disfigurement besides a wealthy despot with no conception of any hum around him will have the wags in his track as surely as the flexibles in front they avenge his exactions fleetwood was honestly unaware of ridicule in the condition of inventive mania at his heels scheming and hesitating to do onehalf of his mind was absorbed with the problem of how now to treat the mother of his boy her behaviour in becoming a mother was acknowledged to be good the production of a boy was goodconsiderate he almost thought he grew so far reconciled to her as to have intimations of a softness coming on a wish to hear her speak of the trifling kindness done to the sister of madge in reward of kindness done to her wishes for looks he remembered secret to him more his own than any possessions dozens of men had wealth some had beautiful wives none could claim as his own that face of the look of sharp steel melting into the bridal flower when she sprang from her bed to defend herself and recognized the intruder at her window stood smittenit is my husband moonlight gave the variation of her features and that did not appease the resentment tearing him from her so justifiable then as he forced himself to think now hideous glimpses of the pictures his deeds painted of him since his first meeting with this woman had to be shunned he threw them off they were set down to the mystery men are the degrading utterly different back view of them teaches that life is an irony if the teaching is not accepted and we are to take the blame can we bear to live therefore either way the irony of life is proved young men straining at thought in the grip of their sensations reach this logical conclusion they will not begin by examining the ground they stand on and questioning whether they have consciences at peace with the steps to rearward having established life as the coldly malignant element which induces to what it chastises a loathing of womanhood the deputed mother of life ensues by natural sequence and if there be one among women who disturbs the serenity we choose to think our due she wears for us the sinister aspect of a confidential messenger between nemesis and the parcae fleetwood was thus compelled to regard carinthia as both originally and successively the cause of his internal as well as his exterior discomfort otherwise those glimpses would have burnt into perpetual stigmas he had also to get his mind away from her they pleaded against him volubly with the rising of her image into it his manager at the mines had sent word of ominous discontent down there his presence might be required obviously then the threatened place was unfitting for the countess of fleetwood he despatched a kind of order through mr howell edwards that she should remove to esslemont to escape annoyances esslemont was the preferable residence she could there entertain her friends could spend a pleasanter time there he waited for the reply edwards deferred it were they to be in a struggle with her obstinate will once more henrietta was preparing to leave london for her dismal narrow and after an absence desired lovenest the earl called to say farewell cool as a loyal wife could wish him to be admiring perforce marriage and maternity withdrew nothingadded to the fair young womans bloom she had gone to her room to pack and dress livia received him in the midst of the casual commonplaces her memory was enlightened oh said she and idly drew a letter out of a blottingpad we have heard from wales she handed it to him before he knew the thing he did he was reading there is no rest foamy brother and i cannot help i am kept so poor i have not the smallest of sums i do not wish to leave walesthe people begin to love me and can one be mistaken i know if i am loved or hated but if my lord will give me an allowance of money of some hundreds i will do his bidding i will leave england or i will go to esslemont i could sayto mr woodseer in that part of london he would not permit he thinks me blacked by it like a sweepboy coming from a chimney and that i have done injury to his title no riette to be a true sister i must bargain with my lord before i submit he has not cared to come and see his little son his boy has not offended him there may be some of me in this dear i know whose features will soon show to defend the mothers good name he is early my champion he is not christened yet and i hear it accuse me and i am not to blamei still wait my lords answer dont be bothered to read the whole livia had said with her hand out when his eyes were halfway down the page fleetwood turned it to read the signature janey she seemed servile enough to some of her friends carinthia would have hada pleasanter sound he folded the letter why give me this take itsaid he she laid it on the open pad henrietta entered and had it restored to her livia remarking i found it in the blotter after all she left them together having to dress for the drive to the coach office with henrietta poor amusement for you this time fleetwood bowed gently smiling oh cried henrietta balls routs dinners musicas much music as i could desire even i what more could be asked i am eternally grateful the world says you are more beautiful than ever happiness does it thenhappiness owing to you lord fleetwood columelli pleases you his voice is heavenly he carries me away from earth he is a gentleman toorare with those fellows a pretty manner he will speak his compliments in his english you are seasoned to endure them in all languages pity another of your wounded brailstone has been hard hit at the tables i cannot pity gamblersmay i venturehalf a word tomes but just a little compassion for the devoted he wouldnt play so madlyif well say a tenth dilution of the rapt hearing columelli gets signor columelli sings divinely you dont dislike brailstone he is one of the agreeable he must put his feelings into italian song to put them aside will do we are not to have our feelings yes on the proviso that ours are respected but one instant lord fleetwood pray she isi have to speak of her as my sister i am sure she regrets she writes very nicely you have a letter from her henrietta sighed that it would not bear exposure to him yes nicely worded well yes it is he paused not expecting that the letter would be shown but silence fired shots and he had stopped the petition we are to have you for a weeks yachting you prescribe your company only be merciful exclusion will mean death to some columelli will be touring in switzerland you shall have him in the house when my new bit of ground northwest of london is open very handy ten miles out well have the opera troupe there and you shall command the opera her beauty sweetened to thank him if as livia said his passion for her was unchanged the generosity manifested in the considerate screen it wore over any physical betrayal of it deserved the lustre of her eyes it dwelt a moment vivid with the heart close behind and remorseful for misreading of old his fine character here was a young man who could be the very kindest of friends to the woman rejecting him to wed another her smile wavered how shall a loving wife express warmth of sentiment elsewhere without the one beam too much that plunges her on a tideway his claim of nothing called for everything short of the proscribed she gave him her beauty in fullest flower it had the appearance of a temptation and he was not tempted though he admired his thought being husband of the thing but he admired that condition awakened his unsatisfied past days to desire positive proof of her worthlessness the past days writhed in him the present were loveless entirely cold he had not even the wish to press her hand the market held beautiful women of a like description he wished simply to see her proved the thing he read her to be and not proved as such by himself he was unable to summon or imagine emotion enough for him to simulate the forms by which fair women are wooed to their perdition for all he cared any man on earth might try succeed or fail as long as he had visual assurance that she coveted a slave to the pleasures commanded by the wealth once disdained by her till that time he could not feel himself perfectly free dame gossip prefers to ejaculate young men are mysteries and bowl us onward no one ever did comprehend the earl of fleetwood she says he was bad he was good he was whimsical and stedfast a splendid figure a mark for ridicule romantic and a close arithmetician often a devil sometimes the humanest of creatures in fine he was a millionaire nobleman owning to a considerable infusion of welsh blood in the composition of him now to the cymry and to the pure kelt the past is at their elbows continually the past of their lives has lost neither face nor voice behind the shroud nor are the passions of the flesh nor is the animate soul wanting to it other races forfeit infancy forfeit youth and manhood with their progression to the wisdom age may bestow these have each stage always alive quick at a word a scent a sound to conjure up scenes in spirit and in flame historically they still march with cadwallader with llewellyn with glendower sing with aneurin taliesin old llywarch individually they are in the heart of the injury done them thirty years back or thrilling to the glorious deed which strikes an empty buckler for most of the sons of time an old sea rises in them rolling no phantom billows to break to spray against existing rocks of the shore that is why and even if they have a dose of the teuton in them they have often to feel themselves exiles when still in amicable community among the preponderating saxon english add to the single differentiation enormous wealthwe convulse the excellent dame by terming it a chained hurricane to launch in foul blasts or beneficent showers according to the moods during youthand the composite lord fleetwood comes nearer into our focus dame gossip with her jigging to be at the butterwomans trot when she is not violently interrupting would suffer just punishment were we to digress upon the morality of a young mans legal possession of enormous wealth as well wholly cambrian fleetwood was not but he had to the full the cambrians reverential esteem for high qualities his goodbye with henrietta and estimate of her left a dusky mental void requiring an orb of some sort for contemplation and an idea of the totally contrary carinthia the woman he had avowedly wedded usurped her place qualities were admitted she was thrust away because she had offended still more because he had offended she bore the blame for forcing him to an examination of his conduct at this point and that where an ancestral savage in his lineaments cocked a strange eye yet at the moment of the act of the deed he had known himself the veritable fleetwood he had now to vindicate himself by extinguishing her under the load of her unwomanliness she was like sundried linen matched beside oriental silk she was rough crisp unyielding that was now the capital charge henrietta could never be guilty of the unfeminine which did he prefer it is of all questions the one causing young men to screw wry faces when they are asked they do so love the feminine the ultrafeminine whom they hate for her inclination to the frail his depths were sounded and he answered independently of his will that he must be up to the heroical pitch to decide carinthia stood near him then the confession was a step and fraught with consequences her unacknowledged influence expedited him to sarah winchs shop for sight of one of earths honest souls from whom he had the latest of the two others down in wales and of an infant there he dined the host of his ixionides leaving them early for a drive at night eastward and a chat with old mr woodseer over his punching and sewing of his bootleather another honest soul mr woodseer thankfully consented to mount his coachbox next day and astonish gower with a drop on his head from the skies about the time of the midday meal there we have our peep into dame gossips young man mysterious chapter xxix carinthia in wales an august of gales and rains drove atlantic air over the welsh highlands carinthias old father had impressed on her the rapture of smelling salt when by chance he stood and threw up his nostrils to sniff largely over a bed of bracken that reminded him of his element and her fancy would be at strain to catch his once proud riding of the seas she felt herself an elder daughter of the beloved old father as she breathed it in full volume from the billowy west one morning early after sunrise and walked sisterly with the farseen inexperienced little maid whom she saw trotting beside him through the mountain forest listening storing his words picturing the magnetic veined great gloom of an untasted world this elder daughter had undergone a shipwreck but clear proof that she had not been worsted was in the unclouded liveliness of the younger one gazing forward imaginative creatures who are courageous will never be lopped of the hopeful portion of their days by personal misfortune carinthia could animate both it would have been a hurt done to a living human soul had she suffered the younger self to run overcast only the gazing forward had become interdicted to her experienced self nor could she vision a future having any horizon for her child she saw it in bleak squares and snuggled him between dangers weathered and dangers apprehended the conviction that her husband hated her had sunk into her nature hating the mother he would not love her boy he was her boy and strangely bestowed not beautifully to be remembered rapturously or gratefully and with deep love of the father she felt the wound recollection dealt her but the boy was her one treasure and no treasure to her husband they were burdens and the heir of his house child of a hated mother was under perpetual menace from an unscrupulous tyrannical man the dread and antagonism were first aroused by the birth of her child she had not known while bearing him her present acute sensation of the hunted flying and at bay previously she could say i did wrong here i did wrong there distrust had brought the state of war which allows not of the wasting of our powers in confessions her husband fed her and he clothed her the limitation of his bounty was sharply outlined sure of her rectitude a stranger to the world she was not very sensible of dishonour done to her name it happened at times that her father inquired of her how things were going with his little carin and then revolt sprang up and answered on his behalf rather fiercely she was however prepared for any treaty including forgiveness if she could be at peace in regard to her boy and have an income of some help to her brother chillon was harassed on all sides she stood incapable of aiding so foolishly feeble in the shadow of her immense longing to strive for him that she could think her husband had purposely lamed her with an infant her love of her brother now the one man she loved laid her insufficiency on the rack and tortured imbecile cries from it on the contrary her strange husband had blest her with an infant everything was pardonable to him if he left her boy untouched in the mothers charge much alone as she was she raised the dead to pet and cherish her boy chillon had seen him and praised him mrs owain wythan her neighbour over a hill praised him above all babes on earth poor childless woman she was about to cross the hill and breakfast with mrs wythan the time for the weaning of the babe approached and had as prospect beyond it her dull fear that her husband would say the mothers work was done and seize the pretext to separate them and she could not claim a longer term to be giving milk because her father had said not a quarter of a month more than nine for the milk of the motheror else the child would draw an unsustaining nourishment from the strongest breast she could have argued her exceptional robustness against another than he but the dead father wanting to build a great race of men and women ruled carinthia knelt at the cradle of a princeling gone from the rich repast to his alternative kingdom you will bring him over when he wakes she said to madge mrs wythan would like to see him every day martha can walk now she can walk and hold a child in her two arms my lady said madge she expects miners popping up out of the bare ground when she sees no goblins theythey know him they would not hurt him they know my son her mistress answered the population of the mines in revolt had no alarms for her the works were empty down below men sat by the wayside brooding or strolled in groups now and then loudly exercising their tongues or they stood in circle to sing hymns melancholy chants of a melancholy time for all how would her father have acted by these men he would have been among them dissensions in his mine were vapours of a day lords behaved differently carinthia fancied the people must regard their master as a foreign wizard whose power they felt without the chance of making their cry to him heard she too dealt with a lord it was now his wish for her to leave the place where she had found some shreds of a home in the thought of being useful she was gathering the peoples language many of their songs she could sing and please them by singing to them they were not suspicious of her at least their women had open doors for her the men if shy were civil she had only to go below she was greeted in the quick tones of their speech all along the street of the slateroofs but none loved the castle and she as little saving the one room in it where her boy lay the grey of welsh history knew a real castle beside the roaring brook frequently a torrent this was an eighteenth century castellated habitation on the verge of a small wood midway up the height and it required a survey of numberless happy recollections to illumine its walls or drape its chambers the permanently lighted hearth of a dear home as in that forsaken unfavoured old white house of the wooded austrian crags it had not rather it seemed a place waiting for an ill deed to be done in it and stop all lighting of hearths thereafter out on the turf of the shaven hills her springy step dispersed any misty fancies her shortwinged hive set to work in her head as usual building scaffoldings of great things to be done by chillon present evils escaped the rolling big bade hills with the riding clouds excited her as she mounted and she was a figure of gladness on the ridge bending over to hospitable plas llwyn where the wythans lived entertaining rich and poor alike they had led the neighbourhood to call on the discarded countess of fleetwood a warm strain of arms about her neck was carinthias welcome from mrs wythan lying along the couch in her boudoir an established invalid who yearned sanely to life and caught a spark of it from the guest eyed tenderly by her as they conversed our boyour chillon kirby till he has his baptism names he is well i am to see him he follows me he sleeps almost through the night now ah my dear mrs wythan sighed imagining it would disappoint me if he did not wake me i wake at his old time and watch him carinthia put on the babys face in the soft mould of slumber i see him mrs wythan cried he is part mine he has taught owain to love babies a tray of breakfast was placed before the countess mr wythan is down among his men she said every morning as long as this agitation lasts i need not say good appetite to you after your walk you have no fear of the men i know owains men are undisturbed he has them in hand absentee masters cant expect continued harmony dear he tells me mr edwards awaits the earl drinking her tea carinthias eyelids shut she set down her cup if he must come she said he wishes me to leave i am to go again where i have no friends and no language to learn and can be of no use it is not for me that i dread his coming he speaks to command the men ask to be heard he will have submission first they do not trust him his coming is a danger for me i should wish him to come may i say your rebecca bids you say my darling it is i am with the men because i am so like them i beg to be heard he commands obedience he is a great nobleman but i am the daughter of a greater man and i have to say that if those poor miners do harm i will not stand by and see an anger against injustice punished i wish his coming for him to agree upon the christian names of the boy i feel his coming will do me injury in making me offend him worse i would avoid that oh dear soul i may say it to youhe cannot hurt me any more i am spared loving him when i forgive him and i do the loving is the pain that is gone by mrs wythan fondled and kissed carinthias hand let me say in my turn i may help you dear you know i have my husbands love as he mine am i have i ever been a wife to him here i lie a dead weight to be carried up and down all of a wife that owain has had for years i lie and pray to be taken that my good man my proved good man may be free to choose a healthy young woman and be rewarded before his end by learning what a true marriage is the big simpleton will otherwise be going to his grave thinking he was married i see him stepping about softly in my room so contented if he does not disturb me and he crushes me with a desire to laugh at him while i worship i tricked him into marrying the prostrate invalid i am and he cant discover the trick he will think its a wife he has instead of a doctors doll oh you have a strange husband it has been a strange marriage for you but you have your invincible health you have not to lie and feel the horror of being a deception to a guileless man whose love blindfolds him the bitter ache to me is that i can give nothing you abound in power to give carinthia lifted her open hands for sign of their emptiness my brother would not want if i could give he may have to sell out of the army he thinks fears and i must look on our mother used to say she had done something for her country in giving a son like chillon to the british army poor mother our bright opening days all seem to end in rain we should turn to mr wythan for a guide he calls you morgan le fay christianized what i am carinthia raised and let fall her head an example makes dwarfs of us when mr wythan does penance for temper by descending into his mine and working among his men for a day with the pick seated as he showed me down below that is an example if i did like that i should have no firedamp in the breast and not such a task to forgive that when i succeed i kill my feelings the entry of madge and martha the nursegirl with the overflowing armful of baby changed their converse into melodious exclamations kit ines has arrived my lady madge said i saw him on the road and stopped a minute mrs wythan studied carinthia her sharp invalids ears had caught the name she beckoned the man whothe fighting man it will be my child this time said carinthia i have no fear for myself she was trembling though her features were hard for the war her lord had declared as it seemed did he tell you his business here she asked of madge he says to protect you my lady since you wont leave he stays at the castle he is to stay there he says as long as the welsh are out the welsh are misunderstood by lord fleetwood mrs wythan said to carinthia he should live among them they will not hurt their lady protecting may be his intention but we will have our baby safe here not she appealed and babys mother how otherwise you read my wishes carinthia rejoined the man i do not think a bad man he has a master while i am bound to my child i must be restful and with the man at the castle marthas goblins would jump about me day and night my boy makes a coward of his mother we merely take a precaution and i have the pleasure of it said her hostess give orders to your maid not less than a fortnight it will rejoice my husband so much as with the warmly hospitable few were the words madge was promised by her mistress plenty of opportunities daily for seeing kit ines and her mouth screwed to one of womens dimples at a corner she went off in a cart to fetch boxes thinking we are a hunted lot so she was not mildly disposed for the company of mr kit on her return to the castle englands champion lightweight thought it hard that his coming down to protect the castle against the gibbering heathen welsh should cause a clearing out and solitariness for his portion whats the good of innocence if you re always going to suspect a man he put it like a true son of the pirates turned traders ive got a paytron and a man in my profession must have a paytron or where is he wheres his money for a trial of skill say he saves and borrows and finds the lump to clap it down and hes knocked out o time there he is bankrup and a devil of a licking into the bargain that s the cream of our profession if a man has got no paytron no prizering can live without one the odds are too hard on us my lady ought to take into account i behaved respectful when i was obliged to do my lords orders and remove her from our haunts which wasnt to his taste here im like a cannon for defending the house needs be and all inside flies off scarified it strikes me kit ines a man with a paytron is no better than a tool of a man said madge and dont you go to be sneering at honest tools ines retorted when will women learn a bit of the world before theyre made hags of by old father wearandtear a young woman in her prime you madge be such a fool as not see i serve tool to stock our shop your paytron bid you steal off with my ladys child kit ines youd do it to stock your shop ines puffed if you aint a girl to wallop the wind fancy me at that game is that why my ladybut i cant be suspected that far you make me break out at my pores my paytrons a gentleman he wouldnt ask and i couldnt act such a part dear lord itd have to be stealing off for my lady can use a stick and put it to the choice between my lady and her child and any paytron living paytron be damned id say rathern go against my notions of honour have you forgot all our old talk about the prizering the nursery of honour in old england that was before you sold yourself to a paytron kit ines ah women wants mastheading off and on for em to have a bit of a lookout over life as it is they go stewing over books of adventure and drop into frights about awful man take me now you had a no small admiration for my manly valour once and you trusted yourself to me and did you ever repent itowning youre not the young woman to tempt to t other way you wouldnt have found me talking to you here if i had and here im left to defend an empty castle am i dont drink or youll have your paytron on you hes good use there i ask it can i see my lady drunk nor sober you wont serve a paytron be a leper youll find with all honest folk ines shook out an execrating leg at the foul word leper you say you say that you say leper to me strut your tallest kit ines its the money rattles in your pocket says it its my reputation for decent treatment of a woman lets you say it madge winch stick to that as long as your paytron consents its the one thing youve got left benefit you hussy and mind you dont pull too stiff be the woman and have the last word his tongue was checked he swallowed the exceeding sourness of a retort undelivered together with the feeling that she beat him in the wrangle by dint of her being an unreasonable wench madge huffed away to fill her boxes he stood by the cart hands deep down his pockets when she descended she could have laughed at the spectacle of a champion prizefighter out of employ hulking idle because he was dog to a paytron but her contempt of him declined passing in small change so youre off what am i to tell my lord when he comes kit growled his yachts fetching for a welsh seaport she counted it a piece of information gained and jumped to her seat bidding the driver start to have pretty well lost her character for a hero changed into a patrons dog was a thought that outweighed the show of incivility some little distance away she reproached herself for not having been so civil as to inquire what day my lord was expected by his appointment the girl reflected on the strangeness of a body of discontented miners bringing my lord and my lady close perhaps to meet chapter xxx rebecca wythan the earl was looked for at the chief office of the mines and each day an expectation of him closed in disappointment leaving it to be surmised that there were more serious reasons for his continued absence during a crisis than any discussed whether indeed as when a timepiece neglects to strike the hour which is by the reckoning of natural impatience past the capital charge of crazy works must not be brought against a nobleman hitherto precise upon business of a just disposition fairly humane for though he was an absentee sucking the earth through a tube in ottoman ease he had never omitted the duty of personally attending on the spot to grave cases under dispute the son of the hardheaded father came out at a crisis and not too highhandedly he could hear an opposite argument to the end therefore since he refused to comply without hearing he was wanted on the spot imperatively now irony perusing history offers the beaten and indolent a sugary acid in the indication of the spites and the pranks the whims and the tastes at the springs of main events it is taken by itself destructive nourishment but those who labour in the field to shovel the clods of earth to history would be wiser of their fellows for a minor dose of it mr howell edwards consulting with mr owain wythan on the necessity that the earl should instantly keep his promise to appear among the men and stop the fermentation as in our younger days a lordly owner still might do by small concessions and the physical influencethe nervecharmcould suppose him to be holding aloof for his pleasure or his pride perhaps because of illness or inability to conceive the actual situation at a distance he mentioned the presence of the countess and mr wythan mentioned it neither of them thinking a rational man would so play the lunatic as to let men starve and wreck precious mines for the sake of avoiding her sullen days went by on these days of the slatecloud or the leadenwinged carinthia walked over the hills to her staring or downeyed silent people admitted without a welcome at some doors rejected at some her baskets from the castle were for the most part received as graciously she continued to direct them for delivery where they were needed and understood why a charity that supplied the place of justice was not thanked she and her people here were one regarding the master as she had said they could not hurt her sensitiveness she felt too warmly with them and here it was not the squalid flat bricked eastcorner of london at the close of her daily pilgrimage up from the solitary street of the slateroofs she mounted a big hill and had the life of high breathing a perpetual escape out of the smoky grimy city mazes was trumpeted to her in the winds up there a recollected contrast lightened the skyless broad spaces overhead almost to sunniness having air of the hills and activity for her limbs she made sunshine for herself regrets were at no time her nestlings look backward only to correct an error of conduct for the next attempt says one of her fathers maxims as sharply bracing for women as for men she did not look back to moan now that her hunger for the safety of her infant was momentarily quieted she could see kit ines hanging about the lower ground near the alehouse and smile at madges comparison of him to a drummedout soldier who would like to be taken for a holiday pensioner he saluted under the suspicion of his patrons lady his legs were hampered he dared not approach her though his innocence of a deed not proposed to him yetand all to stock that girl madges shop if done knocked at his ribs with fury to vindicate himself before the lady and her maid a gentleman met them and conducted them across the hills and two taffy gentlemen would hardly be sufficient for the purpose supposing an illused englishman inclined to block their waywhat and play footpad kit ines no its just a game in the head but a true man hates to feel himself suspected his refuge is the beer of the country next day there were the two gentlemen to conduct the lady and her maid and taffy the first walks beside the countess and that girl madge trudges along with no other than my lords mr woodseer chattering like a wateringcan on a gardenbed deuce a glance at kit ines how can she keep it up and the gentleman no more than nodding how does he enjoy playing second fiddle with the maid while mr tall brownface taffy violins it to her ladyship a stones throw in front ines had less curiosity to know the object of mr woodseers appearance on the scene idle unhandsomely treated and a cave of the yawns he merely commented on his observations yes there he is dont look at him madge said to gower and whatever hes here for he has a bad time of it and rather more than its pleasant for him to think over if a slave to a paytron thinks at all i wont judge him my mistress is bitten with the fear for the child worse than ever and the earl my lord not coming and he wanting her to move again seems to her he durstnt do it here and intends to snap at the child on the road shes forced to believe anything of such a husband and father and why does he behave so i cant spell it hes kind to my sallyyouve seen the piccadilly shopbecause she was she did her best in love and duty for my lady and behaves like a husband hating his wifes life on earth then he went down with good mr woodseer and called on sally pretending to inquire after she was kidnapped by that kit ines acting to please his paytron he must be shown up to the room where she slept and stands at the door and peeps in sallys letter says and asks if he may enter the room he went to the window looking on the chimneys she used to see and touched an ornament over the fireplace called grandfathers pigtail casehe was a sailor only a ridiculous piece of china that made my lady laugh about the story of its holding a pigtail but he turns it over because she didsally told him he couldnt be pretending when he bought the beautiful shop and stocked it for sally he gets her lots of customers and no rent to pay till next michaelmas a year shes a made woman through him he said to her he had heard from mr woodseer the countess of fleetwood called her sister he shook her hand the countess of fleetwood called both of you her sisters i think said gower im her servant id rather serve her than have a fortune you were born with a fortune one would like to have a nibble at madge i cant lay hand on it then its the capacity for giving my dear please mr gower dont say that youll make me cry he keeps his wife so poor she hasnt a shilling of her own she wearies about her brother she cant help he can spend hundreds on my sally for having been good to her in our small wayits a fairy tale and he wont hear of money for his wife except that shes never to want for anything it can buy you give what it cant buy me im a pugilists wenchive heard myself called she was the first who gave me a lift never mind me have you come to take her away shed trust herself and the child to you take herreason with her as to the best we can do he holds off from a meeting just now i fancy hes wearing round to it his keeping his wife without money passes comprehension after serving him for a few months i had a store invested to support me for yearsas much as i need before i join the ranks of the pen i was at my reading and writing and drowsing and down he rushes i m in harness again i cant say its dead waste of time besides i pick up an independence for the days ahead but i dont respect myself for doing the work heres the difference between us two servants madge i think of myself and you dont the difference is more like between the master and mistress we serve mr gower well id rather be the woman in this case you know the reputation ive got and can only just read and cant spell my mistress teaches me bits of german and french on her walks gower took a new observation of this girl whom he had not regarded as like himself a pushing blade among the grasses he proposed to continue her lessons if she cared to learn saying it could be done in letters i wont be ashamed of writing if you mean it said she my mistress will have a usefuller servant she had a strange honeymoon of a marriage if ever wasand told me t other day she was glad because it brought us togethershe a born lady a flingabove born ladies shes quick as light to hit on a jewel where there is one whether it shines or not she stands among the verities of the world yes madge said panting for more do speak of her when you praise her i feel shes not wasted mistress and friend and wifeif hed let her be and mother never mother like her the boy ll be a sturdy shell see he has every chance hes a lucky little one to have that mother you think her handsome madge gower asked it wishing to hear a devotees confusion of qualities and looks the question was a drop on lower spheres and it required definitions to touch the exact nature of the form of beauty and excuse a cooler tone on the commoner plane these demanded language she rounded the difficulty saying you see engravings of archery that s her figureher real figure i think her face i cant describe it flashes thats it said gower delighted with his perception of a bare mind at work and hitting the mark perforce of warmth when it flashes its unequalled theres the supremacy of irregular lines people talk of perfect beauty suitable for paintings and statues living faces if theyre to show the soul which is the star on the peak of beauty must lend themselves to commotion nature does it in a breezy tree or over ruffled waters repose has never such splendid reach as animationi mean in the living face artists prefer repose only nature can express the uttermost beauty with her gathering and tuning of discords well your mistress has that beauty i remember my impression when i saw her first on her mountains abroad other beautiful faces of women go pale grow stale the diversified in the harmony of the flash are natures own her radiant made of her many notes beyond our dreams to reproduce we cant hope to have a true portrait of your mistress does madge understand the literary dose was a strong one for her but she saw the index and got a lift from the sound her bosom heaved oh i do try mr gower i think i do a little i do more while youre talking you are good to talk so to me you should have seen her the night she went to meet my lord at those beastly gardens kit ines told me he was going to she was defending him ive no words you teach me whats meant by poetry i couldnt understand that once their eyes were on the countess and her escort in advance gowers praises of her mistresss peculiar beauty set the girl compassionately musing his eloquence upon the beauty was her clue carinthia and mr wythan started at a sharp trot in the direction of the pair of ponies driven by a groom along the curved decline of the narrow roadway his whip was up for signal it concerned the house and the master of it his groom drove rapidly down while he hurried on the homeward way as a man will do with the dread upon him that his wifes last breath may have been yielded before he can enfold her carinthia walked to be overtaken not daring to fever her blood at a swifter pace lamed with an infant the thought recurred she is very ill she has fainted she lies insensible madge heard from her of mrs wythan we were speaking of her when the groom appeared it has happened twice they fear the third he fears it though he laughs at a superstition now step i know you like walking mr woodseer once i left you behind i have the whole scene of the angel and the cripple gower replied o that day they were soon speculating on the unimpressionable house in its clump of wood midway below which had no response for anxieties a maidservant at the garden gate by mr wythans orders informed carinthia that her mistress had opened her eyes there was a hope of weathering the ominous third time but the hope was a bird of short flight from bush to bush until the doctor should speak to confirm it even the child was under the shadow of the house carinthia had him in her arms trusting to life as she hugged him and seeing innumerable darts out of all regions assailing her treasure she wishes to have you mr wythan came and said to her almost her first word the heart is quickening she will live for me if she can he whispered it his features shot the sparkle rebecca wythan had strength to press carinthias hand faintly she made herself heard no pain her husband sat upright quite still attentive for any sign his look of quiet pleasure ready to show sprightliness dwelt on her she returned the look unable to give it greeting past the sense of humour she wanted to say see the poor simple fellow who will think it a wife that he has she did but look carinthia spoke his name mr wythan by chance and rebecca breathed heavily until she formed the words owain to me to me owain added the three formed a chain of clasped hands it was in the mind of the sick lady to disburden herself of more than her weakness could utter so far was she above earthly links the desire in her was to be quit of the flesh bearing a picture of her husband as having the dues of his merits her recovered strength next day brought her nearer to our laws you will call him owain carinthia she said he is not one to presume on familiarity i must be going soon i cannot leave him the wife i would choose i can leave him the sister he is a sure friend he is the knightly man women dream of i harp on it because i long for testimony that i leave him to have some reward and this may be between two so pure at heart as you two dear soul friend yes and owain yes i can say it carinthia rejoined brother i have only my chillon my life is now for him i am punished for separating myself from the son of my father i have no heart for a second brother what i can give to my friend i will i shall love you in him if i am to lose you not owainit was i was the wretch refused to call on the lonely lady at the castle until i heard she had done a romantic little bit of thinghushed a lambkins bleating my loss my loss and i could afford it so poorly since then carinthia has filled my days i shudder to leave you and think of your going back to the english their sneer withers they sent you down among us as a young woman to be shunned i did wildly i was ungoverned i had one idea said carinthia one idea is a bullet good for the day of battle to beat the foe father tells us it was a madness in me now it has gone i see all round i see straight too with one idea we see nothingnothing but itself whizz we go i did i shall no longer offend in that way mr gower woodseer is here from my lord with him the child will be safe i am not alarmed it is to requestthey would have me gone to prepare the way for my lord you have done it he has the castle to himself i cannotspare you a tyrant ordering you to go should be defied my lord fleetwood puts lightning into my slow veins we have talked we shall be reproved by the husband and the doctor said carinthia sullen days continued and rolled over to night at the mines gowers mission was rendered absurd by the countesss withdrawal from the castle he spoke of it to mr wythan once and the latter took a big breath and blew such a lord to the winds persuade our guest to leave us that the air may not be tainted for her husband when he comes he neednt call hes not obliged to see her shes offered esslemont to live in i believe her instincts righthe has designs on the child a little more and we shall have a mad dog in the fellow he doubles my work by keeping his men out if she were away we should hear of black doings twenty dozen of his pugilists wouldnt stop the burning they agreed that persuasions need not be addressed to the countess she was and would remain mr wythans guest as for the earl gower inclined to plead hesitatingly still to plead on behalf of a nobleman owning his influence and very susceptible to his wisdom whose echo of a pointed saying nearly equalled the satisfaction bestowed by print the titled man affected the philosopher in that manner or rather the crude philosophers relish of brilliant appreciation stripped him of his robe for he was with owain wythan at heart to scorn titles which did not distinguish practical offices a nation bowing to them has gone to pith for him he had to shake himself that he might not similarly stick he had to do it often objects elevated even by a decayed world have their magnetism for us unless we nerve the mind to wakeful repulsion he protested he had reason to think the earl was humanizing though he might be killing a woman in the process could she wish for better he asked with at least the gravity of the undermining humourist and he started owain to course an idea when he remarked of lord fleetwood imagine a devil on his back on a river flying a cherub owain sparkled from the vision of the thing to wrath with it ay but while hes floating his people are edging on starvation and ive a personal grievance i keep you know open hall bread and cheese and beer for poor mates his men are favouring us with a call we have to cart treble from the town if i straighten the sticks he dies to bend itll be a grievance against meand a fig for it but i like to be at peace with my neighbours and waft them penillion instead of dealing the cleddyfal of llewellyn at last the tension ceased they had intelligence of the earls arrival his countess was little moved by it and the reason for that lay in her imagination being absorbed henrietta had posted her a journal telling of a deed of chillons no great feat but precious for its likeness to him as they phrased it that is for the light it cast on their conception of the man heading a squadron in a riotous midland town he stopped a charge after fire of a shot from the mob and galloped up the street to catch a staggering urchin to his saddlebow and place the mite in safety then it was a simple trot of the hussars ahead way was made for him now to see what banquet there is for the big of heart in the worlds hot stress take the view of carinthia to whom her brothers thoughtful little act of gentleness at the moment of the redofthepowder smoke was divinest bread and wine when calamity hung around with the future an unfooted wilderness her powers untried her husband her enemy chapter xxxi we have again to deal with the examples of our younger man the most urgent of dames is working herself up to a grey squall in her detestation of imagerial epigrams otherwise gower woodseers dash at the quintessential young man of wealth would prompt to the carrying of it further and telling how the tethered flutterer above a devil on his back on a river was beginning to pull if not drag his withholder and teaser fleetwood had almost a desire to see the small dot of humanity which drew the breath from himand was indistinguishably the bubbly grin and gurgle of the nurses he could swear he kicked at the bondage to our common fleshly nature imposed on him by the mother of the little animal but there had been a mother to his father odd movements of a warmish curiosity brushed him when the cynic was not mounting guard they were it seemed externalno part of him like blasts of a wayside furnace across wintry air they were as it chanced natures woman in him plucking at her separated partner customs man something of an oriental voluptuary on his isolated regal seat and he would suck the pleasures without a descent into the stale old ruts where lifes convict couple walk linked to one another to their issue more there was also a cold curiosity to see the male infant such a mother would have the grandson of old lawless might turn out a rascalhe would be no mean one no coward that mother too who must have been a touch astonished to find herself a motherfleetwood laughed a curt bark and heard rebukes and pleaded the marriagetrap to the man of his word devil and cherub were at the tug or say dog and gentleman a survival of the schoolboythat mother a girl of the mountains perhaps wanted no more than smoothing by the world it is my husband sounded foolish sounded freshisha new note would she repeat it the bit of simplicity would bear repeating once gower woodseer says the creature grows and studies to perfect herself shes a good way off that and may spoil herself in the process but she has a certain power her donkey obstinacy in refusing compliance and her pursuit of my husband and ability to drench him with ridicule do not exhibit the ordinary young female she stamps her impression on the people she meets her husband is shaken to confess it likewise despite a disagreement between them he has owned he is her husband he has not disavowed the consequence that fellow gower woodseer might accuse the husband of virtually lying if he by his conduct implied her distastefulness or worse by heaven as felon a deed as could be done argue the case anyhow it should be undone let her but cease to madden for whatever the rawness of the woman she has qualities and experience of the facile loves of london very sharply defines her qualities think of her as raw she has the gift of rareness forget the donkey obstinacy her character grasps in the grasp of her character one inclines and her husband inclines to become her advocate she has only to discontinue maddening the wealthy young noble prized any form of rareness wherever it was visible having no thought of the purchase of it except with worship he could listen pleased to the talk of a methodist minister sewing bootleather he picked up a roadside tramp and made a friend of him and valued the fellows honesty submitted to his lectures pardoned his insolence the sight of carinthias narrow bedroom and strip of bed over sarah winchs whitechapel shop had gone a step to drown the bobbing whitechapel countess at least he had not been hunted by that gaunt chalkquarry ghost since his peep into the room own it she likewise has things to forgive women nurse their larvae of ideas about fair dealing but observe the distinction aid if women understood justice they would be the first to proclaim that when two are tied together the one who does the other serious injury is more naturally excused than the one whotenfold abhorrent if a womancalls up the grotesque to extinguish both with this apology for himself lord fleetwood grew tolerant of the person honourably avowed as his wife so therefore the barrier between him and his thoughts of her was broken the thoughts carrying red doses were selected finally the taste to meet her sprouted if agreeable she could be wooed if barely agreeable tormented if disagreeable left as before although it was the hazard of a die he decided to follow his taste her stay at the castle had kept him long from the duties of his business and he could imagine it a grievance if he pleased but he put it aside alighting at his chief managers office he passed through the heated atmosphere of blackbrowed wiry little rebels who withheld the salute as they lounged a posture often preceding the spring in compulsorily idle workers he was aware of instinct abroad an antagonism to the proprietors rights they roused him to stand by them and were his own form of instinct handsomely clothed it behoved that he should examine them and the claims against them to be sure of his ground he and mr howell edwards debated the dispute for an hour agreeing partially differing there was a weakness on the principle in edwards these fellows fixed to the spot are for compromise too much an owner of mines has no steady reckoning of income if the rate of wage is perpetually to shift according to current mostly ignorant versions of the prosperity of the times are we so prosperous it is far from certain and if the rate ascends the question of easing it down to suit the discontinuance of prosperity agitating our exchequerwhose demand is for fixityperplexes us further however that was preliminary he and howell edwards would dine and wrangle it out the earl knew himself a hot disputant after dinner incidentally he heard of lady fleetwood as a guest of mrs wythan and the circumstance was injurious to him because he stood against mr wythans pampering system with his men ines up at the castle smelt of beer and his eyelids were sottish nothing to do tries the virtue of the best he sought his excuse in a heavy lamentation over my ladys unjust suspicion of hima known man of honour though he did serve his paytron the cause of lady fleetwoods absence was exposed to her outraged lord who had sent the man purely to protect her at this castle where she insisted on staying the suspicion cast on the dreary lusher was the wifes wild shot at her husband one could understand a silly womans passing terror her acting under the dictate of it struck the husbands ribbed breast as a positive clap of hostilities between them across a chasm his previous placable mood was immediately conceived by him to have been one of his fits of generosity a step to a frightful dutiful embrace of an almost repulsive object he flung the thought of her back on her whitechapel she returned from that place with smiles dressed in a laundry white with a sprinkle of smuts appearing to him as an adversary armed and able to strike there was a blow for he chewed resentments and these were goaded by a remembered shyness of meeting her eyes when he rounded up the slope of the hill in view of his castle where he supposed she would be awaiting my husband the silence of her absence was lively mockery of that anticipation gower came on him sauntering about the grounds youre not very successful down here fleetwood said without greeting the countess likes the air of this country said gower evasively impertinently and pointlessly offensively to the despot employing him to be either subservient or smart i wish her to leave it she wishes to see you first she takes queer measures i start tomorrow for my yacht at cardiff there the matter ended for fleetwood fell to talking of the mines at dinner and after dinner it was the topic and after howell edwards had departed when the man who has a heart will talk of nothing but what concerns his interests and the heart is hurt it may be perceived by a cognizant friend that this is his proud mute way of petitioning to have the tenderer subject broached gower was sure of the heart armoured or bandaged though it wasa haunt of evil spirits as welland he began now to speak of me half a minute you cajoled me out of my surrey room where i was writing in the vein ive had the scene before me the earl interposed juniper dells and that tree of the flashing leaf and that dear old boy your father young as you and me and saying love of nature gives us eternal youth on with you i doubted whether i should be of use to you i told you the amount of alloy in my motives a year with you i have subsistence for ten years assured to me dont be a prosy dog gower woodseer will you come over to the wythans before you go i will not you would lengthen your stride across a wounded beast i see no wound to the beast you can permit yourself to kick under cover of a metaphor tell me what you drive at gower the request is for you to spare pain by taking one stepan extra strain on the muscles of the leg it s only the leg wants moving the lady has legs to run away let them bring her back why have me with you then im useless but you read us all see everything and wait only for the mood to do the right you read me and im not open to everybody you read the crux of a man like me in my novel position you read my admiration of a beautiful woman and effort to keep honest you read my downright preference of what most people would call poverty and my enjoyment of good cookery and good company you enlist among the crew below as one of our tempters you find i come round to the thing i like best therefore you have your liking for me and thats why you turn to me again after your natural infidelities so much for me you read this priceless lady quite as clearly you choose to cloud her with your moods she was at a disadvantage arriving in a strange country next to friendless and each new incident bred of a luckless beginningi could say more fleetwood nodded you are read without the words you read in history too i suppose that there are two sides to most cases the loudest is not often the strongest however now the lady shows herself crazed thats reading her charitably else she has to be taken for a spiteful shrew who pretends to suspect anything thats villanous because she can hit on no other way of striking crazed is a wide shot and hits half the world muttered gower lady fleetwood had a troubled period after her marriage she suffered a sort of kidnapping when she was bearing her child theres a book by an edinburgh doctor might be serviceable to you it enlightens me she will have a distrust of you as regards the child until she understands you by living with you under one roof such animals these women are good lord fleetwood ejaculated i marry one and i m to take to reading medical books he yawned you speak that of women and pretend to love nature said gower you hate nature unless you have it served on a dish by your own cook thats the way to the madhouse or the monastery there we expiate the sin of sins a man finds the woman of all women fitted to stick him in the soil and trim and point him to grow and shes an animal for her pains the secret of your malady is youve not yet though youre on a healthy leap for the practices of nature hopped to the primary conception of what nature means women are in and of nature ive studied them herehad nothing to do but study them that most noble of ladies whole mind was knotted to preserve her child during her time of endurance up to her moment of trial think it over its your one chance of keeping sane and expect to hear flat stuff from me while you go on playing tyrant you certainly take liberties fleetwoods mildest voice remarked i told you i should try you when you plucked me out of my surrey nest fleetwood passed from a meditative look to a malicious halflaugh you seem to have studied the most noble of ladies latterly rather like a barrister with a brief for the defendantplaintiff if you like as to that ill help you to an insight of a particular weakness of mine said gower i require to have persons of even the highest value presented to me on a stage or else i dont grasp them at allthey re simply pictures i saw the lady admired esteemed sufficiently i supposed until her image appeared to me in the feelings of another then i saw fathoms no doubt it was from feeling warmer i went through the blood of the other for my impression name the other said the earl and his features were sharp you can have the name gower answered it was the girl madge winch fleetwoods hard stare melted to surprise and contemptuous amusement you see the lady to be the most noble of ladies through the warming you get by passing into the feelings of madge winch sarcasm was in the tone and beneath it a thrill of compassionateness traversed him and shot a remorseful sting with the vision of those two young women on the coach at the scene of the fight he had sentience of their voices nigh to hearing them the forlorn brides hand given to the anxious girl behind her gushed an image of the sisterhood binding women under the pangs they suffer from men he craved a scourging that he might not be cursing himself and he provoked it for gower was very sensitive to a cold breath on the weakness he had laid bare and when fleetwood said you recommend a bath in the feelings of madge winch the retort cameit might stop you on the road to a cowl fleetwood put on the mask of cogitation to cover a shudder how a question of the man or the monk with you as i fancy ive told you more than once you may fancy committing any impertinence and be not much out the saving of you is that you digest it when youve stewed it down you try me i dont impose the connection no i take the blame for that they sat in dumbness fidgeted sprang to their feet and lighted bedroom candles mounting the stairs gower was moved to let fall a benevolent look on the worried son of fortune i warned you i should try you it ought to be done politely if i have to speak a truth i m boorish the divinely damnable naked truth wont wear ornaments its about the same as pitching a handful of earth you dirt your hands hit or miss out of this corridor into my room and spout your worst cried the earl gower entered his dressingroom and was bidden to smoke there youre a milder boor when you smoke that day down in surrey with the grand old bootmaker was one of our days gower woodseer theres no smell of the boor in him perhaps his religion helps him more than natureworship not the best for manners you wont smoke your pipea cigar lay on then as hard as you like youre asking for the debauchees last luxurynot a correction said gower grimly thinking of how his whip might prove effective and punish the man who kept him fruitlessly out of his bed i want stuff for a place in the memory said fleetwood and the late hour with the profitless talk made it a stinging taunt you want me to flick your indecision thats half a hit i m to talk italics for you to store a smart word or so true i swear and please begin you hang for the fates to settle which is to be smothered in you the man or the lordand it ends in the monk if you hang much longer a bit of a scorpion in his intention fleetwood muttered on a stride ill tell you this gower woodseer when you lay on in earnest your diction is not so choice do any of your remarks apply to lady fleetwood all should i dont presume to allude to lady fleetwood she has not charged you to complain lady fleetwood is not the person to complain or condescend to speak of injuries she insults me with her insane suspicion a swollen vein on the young noblemans forehead went to confirm the idea at the wythans that he was capable of mischief they were right he was as capable of villany as of nobility but he happened to be thanking gower woodseers whip for the comfortable numbness he felt at carinthias behaviour while detesting her for causing him to desire it and endure it and exonerate his prosy castigator he was ignorant of the revenge he had on gower whose diction had not been particularly estimable in the feebleness of a man vainly courting sleep the disarmed philosopher tossed from one side to the other through the remaining hours of darkness polishing sentences that were natural spouts of choicest diction and still the earls virulent small sneer rankled he understood why after a time the fervour of advocacy which inspires high diction had been wanting he had sought more to lash the earl with his personal disgust and partly to parade his contempt of a lucrative dependencythan he had felt for the countess no wonder his diction was poor it was a sample of limp thinness a sort of tongue of a master slenderflavourless unsatisfactory considering its object measured to be condemned by its poor achievement he had nevertheless a heart to feel for the dear lady and heat the pleading for her especially when it ran to its object as along a shaft of the sunrays from the passionate devotedness of that girl madge he brooded over it till it was like a fire beneath him to drive him from his bed and across the turfy roller of the hill to the wythans in the front of an autumnal sunrisegrand where the country is shorn of surface decoration as here and there we find some unadorned human creature whose bosom bears the ball of warmth chapter xxxii in which we see carinthia put in practice one of her old fathers lessons seated at his breakfasttable the earl saw gower stride in and could have wagered he knew the destination of the fellows morning walk it concerned him little he would be leaving the castle in less than an hour she might choose to come or choose to keep away the whims of animals do not affect men unless they are professionally tamers petty domestic dissensions are besides poor webs to the man pulling singlehanded at ropes with his revolted miners on the topic of wages too he was gowers master and could hold forth by which he taught himself to feel that practical affairs are the proper business of men women and infants being remotely secondary the picturesque and poetry consequently sheer nonsense i suppose your waiting here is useless to quote you he said the countess can decide now to remain if she pleases drive with me to cardiffi miss you if you re absent a week or is it legs drop me a line of your stages on the road and dont loiter much gower spoke of starting his legs next day if he had to do the journey alone and he clouded the yacht for fleetwood with talk of the wye and the usk hereford and the malvern hills elliptical over the plains yes the earl acquiesced jealously we ought to have seentramped every foot of our own country that yacht of mine there she is and i said i would board her and have a fly with half a dozen fellows round the scottish isles were never free to do as we like legs are the only things that have a taste of freedom said gower they strolled down to howell edwards office at nine kit ines beside the luggage cart to the rear around the office and along to the street of the cottages crowds were chattering gesticulating ines fancied the foreign jabberers inclined to threaten howell edwards at the door of his office watched them calculatingly the lord of their destinies passed in with him leaving gower to study the features of the men and ines to reckon the chance of a fray fleetwood came out presently saying to edwards that concession goes far enough because i have a neighbour who yields at every step no stick to the principle ive said my final word and heres the carriage if the mines are closed mores the pity but im not responsible you can let them know if you like before i drive off it doesnt matter to me the carriage was ready gower cast a glance up the hill three female figures and a pannierdonkey were visible on the descent he nodded to edwards who took the words out of his mouth her ladyship my lord she was distinctly seen and looked formidable in definition against the cloud madge and the nursemaid martha were the two other young women on they came and the angry man seated in the carriage could not give the order to start nor could he quite shape an idea of annoyance though he hung to it and faced at gower a battery of the promise to pay him for this tattling observers were estimated at their small importance there as everywhere by one so high above them but the appearance of the woman of the burlesque name and burlesque actions and odd ascension out of the ludicrous into a form to cast a spell so that she commanded serious recollections of her disturbed him he stepped from his carriage again he had his incomprehensible fit of shyness and a vision of the complacent jowled redundant bluecoated monarch aswing in imbecile merriment on the signboard of the royal sovereign inn constitutionally his total opposite yet instigating the sensation in that respect his countess and he had shifted characters carinthia came on at her bold mountain stride to within hail of him met by gower she talked smiled patted her donkey clutched his ear lifted a silken covering to show the child asleep entirely at her ease and unhurried these women get aid from their pride of maternity and when they can boast a parson behind them they are indecorous up to insolent in their ostentation of it she resumed her advance with a slight abatement of her challengeing match sedately very collectedly erect changed in the fulness of her figure and her poised calm bearing he heard her voice addressing gower yes they do we noticed the slateroofs looking down on them they do look like a council of rooks in the hollow a parliament you said they look exceedingly like when a peep of sunshine falls oh no not clergymen she laughed at the suggestion she might be one of the actresses by nature is the man unsympathetic with women a hater of nature deductively most women are actresses as to worshipping nature we go back to the state of heathen beast mr philosopher gower could be answered fleetwood drew in his argument she stood before him there was on his part an insular representation of old french court salute to the lady and she replied to it in the exactest measure as if an instructed proficient she stood unshadowed we have come to bid you adieu my lord she said and no trouble of the bosom shook her mellow tones her face was not the chalkquarry or the rosed rock it was oddly individual and in a way alluring with some gentle contraction of her eyelids but evidently she stood in full repose mistress of herself upon him it appeared the whole sensibility of the situation was to be thrown he hardened we have had to settle business here he said speaking resonantly to cover his gazing discomposedly all but furtively the child was shown still asleep a cunning infant not a cry in him to excuse a father for preferring concord or silence or the bachelors exemption he is a strong boy the mother said our doctor promises he will ride over all the illnesses fleetwoods answer set off with an alarum of the throat and dwindled to we ll hope so seems to sleep well she had her rocky brows they were not barren crags and her shape was natures ripeness it was acknowledged she stood like a lance in airrather like an amazon schooled by athene one might imagine hues of some going or coming flush hinted the magical trick of her visage she spoke in modest manner or it might be indifferently without a flaunting of either i wish to consult you my lord he is not baptized his christian names i have no choice i should wish him to bear one of my brothers names i have no knowledge of your brothers names chillon is one ah is it should you think suitable to our climate another name of my brothers is john bull the loutish derision passed her and rebounded on him that would be quite at home you will allow one of your own names my lord oh certainly if you desire it choose there are four names you will find in a book of the peerage or directory or so up at the castleor you might have writtenbetter than these questions on the public road i dont demur let it be as you like i write empty letters to tell what i much want carinthia said you have only to write your plain request if now i see you i may speak another request my lord pray he said with courteous patience and stepped forward down to the street of the miners cottages she could there speak outbawl the request if it suited her to do so on the point of speaking she gazed round perfectly safe no harm possible said he fretful under the burden of this her maniacal maternal anxiety the men are all right they would not hurt a child what can rationally be suspected i know the men they love their children she replied i think my child would be precious to them mr woodseer and mr edwards and madge are there is the one more requesti mean a mothers anxiety does not run to the extent of suspecting everybody some of the children are very pretty said carinthia and eyed the bands of them at their games in the roadway and at the cottage doors children of the poor have happy mothers her eyes were homely morning over her face they were open now to what that fellow woodseer who could speak to the point when he was not aiming at it called the parlour or social sittingroom where we may have converse with the tame womans mind seeing the door to the clawing recesses temporarily shut forgive me if i say you talk like the bigger child fleetwood said lightly not ungenially for the features he looked on were museful a picture in their one expression her answer chilled him it is true my lord i will not detain you i would beg to be supplied with money he was like the leaves of a frosted plant in his crisp curling inwardhe had been so genial you have come to say goodbye that an opportunity toas you put itbeg for money i am not sure of your having learnt yet the right disposal of money i beg my lord to have two thousand pounds a year allowed me tenand its a task to spend the sum on a single householdshall be alloted to your expenditure at esslemontstables bills et caetera you can entertain my steward leddings will undertake the management you will not be troubled with payings her head acknowledged the graciousnessi would have two thousand pounds and live where i please pardon me the two for a lady living where she pleases exceeds the required amount i will accept a smaller sum my lord moneyit seems a singular demand when all supplies are furnished i would have control of some money you are thinking of charities not charities edwards here has a provision for the hospital needs of the people mr woodseer applies to me in cases he can certify leddings will do the same at esslemont i am glad i am thankful the money i would have is for my own use it is for me ah scarcely that i fancy the remark should have struck home he had a thirst for the sign of her confessing to it he looked something like a petrifaction of her wildest face was shown carinthias eyes were hard out on a scattered knot of children down the street she gathered up her skirts without a word to him she ran and running shouted to the little ones around and ahead in in indoors children blant ir ty mothers mothers ho get them in see the dog ci ci in with them blant ir ty vr ty a big black mongrel appeared worrying at one of two petticoated urchins on the ground she scurried her swiftest with such warning welsh as she had on the top of her mountain cry and doors flew wide there was a bang of doors when she darted by first gust of terrible heavens that she seemed to the cottagers other shouts behind her rent the air gathering to a roar from the breasts of men and women mad dog about had been for days the rumour crossing the hills over the line of village hamlet farm from cardiff port dead hush succeeded the burst men and women stood off the brute was at the lady her arms were straight above her head her figure overhanging on a bend of the knees right and left the fury of the slavering fangs shook her loose droop of gown and a dull prolonged growl like the clamour of a far body of insurrectionary marching men told of the rage fleetwood hovered helpless as a leaf on a bough back i pray she said to him and motioned it her arms at high stretch he held no weapon the sweat of his forehead half blinded him and she waved him behind her beckoned to the crowd to keep wide way used her lifted hands as flappers she had all her wits there was not a wrinkle of a grimace nothing but her locked lips betrayed her vision of imminent doom the shaking of her gown and the snarl in the undergrowl sounded insatiate the brute dropped hold with a weariful jog of the head it pursued its course at an awful even swinging pace deaths own deaths doer his reaperhe the very death of the terrors carinthias cry rang for clear way to be kept on either side and that accursed went the path through a sharpedged mob as it poured pellmell and shrank back closing for the chase to rear of it father taught me she said to the earl not more discomposed than if she had taken a jump its over he groaned savagely white and bellowed for guns any weapons your father pray she was entreated to speak yes it must be shot it will be merciful to kill it she said they have carried the child indoors the others are safe mr woodseer run to my nursegirl martha he goes she murmured and resumed to the earl father told me women have a better chance than men with a biting dog he put me before him and drilled me he thought of everything usually the poor beast snapsone angry bite not more my dress teased it fleetwood grinned civilly in his excitement intending to yield patient hearing to be interested by any mortal thing she might choose to say she was advised by recollection to let her father rest no dear girl not hurt no scratchonly my gown torn she said to madge and madge heaved and whimpered and stooped to pin the frayed strips quite safe you see it is easy for women to escape mr edwards carinthias voice hummed over the girls head father made me practise it in case he forethought madge you heard of this dog i told you how to act i was not feverish our babe will not feel it she bade madge open her hands a scratch would kill never mind the tearings i will hold my dress oh there is that one child bitten mr edwards mount a man for the doctor i will go in to the child he was bitten lose not one minute mr edwards i see you go he bowed and hastened the childs mother was red eyes at her door for ease of her heart to the lady carinthia stepped into the room where the little creature was fetching sobs after the spout of screams god in heaven she cant be going to suck the bite fleetwood cried to madge whose answer was disquieting if its to save life my mistress wont stop at anything his heart sprang with a lighted comprehension of gower woodseers meaning this girls fervour opened portals to new views of her mistress or opened eyes chapter xxxiii a frightful debate pushing through a swarm into the cot fleetwood saw carinthia on a knee beside a girls lap where the stripped child lay its mother held a basin for the dabbing at raw red spots a sting of pain touched the memory of its fright and brought further screams then the sobs carinthia hummed a styrian cradlesong as the wailing lulled she glanced up she said to the earl the bite was deep it was in the blood we may have time get me an interpreter i must ask the mother i know not many words what now said he at the looming of new vexations we have no choice has a man gone dr griffiths would hurry fast an hour may be too late the poison travels father advised itfifty years for one brave minute this child should be helped to live we ll do our best why an interpreter a poker in the fire the interpreterwhether the mother will bear to have it done burn do you mean it should be burnt not by you quick quick but will youcould you no i say if there is no one else you forget your own child he is near the end of his mother the doctor will soon arrive the poison travels it cannot be overtaken unless we start nearly equal father said work like that wants an experienced hand a steady one i would not quakenot tremble i cannot permit it mr wythan would knowhe would know do you hear lady fleetwoodthe dog may not be mad signs he ran heavy he foamed foam s no sign go order to me a speaker of english and welsh the earl spun round sensible of the novelty of his being commanded and submitting but no sooner had he turned than he fell into her view of the urgency and he went much like the boy we see at school with a strong hand on his collar running him in madge entered and said mr woodseer has seen baby and martha and the donkey all safe he is kind said carinthia do we right to bathe the wound it seems right to wash it little things that seem right may be exactly wrong after all when we are ignorant i know burning the wound is right madge asked but my lady who is to do it you would do it dear if i shrank her mistress replied oh my lady i dont know i cant say burning a child and theres our baby he has had me nearly his time oh my dear lady would the mother consent my madge i have so few of their words yet you would hold the child to save it from a dreadful end god help me my ladyi would as long as i live i will oh poor infant we do need our courage now seeing that her mistress had not a tear or a tremor the girl blinked and schooled her quailing heart still under the wicked hope that the mother would not consent in a wonderment at this lady who was womanly and who could hold the red iron at living flesh to save the poor infant from a dreadful end her flow of love to this dear lady felt the slicing of a cut was half revulsion half worship uttermost worship in estrangement with the further throbbing of her pulses the cottage door was pushed open for lord fleetwood and howell edwards whom his master had prepared to stand against immediate operations a mounted messenger had been despatched but it was true the doctor might not be at home assuming it to be a bite of rabies minutes lost meant the terrible edwards bowed his head to that on the other hand he foresaw the closest of personal reasons for hesitating to be in agreement with the lady wholly the countess was not so much a persuasive lady as she was in her breath and gaze a sweeping and a wafting power after a short argument he had the sense of hanging like a bank detached to fatality of motion by the crack of a landslip and that he would speedily be on his manhood to volunteer for the terrible work he addressed the mother her eyes whitened from their red at his first word of laying hot iron on the child she ran out with the wild womans howl to her neighbours poor mother carinthia sighed it may last a year in the childs body and one day he shudders at water father saw a bitten man die i could fear death with the thought of that poison in me i pray dr griffiths may come fleetwood shuffled a step he will come he will come the mother and some women now packed the room a gabble arose between them and edwards they fired sharp snatches of speech and they darted looks at the lady and her lord they do not know said carinthia gower brought her news that the dog had been killed martha and her precious burden were outside a mob of men too he was not alarmed but she went to the door and took her babe in her arms and when the women observed the lady holding her own little one their looks were softened at a hint of explanation from edwards the guttural gabble rattled up to the shrill vowels fleetwoods endurance broke short the packed small room the cagedmonkey lingo the wailful child and the past and apprehended debate upon the burning of flesh composed an intolerable torture he said to edwards go to the men settle it with them we have to follow that man wythan no peace otherwise tell the men the body of the dog must be secured for analysis mad or not its the same these welsh mothers and grandmothers wont allow cautery at any price hark at them he turned to carinthia your ladyship will let mr edwards or mr woodseer conduct you to the house where you are residing you dont know these excitable people i wish you to leave she replied softly i stay for the doctors coming impossible for me to wait and i cant permit you to be here it is life and death and i must not be commanded you may be proposing gratuitous agony i would do it to my own child the earl attacked gower add your voice to persuade lady fleetwood gower said what if i think with lady fleetwood you would see her do it do it myself if there was no one else this dogall of you have gone mad the earl cried griffiths may keep his head its the only chance take my word these welshwomen just listen to them wont have it you ll find yourself in a nest of furies it may be right to do its folly to propose it madness to attempt it and i shall be bitten if i stop here a minute longer im gone i can neither command nor influence i should have thought gower woodseer would have kept his wits fleetwoods look fell on madge amid the group gowers perception of her mistress through the girls devotion to her moved him he took madge by the hand and the sensation came that it was the next thing to pressing his wifes youre a loyal girl you have a mistress it s an honour to serve you bind me by the way ines shall run down for a minute before i go let him stay where he is madge said having bobbed her curtsey oh if hes not to get a welcome said the earl and he could now fix a steadier look on his countess who would have animated him with either a hostile face or a tender she had no expression of a feeling he bent to her formally carinthias words were adieu my lord i have only to say that esslemont is ready to receive you he remarked bowed more curtly and walked out gower followed him they might as well have been silent for any effect from what was uttered between them they spoke opinions held by each of themadverse mainly speaking for no other purpose than to hold their positions oh she has courage no doubt no one doubted it fleetwood said out of all relation to the foregoing courage to grapple with his pride and open his heart was wanting in him had that been done even to the hint of it instead of the lordly indifference shown gower might have ventured on a suggestion that the priceless woman he could call wife was fast slipping away from him and withering in her allegiance he did allude to his personal sentiment one takes aim at philosophy lady fleetwood pulls us up to pay tribute to our debts but this was vague and his hearer needed a present thunder and lightning to shake and pierce him i pledged myself to that yacht said fleetwood by way of reply or you and i would tramp it as we did oncejolly old days i shall have you in mind now turn back do the best you can they parted midway up the street gower bearing away a sharp contrast of the earl and his countess for until their senses are dulled impressionable young men however precociously philosophical are mastered by appearances and they have to reflect under new lights before vision of the linked eye and mind is given them fleetwood jumped into his carriage and ordered the coachman to drive smartly he could not have admitted the feeling small he felt the having been diminished and his requiring a rapid transportation from these parts for him to regain his proper stature had he misconducted himself at the moment of danger it is a ghastly thought that the craven impulse may overcome us but no he could reassure his repute for manliness he had done as much as a man could do in such a situation at the same time he had done less than the woman needed she to have gone so far why precipitate herself into the jaws of the beast now she proposes to burn the childs wound and she will do it if they let her one sees her at the workpale flinty no faces trebly the terrific woman in her mild way of doing the work all because her old father recommended it because she thinks it a duty we will say that is juster this young woman is a very sword in the hand of her idea of duty she can be feminine toothere is one who knows she can be particularly distant too if in timidity she has a modest view of herselfor an enormous conception of the magi that married her will she take the worlds polish a little fleetwood asked with the simplicity of the superior being who will consequently perhaps bestow the debt he owes but his was not the surface nature which can put a question of the sort and pass it as soon as it had been formed a vision of the elemental creature calling him husband smote to shivers the shell we walk on and caught him down among the lower forces up amid the higher an infernal and a celestial contest for the extinction of the one or the other of them if it was not for their union she wrestled with him where the darknesses roll their snakeeyed torrents over between jagged horns of the netherworld she stood him in the white ray of the primal vital heat to bear unwithering beside her the test of light they flew they chased battled embraced disjoined adventured apart brought back the count of their deeds compared themand name the one crushed it was the one weighted to shame thrust into the cellarcorner of his own disgust by his having asked whether that starry warrior spirit in the womans frame would take polish a little why should it be a contention between them for this reason he was reduced to admire her act and if he admired he could not admire without respecting if he respected perforce he reverenced if he reverenced he worshipped therefore she had him at her feet at the feet of any woman except for the trifling object but at the feet of it is my husband that would be a reversal of things are not things reversed when the name carinthia sounds in the thought of him who laughed at the name not less angelically martial than feltres adored silver trumpets of his papal procession sweeter of the new morning for the husband of the woman if he will but consent to the worshippers posture yes and when gower woodseers malady of the wealthy as he terms the pivotting of the whole marching and wheeling world upon the favoured of fortunes habits and tastes promises to quit its fell clutch on him another voice in the young nobleman cried pooh dolt and dupe and surrounded her for half a league with reek of burnt flesh and shrieks of a tortured child giving her the aspect of a sister of the parcw but it was not the ascendant voice it growled underneath much like the deadly beast at carinthias gown while she stoodan image of her to dominate the princeliest of men the princeliest must have won his title to the place before he can yield other than complimentary station to a woman without violation of his dignity and vast wealth is not the title worldly honours are not deeds only are the title fleetwood consented to tell himself that he had not yet performed the deeds therefore for him to be dominated was to be obscured eclipsed a man may outrun us it is the fortune of war eclipsed behind the skirts of a woman waving her upraised hands with back prayno that ignominy is too horribly abominable be sure the situation will certainly recur in some form will constantly recur she will usurp the lead she will play the man let matters go on as they are we know our personal worth arrived at this point in the perpetual round of the conflict carinthia had implanted fleetwood entered anew the ranks of the ordinary men of wealth and a coronet and he hugged himself he enjoyed repose knowing it might be but a truce matters might go on as they were still he wished her away from those wythans residing at esslemont there she might come eventually to a better knowledge of his personal worththe gold mine we carry in our bosoms till it is threshed out of us in sweat that fellow gower woodseex says adding that we are the richer for not exploring it philosophical cynicism is inconclusive fleetwood knew his large capacities he had proved them and could again in case a certain half foreseen calamity should happenimagine it a fact imagine him seized besides admiring her character with a taste for her person why then he would have to impress his own mysteriously deep character on her portion of understanding the battle for domination would then begin anticipation of the possibility of it hewed division between the young mans pride of being and his warmer feelings had he been free of the dread of subjection he would have sunk to kiss the feet of the statuesque young woman arms in air firmfronted over the hideous death that tore at her skirts chapter xxxiv a survey of the ride of the welsh cavaliers escorting the countess of fleetwood to kentish esslemont a formal notification from the earl addressed to the countess of fleetwood in the third person that esslemont stood ready to receive her autocratically concealed her lords impatience to have her there and by the careful precision with which the stages of her journey were marked as places where the servants despatched to convey their lady would find preparations for her comfort again alarmed the disordered mothers mind on behalf of the child she deemed an object of the fathers hatred second to his hatred of the mother but the mother could defend herself the child was prey the child of a detested wife was heir to his title and estates his look at the child his hasty one look down at her innocent was conjured before her as resembling a kick at a stone in his path his indifference to the childs christian names pointed darkly over its future the distempered wilfulness of a bruised young woman directed her thoughts she spoke them in the tone of reason to her invalid friend rebecca wythan who saw with her felt with her yearned to retain her till breath was gone owain wythan had his doubts of the tyrant guilty of maltreating this woman of women but when you do leave wales he said you shall be guarded up to your haven carinthia was not awake to his meaning then she sent a short letter of reply imitating the style of her lord very baldly stating that she was unable to leave wales because of her friends illness and her part as nurse regrets were unmentioned meanwhile rebecca wythan was passing to death not cheerlessly more and more faintly her thread of life ran to pause resembling a rill of the drought and the thinnerit grew the shrewder were her murmurs for carinthias ears in commending the most real of husbands of an unreal wife to her friendly care of him when he would no longer see the shadow he had wedded she had the privilege of a soul beyond our minor rules and restrainings to speak her wishes to the true wife of a mock husbandno husband less a husband than this shadow of a woman a wife she said and spoke them without adjuring the bowed head beside her to record a promise or seem to show the far willingness but merely that the wishes should be heard on earth in her last breath for a good mans remaining one chance of happiness on the theme touching her husband owain it was verily to hear a soul speak and have knowledge of the broader range the rich interflowings of the tuned discords a spirit past the flesh can find her mind was at the same time alive to our worldly conventions when other people came under its light she sketched them and their views in her brief words between the gasps with perspicuous humorous bluntness as vividly as her twitched eyebrows indicated the laugh gower woodseer she read startlingly if correctly carinthia could not leave her attendance upon this dying woman was a drinking at the springs of life rebecca wythan under earth the earl was briefly informed of lady fleetwoods consent to quit wales obedient to a summons two months oldand that she would be properly escorted for the which her lord had made provision consequently the tyrant swallowed his wrath little conceiving the monstrous blow she was about to strike in peril of fresh floods from our dame who should be satisfied with the inspiring of these pages it is owned that her story of the four and twenty squires of glamorgan and caermarthen in their brassbuttoned green coats and buckskins mounted and armed an escort of the countess of fleetwood across the swollen severn along midwinter roads up to the kentish gates of esslemont has a foundation though the story is not the more credible for her flourish of documentary old balladsheets printed when londons wags had ears on cock to any whisper of the doings of their favourite whitechapel countess and indeed hardly depended on whispers enthusiasm sufficient to troop forth four and twenty and more hundreds of cambrian gentlemen and still more of the common folk as far as they could journey afoot was over the two halves of the principality to give the countess a reputable and gallant bodyguard london had intimations of kindling circumstances concerning her and magnified them in the interests of the national humour which is the english way of exalting to criticize criticizing to depreciate and depreciating to restore ultimately to cherish in reward for the amusement furnished by an eccentric person not devoid of merit these little tales of her pricking cool blood to some activity were furzefires among the welsh but where the latter heard bardic strings inviting a chorus the former as unanimously obeyed the stroke of their humorous conductors baton for an outburst from the ribs or below and it was really funny to hear of whitechapels titled heroine roaming taffyland at her old pranks catching a maddened bull by the horns in the marketplace and hanging to the infuriate beast a wild whirl of clouts till he is reduced to be a subject for steaks that is no common feat her performances down mines were things of the underworld england clapped hands merely objecting to her not having changed her garb for the picadors or matadors before she seized the bull wales adopted and was proud of her in any costume welshmen north and south united for the nonce now propose her gallantry as a theme to the rival bards at the next eisteddfod she is to sit throned in full assembly oak leaves and mistletoe interwoven on her head a white robe and green sash to clothe her and the vanquished beasts horns on a gilded pole behind the dais hearing the eulogies respectively interpreted to her by colonel fluellen wythan at one ear and captain agincourt gower at the other a splendid scene she might well insist to be present there however we are at the pitch of burlesque beyond her illustrious lords capacity to stand peremptory orders from england arrive commanding her return she temporizes postpones and supplicates to have the period extended up to the close of the eisteddfod my lords orders are imperatively repeated and very blunt he will not have her continue playing the fool down there she holds her ground from august into february and then sets forth to undergo the further process of her taming at esslemont in england with llewellyn and vaughan and cadwallader and watkyn and shenkyn and the remains of the race of owen tudor attending her vowed to extract a receipt from the earl her lords responsible servitors for the safe delivery of their heroines person at the gates of esslemont ich dien their trumpeted motto counting the number at four and twenty it wears the look of an invasion but the said number is a ballad number and has been since the antique time there was at a lesser number enough of a challenge about it for squires of england never in those days backward to pick up a glove or give the ringing rejoinder for a thumbbite to ride out and tilt compliments with the whitechapel countesss green cavaliers rally their sprites and entertain them exactly according to their degrees of dignity as exhibited by their haviour under something of a trial and satisfy also such temporary appetites as might be excited in them by among other matters left to the luck of events a metropolitan play upon the saxon tongue hard of understanding to the leeky cocks until their ready store of native pepper seasons it which may require a corresponding english condiment to rectify the flavour of the stew now the number of saxenormans riding out to meet and greet the welshmen is declared to have not exceeded nine so much pretends to be historic in opposition to the poetic version they would we may be sure have made it a point of honour to meet and greet their invading guests in precisely similar numbers a larger would have overshot the mark of courtesy and doubtless a smaller have fallen deplorably short of it therefore an acquaintance with her chivalrous if less impulsive countrymen compels to the dismissing of the dames ballad authorities she has every right to quote them for her own good pleasure and may create in others an enjoyment of what has been called the mackrell fry her notion of a ballad is that it grows like mushrooms from a scuffle of feet on grass overnight and is a sort of forest mother of the pied infant reared and trimmed by historians to show the world its fatherly antecedent steps the hand of rose mackrell is at least suggested in more than one of the ballads here the welsh irruption is a chevy chase next we have the countess for a disputed helen the ladys lord is not a shining figure how can an undecided one be a dispenser of light poetry could never allow him to say with her whereer i go i make a name and leave a song to follow yet he was the master of her fortunes at the time all the material power was his even doggerel verse it is worth while to brood on the fact denies a surviving preeminence to the potent moody reverses the position between the driven and the driver poetry however erratic is less a servant of the bully present or pomlious past than history the muse of history has neither the same divination of the intrinsic nor the devotion to it though truly she has possession of all the positive matter and holds us faster by the crediting senses nine english cavaliers then left london early on a january or february morning in a southerly direction bearing east and they were the earl of fleetwoods intimates of the halfdependent order so we may suppose them to have gone at his bidding that they met the procession of the welsh and claimed to take charge of the countesss carriage near the kentish borderline is an assertion supported by testimony fairly acceptable intelligence of the advancing party had reached the earl by courier from the date of the first gathering on the bridge of pontypridd and from gloucester along to the thames at reading thence away to the mole from mickleham where the surrey chalk runs its final turfy spine northeastward to the slope upon kentish soil greatly to the astonishment of the welsh cavaliers a mounted footman clad in the green and scarlet facings of lord fleetwoods livery rode up to them a mile outside the principal towns and named the inn where the earl had ordered preparations for the reception of them englands hospitality was offered on a princely scale cleverer fencing could not be the meeting in no sense an encounter occurred close by a thirtyacre meadow famous over the county and was remarkable for the punctilious exchange of ceremonial speech danger being present as we see powdermagazines protected by their walls and fosses and covered alleys notwithstanding which there was a scintillation of sparks lord brailstone spokesman of the welcoming party expressed comic regrets that they had not an interpreter with them mr owain wythan in the name of the cambrian chivalry assured him of their comprehension and appreciation of english slang both gentlemen kept their heads uncovered in a suspense they might for a word or two more of that savour have turned into the conveniently spacious meadow they were induced on the contrary to enter the channel of english humour by hearing chumley potts exclaim his nob and all of them laughed at the condensed description of a good hit back at the english partys cost laughter let it be but genuine is of a common nationality indeed a common fireside and profound disagreement is not easy after it the dame professes to believe that carinthia jane had to intervene as peacemaker before the united races took the table in esslemonts dininghall for a memorable night of it and a contest nearer the mark of veracity than that shown in another of the ballads she would have us follow whatever happened they sat down at table together and the point of honour for them each and every was not to be first to rise from it once more the pure briton and the mixed if not fused english engaged bacchus for instrument this time bacchus for arbiter of the fray you may imagine says the dame she cites the old butler at esslemont as having been much questioned on the subject by her family relative dr glossop and others interested to know the smallest items of the factsand he is her authority for the declaration that the welsh gentlemen and the english gentlemen whatever their united number consumed the number of nine dozen and a half of old esslemont wine before they rose or as possibly sank at the festive board at the hour of five of the morning years later this butler joshua queeney a much enfeebled old man retold and enlarged the tale of the enormous consumption of his best wine with a sacred oath to confirm it and a tear expressive of elegiacal feelings they bled me twelve dozen not a bottle less she quotes him after a minute description of his countenance and scrupulously brushed black suit pensioner though he had become he had grown during the interval to be more communicative as to particulars the wines were four sherry led off the parade pace hock the trot into the merry canter champagne the racing gallop burgundy the grand trial of constitutional endurance for the enforced finish all these wines except the sparkling had their date of birth in the precedent century they went like water questioned anxiously by dr glossop queeney maintained an impartial attitude and said there was no victor no vanquished they did not sit in blocks the tactics for preserving peace intermingled them each english gentleman had a welsh gentleman beside him they both sat firm both fell together the bottles or decanters were not stationary for the guest to fill his glass they circulated returning to an empty glass all drank equally often the voices were high the talk was loud the gentlemen were too serious to sing at one moment of the evening queeney confidently anticipated a fracassy he said one of the foreign partyand they all spoke english after five dozen bottles had gone the round as correct as the english themselvesremarked on the seventyyears old brown sherry that it had a madeira flavour he spoke it approvingly thereupon lord simon pitscrew calls to queeney asking him why madeira had been supplied instead of esslemonts renowned old sherry a second welsh gentleman gave his assurances that his friend had not said it was madeira but lord brailstone accused them of the worse unkindness to a venerable old brown sherry in attributing a madeira flavour to it then another welsh gentleman briskly and emphatically stated his opinion that the attribution of madeira flavour to it was a compliment at this which smelt strongly he said of insult captain abrane called on the name of their absent host to warrant the demand of an apology to the old brown sherry for the imputation denying it an individual distinction chumley potts offered generally to bet that he would distinguish blindfold at a single sip any madeira from any firstclass sherry old brown or pale single sip or smell ambrose mallard cried either for himself or his comrade queeney could not say which of all lord fleetwoods following mr potts and mr mallard were the dame informs us queeneys favourites because they were so genial and he remembered most of what they said and did being moved to it by poor young mr mallards melancholy end and mr pottss grief the welsh gentlemen after paying their devoirs to the countess next morning rode on in fresh health and spirits at midday to barlings the seat of mr mason fennell a friend of mr owain wythans they shouted in an unseemly way queeney thought at their breakfasttable to hear that three of the english party namely captain abrane mr mallard and mr potts had rung for tea and toast in bed lord simon pitscrew lord brailstone and the rest of the english were sore about it for it certainly wore a look of constitutional inferiority on the english side which could boast of indubitably stouter muscles the frenzied spirits of the welsh gentlemen when riding off let it be known what their opinion was under the protection of the countesss presence they were so cheery as to seem triumphantly ironical they sent messages of condolence to the three in bed with an undisguised reluctance the countess holding mr owain wythans hand longer than was publicly decent calling him by his christian name consented to their departure as they left they defiled before her the vow was uttered by each that at the instant of her summons he would mount and devote himself to her service individually or collectively she waved her hand to them they ranged in line and saluted she kissed her hand sweeping the cavaliers obeisance gallantest of bows they rode away a striking scene dame gossip says but raises a wind over the clipped adventure and is for recounting what london believed about it enough has been conceded for the stoppage of her intrusion she is left in the likeness of a fullcharged pistol capless to the clapping trigger that which london believed or affected to believe about it would fill chapters there was during many months an impression of lord fleetwoods countess as of a tenacious dread prevailing young woman both intrepid and astute who had by an exercise of various arts legitimate in open war of husband and wife gathered the pick of the principality to storm and carry another of her husbands houses the certification that her cavaliers were welsh gentlemen of wealth and position required a broader sneer at the welsh than was warranted by later and more intimate acquaintance if it could be made to redound to her discredit so therefore added to the national liking for a plucky woman she gained the respect for power whitechapel was round her like londons one streets length extension of smoky haze reminder of the mornings fog under novel sunbeams simultaneously strange to say her connubial antagonist far from being overshadowed grew to be proportionately respected and on the strength of his deserts apart from his title and his wealth he defended himself as he was bound to do by welcoming the picked welsh squires with hospitable embrace providing ceremonies receptions and most comfortable arrangements for them along the route but in thus gravely entering into the knightly burlesque of the procession and assisting to swell the same he not only drew the venom from it he stood forth as englands deputed representative equal to her invasive challengeing guests at all points comic tragic or cordial he saw that it had to be treated as a national affair and he parried the imputation which would have injured his countrys name for courtly breeding had they been illreceived while he rescued his own good name from derision by joining the extravagance he was well inspired it was popularly felt to be the supreme of clevernay noblefencing really noble though the cleverness was conspicuous a defensive stroke protecting him against his fair ones violent charge of horse warded off an implied attack upon old england in old englands besthumoured easy manner supposing the earl to have acted otherwise his countess would virtually have ridden over him and wild wales have cast a shadow on the chivalry of magisterial england he and his country stood to meet the issue together the moment the countess of fleetwood and her escort crossed the welsh border when it became a question between the hothearted at their impetuous gallop and the sedatively minded in an unfortified camp of armchairs the earls adroitness averting a collision fatal or discomforting to both disengaged him from an incumbent odium of which it need hardly be stated neither the lady nor her attendant cavaliers had any notion at the hour of the assembly for the start for england on the bridge of pontypridd the hungry mother had the safety of her babe in thought the hotheaded welshmen were sworn to guard their heroine that is the case presented by the dames papers when the incredible is excised she claims the being a good friend to fiction in feeding popular voracity with all her stores but the old buccaneer no professed friend to it is a sounder guide in the maxim where he says deliver yourself by permit of your cheque on the bank of reason and your account is increased instead of lessened our account with credulity he would signify the dame does not like the shaking for a sifting romance however is not a mountain made of gold but a vein running some way through and it must be engineered else either we are filled with wind from swallowing indigestible substance or we consent to a debasing of the currency which means her tomorrows bankruptcy and the spectacle of romance in the bankruptcy court degrades us who believe we are allied to her as cruelly as it appals it gives the cynic licence to bark day and night for an entire generation surely the countess of fleetwoods drive from the welsh borders to esslemont accompanied by the chosen of the land followed by the vivats of the whole principality and england gaping to hear the stages of her progress may be held sufficiently romantic without stuffing of surprises and conflicts adventures at inns alarms at midnight windings of a horn over hilly verges of black heaths and the rape of the child the pursuit the recovery of the child after a new set of heroine performances on the part of a strungwire mother whose outcry in a waste country district as she clasps her boy to her bosom again theres a farm i see for milk for him the dame repeats having begun with an admission that the tale has been contradicted and is not produced on authority the end in design is to win the ear by making a fuss and roll event upon event for the braining of common intelligence until her narrative resembles dusty troopings along a road to the races carinthia and her babe reached esslemont no matter what impediments there like a stopped runner whose pantings lengthen to the longer breath her alarms over the infant subsided ceasing for as long as she clasped it or was in the room with it walking behind the precious donkeybasket round the park she went armed and she soon won a fearful name at kentish cottagehearths though she was not black to see nor old no she was very young but she did all the things that soldiers dowas a bit of a foreignershe brought a reputation up from the welsh land and it had a ravens croak and a glowworms drapery and a goblins origin something was hinted of her having agitated london once somebody dropped word of her and that old lord levellier up at croridge she stalked park and country at night stories one or two near the truth were told of a restless and a very decided lady down these parts as well and the earl her husband darent come nigh in his dread of her so that he runs as if to save his life out of every place she enters and hes not one to run for a trifle his pride is pretty well a match for princes and princesses all the same he shakes in his shoes before her durst hardly spy at esslemont again while shes in occupation his managing gentleman comes down from him and goes up from her thats how they communicate one week shes quite solitary another week the house is brimful as can be she s the great lady entertaining then yet they say it s a fact she has not a shilling of her own to fling at a beggar she ll stock a cottage wanting it with provision for a fortnight or more and shell order the doctor in and shell call and see the right things done for illness but no money no ones to expect money of her the shots you hear in esslemont grounds out of season are she and her maid always alongside her at it before a target on a bank trying that old lord levelliers gunpowder out of his mill and hes got no money either not for his workmen they say until they congregate and a threatening to blow him up brings forth half their pay on account but he s a known miser shes not that shes a pleasantfaced lady for the poor she has the voice poor people like its only her enemy maybe her husband she can be terrible to shed drive a hole through a robber stopping her on the road as soon as look at him this was esslemonts atmosphere working its way to the earl not so very long after the establishment of his countess there she could lay hold of the english too it seemed did she call any gentleman of the district by his christian name lord simon pitscrew reported her doing so in the case of one of the welshmen those welshmen apparently they are making a push for importance in the kingdom chapter xxxv in which certain changes may be discerned behind his white plaster of composure lord fleetwood had alternately raged and wondered during the passage of the welsh cavalcade up eastward a gigantic burlesque that would have swept any husband of their heroine off the scene had he failed to encounter it deferentially preserving his countenance and ostensibly his temper an idiot of a woman incurable in her lunacy suspects the father of the infant as guilty of designs done to death in romances and so she manages to set going solemnly a bigger blazing tom fools show than any known or written romance gives word of and that fellow gower woodseer pleads in apology for her husbands confusion physiologically that it comes of her having been carried off and kept a prisoner when she was bearing the child and knitting her whole mind to ensure the child but what sheer animals these women are if they take impressions in such a manner and mr philosopher argues that the abusing of women proves the hating of nature names it the commonest insanity and the deadliest and men are planted in the bog of their unclean animal condition until they do proper homage to the animal nature makes the woman be oh pish siras meeson corby had the habit of exclaiming when abranes fiddler argues him into a corner the fellow can fiddle fine things and occasionally clear sensemen hating nature are insane women and nature are close if it is rather general to hate nature and maltreat women we begin to see why the world is a mad world that is the tune of the fiddlers fiddling as for him something protects him he was the slave of countess livia like abrane mallard corby st ombre young cressett and the dozens he is now her master can a man like that be foolish in saying of the countess carinthia she is not only quick to understand she is in the quick of understanding gower woodseer said it of her in wales and again on the day of his walk up to london from esslemont after pedestrian exercise which may heat the frame but cools the mind she stamped that idea on a thoughtful fellow hes a welshman they are all excitablehave heads on hounds legs for a flying figure in front still they must have an object definitely seen by themdefinite to them if dim to their neighbours and it will run in the poetic direction and the woman to win them win all classes of them within so short a term is a toss above extraordinary she is named carinthiasuitable name for the welsh pantomimic procession or cry out the word in an amphitheatre of alpine cragsit sounds at home she is a daughter of the mountainsshould never have left them she is also a daughter of the old buccaneerno poor specimen of the fighting englishman of his day according to rose mackrell he this old buccaneer it was who by strange adventures brought the great welsh mines into the family he would not be ashamed in spying through his nautical glass up or down at his daughters doings she has not yet developed a taste for the mothers tricksthe mother said to have been a kindler that countess of cressett was a romantic little flyaway bird both parents were brave the daughter would inherit gallantry she inherits a kind of thwarted beauty or it needs the situation seen in wales her arms up and her unaffrighted eyes over the unappeasable growl she had then the beauty coming from the fathom depths with the torch of life in the jaws of death to light her beauty of the nether kingdom mounting to an upper place in the higher her beauty recognized the name of the man who married her is not longearsnot to himself is the main point nor will it be to the world when he shows that it is not so to himself suppose he went to her would she be trying at domination the womans pitch above womans beauty was perceived to be no intermittent beam but so living as to take the stamp of permanence more than to say it was hers it was she what a deadly peril brought into view was her charactersoul some call it generally a thing rather distasteful in women or chilling to the masculine temperament here it attracts here strange to say it is the decided attraction in a woman of a splendid figure and a known softness by rights she should have more understanding than to suspect the husband as guilty of designs done to death in romances however she is not a craven who compliments him by rearing him and he might prove that there is no need for fear but she would be expecting explanations before the reconcilement the bosom of these women will keep on at its quick heaving until they have heard certain formal words oaths to boot how speak them his old road of the ladder appeared to fleetwood an excellent one for obviating explanations and effecting the reconcilement without any temporary seeming forfeit of the native male superiority for there she is at esslemont now any night the window could be scaled it is my husband the soul was in her voice when she said it he remembered that it had not ennobled her to him then had not endeared was taken for a foreign example of the childish artless imperfectly suited to our english clime the tone of adorable utterances however much desired is never for repetition nor is the cast of divine sweet looks nor are the particular deedsonce pardonable fitly pleaded a second scaling of her windowno nights black hills girdle the scene with hoarse echoes the moon rushes out of her clouds grimacing even fleetwoods devil much addicted to cape and sword and ladder the vulpine and the gryphine rejected it for she had by singular transformation since and in spite of a deluging grotesque that was antecedently incredible she had become a personage counting her adherents she could put half the world in motion on her side yell those welshmen to scorn they were on a plane finding native ground with as large a body of these english his baser mind bowed to the fact her aspect was entirely different her attitude toward him as well insomuch that he had to chain her to her original features by the conjuring of recollected phrases memorable for the vivid portraiture of her foregone simplicity and her devotion to my husband yes there she was at essleinont securely there near him to be seen any day worth claiming too a combatant figure provocative of the fight and the capture rather than repellent the respect enforced by her attitude awakened in him his inherited keen old relish for our intersexual strife and the indubitable victory of the stronger with the prospect of slavish charms fawning submission marrowy spoil or perhaps preferably a sullen submission reluctant charms far more marrowy or who can saythe creature is a rocket of the shot into the fiery garland of stars she may personate any new marvel be an unimagined terror an overwhelming bewitchment for she carries the unexpected in her bosom and does it look like such indubitable victory when the man the womans husband divided from her toothsome to the sex acknowledges within himself and lets the world know his utter dislike of other womens charms to the degree that herbal anchorites positively could not be colder could not be chaster and he no forest bird but having the garden of the variety of fairest flowers at nod and blush about him that was the truth even henriettas beauty had the effect of a princesss birthday doll admired on show by a contemptuous boy wherefore then did the devil in him seek to pervert this loveliest of young women and feed on her humiliation for one flashing minute the taste had gone the desire of the vengeance was extinct personal gratification could not exist he spied into himself and set it down to one among the many mysteries men uninstructed in analysis of motives arrive at this dangerous conclusion which spares their pride and caresses their indolence while it flatters the sense of internal vastness and invites to headlong intoxication it allows them to think they are of such a compound and must necessarily act in that manner they are not taught at the schools or by the books of the honoured places in the libraries to examine and see the simplicity of these mysteries which it would be here and there a saving grace for them to see as the minstrel dutifully inclining to the prosy in their behalf and moralitys should exhibit he should arrest all the characters of his drama to spring it to vision and strike perchance the chord primarily if not continually moving them that readers might learn the why and how of a germ of evil its flourishing under rebuke the persistency of it after the fell creative energy has expired and pleasure sunk to be a phlegmatic dislike almost a loathing this would here be done but for signs of a barometric dead fall in dame gossips chaps already heavily pendent she would be off with us on one of her whirling cyclones or elemental mad waltzes if a step were taken to the lecturingdesk we are so far in her hands that we have to keep her quiet she will not hear of the reasons and the change of reasons for one thing and the other things were so narrate them and let readers do their reflections for themselves she says denouncing our conscientious method as the direct road downward to the dreadful modern appeal to the senses and assault on them for testimony to the veracity of everything described to the extent that at the mention of a vile smell it shall be blown into the readers nostrils and corkingpins attack the comfortable seat of him simultaneously with a development of surprises thither your conscientiousness leads it is not perfectly visible and she would gain information of the singular nature of the young of the male sex in listening to the wrangle between lord fleetwood and gower woodseer on the subject of pocketmoney for the needs of the countess carinthia for it was a long and an angry one and it brought out both of them exposing of course the more complex creature the most they were near a rupture so scathing was gowers tone of irate professor to shirky scholaror it might be put german professor to english scuffleshoe she is for the scene of chillon johns attempt to restore the respiration of his bankbook by wager to wit that he would walk a mile run a mile ride a mile and jump ten hurdles then score five rifleshots at a three hundred yards distant target within a count of minutes twentyfive she says and vows it to have been one of the most exciting of scenes ever witnessed on green turf in the land of wagers and that he was accomplishing it quite certainly when at the first of the hurdles a treacherous unfolding and waving of a white flag caused his horse to swerve and the loss of one minute seven and twenty seconds before he cleared the hurdles after which he had to fire his shots hurriedly and the last counted blank for being outside the circle of the stated time so he was beaten but a terrific uproar over the field proclaimed the popular dissatisfaction presently there was a cleavage of the mob and behold a chase at the heels of the fellow to rival the very captain himself for fleetness he escaped leaving his pole with the sheet nailed to it by way of flag in proof of foul play or a proof as the other side declared of an innocently premature signalizing of the captains victory however that might be he ran seeing him spin his legs at a hounds pace half a mile away four countrymen attempted to stop him all four were laid on their backs in turn with stupefying celerity and on rising to their feet and for the remainder of their natural lives they swore that no man but a champion could have floored them so this again may have been due to the sturdy island pride of four good men knocked over by one we are unable to decide wickedness there was the dame says and she counsels the world to put and put together for at any rate a partial elucidation of a most mysterious incident as to the wagermoney the umpires dissented a famous quarrel that does not concern us here sprang out of the dispute which was eventually after great disturbance of the country referred to three leading sportsmen in the metropolitan sphere who pronounced the wager off being two to one hence arose the dissatisfied third party and the letters of this minority to the newspapers exciting if not actually dividing all england for several months now the month of december was the month of the dames mysterious incident from the date of january as madge winch knew christopher ines had ceased to be in the service of the earl of fleetwood at esslemont park gates one winter afternoon of a northeast wind blowing rumshrub into men for a stand against rheumatics as he remarked ines met the girl by appointment and informing her that he had money and that lord fleetwood was a black nobleman he proposed immediate marriage the hymeneal invitation wafted to her on the breath of rumshrub obtained no response from madge until she had received evasive answers as to why the earl dismissed him and whence the stock of money came lord fleetwood he repeated was a black nobleman she brought him to say of his knowledge that lord fleetwood hated and had reason to hate captain levellier shouldnt i hate the man took my sweetheart from me and popped me into the noose with his sister instead madge was now advised to be overcome by the smell of rumshruba mere fancy drink tossed off by heroes in their idle moments before they settle down to the serious business of real drinking kit protested he simulated envious admiration of known heroes who meant business and scorned any of the weak stuff under brandy and went at it till the bottles were the first to give in for why they had to stomach an injury from the world or their young woman and halfway on they shoved that young person and all enemies aside trampled em that was what old odevy signified and manys the man driven to his consolation by a cat of a girl whos like the elements in their puffs and spits at a gallant ship that rides the tighter and the tighter for all they can do to capsize tighter than ever i was tight ill be tonight if you cant behave they fell upon the smack of words kit hitched and huffed away threatening bottles whatever he had done it was to establish the petticoated hornet in the dignity of matron of a champion lightweights wholesome retreat of a publichouse a spell of his larkish hilarity was for the punishment of the girl devoted to his heroical performances as he still considered her to be though women are notoriously volatile and her language was mounting a stage above the kitchen madge had little sorrow for him she was the girl of the fiery heart not the large heart she could never be devoted to more than one at a time and her mistress had all her heart in relation to kit the thought of her having sacrificed her good name to him flung her on her pride of chastity without the reckoning of it as a merit it was the inward assurance of her independence the young spinsters planting of the standard of her proud secret knowledge of what she is let it be a thing of worth or what you will or the world think as it may that was her thought her feeling the much livelier animation was bitter grief because her mistress unlike herself had been betrayed by her ignorance of the man into calling him husband just some knowledge of the man the warning to the rescue might be there for nothing did the dear lady weep except for her brothers evil fortune the day when she had intelligence from mrs levellier of her brothers defeat she wept over the letter on her knees long hours me my child my brother she cried more than once she had her suspicion of the earl then and instantly as her loving servant had the suspicion was now no dark light but a clear daybeam to madge she adopted kits word of lord fleetwood a black nobleman he is he is her mistress had written like a creature begging him for money he did not deign a reply to her when he had seen good proof she was the bravest woman on earth and she rushed at death to save a child a common child as people say and who knows but she saved that husband of hers too from bites might have sent him out of the world barking and all his wealth not able to stop him they were in the month of march her dear mistress had been begging my lord through mr woodseer constantly of late for an allowance of money on her knees to him as it seemed and mr woodseer was expected at esslemont her mistress was looking for him eagerly something her heart was in depended on it and only her brother could be the object for now she loved only him of these men though a gentleman coming over from barlings pretty often would pour mines of money into her lap for half a word carinthia had walked up to croridge in the morning to meet her brother at lekkatts madge was left guardian of the child she liked a stroll any day round esslemont park where her mistress was beginning to strike roots as she soon did wherever she was planted despite a tone of pity for artificial waters and gardeners arts madge respected them she knew nothing of the grandeur of wildness her native english veneration for the smoothing hand of wealth led her to think esslemont the home of all homes for a lady with her husband beside her and without him too if he were wafted over seas and away if there would but come a wind to do that the wild northeaster tore the budded beeches master john edward russett lay in the cradlingbasket drawn by his docile donkey martha and madge to right and left of him a speechless rustic graduating in footmans livery to rear at slow march round by the wrinkled water madge saw the park gates flung wide a coach drove up the road along on the farther rim of the circle direct for the house it stopped the team turned leisurely and came at a smart pace toward the carriagebasket lord fleetwood was recognized he alighted bidding one of his grooms drive to stables madge performed her reverence aware that she did it in clumsy style his presence had startled her instincts and set them travelling coldish for the youngster he said all well madge baby sleeps in the air my lord she replied my lady has gone to croridge sharp air for a child isnt it my lady teaches him to breathe with his mouth shut like her father taught her when she was little our baby never catches colds madge displayed the childs face the father dropped a glance on it from the height of skies croridge you said her uncle lord levelliers you say never catches cold not our baby my lord probably good management on the part of the mother but the wifes absence disappointed the husband strung to meet her and an obtrusion of her practical motherhood blurred the prospect demanded by his present step when do you expect her to return madge before nightfall my lord she walks oh yes my lady is fond of walking i suppose she could defend herself my lady walks with a good stick fleetwood weighed the chances beheld her figure attacked amazonian and tell me my dearkit i dont see more of kit ines what has the fellow done id like him to let me know why he was dismissed ah he kept silent on that point he let out enough youve punished him if hes to lose a bonny sweetheart poor devil your sister sally sends you messages were both of us grateful my lord he lifted the thin veil from john edward russetts face with a loveless hand you remember the child bitten by a dog down in wales i have word from my manager there poor little wretch has dieddied raving madges bosom went shivering up and sank my lady was right shes not often wrong shes looking well said the earl impatient with her moral meritsand this communication from wales had been the decisive motive agent in hurrying him at last to esslemont the next moment he heard coolly of the ladys looking well he wanted fervid eulogy of his wifes looks if he was to hear any chapter xxxvi below the surface and above the girl was counselled by the tremor of her instincts to forbear to speak of the minor circumstance that her mistress had besides a good stick a good companion on the road to croridge and she rejoiced to think her mistress had him because it seemed an intimation of justice returning upon earth she was combative a born rebel against tyranny she weighed the powers she felt to the worth of the persons coming into her range of touch she set her mistress and my lord fronting for a wrestle and my lords wealth went to thin vapour and her mistresss character threw him more dimly my lord and the welsh gentleman were put to the trial a tough one for these two men she did not proclaim the winner but a momentary flutter of pity in the direction of lord fleetwood did as much she pitied him for his presence at esslemont betrayed an inclination he was ignorant of his ladys character of how firm she could be to defy him and all the world in her gratitude to the gentleman she thought of as her true friend smiled at for his open naturecalled by his christian name the idea of a piece of information stinging lord fleetwood the desire to sting so as to be an instrument of retribution one of female human natures ecstasies and her abstaining that she might not pain the lord who had been generous to her sister sally made the force in madges breast which urges to the gambling for the undeveloped entitled prophecy she kept it low and felt it thrill lord fleetwood chatted madge had him wincing he might pull the cover off the childs face carelesslyhe looked at the child his look at the child was a thought of the mother if he thought of the mother he would be wanting to see her if he heard her call a gentleman by his christian name and heard the gentleman say carinthia my lord would begin to shiver at changes women have to do unusual things when they would bring that outer set to human behaviour perhaps my lord would mount the coachbox and whip his horses away adieu forever his lady would not weep he might perhaps command her to keep her mouth shut from gentlemens christian names all except his own his lady would not obey he had to learn something of changes that had come to others as well as to himself ah and then would he dare hint as base men will he may blow foul smoke on her she will shine out of it he has to learn what she is that is his lesson and let him pray all night and work hard all day for it not to be too late let him try to be a little like mr woodseer who worships the countess and is hearty with the gentleman she treats as her best of friends there is the real nobleman fleetwood chatted on airily his instincts were duller than those of the blackbrowed girl at whom he gazed for idle satisfaction of eye from time to time while she replied demurely and maintained her drama of the featureless but welldistinguished actors within her bosoma round plump bust good wharfage and harbourage he was thinking excellent harbourage supposing the arms out in pure goodwill a girl to hold her voyager fast and safe men of her class had really a capital choice in a girl like this men of another class as well possibly for temporary anchorage out midchannel nopossibly not here and there a girl is a tartar ines talked of her as if she were a kind of religious edifice and a doubt were sacrilege she could impress the rascal girls have their arts for reaching the holy end and still they may have a welcome for a foreign ship the earl said humorously you will grant me permission to lunch at your mistresss table in her absence and she said my lord and he resumed to waken her interest with a personal question you like our quiet country round esslemont she said i do and gave him plain look for look her eye was undefended he went into it finding neither shallow nor depth simply the look always the look whereby he knew that no story of man was there and not the shyest of remote responsive invitations from natures wakened and detected rogue the bed of an unmarried young womans eye yields her secret of past and present to the intrepid diver if he can get his plunge he holds her for the tenth of a minute that is the revealment jewel or oystershell it is ours she cannot withhold it he knew right well this girl then was he could believe one of the rarely exampled innocent in knowledge he was practised to judge invitation or challenge or response from the handsomest he would have scorned just then his native devilry suffered a stir at sight of an innocent in knowledge and spotless after experiences by a sudden singular twist rather unfairly naturally as it happened he attributed it to an influence issuing from her mistress to whom the girl was devoted whom consequently she copied might physically and also morally at a distance resemble well youve been a faithful servant to your lady my dear i hope youll be comfortable here he said she likes the mountains my lady would be quite contented if she could pass two months of the year in the mountains madge answered look at me they say people living together get a likeness to one another whats your opinion upon my word your eyebrows remind me though theyre not the colourthey have a bend youve seen my lady in danger my lord yes well there s no one to resemble her there she has her markkind of superhuman business were none of us fifty feet high with phosphorus heads as your friend mr gower woodseer says of the prodigiosities lady fleetwood is backwhen before dark she should be he ran up the steps to the house at lekkatts beneath croridge a lean midday meal was being finished hard on the commencement by a silent company of three when eating is choking to the younger members of the repast bread and cold muttonbone serve the turn as conclusively as the frenchmans buffetdishes carinthias face of unshed tears dashed what small appetite chillon had lord levellier plied his fork in his right hand ruminating his back an arch across his plate riddles to the thwarted young these old people will not consent to be read by sensations carinthia watched his jaws at their work of eating under his victims eyeknowing chillon to be no longer an officer in the english service knowing that her beloved had sold out for the mere money to pay debts and support his henrietta knowing as he must know that chillons act struck a knife to pierce his mothers breast through her coffinboards this old man could eat and he could withhold the means due to his dead sisters son could he look on chillon and not feel that the mothers heart was beating in her sons fortunes half the money due to chillon would have saved him from ruin lord levellier laid his fork on the plate he munched his grievance with his bit of meat the nephew and niece here present feeding on him were not so considerate as the welsh gentleman a total stranger who had walked up to lekkatts with the countess of fleetwood and expressed the preference to feed at an inn relatives are cormorants his fork on his plate released the couple barely half a dozen words before the sitting to that niggard restoration had informed carinthia of the step taken by her brother she beckoned him to follow her the worst is done now chillon i am silent uncle is a rock you say we must not offend i have given him my whole mind say where riette is to live her headquarters will be here at a furnished house shes with her cousin the dowager yes she should be with me she wants music she wantspoor girl let her have what comes to her their thoughts beneath their speech were like fish darting under shadow of the traffic bridge she loves music said carinthia it is almost life to her like fresh air to me next month i am in london lady arpington is kind she will give me as much of their polish as i can take i dare say i should feel the need of it if i were an enlightened person for instance did i hear owain when your welsh friend was leaving chillon asked it was his dying wifes wish brother keep to the rules dear they have been broken chillon mend them that would be a step backward the right one for defence father says father says the habit of the defensive paralyzes will womanizes he says carin you quote him falsely to shield the sex quite right but my sister must not be tricky keep to the rules youre an exceptional woman and it would be a good argument if you were not in an exceptional position owain is the exceptional man brother my dear after all you have a husband i have a brother i have a friend i have noi am a mans wife and the mother of his child i am free or husband would mean dungeon does my brother want an oath from me that i can give him conduct yes i couldnt doubt you said chillon but the worlds a flood at a dyke for women and they must keep watch youve read but owain is not our enemy said carinthia in her deeper tones expressive of conviction and not thereby assuring to hear he is a man with men a child with women his rebecca could describe him i laugh now at some of her sayings of him i see her mouth so tenderly comical over her big simpleton she called him and loved him so the gentleman appeared on the waste land above the house his very loose black suit and a peculiar roll of his gait likened him to a mourning boatswain who was jolly in lord levelliers workshop his remarks were to the point chillons powders for guns and blasting interested him and he proposed to ride over from barlings to witness a test of them you are staying at barlings chillon said yes now carinthia is at esslemont he replied astoundingly the simpleton his conversation was practical and shrewd on the walk with chillon and carinthia down to esslemont evidently he was a man well armed to encounter the world social usages might be taught him chillon gained a round view of the worthy simple fellow unlikely to turn out impracticable for he talked such good sense upon matters of business carinthia saw her brother tickled and interested a feather moved her full of tears though she was her heart lay open to the heavens and their kind small wholesome gifts her happiness in the walk with her brother and her friendthe pair of them united by her companionship both of them showing they counted her their comradewas the nearest to the radiant day before she landed on an island and imagined happiness grew here and found it to be gilt thorns loud mockery a shaving northeaster tore the scream from hedges and the roar from copses under a faceless breadth of sky and she said as they turned into esslemont park lane we have had one of our old walks today chillon you used to walk together long walks over in your own country said mr wythan yes owain we did and my brother never knew me tired never knew you confess to it said chillon as he swallowed the name on her lips walking was flying over there brother say once or twice in wales too mr wythan begged of her wales reminded yes owain i shall not forget wales welsh people mr woodseer says they have the threestringed harp in their breasts and one string is always humming whether you pull it or no that s love of country that s their love of wild wales carinthia there was a quiet interrogation in chillons turn of the head at this fervent simpleton i love them for that hum said she it joins one in me call to them any day they are up ready to march oh dear souls carinthia said her breath drew in the three were dumb they saw lord fleetwood standing in the park gateway chapter xxxvii between carinthia and her lord the earls easy grace of manner was a ceremonial mantle on him as he grasped the situation in a look he bent with deferential familiarity to his countess exactly toning the degree of difference which befitted a salute to the two gentlemen amiable or hostile there and back he said and conveyed a compliment to carinthias pedestrian vigour in the wary smile which can be recalled for a snub she replied we have walked the distance my lord her smile was the braced one of an untired stepper a cold wind for you we walked fast she compelled him to take her in the plural though he addressed her separately but her tones had their music your brother captain kirbylevellier i believe my brother is not of the army now my lord she waved her hand for madge to conduct donkey and baby to the house he noticed he was unruffled the form of amenity expected from her in relation to her brother was not exhibited she might perhaps be feeling herself awkward at introductions and had to be excused i beg he said and motioned to chillon the way of welcome into the park saw the fixed figure and passed over the unspoken refusal with a remark to mr wythan at barlings i presume my tent is pitched there was the answer goodbye my brother said carinthia chillon folded his arms round her god bless you dear love let me see you soon he murmured you can protect yourself fear nothing for me dearest she kissed her brothers cheek the strain of her spread fingers on his shoulder signified no dread at her being left behind strangers observing their embrace would have vowed that the pair were brother and sister and of a notable stock i will walk with you to croridge again when you send word you are willing to go and so goodbye owain she said she gave her hand frankly she pressed the welshmans he not a whit behind her in frankness fleetwood had a skimming sense of a drop upon a funny whirly world he kept from giddiness though the whirl had lasted since he beheld the form of a wild forest girl dancing as it struck him now over an abyss on the plumed shoot of a stumpy tree ay and she danced at the ducal schlossshe mounted his coach like a witch of the alps up cragsshe was beside him pelting to the vale under a leaden southwestershe sat solitary by the fireside in the room of the inn veil it he consented to the veil he could not lift he had not even power to try and his heart thumped londons whitechapel countess glided before him like a candle in the fog he had accused her as the creature destroying romance was it gold in place of gilding absolute upper human life that the ridiculous object at his heels over london proposed instead of delirious brilliancies drunken gallops poisonsyrupspuffs of a young mans vapours there was madge and the donkey baskettrap ahead on the road to the house bearing proof of the veiled hadbeen signification of a mighthavebeen why not a possible mightbe still the mightbe might be looking on this shaven earth and sky of march with the wrathful wind at work we know that it is not the end a day follows for the world but looking on those blown black funeral sprays and the wrinkled chill waters and the stare of the esslemont housewindows it has an appearance of the last lines of our written volume dead finis not death fouler the man alive seeing himself stretched helpless for the altering of his

creature as a woman then what sort of woman is she she was once under a fascinationludicrously painfully intensely like a sort of tipsy poor puss the trapped hare tossed to her serpent and thoroughly

sincere a dose of kindness should operate happily to restore the honeymoony fancies hopes trusts dreams all back as before the honeymoon showed the silver crook and shadowy hags back of a decaying crescent and true enough the poor girls young crescent of a honeymoon went down sicklyyellow rather early it can be renewed she really was at that time rather romantic she became absurd romance is in her nevertheless she is a woman of mettle she is probably expecting to be wooed one makes a hash of yesterdays left dish but she may know no better add a pickle as chummy potts used to say the dish is rendered savoury by a slight expenditure of attentions just a dab of intimated soft stuff pleasant to see you established here if you find the place agreeable he said she was kissing her hand to her brother all her eyes for himor for the couple and they were hidden by the park lodge before she replied it is an admired beautiful place i came said he to have your assurance that it suits you i thank you my lord my lord would like a short rest carinthia she seemed placidly acquiescing you have seen the boy twice today we were having a conversation just now we think him very intelligent lady arpington tells me you do the honours here excellently she is good to me praises the mothers management of the young one john edward edward for callname madge boasts his power for sleeping he gives little trouble and babes repay us we learn from small things out of the mouth of babes wisdom well their habits show the wisdom of the mother a good mother theres no higher title a lady of my acquaintance bids fair to win it they say carinthia looked in simplicity saw herself and said if a mother may rear her boy till he must go to school she is rewarded for all she does ah said he nodding over her mania of the perpetual suspicion leddings queeney the servants here run smoothly they do they are happy in serving you see we english are not such bad fellows when were known the climate today for example is rather trying i miss colours most in england said carinthia i like the winds now and then we have a day to remember we re to be the artist of the day gower woodseer says and we get an attachment to the dreariest we are to study small variations of the commonplacedear me but he may be right the sky of lead and scraped lead over those lines he points out and its not a bad trick for reconciling us to gloomy english weather you take lessons from him i can always learn from him said carinthia fleetwood depicted his plodding gower at the tussle with accountbooks she was earnest in sympathy not awake to the comical dull as the clouds dull as the discourse yet he throbbed for being near her took impression of her figure the play of her features the carriage of her body he was shut from her eyes the clear brown eyes gave exchange of looks less of admission than her honest maids madge and the miracle infant awaited them on the terrace for so foreign did the mother make herself to him that the appearance of the child their own child here between them was next to miraculous and the mother who might well have been the most astonished had transparently not an idea beyond the verified palpable lump of young life she lifted in her arms out of the arms of madge maternally at home with its presence on earth demonstrably a fine specimen a promising youngster the father was allowed to inspect him this was his heir a little fellow of smiles features puckered brows of inquiry seeming a thing made already and active on his own account do people see likenesses he asked some do said the mother you she was constrained to give answer there is a likeness to my father i have thought theres a dotage of idolatrous daughters he could have retorted and his gaze was a polite offer to humdrum reconcilement if it pleased her she sent the child up the steps do you come in my lord the house is yours my lady i cannot feel it mine you are the mistress to invite or exclude i am ready to go in a few hours for a small income of money for my child and me our child yes it is our child it is any sum you choose to name but where would you live near my brother i would live three thousand a year for pinmoney or more are at your disposal stay here i beg you have only to notify your wants and well talk familiarly now as were together can i be of aid to your brother tell me pray i am disposed in every way to subscribe to your wishes pray speak speak out so the earl said he had to force his familiar tone against the rebuke of her grandeur of stature and he was for inducing her to deliver her mind that the mountain girls feebleness in speech might reinstate him she rejoined unhesitatingly my brother would not accept aid from you my lord i will take no money more than for my needs you spoke of certain sums down in wales i did then her voice was dead ah you must be feeling the cold northwind here i do not you may feel the cold my lord will you enter the house do you invite me the house is your own will the mistress of the house honour me so far i am not the mistress of the house my lord you refuse carinthia i would keep from using those words i have no right to refuse the entry of the house to you if i come in i guard my rooms she had been awake then to the thrusting and parrying behind masked language good you are quite decided i may suppose i will leave them when i have a little money or when i know of how i may earn some the countess of fleetwood earning a little money i can put aside your title my lord no you cant put it aside while the man with the title lives not even if youre running off in earnest under a dozen welsh names why should you desire to do it the title entitles you to the command of half my possessions as to the house dont be alarmed you will not have to guard your rooms the extraordinary wild animal youthe impression may have been produced i see i see if i were in the house i should not be rageing at your doors and it is not my intention to enter the house that is not by right of ownership you have my word he bowed to her and walked to the stables she had the art of extracting his word from him the word given she went off with it disengaged mistress of esslemont and she might have the place for residence but a decent courtesy required that she should remain at the portico until he was out of sight she was the first out of sight rather insolently she returned him without comment the spell he had cast on her and he was left to estimate the value of a dirited piece of metal not in the currency stamped false coin an odd sense of impoverishment chilled him chilly weather was afflicting the whole country he was reminded and he paced about hurriedly until his horses were in the shafts after all his driving away would be much more expected of him than a stay at the house where the whitechapel countess resided chill dry talking the language of early exercises in english suitable to her welshmen did she owain them every one as he whipped along the drive and left that glassy stare of esslemont behind him there came a slap of a reflectionhere on the box of this coach the bride just bursting her sheath sat and was like warm wax to take impressions she was like hard stone to retain them pretty evidently like women the world over she thinks only of her side of the case men disdain to plead theirs now money is offered her she declines it formerly she made it the principal subject of her conversation turn the mind to something brighter fleetwood strung himself to do so and became agitated by the question whether the bride sat to left or to right of him when the southwester blewa wind altogether preferable to the chill northeast women when they are no longer warm are colder than the deadliest catarrh wind scything across these islands of course she sat to left of him in the line of the main road he remembered a look he dropped on her a look over his left shoulder she never had a wooing she wanted it had a kind of right to it or the show of it how to begin but was she worth an effort turn to something brighter religion is the one refuge from women feltre says his roman catholic recipe the old shoemaker mr woodseer hauls women into his religion and purifies them by the processfancies he does he gets them to wear an air old gower too has his religion of nature with free admission for women whom he worships in similes running away from them leering sheepishly no feltres rigid monastic system is the sole haven and what a world where we have no safety except in renouncing it the two sexes created to devour one another must abjure their sex before they gain the peace as feltre says impressively if absurdly he will end a monk if he has the courage of his logic a queer spectaclean english nobleman a shaven monk fleetwood shuddered we are twisted face about to discover our being saved by women from that horrorthe joining the ranks of the nasal friars by what women bacchante clearly if the wife we have is a northeaster to wither us blood bone and soul he was hungry he waxed furious with the woman who had flung him out upon the roads he was thirsty as well the brightest something to refresh his thoughts grew and glowed in the form of a shiny table bearing tasty dishes old wines at an inn or anywhere but out of london an english inn to furnish the dishes and the wines for a civilized and selfrespecting man is hard to seek as difficult to find as a perfect skeleton of an extinct species the earls breast howled derision of his pursuit when he drew up at the sign of the royal sovereign in the dusky hour and handed himself desperately to mrs rundles mercy he could not wait for a dinner so his eating was cold meat warned by a sip that his drinking if he drank was to be an excursion in chemical acids the virtues of an abstainer served for his consolation tolerant of tobacco although he did not smoke he fronted the fire envying gower woodseer the contemplative pipe which for half a dozen puffs wafted him to bracing deserts or primaeval forests or old highways with the swallow thoughts above him down the past into the future a pipe is pleasant dreams at command a pipe is the concrete form of philosophy why then a pipe is the alternative of a friars frock for an escape from women but if one does not smoke here and there a man is visibly in the eyes of all men cursed let him be blest by fortune let him be handsome healthy wealthy courted he is cursed fleetwood lay that night beneath the roof of the royal sovereign sleep is lifes legitimate mate it will treat us at times as the faithless wife who becomes a harrying beast behaves to her lord he had no sleep having put out his candle an idea took hold of him and he jumped up to light it again and verify the idea that this room he left the bed and strode round it going in the guise of an urgent somnambulist or ghost bearing burden of an imperfectly remembered mission this was the room reason and cold together overcame his illogical scruples to lie down on that bed soliciting the sleep desired he lay and groaned lay and rolled all night the naval monarch with the loose cheeks and jelly smile of the swinging signboard creaked flaws of the northeaster swung and banged him he creaked high in complaintlow in some partial contentment there was piping of his boatswain shrill pipingshrieks of the whistle how many nights had that most illfated of brides lain listening to the idiotic uproar it excused a touch of craziness but how many not one not two ten twentycount count to the exact number of nights the unhappy girl must have heard those mad colloquies of the hurricane boatswain and the chirpy king by heaven whitechapel after one night of it beckons as a haven of grace chapter xxxviii a dip into the springs waters the night lord fleetwood had passed cured him of the wound carinthia dealt with her blunt defensive phrase and her welshman seated on his coachbox he turned for a look the back way leading to esslemont and saw rosed crag and mountain forest rather than the soft undulations of parkland pushing green meadows or brown copse up the slopes under his eye she had never been courted she deserved a siege she was a daughter of the racy highlands and she who could say to her husband i guard my rooms without sign of the stageface of scorn or defiance or flinging of the glove she would have to be captured by siege it was clear she wore an aspect of the confident fortress which neither challenges nor cries to treat but commands respect how did she accomplish this miracle of commanding respect after such a string of somersaults before the london world he had to drive northwestward his word was pledged to one of his donkey ixionidesabrane he recollectedto be a witness at some contemptible exhibition of the fellows muscular skill a match to punt against a thames waterman this time odd how it should come about that the giving of his word forced him now to drive away from the woman once causing him to curse his luck as the prisoner of his word however there was to be an end of it soona change change as remarkable as harry monmouths at the touching of his crown though in these days in our jogtrot old england half a step on the road to greatness is the utmost we can hop and all england jeers at the man attempting it he caps himself with this or that one of their titles for it is not the popular thing among englishmen their hero when they have done their fighting is the wealthy patron of sport what sort of creatures are his comrades but he cannot have comrades unless he is on the level of them yet let him be never so high above them they charge him and point him as a piece of cannon assenting to the flatteries they puff into him he is their engine the idol of the hour is the mobs wooden puppet and the doing of the popular thing seed of no harvest gower woodseer says moderately well snuffing incense of his happy delivery not to be the idol to have an aim of our own there lies the truer pride if we intend respect of ourselves the mr pulpit young men have in them until their habits have fretted him out was directing lord fleetwoods meditations upon the errors of the general man as a cover for lateral references to his hitherto erratic career not much worse than a swerving from the right line which now seemed the desirable road for him and had previously seemed so stale so repulsive he was of course only halfconscious of his pulpitizing he fancied the serious vein of his thoughts attributable to a tumbled night nevertheless he had the question whether that womanpoor girlwas influencing his thoughts for in a moment the very word respect pitched him upon her character to see it a character that emerged beneath obstacles and overcame ridicule won suffrages won a reluctant husbands admiration pricked him from distaste to what might really be taste for her companionship or something more alarming to contemplate in the possibilitiesthirst for it he was driving away and he longed to turn back he did respect her character a character angular as her features were and similarly harmonious splendid in action respect seems a coolish form of tribute from a man who admires he had to say that he did not vastly respect beautiful women have they all the poetry know them well and where is it the pupil of gower woodseer asked himself to specify the poetry of woman she is weak and inferior but she has it civilized men acknowledge it and it is independent or may be beside her gift of beauty she has more of it than we have then name it well the flowers of the field are frail things pluck one and you have in your hand the frailest of things but reach through the charm of colour and the tale of its beneficence in frailty to the poetry of the flower and secret of the myriad stars will fail to tell you more than does that poetry of your little flower lord feltre at the heels of st francis agrees in that well then much so with the flowers of the two hands and feet we do homage to those ungathered and reserve our supremacy the gathered no longer courted are the test of men when the embraced woman breathes respect into us she wings a beast we have from her the poetry of the tasted life excelling any gardengate or threshold lyrics called forth by purest early bloom respect for her person for her bearing for her character that is in the sum a beauty plastic to the civilized young mans needs and cravings as queenly physical loveliness has never so fully been to him along the walks of life and as ideal worships cannot be for our nerving contentment she brings us to the union of body and soul as good as to say earth and heaven secret of all human aspirations the ripeness of the creeds is there and the passion for the woman desired has no poetry equalling that of the embraced respected woman something of this went reeling through fleetwood positively to this end accompanied the while with flashes of carinthia her figure across the varied scenes ridicule vanished could it ever have existed if london had witnessed the scene down in wales london never again would laugh at the whitechapel countess he laughed amicably at himself for the citizen sobriety of these views on the part of a nobleman whose airy pleasure it had been to flout your sober citizens with their toadatthehop notions their walled conceptions their drab propriety and felt a petted familiar within him dub all pulpitizing poetizing drivellers with one of those detested titles invented by the english as a corrective of their maladies or the excesses of their higher moods but reflection telling him that he had done injury to carinthiahad inflicted the sorest of the wounds a young woman a new bride can endure he nodded acquiescence to the charge of misbehaviour and muzzled the cynic as a consequence the truisms flooded him and he lost his guard against our native prosiness must we be prosy if we are profoundly uncynically sincere do but listen to the stuff we are maundering extracts of poetry if one could hit upon the right would serve for a relief and a lift when we are in this ditch of the serious vein gower woodseer would have any number handy to spout or felteryour convinced and fervent catholic has quotations of images and latin hymns to his madonna or one of his catherines by the dozen to suit an enthusiastic fit of the worship of some fair woman and elude the prosy in commending her feltre is enviable there as he says it is natural to worship and only the catholics can prostrate themselves with dignity that is matter for thought stir us to the depths it will be found that we are poor soupy stuff for estimable language and the preservation of selfrespect in prostration we want ritual ceremonial elevation of the visible object for the souls adoring through the eye so may we escape our foul or empty selves lord feltre seemed to fleetwood at the moment a more serviceable friend than gower woodseer preaching naturean abstraction not inspiring to the devout poetic or giving us the tongue above our native prosy he was raised and refreshed by recollected lines of a gregorian chant he and feltre had heard together under the roof of that alpine monastery the dame collapses there is little doubt of her having the world to back her in protest against all fine filmy work of the exploration of a young mans intricacies or cavities let her not forget the fact she has frequently impressed upon us that he was the very wealthiest nobleman of his time instructive to touch inside as well as out he had his share of brains too and also she should be mindful of an alteration of english taste likely of occurrence in the remote posterity she vows she is for addressing after she has exhausted our present hungry generation the posterity signified will it is calculable it is next to certain have studied a developed human nature so far as to know the composition of it a not unequal mixture of the philosophic and the romantic and that credible realism is to be produced solely by an involvement of those two elements or else she may be sure her story once out of the mouth goes off dead as the spirits of a vapour that has performed the stroke of energy she holds a surprising event in the history of the wealthiest nobleman of his time and she would launch it upon readers unprepared with the reference to our mysterious and unfathomable nature for an explanation of the stunning crack on the skull this may do now it will not do ten centuries hence for the english too are a changeable people in the sight of ulterior time one of the good pieces of work lord fleetwood could suppose he had performed was recalled to him near the turning to his mews by the handsome piccadilly fruitshop he jumped to the pavement merely to gratify sarah winch with a word of madge and being emotional just then he spoke of lady fleetwoods attachment to madge and he looked at sarah straight he dropped his voice she said you remember you were sisters to her sarah remembered that he had spoken of it before two brilliant drops from the deepest of womans ready well stood in her eyes he carried the light of them away they were such pure jewels of tribute to the carinthia now seen by him as worshipping souls of devotees offer to their madonna for her most glorious adornment chapter xxxix the red warning from a son of vapour desiring loneliness or else lord feltres company fleetwood had to grant a deferred audience at home to various tradesmen absurdly fussy about having the house of his leased estate of calesford furnished complete and habitable on the very day stipulated by his peremptory orders that the place should be both habitable and hospitable they were right they were excused grand entertainments of london had been projected and he fell into the weariful business with them thinking of henriettas insatiable appetite for the pleasures he had taken the lease of this burdensome calesford at an eightmiles drive from the northwest of town to gratify the devouring womans taste which was to have all the luxuries of the town in a framework of country scenery gower woodseer and he were dining together in the evening the circumstance was just endurable but gower would play the secretary and doggedly subjected him to hear a statement of the woeful plight of countess livias affairs gower commissioned to examine them remarked if we have all the figures if we could stop the bleeding fleetwood replied come to the opera tonight i promised i promised abrane for tomorrow theres no end to it this gambling manias a flux not one of them except your old enemy corby keeps clear of it and theyre at him for subsidies as they are at me and would be at you or any passenger on the suspected of a purse corby shines among them that was heavy judgement enough gower thought no allusion to esslemont ensued the earl ate sparely and silently for the most part he was warmed a little at the opera by hearing henriettas honest raptures over her columelli in the pirata but lord brailstone sat behind her and their exchange of ecstasies upon the tattered pathos of e il mio tradito amor was not moderately offensive his countenance in henriettas presence had to be studied and interpreted by livia why did it darken the demurest of fuliginous intriguers argued that brail stone was but doing the spiriting required of him and would have to pay the penalty unrewarded let him italianize as much as he pleased not many months longer and there would be the bit of an outburst the whiff of scandal perhaps a shot and the rupture of an improvident alliance followed by henriettas free hand to the moody young earl who would then have possession of the only woman he could ever love and at no cost jealousy of a man like brailstone however infatuated the man was too foolish he must perceive how matters were tending the dieaway acid eyeballsattheceiling of a pair of fanatics per la musica might irritate a husband but the lover should read and know giddy as the beautiful creature deprived of her natural aliment seems in her excuseable hunger for it she has learnt her lesson she is not a reeling libertine brailstone peered through his eyelashes at the same shadow of a frown where no frown sat on his friends brows displeasure was manifest and why fleetwood had given him the dispossessing shrug of the man out of the run and the hint of the tip for winning with the aid of operatic arias and though he was in fleetwoods books ever since the prizefight neither fleetwood nor the husband nor any skittishness of a timorous wife could stop the pursuer bent to capture the fairest and most inflaming woman of her day i prefer your stage columelli fleetwood said i come from exile said henrietta and her plea in excuse of ecstatics wrote her down as confessedly treasonable to the place quitted ambrose mallard entered the box beholding only his goddess livia their eyebrows and inaudible lips conversed eloquently he retired like a trumped card on the appearance of m de st ombre the courtly frenchman won the ladies to join him in whipping the cream of the world for five minutes and passed out before his flavour was exhausted brailstone took his lesson and departed to spy at them from other boxes and heave an inflated shirtfront young cressett the bottle of effervescence dashed in and for him livias face was motherly he rattled a tale of the highway robbery of sir meeson corby on one of his yorkshire moors the picture of the little baronet arose upon the narration and it amused chumley potts came to confirm every item as he said plucked corby clean pistol at his head quite old style time ten pm suspects great britain king lords and commons and buttons twenty times tighter brosey mallard down on him for a few fighting men perfect answer to brosey mr mallard did not mention the robbery henrietta remarked feared to shock corby such a favoured swain potts accounted for the omission brosey spilling last night fleetwood asked at the palazzo we were said potts luck pretty fair first off brosey did his trick and away and away and away went he more old brosey wins the wiser he gets i stayed he swung to gower dont drink dry sillery after two am you read me egyptian but decipherable said gower the rising of the curtain drew his habitual groan from potts and he fled to collogue with the goodly number of honest fellows in the house of music who detested squallery most of these afflicted pilgrims to the london conservatory were engaged upon the business of the goddess richly inspiring the heliconian choir but rendering the fountainwaters heady here they had to be if they would enjoy the spectacle of londons biggest and choicest bouquet and in them too there was an unattached air during potts cooling discourse of turf and tables except when he tossed them a morsel of tragedy or the latest joke not yet past the full gallop on its course their sparkle was transient woman had them fast compelled to think of them as not serious members of our group he assisted at the crushroom exit and the happy riddance of the beautiful cousins dedicated to the merry london midnights further pastures fleetwoods word was extracted that he would visit the palazzo within a couple of hours potts exclaimed good you promise hang me if i dont think it s the only certain thing a man can depend upon in this world he left the earl and gower woodseer to their lunatic talk he still had his ideas about the association of the pair hardheaded player of his own game that woodseer spite of his mumbojumbooracle kind of talk mallards turn of luck downward to the deadly drop had come under potts first inspection of the table admiring his friends audacity deploring his rashness reproving his persistency potts allowed his verdict to go by results for it was clear that mallard and fortune were in opposition something like real awe of the tremendous encounter kept him from a plunge or a bet mallard had got the vertigo he reported the gamblers launch on dementedness to the earl gowers less experienced optics perceived it the plainly doomed duellist with the insensible black goddess offered her all the advantages of the immortals challenged by flesh his effort to smile was a line cut awry in wood his big eyes were those of a cat for sociability he looked cursed and still he wore the smile in this condition the gambler runs to emptiness of everything he has his money his heart his brains like a coaltruck on the incline of the rails to a collier mallard applied to the earl for a loan of fifty guineas he had them and lost them and he came not begging blustering for a second supply quite in the wrong tone potts knew fleetwood said back it with pistols brosey and as potts related subsequently old brosey had the look of a staked horse fortune and he having now closed the struggle perforce of his total disarmament he regained the wits we forfeit when we engage her he said to his friend chummy abrane tomorrow ah yes punts a thames waterman start ofhow many yards sunburywalton good reach course of two miles braney in good training straight business i maynt be there but you chummy you mind old chums all cases of the kind safest back the professional unlessyou understand fleetwood could not persuade gower to join the party the philosophers pretext of much occupation masked a bashfully sentimental dislike of the flooding of quiet country places by the citys hordes youre right right said fleetwood in sympathy resigned to the prospect of despising his associates without a handy helper he named esslemont once shot up a look at the sky and glanced it eastward three coaches were bound for sunbury from a common startingpoint at nine of the morning lord fleetwood lord brailstone and lord simon pitscrew were the whips two hours in advance of them the earls famous purveyors of picnic feasts bowled along to pitch the riverside tent and spread the tables our upper and lower london world reported the earl as out on another of his expeditions and say what we will we must think kindly of a wealthy nobleman ever to the front to enliven the towns dusty eyes and increase old englands reputation for preeminence in the sports he is the husband of the whitechapel countessgot himself into that mess but whatever he does he puts the stamp of style on it he and the thing he sets his hand to theyre neat theyre finished theyre fitted to trot together and theyve a shining polish natural like a lily of the fields or say nature and art like the coat of a thoroughbred led into the paddock by his groom if youre of that mind present at the start in piccadilly gower took note of lord fleetwoods military promptitude to do the work he had no taste for and envied the selfcompression which could assume so pleasant an air he heard here and there crisp comments on his lordships coach and horses and personal smartness the word style which reflects handsomely on the connoisseur conferring it and the question whether one of the ladies up there was the countess his task of unearthing and disentangling the monetary affairs of one of the ladies compelled the wish to belong to the party soon to be towering out of the grasp of bricks and delightfully gay spirited quick for fun a fellow he thought may brood upon nature but the real children of natureor she loves them bestare those who have the careless chatter the ready laugh bright welcome for a holiday in catching the hour we are surely the bloom of the hour why yes and no need to lose the rosy wisdom of the children when we wrap ourselves in the patched old cloak of the mans on he went to his conclusions but the dame will have none of them though here was a creature bent on masonrywork in his act of thinking to build a travellersrest for thinkers behind him while the volatile were simply breaking their bubbles he was discontented all day both with himself and the sentences he coined a small streetboy at his run along the pavement nowhither distanced him altogether in the race for the great secret precipitating the thought that the conscious are too heavily handicapped the unburdened unconscious win the goal ay but they leave no legacy so we must fret and stew and look into ourselves and seize the brute and scourge him just to make one serviceable step forward that is utter a single sentence worth the pondering for guidance gower imagined the fun upon middle thames the vulcan face of captain abrane the cries of his backers the smiles of the ladies lord fleetwoods happy style in the teeth of tattlean auroras chariot for overriding it one might hope might almost see that he was coming to his better senses on a certain subject as for style overriding the worst of indignities has not scotia given her poet to the slack dependant of the gallowstree who so rantingly played his jig and wheeled it round in the shadow of that institution style was his he hit on the right style to top the situation and perpetually will he slip his head out of the noose to dance the poets verse in fact style is the mantle of greatness and say that the greatness is beyond our reach we may at least pray to have the mantle strangest of fancies most unphilosophically gower conceived a womans love as that which would bestow the gift upon a man so bare of it as he where was the woman he embraced the idea of the sex and found it resolving to a form of one he stood humbly before the one and she waned into swarms of her sisters so did she charge him with the loving of her sex not her and could it be denied if he wanted a womans love just to give him a style no not that but to make him feel proud of himself that was the hearts way of telling him a secret in owning to a weakness within it the one he had thought of forthwith obtained her lodgement he discovered this truth in this roundabout way and knew it a truth by the warm fireside glow the contemplation of her cast over him dining alone as he usually had to do he was astonished to see the earl enter his room ah you always make the right choice fleetwood said and requested him to come to the library when he had done eating gower imagined an accident a metallic ring was in the earls voice one further mouthful finished dinner for gower was anxious concerning the ladies he joined the earl and asked safe oh yes we managed to keep it from them said fleetwood nothing particular perhaps youll think poor devil of a fellow father and mother alive too he did it out of hearing that a one merit mallard ambrose mallard he has blown his brains out seated plunged in the armchair with stretched legs and eyes at the black firegrate fleetwood told of the gathering under the tent and mallard seen seen drinking champagne mallard no longer seen not missed he killed himself three fields off he must have been careful to deaden the sound small pocketpistol hardly big enough tobut anything serves couple of brats came running up to chummy pottsgentlemans body bloody in a ditch chummy came to me and we went clean deadin the mouth pointed up hole through the top of the skull were crockery crockery i had to keep chummy standing i couldnt bring him back to our party we got help at a farm the body lies there and thats not the worst we found a letter to me in his pocket pencilled his last five minutes i dont see what he could have done except to go i cant tell you more i had to keep my face rowing and driving back but where is mr potts where can mr mallard be queer sensation to hear the ladies ask give me your hand the earl squeezed gowers hand an instant and it was an act unknown for him to touch or bear a touch it said a great deal late at night he mounted to gowers room the funeral of the days impressions had not been skaken off he kicked at it and sunk under it as his talk rambled add five thousand he commented on the spread of livias papers over the table ive been having an hour with her two thousand more she says better multiply by two and a half for a womans confession we have to trust to her for some of the debts of honour see her in the morning no one masters her but you mind the first to be clear of must be st ombre i like the fellow but these frenchmenthey dont spare women ambrosethe earls eyelids quivered jealousy fired that shot quite groundless she s cool as a marble venus as you said go straight from her house to esslemont i dont plead a case make the best account you can of it sayyou may say my eyes are opened i respect her if you think that says little say more it cant mean more whatever the countess of fleetwood may think due to her let her name it say my view of life way of life everything in me has changed i shall follow you i dont expect to march over the ground she has a heap to forgive her father owns or boasts in that book of his rose mackrell lent me he never forgave an injury gower helped the quotation rubbing his hands over it for cover of his glee at the words he had been hearing never forgave an injury without a return blow for it the blow forgives good for the enemy to get it he called his hearty old pagan custom an action of the lungs with him and its not in nature for injuries to digest in us they poison the blood if we try but then theres a manner of hitting back it is not to go an inch beyond the exact measure captain kirby warns us fleetwood sighed down to a low groan lord feltre would have an answer for you shes a wife and a wife hitting back is not a pleasantwell petticoats make the difference if shes for amends she shall exact them and she may be hard to satisfy she shall have her full revenge call it by any other term you like i did her a wrong i dont defend myself it s not yet in the law courts i beg to wipe it out rectify itchoose your phraseto the very fullest i look for the alliance with her to he sprang up and traversed the room were all guilty of mistakes at starting i speak of men women are protected and if theyre not theres the convent for them feltre says but a man has to live it on before the world and this life with these flies of fellows i fell into it in some way absolutely like the first bird i shot as a youngster and stood over the battered head and bloody feathers wondering there was ambrose mallardthe same splintered bonesbloodcome to his end and for a woman that woman the lady bearing the title of halfmother to me god help me what are my sins she feels nothing or about as much as the mortuary paragraph of the newspapers for the dead man and i have ambrose mallards look at her and st ombre talking together before he left the tent to cross the fields borrow beg or steal for money to play for her and not a glimpse of the winning post st ombre s a cool player that s at the bottom of the story hes cool because play doesnt bite him as it did ambrose i should say the other passion has never bitten him and hes alive and presentable ambrose under a sheet with chummy potts to watch chummy cried like a brat in the street for his lost mammy i left him crying and sobbing they have their feelings these children of vapour as you call them but how did i fall into the line with a set i despised she had my opinion of her gamblers and retorted that young cressetts turn for the fling is my doing i cant swear its not theres one of my sins whats to wipe them out she has a tender feeling for the boy confessed she wanted governing why shes young in a way she has that particular vice of play she might be managed heres a lesson for her dont you think she might the right manthe man she can respect fancy incorruptible he must let her see he has an eye for tricks shes not responsible forhis mad passion was the cause cause of everything he did the kind of woman to send the shaft you called her diana seated you said she doesnt hunt she sits and lets fly her arrow well she showed feeling for young cressett and her hit at me was an answer it struck me on the mouth but shes an eternal anxiety a man she respects a man to govern her fleetwood hurried his paces i couldnt have allowed poor ambrose besides he had not a chancenever had in anything it wants a head wants the man who can say no to her the revellers aurora you called her she has her beauty yes she respects you i should be relieveda load off me tell her all debts paid fifty thousand invested in her name and her husbands tell her speak it theres my consentif only the man to govern her she has it from me but repeat it as from me that sum and her portion would make a fair income for the two relieved by heaven what a relief go early coach to esslemont at eleven do my work there i havent to repeat my directions i shall present myself two days after i wish lady fleetwood to do the part of hostess at calesford tell her i depute you to kiss my son for me now i leave you goodnight i shant sleep i remember your saying bad visions come under the eyelids i shall keep mine open and readread her fathers book of the maxims i generally find two or three at a dip to stimulate no wonder she venerates him that sort of progenitor is your permanent aristocracy hard enemy she must have some of her mother in her too abuse me to her admit the justice of reproaches but say reason good feelingi neednt grind at it say i respect her advise her to swallow the injurynot intended for insult i dont believe anything higher than respect can be offered to a woman no defence of me to her but ill tell you that when i undertook to keep my word with her i plainly saidnever mind goodnight if we meet in the morning let this business rest until it s done i must drive to help poor chums and see about the inquest fleetwood nodded from the doorway gower was left with humming ears chapter xl record of minor incidents they went to their beds doomed to lie and roam as the solitaries of a sleepless night they met next day like a couple emerging from sirocco deserts indisposed for conversation or even short companionship much of the nights dry turmoil in their heads each would have preferred the sight of an enemy and it was hardly concealed by them for they inclined to regard one another as the author of their infernal passage through the drear nights wilderness fleetwood was the civiller his immediate prospective duties being clear however abhorrent but he had inflicted a monstrous disturbance on the man he meant in his rash decisive way to elevate if not benefit gowers imagination foreign to his desires and his projects was playing jugglers tricks with him dramatizing upon hypotheses which mounted in stages and could pretend to be soberly conceivable assuming that the earls wild hints overnight were a credible basis he transported himself to his first view of the countess livia the fountain of similes born of his prostrate adoration close upon the invasion and capture of him by the combined liqueurs in the giddy batlen lights and joining the arabian magic in his breast at the time with the more magical reality now proposed as a sequel to it he entered the land where dreams confess they are outstripped by revelations yet it startled him to hear the earl say youll get audience at ten ive arranged make the most of the situation to her i refuse to help i foresee it s the only way of solving this precious puzzle you do me and every one of us a service past paying not a man of her set worth shebut youll stop it no one else can of course youve had your breakfast off and walk yourself into a talkative mood as you tell me you do one of the things i do when ive nobody to hear said gower speculating whether the black sprite in this young nobleman was for sending him as a rod to scourge the lady an ingenious device that smelt of mediaeval courts and tickled his humour will she listen he said gravely she will listen she has not to learn you admire you admit she has helped to trim and polish and the rest she declares youre incorruptible theres the ground open i fling no single sovereign more into that quicksand and i want not one word further on the subject i follow you to esslemont pray go fleetwood pushed into the hall a footman was ordered to pack and deposit mr woodseers portmanteau at the coachoffice the principal point is to make sure we have all the obligations gower said you know the principal point said the earl relieve me he faced to the opening street door lord feltre stood in the framing of ita welcome sight the monastic man of fashion of gowers phrase for him entered crooning condolences with a stretched waxen hand for his friend a partial nod for natures worshipperinefficient at any serious issue of our human affairs as the earl would now discover gower left the two young noblemen to their greetings happily for him philosophy in the present instance after a round of profundities turned her lantern upon the comic aspect of his errand considering the countess livia and himself and the tyrant who benevolently and providentially or sardonically hurled them to their interview the situation was comic certainly in the sense of its being an illumination of this lifes odd developments for thus had things come about that if it were possible even to think of the ladys condescending he thanks to the fair one he would see before evening was armed and proof against his old infatuation or any renewal of it and he had been taught to read through the beautiful twilighted woman as if she were burnt paper held at the fire consuming her his hopes hung elsewhere nevertheless an intellectual demonimp very lively in his head urged him to speculate on such a contest between them and weigh the engaging forces difficulties were perceived the scornful laughter on her side was plainly heard but his feeling of savage mastery far from beaten down swelled so as to become irritable for the trial and when he was near her house he held a review of every personal disadvantage he could summon incited by an array of limping deficiencies that flattered their arrogant leader with ideas of the power he had in spite of them in fact his emancipation from sentiment inspired the genial mood to tease women having to encounter a male adept at the weapon for the purpose must be either voluble or supportingly proud to keep the skin from shrinking which is a commencement of the retrogression and that has frequently been the beginning of a rout now the countess livia was a lady of queenly pose and the servitorial conventional speech likely at a push to prove beggarly when once on a common platform with a man of agile tongue instigated by his intellectual demon to pursue inquiries into her moral resources after a ruthless exposure of the wrecked material she would have to be after the various fashions defiant if she was to hold her own against pressure and seeing as she must the road of prudence point to conciliation it was calculable that she would take it hence a string of possible events astounding to mankind but equally calculable should one care to give imagination headway gower looked signally captain abranes fiddler while he waited at livias house door a studious intimacy with such a lady was rather like the exposure of the silver moon to the astronomers telescope the dame will have nought of an interview and colloquy not found mentioned in her collection of ballads concerning a person quite secondary in dr glossops voluminous papers she as vehemently prohibits a narration of gower woodseers proposal some hours later for the hand of the countess of fleetwoods transfixed maid madge because of the insignificance of the couple and though it was a quaint idyll of an affection slowly formed rationally based while seeming preposterous tending to bluntly funny utterances on both sides the girl was a creature of the enthusiasms and had lifted that passion of her constitution into higher than the worship of sheer physical bravery she had pitied mr gower woodseer for his apparently extreme albeit reverential devotion to her mistress the plainly worded terms of his asking a young woman of her position and her reputation to marry him came on her like an intrusion of dazzling day upon the closed eyelids of the night requiring time and her mistresss consent and his fathers expressed approval before she could yield him an answer that might appear a forgetfulness of her station her ignorance her damaged character gower protested himself with truth a spotted pard an ignoramus and an outcast of all established classes as the worshipper of nature cannot well avoid being but what is it you like me for mr gower madge longed to know that she might see a way in the strange land where he had planted her after a whirl and he replied i ve thought of you till i can say i love you because you have naturally everything i shoot at the vastness of the compliment drove her to think herself empty of anything he named courage and its offspring honesty and devotedness constancy her bosom rose at the word yes constancy he repeated and growing girls have to turn corners as you told me once i did said she reddening under a memory and abashed by his recollection of a moment she knew to have been weak with her or noisy of herself madge went straightway to her mistress and related her great event in the tone of a confession of crime her mistresss approbation was timidly suggested rather than besought it came on a flood carinthias eyes filled she exclaimed oh that good manhe chooses my madge for wife she said it rebecca said it mrs wythan saw and said mr woodseer loved my madge i hear her saying it then yes and yes from me for both your sakes dear girl he will have the faithfullest he will have the kindestoh and i shall know there can be a happy marriage in england she summoned gower she clasped his hand to thank him for appreciating her servant and sister and for the happiness she had in hearing it and she gazed at him and the laden brows of her madge alternately encouraging him to repeat his recital of his pecuniary means for the poetry of the fact it verified feasting on the sketch of a fourroomed cottage and an agricultural labourers widow for cook and housemaid madge to listen to his compositions of the day in the evening madge to praise him madge to correct his vanity love was out of the count but carinthias leaping sympathy decorated the baldness of the sketch and spied his features through the daubed mask he chose to wear as a member of the order of husbands without taking it for his fun dry material statements presented the reality she doated to think of moreover the marriage of these two renewed her belief in true marriages and their intention to unite was evidence of love my journey to england was worth all troubles for the meeting madge she said i can look with pleasure to that day of my meeting her firstthe day it was then she stopped madge felt the quivering upward of a whimper to a sob in her breast she slipped away its a day that has come round to be repaired lady fleetwood said gower if you will will you not he has had a blowthe death of a friend violent death it has broken him he wants a month or so in your mountains i have thought him hard to deal with he is humane his enormous wealth has been his tempter madge and i will owe him our means of livelihood enough for cottagers until i carve my way his feelings are much more independent of his rank than those of most noblemen he will repeat your kind words to madge and me i am sure of it he has had heavy burdens he is young hardly formed yet he needs a helper i mean one allied to him you forgive me i left him with a catholic lord for comforter who regards my prescript of the study of nature when were in grief as about the same as an offer of a dish of cold boiled greens silver and ivory images are more consoling neither he nor i can offer the right thing for lord fleetwood it will be found here and then your mountains more than i nearly as much as you he has a poets ardour for mountain land he and mr wythan would soon learn to understand one another on that head if not as to management of mines the pleading was crafty and it was penetrative in the avoidance of stress carinthia shook herself to feel moved the endeavour chilled her to a notion that she was but half alive she let the question approach her whether chillon could pardon lord fleetwood she with no idea of benignness might speak pardons word to him on a late autumn evening years hence perhaps or to his friends tomorrow if he would considerately keep distant she was upheld by the thought of her brothers more honourable likeness to their father in the certainty of his refusal to speak pardons empty word or touch an offending hand without their fathers warrant for the injury wiped out and as she had no wish for that to be done she could anticipate his withholding of the word for her brother at wrestle with his fallen fortunes was now the beating heart of carinthias mind her husband was a shadow there he did obscure it and he might annoy he was unable to set it in motion he sat there somewhat like youths apprehension of deaththe dark spot seen mistily at times through peoples tears or visioned as in an ambush beyond the hills occasionally challenged to stimulate recklessness oftener overlooked acknowledged for the undesired remote of lifes conditions lifes evil fatal illassorted yokefellow and if it was in his power to burst out of his corner and be terrible to her she could bring up a force unnamed and unmeasured that being the blood of her father in her veins having done her utmost to guard her babe she said her prayers she stood for peace or the struggle does lord fleetwood speak of coming here she said tomorrow i go to croridge tomorrow your ladyship returns yes i return mr gower you have fifty minutes before you dress for dinner he thought only of the exceeding charity of the intimation and he may be excused for his not seeing the feminine full answer it was in an implied unmeditated contrast he went gladly to find his new comrade his flower among grassblades the wonderful creature astonishing him and surcharging his world by setting her face at him opening her breast to him breathing a young mans word of words from a womans mouth his flower among grassblades for a head looking studiously down she was his fountain of wisdom as well in the assurance she gave him of the wisdom of his choice but madge had put up the prizefighters lass by way of dolly defence to cover her amazed confusion when the proposal of this wellliked gentleman to a girl such as she sounded churchy he knocked it over easily it left however a bee at his ear and an itch to transfer the buzzers attentions and tease his darling for she had betrayed herself as right good game nor is there happier promise of lifelong domestic enlivenment for a prescient man of letters than he has in the contemplation of a pretty face showing the sensitiveness to the sting which is not allowed to poison her temper and is short of fetching tears the dear innocent girl gave this pleasing promise moreover she could be twistedto laugh at herself just a little now the young woman who can do that has already jumped the hedge into the highroad of philosophy and may become a philosophers mate in its byways where the minute discoveries are the notable treasures they had their ramble agreeable to both despite the admonitory dose administered to one of them they might have been espied at a point or two from across the parkpalings their laughter would have caught an outside pedestrians hearing whatever the case owain wythan riding down off croridge big with news of her brother for the countess dined at her table and walking up the lane to the esslemont arms on a moonless night to mount his horse pitched against an active and as it was deemed by gowers observation of his eyes a scientific fist the design to black them finely was attributable to the dyeing accuracy of the stroke a single blow had done it mr wythans watch and purse were untouched and a second look at the swollen blind peepers led gower to surmise that they were in the calculation of the striker his own he walked next day to the royal sovereign inn there he came upon the earl driving his phaeton fleetwood jumped down and gower told of the mysterious incident as the chief thing he had to tell not rendering it so mysterious in his narrative style he had the art of indicating darkly ines you mean fleetwood cried and he appeared as nauseated and perplexed as he felt why should ines assault mr wythan it happened that the pugilists patron had within the last fifteen minutes driven past a certain thirtyacre meadow sight of which on his way to carinthia had stirred him he had even then an idea of his old deeds dogging him to bind him every one of them the smallest but youve nothing to go by he said why guess at this rascal more than another gower quoted mrs rundles and the ostler for witnesses to kits visit yesterday to the royal sovereign though kit shunned the bar of the esslemont arms i guess pretty clearly because i suspect he was hanging about and saw me and madge together consolations for failures in townby the way you are complimented and i dont think you deserved it however there was just the chance to stop a run to perdition but madge madge id swear to the girl not so hard as i said gower and spoke of the oath to come between the girl and him fleetwoods dive into the girls eyes drew her before him he checked a spirt of exclamations you fancy the brute had a crack for revenge and mistook his man thats what i want her ladyship to know said gower how could you let her hear of it nothing can be concealed from her the earl was impressionable to the remark in his disgust at the incident it added a touch of a new kind of power to her image shes aware of my coming today or tomorrow they scaled the phaeton and drove you undervalue lord feltre you avoid your adversaries fleetwood now rebuked his hearer it s an easy way to have the pull of them in your own mind you might learn from him hes willing for controversy natureworshipor aboriginal genuflexion he calls it anglicanism methodism he stands to engage them it cant be doubted that in days of trouble he has a faith stout as a rock with an oracle in it as he says and hes right men who go into battle require a rock to back them or a staff to lean on you have your secret you think as far as i can see its to keep you from going into any form of battle the new influence at work on the young nobleman was evident if only in the language used gower answered mildly that can hardly be said of a man whos going to marry perhaps not lady fleetwood is aware lady fleetwood does me the honour to approve my choice you mean youre dead on to it with this girl for a year or more fond of her all my heart in love yes in love the proof of it is i ve asked her now i can support her as a cottager leaning on the three per cents well it helps you to a human kind of talk it carries out your theories i never disbelieved in your honesty the wisdoms another matter did you ever tell any one that theres not an act of a mans life lies dead behind him but it is blessing or cursing him every step he takes by that rejoined gower i can say lord feltre proves theres wisdom in the truisms of devoutness he thought the catholic lord had gone a step or two to catch an eel fleetwood was looking on the backward of his days beholding a melancholy sunset with a grimace in it lord feltre might show you the leanness of philosophyyou would learn from hearing himan old gnawed bone for the dog that chooses to be no better than a dog the vertiginous roast haunch is recommended gower said see a higher than your own head good sir but hang the man he manages to hit on the thing he wants fleetwood set his face at gower with cutting heartiness in love you say and madge and mean it to be the holy business well poor old chummy always gave you credit for knowing how to play your game she has given proof she s a good girl i dont see why it shouldnt end well that attack on the welshmans the bad lookout explained if you like but womens impressions wont get explained away we must down on our knees or they her ladyship attentive at all to affairs of the house every day with queeney at intervals with leddings excellent you speak like a fellow recording the devout observances of a great dame with her minor and superior ecclesiastical comforters regular at church her ladyship goes a woman without religion gower woodseer is a weed on the water or shes hard as nails we shall see generally madge and the youngster parade the park at this hour i drive round to the stables go in and offer your version of that rascally dogs trick it seems the nearest we can come at hes a sot and drunken dogs ll do anything ive had him on my hands and ive got the stain of him they trotted through esslemont park gates ive got that place calesford on my hands too the earl said suddenly moved to a liking for his kentish home he and gower were struck by a common thought of the extraordinary burdens his indulgence in impulses drew upon him present circumstances pictured to gower the opposing weighed and matured good reason for his choosing madge and he complimented himself in his pity for the earl but fleetwood as he reviewed a body of acquaintances perfectly free from the wretched run in harness though they had their fits and their whims was pushed to the conclusion that fatalism marked his particular course through life he could not hint at such an idea to the unsympathetic fellow or rather the burly antagonist to anything of the sort beside him lord feltre would have understood and appreciated it instantly where is aid to be had if we have the fates against us feltre knew the power he said was an example of the efficacy of supplications he had been fatally driven to find the power and had found iton the road to rome of course not a delectable road for an english nobleman except that the noise of another convert in pilgrimage on it would deal our english world a lively smack the very stroke that heavy body wants but the figure of a monastic man of fashion was antipathetic to the earl and he flouted an english protestant mass merely because of his being highly individual and therefore revolutionary for the minority he cast his bitter cud aside my man should have arrived lady fleetwood at home gower spoke of her having gone to croridge in the morning has she taken the child she has yes for the air of the heights for greater security lady arpington praises the thoughtful mother i rather expected to see the child they cant be much later gower supposed you dont feel your long separation from the object letting him have his cushion for pins gower said it needs all my philosophy he was pricked and probed for the next five minutes not bad rallying the earl could be smart when he smarted then they descended the terrace to meet lady fleetwood driving her ponytrap she gave a brief single nod to the salute of her lord quite in the townladys manner surprisingly chapter xli in which the fates are seen and a choice of the refuges from them the home of husband and wife was under one roof at last fleetwood went like one deported to his wing of the house physically sensible in the back turned to his wifes along the corridor that our ordinary comparison for the division of a wedded twain is correct she was arctic and antarctic he had to be perforce of the distance she put between them a removal of either of them from lifeor from the act of breathing as gower woodseers contempt of the talk about death would call itwas an imaginable way of making it a wider division ambrose mallard was far enough from his fatal lady nowfarther than the poles asunder ambrose if the clergy will allow him has found his peace but the road and the means he chose were a madmans the blotting of our character to close our troubles is the final proof of our being sons of vapour according to gower woodseers heartless term for poor ambrose and the lot they have their souls and above philosophy natural or unnatural they may find a shelter they can show in their desperation that they are made of blood as philosophers rather fail of doing an insignificant brainless creature like feltre had wits by the aid of his religion to help or be charitable to his fellows particularly the sinners in the crisis of life surpassing any philosophers information of her ladyships having inspected the apartments to see to the minutest of his customary luxuries cut at him all round his valet had it from the footmen and maids and their speaking of it meant a liking for their mistress and that liking added to her official solicitude on his behalf touched a soft place in him and blew an icy wind he was frozen where he was warmed here was evidence of her intending the division to be a fixed gap she had entered this room and looked about her he was here to feel her presence in her absence some one or something had schooled her too her largeeyed directness of gaze was the same as at that inn and in wales but her easy sedateness was novel her english almost the tone of the english world he gathered it at least from the few remarks below stairs his desire to be with her was the desire to escape the phantasm of the woman haunting to subjugate him when they were separate he could kill illusion by magnifying and clawing at her visible angles and audible false notes and he did it until his recollections joined to the sight of her when a clash of the thought of what she had been and the thought of what she was had the effect of conjuring a bitter sweet image that was a more seductive illusion strange to think this woman once loved the man who was not half the value of the man she no longer loved he took a shot at cynicism but hit no mark this woman protected her whole sex they sat at the dinnertable alone thanks to a handsome wenchs attractions for a philosopher married and parents of a lusty son this was their first sitting at table together the mouth that said i guard my rooms was not obtruded she talked passingly of her brother much of lady arpington and of old mr woodseer and though she reserved a smile there was no look of a lock on her face she seemed pleased to be treated very courteously she returned the stately politeness in exactest measure very simply as well her face had now an air of homeliness well suited to an english household interior she could chat any pauses occurring he was the one guilty of them she did not allow them to be barrier chasms or strids for the leap with effort she crossed them like the mountain maid over a gorges plankkept her tones perfectly her madge and mr gower woodseer made a conversible topic she was inquisitive for accounts of spanish history and the land of spain they passed into the drawingroom she had heard of the fate of the poor child in wales she said without a comment i see now i ought to have backed your proposal he confessed and was near on shivering she kept silent proudly or regretfully open on her workbasket was a spanish guidebook and a map attached to it she listened to descriptions of cadiz malaga seville granada her curiosity was chiefly for detailed accounts of catalonia and the pyrenees hardly the place for you theres a perpetual heaving of carlism in those mountains your own are quieter for travellers he remarked and for a moment her lips moved to some likeness of a smile a dimple in a flowing thought he remarked the come and go of it he regretted his inability to add to her knowledge of the spanish pyrenees books helped her at present she said feeling acutely that hostility would have brought them closer than her uninviting civility he spoke of the assault on mr wythan and gower woodseers conjecture and of his having long since discharged the rascal ines to which her unreproachful answer you made use of those men my lord sent a cry ringing through him recalling feltres words as to the grip men progressively are held in by their deeds done oh quite true we change our views and ways of life he said thinking she might set her considerations on other points of his character but this reflection was a piece of humility not yet in his particular estimate of his character and he spurned it an act of pride that drove his mind for occupation to contemplate hers which speedily became an embrace of her character until he was asking whether the woman he called wife and dared not clasp was one of those rarest who can be idealized by virtue of their being known for the young man embracing a character loses grasp of his own is plucked out of himself and passes into it to see the creature he is with the others eyes and feel for the other as a very self such is the privilege and the chastisement of the young gower woodseers engagement with the girl madge was a happier subject for expatiation and agreement her deeper tones threw a light on gower and where she saw goodness he could at least behold the natural philosopher practically philosophizing the girl shall have a dowry from me he said and the sum named was large her head bent acknowledgingly money had small weight with her now his perception of it stripped him and lamed him he wished her ladyship goodnight she stood up and performed a semiceremonious obeisance neatly adapted to their mutual position she had a wellbred mother probably she would sleep no such expectation could soothe the friend and some might be thinking misleader of ambrose mallard before he had ocular proof that the body lay underground his promise was given to follow it to the grave a grave in consecrated earth ambrose died of the accidental shot of a pocketpistol he customarily carried loaded two intimate associates of the dead man swore to that habit of his they lied to get him undisputed christian burial aha the earl laughed outright at chummy pottss nursery qualms the old fellow had to do it and he lied like a man for the sake of ambrose mallards family so much is owing to our friend can ecclesiastical casuists decide upon cases of conscience affecting men of the world a council sat upon the case the whole night long a committee of the worldly held argumentation in a lower chamber these are nights that weaken us to below the level of women a shuttle worked in fleetwoods head he defended the men of the world lord feltre oiled them damned them kindled them to a terrific expiatory blaze and extinguishingly salved and wafted aloft the released essence of them maniacal for argument fleetwood rejected the forgiveness of sins if sins they be prove them sins and the suffering is of necessity everlasting his insomnia logic insisted whichever side he took his wife was against him not in speech but in her look she was a dumb figure among the wranglers clouded up to the neck her look said she knew more of him than they knew he departed next day for london after kissing his child and he would have done wisely to abstain from his exhibition of the paternal knowing it a step to conciliation he checked his impulsive warmth under the apprehension that the mother would take it for a piece of acting to propitiateand his lips pecked the babys cheek its mother held arms for it immediately not without reason did his heart denounce her as a mere mother with little of a mind to see the recent series of feverishly sleepless nights disposed him to snappish irritability or the thirst for tenderness gower had singular experiences of him on the drive northwestward he scarcely spoke he said once if you mean to marry youll be wanting to marry soon of course and his curt nod before the reply was formulated appeared to signify the sooner the better and deliverance for both of us honest though he might be sometimes deep and sometimes picturesque the philosophers day had come to an end how can philosophy minister to raw wounds when we are in a rageing gale of the vexations battered to right and left religion has a nourishing breast philosophy is breastless religion condones offences philosophy has no forgiveness is an untenanted confessional wide air to a cry in anguish feltre says all the way to london fleetwood endured his companion letting him talk when he would he spent the greater part of the night discussing human affairs and spiritual with lord feltre whose dialectical exhortations and insinuations were of the feeblest but to an isolated young man yearning for the tenderness of a woman thinking but of her grievances the ointment brought comfort it soothed him during his march to and away from ambrose mallards grave where it seemed to him curious and even pitiable that chumley potts should be so inconsolably shaken well and if the priests have the secret of strengthening the backbone for a bend of the knee in calamity why not go to the priests chummy pottss hearing was not addressed nor was the chief person in the meditation affected by a question that merely jumped out of his perturbed interior business at calesford kept fleetwood hanging about london several days further and his hatred of a place he wasted time and money to decorate grew immeasurable it distorted the features of the beautiful woman for whose pleasure the grand entertainments to be held there had somewhere or otherwhen felon spectres were abroad over earthbeen conceived he could then return to esslemont gower was told kindly with intentional coldness that he could take a seat in the phaeton if he liked and he liked and took it anything to get to that girl of his whatever the earls inferiors did their inferior station was not suffered to discolour it for his judgement but an increasing antagonism to woodseers philosophywhich the fellow carried through with perpetual scorings of satisfactioncaused him to set a hard eye on the damsel under the grisly spotting shadow of the sottish bruiser of whom after once touching the beast he could not rub his hands clean and he chose to consider the winning of the prizefighters lass the final triumph or flag on the apex of the now despised philosophy vain to ask how he had come to be mixed up with the lot or why the stolidly conceited pretentious fellow had seat here as by right beside him we sow and we reap plant for sugar and taste the cane some one saysthis woodseer probably he can when it suits him tickle the ears of the worldlings and there is worthier stuff to remember stuff to nourish feltres wisdom of our fathers rightly named religion more in the country when he traversed sweep and rise of open land carinthias image began to shine and she threw some of her light on madge who made woodseer appear tolerable sagacious absurdly enviable as when we have the fit to wish we were some fourfoot the fellows philosophy wore a look of practical craft he was going to the girl he liked and she was one could swear an honest girl and she was a comely girl a girl to stick to a man her throwing over a sot was creditable her mistress loved her that said much for any mortal creature man or woman loved by carinthia could not be cowardly could not be vile must have high qualities next to religion she stood for a test of us had she any strong sense of religion in addition to the formal trooping to one of their pallid protestant churches lord feltre might prove useful to her for merely the comprehension of the signification of religion steadies us it had done that for him the earl owned he broke a prolonged silence by remarking to gower you havent much to say today and the answer was very little when im walking im picking up and when im driving im putting together gower was rallied on the pursuit of the personal object in both cases he pointed at sheep shepherd farmer over the hedge all similarly occupied and admitted shamelessly that he had not a thought for company scarce a word to fling ideas in gestation are the dullest matter you can have there i quite agree with you said fleetwood abrane chummy potts brailstone little corby were brighter comrades and these were his ixionides hitherto his carving of a way in the world had been sufficiently illconsidered was it preferable to be a loutish philosopher since the death of ambrose mallard he felt woodseers title for that crew grind harshly and he tried to provoke a repetition of it that he might burst out in wrathful defence of his friendsto be named friends when they were vilified defence of poor ambrose at least the sinner who or one as bad might have reached to pardon through the priesthood gower offered him no chance entering esslemont air fleetwood tossed his black mood to the winds she breathed it she was a mountain girl and found it hard to forgive our lowlands she would learn tolerance taking her flights at seasons the yacht if she is anything of a sailor may give her a taste of englands pleasures she will have a special allowance for distribution among old mr woodseers people as to the rest of the countess of fleetwoods wishes her family ranks with her husbands in claims of any kind on him there would beshe would require and had a right to demandsay a warm halfhour of explanations he knew the tone for them and so little did he revolve it apprehensively that his mind sprang beyond to the hearing from her mouth of her not intending further to guard her rooms how quietly the words were spoken there was a charm in the retrospect of her mouth and manner one of the rare women who never pout or attitudinize she could fling her glove gracefullyone might add capturingly under every aspect she was a handsome belligerent the words he had to combat pleased his memory some good friend lady arpington probably had instructed her in the art of dressing to match her colour concerning himself he made no stipulation but he reflected on lord feltres likely estimate of her as a bit of a heathen and it might be to her advantage were she and feltre to have some conversations whatever the faith a faith should exist for without the sentiment of religion a woman he says is where she was when she left the gates of eden a man is not much farther feltre might have saved ambrose mallard he is however right in saying that the woman with the sentiment of religion in her bosom is a box of holy incense distinguishing her from all other women empty of it she is devils bait at best she is a creature who cannot overlook an injury or must be exacting god knows what humiliations before she signs the treaty informed at the house that her ladyship had been staying up on croridge for the last two days fleetwood sent his hardest shot of the eyes at gower let her be absent it was equal to the first move of war and absolved him from contemplated proposals to make amends but the enforced solitary companionship with this ruminator of a fellow set him asking whether the godless dog he had picked up by the wayside was not incarnate another of the sins he had to expiate day after day almost hourly some new stroke fell on him why was he selected for persecution because he was wealthy the fates were driving him in one direction no doubt of that this further black mood evaporated and like a cessation of english stormweather bequeathed him gloom ashamed of the mood he was nevertheless directed by its final shadows to see the ruminating tramp in gower and in madge the prizefighters jilt and round about esslemont a world eyeing an earl of fleetwood who painted himself the man he was or was held to be by getting together such a collection from the daughter of the old buccaneer to the ghastly corpse of ambrose mallard why clearly wealth was the sole origin and agent of the mischief with somewhat less of it he might have walked in his place among the nations elect the herd of the gilt horns untroubled by ambitions and ideas arriving thus far he chanced to behold gower and madge walking over the grounds near the western plantation and he regretted the disappearance of them with the fellow talking hard into the girls ear those two could think he had been of some use the man pretending to philosophical depth was at any rate honest one could swear to the honesty of the girl though she had been a reckless hussy their humble little hopes and means to come to union approached after a fashion hymning at his ears those two were pleasanter to look on than amorous lords and great ladies who are interesting only when they are wicked four days of desolate wanderings over the estate were occupied chiefly in his decreeing the fall of timber that obstructed views and was the more imperatively doomed for his bailiffs intercession sound wood the trees might be they had to assist in defraying the expense of separate establishments a messenger to queeney from croridge then announced the countesss return for a couple of hours queeney said it was the day when her ladyship examined the weekly bills of the household that was in the early morning the post brought my lord a letter from countess livia a most infrequent writer she had his word to pay her debts what next was she for asking he shrugged opened the letter and stared at the half dozen lines the signification of them rapped on his consciousness of another heavy blow before he was perfectly intelligent all possible anticipation seemed here outdone insomuch that he held palpable evidence of the fates at work to harass and drive him she was married to the young earl of cressett fleetwood printed the lines on his eyeballs they were the politely flowing feminine of a statement of the fact which might have been in one line they flourished wantonly they were deadly blunt and of all men this youngster who struck at him through her lips with the reproach that he had sped the goodlooking little beast upon his road to ruinperhaps to ambrose mallards end chapter xlii the retarded courtship carinthia reached esslemont near noon she came on foot and had come unaccompanied stick in hand her dress looped for the roads madge bustled her shorter steps up the park beside her fleetwood met her on the terrace no one can be spared at croridge she said i go back before dark apology was not thought of she seemed wound to the pitch he bowed he led into the morningroom the boy is at croridge with me he has his nurse madge was at home here more than there why do you go back i am of use to my brother forgive mein what way he has enemies about him they are the workmen of lord levellier they attacked lekkatts the other night and my uncle fired at them out of a window and wounded a man they have sworn they will be revenged mr wythan is with my brother to protect him two men very well they dont want if theres danger a womans aid in protecting him she smiled and her smile was like the hint of the steel blade an inch out of sheath my brother does not count me a weak woman oh no no one would think that fleetwood said hurriedly and heartily least of all men i carinthia but you might be rash my brother knows me cautious chillon it is my brothers name you used to call him by his name i love his name ah well i may be pardoned for wishing to hear what part you play there i go the rounds with my brother armed we carry arms queer sight to see in england but there are rascals in this country too she was guilty of saying though not pointedly we do not hire defenders in civilized lands he began and stopped you have mr wythan yes we are three you call him i think owain i do in your brothers hearing yes my lord it would be in your hearing if you were near no harm no doubt there is none but you will not call your brother chillon to me you dislike the name i learn to like everything you do and say and every person you like it is by mr wythans dead wifes request that i call him by his name he is our friend he is a man to trust the situation fleetwood hung swaying between the worldly view of it and the white light of this womans nature flashed on his emotion into his mind you shall be trusted for judging if he is your friend he is my friend i have missed the sight of our boy you heard i was at esslemont i heard from madge it is positive you must return to croridge i must be with my brother yes your ladyship will permit me to conduct you her head assented there was nothing to complain of but he had not gained a step the rule is that when we have yielded initiative to a woman we are unable to recover it without uncivil bluster so therefore women dealing with gentlemen are allowed unreasonable advantages he had never granted it in colloquy or act to any woman but this one consequently he was to see that if the gentleman in him was not put aside the lady would continue moving on lines of the independence he had likewise yielded or rather flung to her unless as a result he besieged and wooed his wife his wife would hold on a course inclining constantly farther from the union he desired yet how could he begin to woo her if he saw no spark of womanly tenderness he asked himself because the beginning of the wooing might be checked by the call on him for words of repentance only just possible to conceive imagine them uttered and she has the initiative for life she would not have it certainly with a downright brute but he was not that in an extremity of bitterness he fished up a drowned old thought of all his torments being due to the impulsive halfbrute he was and between the good and the bad in him the sole point of strength was a pride likely as the smooth simplicity of her indifference showed him soon to be going down prostrate beneath her feet wholly a brutewell he had to say that playing the perfect brute with any other woman he would have his mastery the summoning of an idea of personal power to match this woman in a contest was an effort exhausting the idea they passed out of esslemont gates together at that hour of the late afternoon when southwesterly breezes after a summer gale drive their huge white flocks over blue fields fresh as morning on the march to pile the crown of the sphere and end a troubled day with grandeur up the lane by the park they had open land to the heights of croridge splendid clouds fleetwood remarked she looked up thinking of the happy long days walk with her brother to the styrian baths pleasure in the sight made her face shine superbly a flying switzerland mr woodseer says she replied england is beautiful on days like thesefor walking i think the english climate very good he dropped a murmur it should suit so good a walker and burned to complimenther spirited easy stepping and scorned himself for the sycophancy it would be before they were on the common ground of a restored understanding but an approval of any of her acts threatened him with enthusiasm for the whole of them her person included and a dam in his breast had to keep back the flood you quote woodseer to me carinthia i wish you knew lord feltre he can tell you of every cathedral convent and monastery in europe and syria nature is well enough she is as he says a savage mens works acting under divine direction to escape from that tangle are better worthy of study perhaps if one has done wrong for example i could listen to him she said you would not needexcept yes one thing your fathers book speaks of not forgiving an injury my father does he thinks it weakness to forgive an injury women do and are disgraced they are thought slavish my brother is much stronger than i am he is my father alive in that it is antichristian some would think let offending people go he would not punish them they may go where they will be forgiven for them our religion is a happy retreat we are glad they have it my father and my brother say that injury forbids us to be friends again my father was injured by the english admiralty he never forgave it but he would have fought one of their ships and offered his blood any day if his country called to battle you have the same feeling you mean i am a woman i follow my brother whatever he decides it is not to say he is the enemy of persons offending him only that they have put the division they repent if they do they do well for themselves you would see them in sackcloth and ashes i would pray to be spared seeing them you can entirely forgetwell other moments other feelings they may heighten the injury carinthia i should wish to speak plainly if i could and tell you you speak quite plainly my lord you and i cannot be strangers or enemies we cannot be i would not be to be friends we should be separate you say you are a woman you have a heart thenfor if not what have you was added in the tone my heart is my brothers she said all your heart my heart is my brothers until one of us drops there is not another on earth beside your brother chillon there is my child the dwarf square tower of croridge village church fronted them against the sky seen of both you remember it he said and she answered i was married there you have not forgotten that injury carinthia i am a mother by all the saints you hit hard justly not you our deeds are the hard hitters we learn when they begin to flagellate stroke upon stroke suppose we hold a costly thing in the hand and dash it to the groundno recovery of it none that must be what your father meant i cant regret you are a mother we have a son a bond how can i describe the man i was he mutteredpossessed sort of werewolf you are my wife i was married to you my lord its a tie of a kind it binds me obey you said obey it i do you consider it holy my father and my mother spoke to me of the marriagetie i read the service before i stood at the altar it is holy it is dreadful i will be true to it to your husband to his name to his honour to the vow to live with him my husband broke that for me carinthia if he bids you begs you to renew it god knows what you may save me from pray to god do not beg of me my lord i have my brother and my little son no more of husband for me god has given me a friend tooa man of humble heart my brothers friend my dear rebeccas husband he can take them from me no one but god see the splendid sky we have with those words she barred the gates on him at the same time she bestowed the frank look of an amiable face brilliant in the lively red of her exercise in its bentbow curve along the forehead out of the line of beauty touching as her voice was to make an undertone of anguish swell an ecstasy so he felt it for his mood was now the lovers a torture smote him to find himself transported by that voice at his ear to the scene of the young bride in thirtyacre meadow i propose to call on captain kirbylevellier tomorrow carinthia he said the name of his house my brother is not now any more in the english army she replied he has hired a furnished house named stoneridge he will receive me i presume my brother is a courteous gentleman my lord here is the church and here we have to part for today do we goodbye to you my lord she said he took her hand and dropped the dead thing your idea is to return to esslemont some day or other for the present was her strange answer she bowed she stepped on on she sped leaving him at the stammered beginning of his appeal to her their parting by the graveyard of the church that had united them was what the world would class as curious to him it was a further and a wellmarked stroke of the fatality pursuing him he sauntered by the graveyard wall until her figure slipped out of sight it went like a puffed candle and still it haunted the corner where last seen her vanishing seemed to say that less of her belonged to him than the phantom his eyes retained behind them somewhere there was in his pocket a memento of ambrose mallard that the family had given him at his request he felt the lump it had an answer for all perplexities it had been charged and emptied since it was in his possession and it could be charged again the thing was a volume as big as the world to study for the touch of a finger one could have its entirely satisfying contents and fly and be a raven of that night wherein poor ambrose wanders lost but cured of human wounds he leaned on the churchyard wall having the graves to the front of eyes bent inward they were protestant graves not so impressive to him as the wreathed and gilt of those under dedication to feltres madonna but whatever they were they had ceased to nurse an injury or feel the pain for having inflicted it their wrinkles had gone from them whether of anger or suffering ambrose mallard lay as peaceful in consecrated ground and chumley potts would be unlikely to think that the helping to lay ambrose in his quiet last home would cost him a roasting until priestly intercession availed so chummy continues a protestant dull consciences can but this is incomprehensible that she nursing her injury should be perfectly civil she is a woman without emotion she is a woman full of emotion one man knows she ties him to her to make him feel the lash of his remorse he feels it because of her casting him from herand so civilly if this were a catholic church one might go in and give the stained soul free way to get a cleansing as it is here are the graves the dead everywhere have their sanctity even the heathen fleetwood read the name of the family of meek on several boards at the head of the graves jonathan meek died at the age of ninetyfive a female meek had eightynine years in this life ezra meek gave up the ghost prematurely with a couplet at eightyone a healthy spot croridge or there were virtues in the meek family he reflected and had a shudder that he did not trace to its cause beyond an acknowledgement of a desire for the warm smell of incense chapter xliii on the road to the act of penance his customary wrestle with the night drove lord fleetwood in the stillness of the hour after matins from his hated empty esslemont up again to the village of the longlived people enjoying the moist earthiness of the air off the ironstone he rode fasting a good preparatory state for the simple pleasures which are virtually the great nourishers teats to her young the earl was relieved of his dejection by a sudden filling of his nostrils fat esslemont underneath had no such air except on the mornings of his walk over the salzkammergut and black forest regions he had never consciously drawn that deep breath of the satisfied rapture charging the whole breast with thankfulness huntsmen would know it if the chase were not urgent to pull them at the tail of the running beast once or twice on board his yacht he might have known something like it but the salt seabreeze could not be disconnected from his companion lord feltre and a thought of feltre swung vapour of incense all about him breathing this air of the young suns kiss of earth his invigoration repelled the seductions of the burnt oriental gums besides as he had told his friend it was the sincerity of the catholic religion not the seductiveness that won him to a form of homagethe bend of the head of a foreign observer at a midnight mass asceticism though it may not justify error is a truth in itself it is the essence extracted of the scourge flesh vanquished and it stands apart from controversy those monks of the forested mountain heights rambling for their herbs know the blessedness to be found in mere breathing a neighbour readiness to yield the breath inspires it the more for when we do not dread our end the sense of a free existence comes back to us we have the prized gift to infancy under the piloting of manhood but before we taste that happiness we must perform our penance no living happiness can be for the unclean as the holy father preached to his flock of the monastery dispersing at matins ay but penance penance is there not such a thing as the doing of penance out of the church in the manly fashion so to regain the right to be numbered among the captains of the worlds fighting men incontestably the best of comrades whether or no they led away on a cataract leap at the gates of life boldly to say we did a wrong will clear our sky for a few shattering peals the penitential act means youth put behind us and a steady course ahead but for the keeping of a steady course men made of blood in the walks of the world must be steadied say it plainlymated there is the humiliating point of our human condition we must have beside us and close beside us the woman we have learned to respect supposing ourselves lucky enough to have found her that required other scale of the human balance as woodseer calls her now he has got her wiser than lord feltre in reference to men and women we get no balance without her that is apparently the positive law and by reason of mens wretched enslavement it is the dance to dissolution when we have not honourable union with women feltres view of women sees the devilish or the angelical and to most men women are knaves or ninnies hence do we behold rascals or imbeciles in the offspring of most men he embraced the respected womans character with the usual effectto see with her sight and she beheld a speckled creature of the intermittent whims and moods and spites the universal patron whose ambition to be leader of his world made him handle foul brutescorrupt and cause their damnation they retort with curses in their pangs she was expected to pardon the husband who had not abstained from his revenge on her for keeping him to the pledge of his word and what a revengehe had flung the world at her she is consequently to be the young bride she was on the memorable morning of the drive off these heights of croridge down to thirtyacre meadow it must be a saint to forgive such offences and she is not one she is deliciously not one neither a genevieve nor a griselda he handed her the rod to chastise him her exchange of christian names with the welshman would not do it she was too transparently sisterly provincially simple she was in fact respected any whipping from her was childs play to him on whom if he was to be made to suffer the vision of the intense felicity of austerest asceticism brought the sensation as bracingly as the boreal morning animates men of high blood in ice regions she could but gently sting even if vindictive along the heights outside the village some way below a turn of the road to lekkatts a gentleman waved hand the earl saluted with his whip and waited for him nothing wrong mr wythan nothing to fear my lord i get a trifle uneasy the countess will not leave her brother a glow of his countesss friendliness for this openfaced promptspeaking good fellow of the faintly inky eyelids and possibly sheepish inclinations melted fleetwood our downright repentance of misconduct toward a woman binds us at least to the tolerant recognition of what poor scraps of consolement she may have picked up between then and nowwhen we can stretch fist in flame to defy it on the oath of her being a woman of honour the earl alighted and said her brother i suspect is the key of the position hes worth itshe loves her brother said mr wythan betraying a feature of his quick race with whom the reflection upon a statement is its lightning in advance gratified by the instant apprehension of his meaning fleetwood interpreted the welshmans i have to see the brother worthy of her love can you tell me the hour likely to be convenient mr wythan thought an appointment unnecessary which conveyed the sufficient assurance of audience granted you know her brother well mr wythan know him as if i had known him for years they both come to the mind as faith comesno saying how one swears by them fleetwood eyed the welsh gentleman with an idea that he might readily do the same by him mr wythans quarters were at the small village inn whither he was on his way to breakfast the earl slipped an arm through the bridle reins and walked beside him listening to an account of the situation at lekkatts it was that extraordinary complication of moves and checks which presents in the main a knot for the powers above to cut a miserly old lord withholds arrears of wages his workmen strike at a critical moment his nephew moved by common humanity draws upon crippled resources to supply their extremer needs though they are ruining his interests they made one night a demonstration of the terrorizing sort round lekkatts to give him a chorus and the old lord fired at them out of window and wounded a man for that they vowed vengeance all the new gunpowder milled in surrey was for some purpose of his own stored by lord levellier on the alder island of the pond near his workshops a quarter of a mile below the house they refused whatever their object to let a pound of it be moved at a time when at last the government had undertaken to submit it to experiments and there they stood on ground too strong for the captain as they called him to force because of the quantity stored at lekkatts being largely beyond the amount under cover of lord levelliers licence the old lord was very ill and he declined to see a doctor but obstinately kept from dying his nephew had to guard him and at the same time support an enemy having just cause of complaint this however his narrow means would not much longer permit him to do the alternative was then offered him of either siding arbitrarily against the men and his conscience or of taking a course imprudent on the part of a presumptive heir mr wythan said hurriedly at the little inns doorsteps you make one of his lordships guard said fleetwood the countess her brother and i yes danger at all not so much to fear while the countess is with us fear is not a word for carinthia her name on the earls lips drew a keen shot of the eye from mr wythan and he read the signification of the spoken name you know what every cambrian living thinks of her my lord she shall not have one friend the less for me fleetwoods hand was out for a goodbye and the hand was grasped by one who looked happy in doing it he understood and trusted the man after that warmed in thinking how politic his impulses could be his intention of riding up to croridge at noon to request his interview with mr kirbylevellier was then stated the key of the position as you said mr wythan remarked not proffering an opinion of it more than was expressed by a hearty rosy countenance that had to win its way with the earl before excuse was found for the venturesome repetition of his phrase cantering back to that home of the loves of gower woodseer and madge winch the thought of his first act of penance done without his feeling the poorer for it reconciled fleetwood to the aspect of the hollow place he could not stay beneath the roof his task of breakfasting done he was off before the mornings delivery of letters riding round the country under croridge soon up there again and henrietta might be at home he was reminded by hearing bandmusic as he followed the directions to the house named stoneridge the band consisted of eight wind instruments they played astonishingly well for itinerant musicians by curious chance they were playing a selection from the pirata presently he heard the notes to il mio tradito amor they had hit upon henriettas favourite piece at the close of it he dismounted flung the reins to his groom and addressing a compliment to the leader was deferentially saluted with a my lord henrietta stood at the window a servant held the door open for him to enter he went in and the beautiful young woman welcomed him oh my dear lord you have given me such true delight how very generous of you he protested ignorance she had seen him speak to the conductor and receive the patrons homage and who but he knew her adored of operas or would have had the benevolent impulse to think of solacing her exile from music in the manner so sure of her taste she was at her loveliest her features were one sweet bloom as of the sunny flower garden and touched to the heart by the music and the kindness she looked the look that kisses innocently he felt feeling himself on the same good ground while he could own he admired the honey creature much as an amateur may admire one of the pictures belonging to the nation and you have come she said we are to believe in happy endings he shrugged as the modest man should who says if it depends on me but the words were firmly spoken and could be credited janey is with her brother down at lekkatts things are at a deadlock a spice of danger enough to relieve the dulness and where there is danger janeys at home henrietta mimicked her janey parades with her brother at night old military cap on her head firearms primed sings her austrian mountain songs or the light cavalry call till it rings all day in my earsshe has a thrilling contralto you are not to think her wild my lord shes for adventure or domesticity whichever the fates decree she really is coming to the perfect tone speak of her said the earl she cant yet overlook its in the family she will overlook anything her brother excuses im here to see him i heard it from mr wythan owain i believe henrietta sketched apologies with a sidled head soft pout wavy hand he belongs to the order of primitive people his wifethe same pattern one supposespledged them to their christian names the man is a simpleton but a gentleman and janey holds his dying wifes wish sacred we are all indebted to him whatever she thinks right said fleetwood the fair young womans warm nature flew out to him on a sparkle of grateful tenderness in return for his magnanimity oblivious of the inflamer it was and her heart thanked him more warmly without the perilous show of emotion when she found herself secure she was beautiful she was tempting and probably the weakest of players in the ancient game of two and clearly she was not disposed to the outlaw game was only a creature of ardour that he could see seeing the misinterpretation a fellow like brailstone would put upon a temporary flush of the feminine and the advantage he would take of it perhaps not unsuccessfullythe dog he committed the absurdity of casting a mental imprecation at the cunning tricksters of emotional women and yelled at himself in the worn old surplice of the converted rake but letting his mind run this way the tradito amor of the band outside the ladys window was instantly traced to lord brailstone so convincingly that he now became a very counsel for an injured husband in denunciation of the seductive compliment henrietta prepared to conduct him to lekkatts her bonnet was brought she drew forth a letter from a silken workbag and raised itlivias handwriting i ve written my opinion he said not too severe pray posted livia wanted a protector and chosewhat on earth are you saying livia and her boyish lord were abandoned on the spot though henrietta could have affirmed stoutly that there was much to be pleaded if a female advocate dared it and a man would but hear his fingers were at the leaves of a spanish dictionary oh yes and here we have a book of travels in spain she said everything spanish for janey now you are awareno he was unaware and desired to be told janeys latest idea only she would have conceived the notion you solve our puzzle my lord she renewed the thanks she persisted in offering for the military music now just ceasing vexatiously considering that it was bad policy for him to be unmasking brailstone to her at the same time the blindness which rendered her unconscious of brailstones hand in sending members of a military band to play selections from the favourite opera they had jointly drunk of to ecstasy was creditable touching when one thought of the pursuers many devices not omitting some treason on the part of her present friend tell mei solve he said henrietta spied the donkeybasket bearing the two little ones yes i hope soon our way down she made answer i want you to see the pair of lovebirds in a nest the boy and girl were seen lying side by side both fast asleep fairhaired girl darkhaired boy faced to one another temper said fleetwood when he had taken observation of them very imperiousmr boy she replied straightening her back under a pretty frown to convey the humour of the infant tyrant the fathers mind ran swiftly on a comparison of the destinies of the two children from his estimate of their parents many of gower woodseers dicta converging to reawaken thoughts upon natures laws which a knowledge of his own nature blackened he had to persuade himself that this child of his was issue of a loving union he had to do it violently conjuring a vivid picture of the mother in bud and his recognition of her young charm the pain of keeping to his resolve to quit her lest she should subjugate him and despoil him of his wrath the fatalism in his coming and going the romantic freak it had beena situation then so clearly wrought now blurred past comprehension but there must have been love or some love on his part otherwise he was bound to pray for the mother to predominate in the child all but excluding its father carinthias image as a result ascended sovereignty and he hung to it for if we are human creatures with consciences nothing is more certain than that we make our taskmasters of those to whom we have done a wrong the philosopher says between lord feltre and gower woodseer influenced pretty equally by each of them this young nobleman was wakening to the claims of othersyouths infant conscience fleetwood now conceived the verbal supplication for his wifes forgiveness involved in the act of penance and verbal meant abject with him going so far it would mean naked precise no slurring that he knew and a tremor went over him women then are really the half of the world in power as much as in their number if men pretend to a step above the savage or well his wife was a power he had forgotten the puzzle spoken of by henrietta when she used the word again and expressed her happiness in the prospect before themcaused by his presence of course you are aware my dear lord janey worships her brother he was defeated by some dastardly contrivance in a wager to do wonderful featsfor money money money a large stake how we come off our high horses i hadnt an idea of money before i was married i think of little else my husband has notions of honour he engaged himself to pay a legacy of debts his uncle would not pay debts long due to him he was reduced to the shift of wagering on his great strength and skill he could have done it his enemy managedenemy there was he had to sell out of the army in consequence i shall never have janeys face of suffering away from my sight he is a soldier above all things it seems hard on me but i cannot blame him for snatching at an opportunity to win military distinction he is in treaty for the post of aide to the colonelthe general of the english contingent bound for spain for the cause of the queen my husband will undertake to be at the orders of his chief as soon as he can leave this place janey goes with him according to present arrangements passing through a turnstile that led from the road across a meadowslope to the broken land below henrietta had view of the earls hard white face and she hastened to say you have altered that my lord she is devoted to her brother and her brother running dangers and danger in itself is an attraction to her but her husband will have the first claim she has her good sense she will never insist on going if you oppose she will be ready to fill her station it will beher pride and her pleasure henrietta continued in the vein of these assurances and carinthias character was shooting lightnings through him withering that of the woman who referred to his wifes good sense and her station and certainly would not have betrayed herself by such drawlings if she had been very positive that carinthias disposition toward wealth and luxury resembled hers she knew the reverse or so his contemptuously generous effort to frame an apology for the stuff he was hearing considered it his wife was lost to him that fact smote on his breast the moment he heard of her desire to go with her brother wildest of enterprises but a criminal saw himself guilty of a large part in the disaster the two heroical souls were striving desperately to repair if her chillon went carinthia would gosure as flame is drawn to air the exceeding splendour in the character of a young woman injured as she had been soft to love as he knew her and giving her husband no other rival than a beloved brother no ground of complaint save her devotion to her brother pervaded him without illuminating or lifting rather with an indication of a foul contrast that prostrated him half of our funny heathen lives we are bent double to gather things we have tossed away was one of the numbers of apposite sayings that hummed about him for a chorus of the worlds old wisdom in derision when he descended the heathy path and had sight of carinthia beside her chillon would it be the same thing if he had it in hand again did he wish it to be the same was not he another man by the leap of his heart to the woman standing down there he was a better man but recent spiritual exercises brought him to see superstitiously how by that sign she was lost to him for everlastingly in this life the better pays for the worse thus is the better a proved thing both chillon and carinthia it is probable might have been stirred to deeper than compassion had the proud young nobleman taken them into his breast to the scouring of it exposing the grounds of his former brutality his gradual enlightenment his ultimate acknowledgement of the pricelessness of the woman he had won to lose her an imploring of forgiveness would not have been necessary with those two however great theiror the womansastonishment at the revelation of an abysmal male humanity a complete exposure of past meanness is the deed of present courage certain of its reward without as well as within for then we show our fellows that the slough is cast but life is a continuous fight and members of the social world display its degree of civilization by fighting in armour most of them are born in it and their armour is more sensitive than their skins it was fleetwoods instinct of his inability to fling it off utterly which warned him of his loss of the wife whose enthusiasm to wait on her brother in danger might have subsided into the channel of duty even tenderness had he been able resolutely to strip himself bare this was the further impossible to him because of a belief he now imposed upon himself to cover the cowardly shrinking from so extreme a penitential act that such confessions are due from men to the priest only and that he could confess wholly and absolutely to the priestto heaven therefore under seal and in safety but with perfect repentance so compelled to keep his inner self unknown he fronted chillon courteously in the somewhat lofty seeming of a guarded manner he requested audience for a few minutes observing the princely figure of the once hated man and understanding henriettas sheer womanly choice of him carinthias idolatry too as soon as he had spoken the man was in his voice chillon said it concerns my sister i have to think in that case her wish is to be present your lordship will shorten the number of minutes for the interview by permitting it fleetwood encountered carinthias eyes they did not entreat or defy they seconded her brother and were a civil shining naught on her husband he bowed his head constrained feeling heavily the two to one she replied to the look my brother and i have a single mind we save time by speaking three together my lord he was led into the long room of the workshop where various patterns of muskets rifles pistols and swords were stars crosses wedges over the walls and a varnished wooden model of a piece of cannon occupied the middle place on a block contempt of military weapons and ridicule of the art of war were common on those days among a people beginning to sit with habitual snugness at the festive board provided for them by the valour of their fathers fleetwood had not been on the side of the banqueting citizens though his countrys journals and her feasted popular wits made a powerful current to whelm opposition but the appearance of the woman his wife here her head surrounded by destructive engines in the form of trophy and the knowledge that this woman bearing his name designed to be out at the heels of a foreign army or tagrag of uniformed rascals inspired him to reprobate mens bad old game as heartily as good sense does in the abstract and as derisively as it is the way with comfortable islanders before the midnight trumpetnotes of panic have tumbled them to their legs he took his chair sickened he was the next moment taking carinthias impression of chillon compelled to it by an admiration that men and women have alike for shapes of strength in the mould of grace over whose firm build a flicker of agility seems to run for the young soldiers figure was visibly in its repose prompt to action as the minds movement this was her brother her enthusiasm for her brother was explained to him no sooner did he have the conception of it than it plucked at him painfully and feeling himself physically eclipsed by the object of carinthias enthusiasm his pride of the rival counselled him to preserve the mask on what was going on within lest it should be seen that he was also morally beaten at the outset a trained observation told him moreover that her chillons correctly handsome features despite their conventional urbanity could knit to smite and held less of the reserves of mercy behind them than carinthias glorious barbaric ruggedness her eyes each time she looked at her brother had without doating the light as of the rise of happy tears to the underlids as they had on a certain day at the altar when my lord was my husbandmore shyly then he would have said as beautifully but for envy of the frank pellucid worship in that look on her proved hero it was the jewel of all the earth to win back to himself and it subjected him through his desire for it to a measurement with her idol in character quality strength hardness he heard the couple pronouncing sentence of his loss by anticipation why had she primed her brother to propose the council of three addressing them separately he could have been his better or truer self the sensation of the check imposed on him was instructive as to her craft and the direction of her wishes she preferred the braving of hazards and horrors beside her brother in scorn of the advantages he could offer and he yearned to her for despising by comparison the bribe he proposed in the hope that he might win her to him she was with religion to let him know the meanness of wealth thus at the edge of the debate or contest the young lords essential nobility disarmed him and the revealing of it which would have appealed to carinthia and chillon both was forbidden by its constituent pride which helped him to live and stood obstructing explanatory speech chapter xliv between the earl the countess and her brother and of a silver cross carinthia was pleased by hearing lord fleetwood say to her your madge and my gower are waiting to have the day named for them she said i respect him so much for his choice of madge they shall not wait if i am to decide old mr woodseer has undertaken to join them it is in whitechapel they will be married the blow that struck was not intended and fleetwood passed it under her brothers judicial eye any small chance word may carry a sting for the neophyte in penitence my lawyers will send down the settlement on her to be read to them today or tomorrow with the interest on that and the sum he tells me he has in the funds they keep the wolf from the doora cottage door they have their cottage theres an old song of love in a cottage his liking for it makes him seem wiser than his clever sayings hell work in that cottage they have a good friend to them in you my lord it will not be poverty for their simple wants i hear of the little cottage in surrey where they are to lodge at first before they take one of their own we will visit them when i am in england i shall visit them often he submitted the man up here wounded is recovering yes my lord i am learning to nurse the wounded with the surgeon to direct me matters are sobering downthe workmen they listen to reason so willingly when we speak personally we find the earl addressed chillon your project of a spanish expedition reminds me of favourable reports of your chief thoroughly able and up to the work chillon answered queer people to meddle with we re on the right side on the dispute it counts napoleon says a spanish civil war promises bloody doings any war does that in the peninsula its war to the knife a merciless business good schooling for the profession fleetwood glanced she was collected and attentive i hear from mrs levellier that carinthia would like to be your companion my sister has the making of a serviceable hospital nurse you hear the chatter of london i have heard it you encourage her mr levellier she will be usefulbetter there than here my lord i claim a part in the consultation there s no consultation she determines to go we can advise her of all the risks she has weighed them every one in the event of accidents the responsibility for having persuaded her would rest on you my brother has not persuaded me carinthias belltones intervened i proposed it the persuasion was mine it is my happiness to be near him helping if i can lady fleetwood i am entitled to think that your brother yielded to a request urged in ignorance of the nature of the risks a woman runs my brother does not yield to a request without examining it all round my lord and i do not i know the risks an evil that we should not endurelife may go there can be no fear for me she spoke plain truth the soul of this woman came out in its radiance to subdue him as her visage sometimes did and her voice enlarged her words she was a warrior woman life her sword death her target never to be put to shame unconquerable no such symbolical image smote him but he had an impression the prose of it as in the scene of the miners cottares her lord could have knelt to her and for an unprotesting longer space now he choked a sigh shrugged and said in the worlds patient manner with mad people you have set your mind on it you see it rosecoloured you would not fear no but your friends would have good reason to fear its a menagerie in revolt over there it is not really the place for you abandon the thought i beg i shall if my brother does not go said carinthia laughter of spite at a remark either silly or slyly defiant was checked in fleetwood by the horror of the feeling that she had gone was ankledeep in bloody mire captive prey of a rabble soldiery meditating the shot or stab of the blessed end out of womans half of our human muddle he said to chillon pardon me war is a detestable game women in the thick of it add a touch to the brutal hideousness of the whole thing chillon said we are all of that opinion men have to play the game women serving in hospital make it humaner their hospitals are not safe well safety for safety is nowhere to be had but the earl pleaded at least in our country in our country women are safe they are we may say protected laws and constables are poor protection for them the women we name ladies are pretty safe as a rule my sister then was the exception after a burning half minute the earl said i have to hear it from you mr levellier you see me here that was handsomely spoken but lord fleetwood had been judged and put aside his opening of an old case to hint at repentance for brutality annoyed the man who had let him go scathless for a sisters sake the grounds of your coming my lord are not seen my time is short i must i repeat be consulted with regard to lady fleetwoods movements my sister does not acknowledge your claim the countess of fleetwoods acts involve her husband one has to listen at times to what old sailors call caribbee chillon exclaimed impatiently half aloud my sister received your title she has to support it she did not receive the treatment of a wifeor lady or woman or domestic animal the bond is broken as far as it bears on her subjection she holds to the rite thinks it sacred you can be at rest as to her behaviour in other respects your lordship does not exist for her the father of her child must exist for her you raise that curtain my lord in the presence of three it would not bear a shaking carinthia said in pity of his torture i have my freedom and am thankful for it to follow my brother to share his dangers with him that is more to me than luxury and the married state i take only my freedom our boy you take the boy my child is with my sister henrietta where we none know yet you still mistrust me her eyes were on a man that she had put from her peaceably and she replied with sweetness in his ears with shocks to a sinking heart my lord you may learn to be a gentle father to the child i pray you may my brother and i will go if it is death for us i pray my child may have his father and god directing his father her speech had the clang of the final yes i hopeif it be the worst happening i pray too said he and drooped and brightened desperately but you too carinthia you could aid by staying by being with the boy and me carinthia he clasped her name the vapour left to him of her i have learnt learnt what i am what you are i have to climb a height to win back the wife i threw away she was unknown to me i to myself nearly as much i sent a warning of the kind of husband for youa poor kind i just knew myself well enough for that you claimed my wordthe blessing of my life if i had known it we were married i playedi see the beast i played money is power they say i see the means it is to damn the soul unless weunless a man does what i do now fleetwood stopped he had never spoken such wordsarterial words as they were though the commonest and with moist brows dry lips he could have resumed have said more have taken this woman this dream of the former bride the present stranger into his chamber of the brave aims and sentenced deeds her brother in the room was the barrier and she sat mute largeeyed expressionless he had plunged low in the mans hearing the air of his lungs was thick hard to breathe for shame of a degradation so extreme chillon imagined him to be sighing he had to listen further soul had been an uttered word when the dishonouring and mishandling brute of a young nobleman stuttered a compliment to carinthia on her faith in gods assistance and the efficacy of prayer he jumped to his legs not to be shouting hound at him he said under control gods name shall be left to the church my sister need not be further troubled she has shown she is not persuaded by me matters arranged here quicklywe start if i am asked whether i think she does wisely to run the risks in an insurrectionary country rather than remain at home exposed to the honours and amusements your lordship offers i think so she is acting in her best interests she has the choice of being abroad with me or staying here unguarded by me she has had her experience she chooses rightly paint the risks she runs you lay the colours on those she escapes she thanks the treatment she has undergone for her freedom to choose i am responsible for nothing but the not having stood against her most wretched marriage it might have been foreseen out there in the war she is protected here she is withi spare your lordship the name fleetwood would have heard harsher had he not been carinthias husband he withheld his reply the language moved him to proud hostility but the speaker was carinthias brother he said to her you wont forget gower and madge she gave him a smile in saying it shall be settled for a day after next week the forms of courtesy were exchanged at the closing of the door on him chillon said he did send a message i gathered itwithout the wordsfrom our uncle griphard i thought him in honour bound to youand it suited me that i should i was a blindfold girl dearest no warning would have given me sight said carinthia that was my treachery to the love of my brother i dream of father and mother reproaching me the misery of her time in england had darkened her minds picture of the early hour with chillon on the heights above the forsaken old home and the enthusiasm of her renewed devotion to her brother giving it again as no light of a lost eden as the brilliant step she was taking with him from their morning eastern alps to smokycrimson pyrenees and spanish sierras she could imagine the cavernous interval her punishment for having abandoned a sisters duties in the quest of personal happiness but simultaneously the growing force of her minds intelligence wherein was no enthusiasm to misdirect by overcolouring enabled her to gather more than a suspicion of comparative feebleness in the man stripped of his terrors she penetrated the discrowned tyrants nature some distance deep enough to be quit of her foregoing alarms these combined with his assured high style had woven him the magical coat threadbare to quiet scrutiny she matched him beside her brother the dwarfed object was then observed and it was not for a woman to measure herself beside him she came however of a powerful blood and he was pressing her back on her resources without the measurement or a thought of it she did that which is the most ordinary and the least noticed of our daily acts in civilized intercourse she subjected him to the trial of the elements composing him by collision with what she felt of her own and it was because she felt them strongly aware of her feeling them but unaware of any conflict that the wrestle occurred she flung him pitied him and passed on along her path elsewhere this can be done when love is gone it is done more or less at any meeting of men and men and men and women who love not are perpetually doing it unconsciously or sensibly even in their love a time for the trial arrives among certain of them and the leadership is assumed and submission ensues tacitly nothing of the contention being spoken perhaps nothing definitely known in carinthias case her revived enthusiasm for her brother drove to the penetration of the husband pleading to thwart its course his offer was wealth that is luxury amusement ease the subaudible himself into the bargain was disregarded not counting with one who was an upward rush of fire at the thought that she was called to share her brothers dangers chillon cordially believed the earl to be the pestilent half madman junction with whom is a constant trepidation for the wife when it is not a screaming plight he said so and carinthia let him retain his opinion she would have said it herself to support her scheme though mad applied to a man moving in the world with other men was not understood by her with henrietta for the earls advocate she was patient as the deaf rockwall enthusiam can be against entreaties to change its direction or bid it disperse the private band of picked musicians at the disposal of the countess of fleetwood and opera singers henrietta mentioned resonant names hired for wonderful nights at esslemont and calesford or on board the earls beautiful schooner yacht were no temptation nor did henriettas allusions to his broken appearance move his wife except in her saying regretfully he changes on the hall table at esslemont a letter from his bankers informed the earl of a considerable sum of money paid in to his account in the name of lord brailstone chumley potts hanging at him like a dog without a master since the death of his friend ambrose had journeyed down anxious about you he said anxious about or attracted by the possessor of ambrose mallards clean sweeper the silvermounted small pistol sight of which he begged to have and to lengthened his jaw on hearing it was loaded a loaded pistol this dark little one to the right of the earls blottingpad and pens had the look of a fearful link with his fallen chaps and fishy hue potts maundered moralities upon life holding the thing in his hand weighing it eyeing the muzzle he couldnt help thinking of what is going to happen to us after it all and brosey knows now was followed by a twitch of one cheek and the ejaculation forever fleetwood alive and ambrose dead were plucking the startled worldling to a peep over the verge into our abyss and the young lords evident doing of the same commanded chumley potts imitation of him under the cloud ambrose had become for both of them he was recommended to see lord feltre if he had a desire to be instructed on the subject of the mitigation of our pains in the regions below potts affirmed that he meant to die a protestant christian thereupon carrying a leaden burden of unlaughed laughable stuff in his breast and chummys concluding remark to speed him damn it no well stick to our religion fleetwood strode off to his library and with the names of the ixionides of his acquaintance ringing round his head proceeded to strike one of them off the number privileged at the moment to intrude on him others would follow this one must be the first to go he wrote the famous letter to lord brailstone which debarred the wily pursuer from any pretext to be running down into mrs levelliers neighbourhood and also precluded the chance of his meeting the fair lady at calesford with the brevity equivalent to the flick of a glove on the cheek lord brailstone was given to understand by lord fleetwood that relations were at an end between them no explanation was added a single sentence executed the work and in the third person he did not once reflect on the outcry in the ear of london coming from the receiver of such a letter upon payment of a debt the letter posted and flying lord fleetwood was kinder to chumley potts he had a friendly word for gower woodseer though both were heathens after their diverse fashions neither of them likely ever to set out upon the grand old road of rome lord feltres appian way of the saints and comforters chummy was pardoned when they separated at night for his reiterated allusions to the temptation of poor ambrose mallards conclusive little weapon lying on the library table within reach of a mans armchair in its case and the case locked yes but easily opened provoking every damnable sort of mortal curiosity the soundest men among us have their fits of the blues fleetwood was told not wholesome chummy shook his head resolutely and made himself comprehensibly mysterious he meant well he begged his old friend to promise he would unload and keep it unloaded for i know the infernal worry you havedeuced deal worse than a nights bad luck said he and fleetwood smiled sourly at the worlds total ignorance of causes his wretchedness was due now to the fact that the aforetime huntress refused to be captured he took a silver cross from a tabledrawer and laid it on the pistolcase there chummy he said that was all not sermonizing or proselytizing he was partly comprehended by chumley potts fully a week later the unsuspecting fellow soon to be despatched in the suite of brailstone bore away an unwontedly affectionate dismissal to his bed and spoke some rather squeamish words himself as he recollected with disgust when he ran about over london repeating his executioners the cross on the pistolcase may have conduced to lord fleetwoods thought that his days among unrepentant ephemeral protestant sinners must have their immediate termination these old friends were the plagueinfected clothes he flung off his body but the cross where it lay forbidding a movement of the hand to that box was authoritative to decree his passage through a present torture by the agency of the hand he held back from the solution of his perplexity at the cost which his belief in the eternal would pay henrietta had mentioned her husbands defeat by some dastardly contrivance he had to communicate for the disburdening of his soul not only that he was guilty but the meanest of criminals in being no more than half guilty his training told him of the contempt women entertain toward the midway or cripple sinner when they have no special desire to think him innocent how write or even how phrase his having merely breathed in his ruffians hearing the wish that he might hear of her husbands defeat and with what object here too a woman might years hence if not forgive bend her head resignedly over the mans vile nature supposing strong passion his motive but the name for the actual motive it would not bear writing or any phrasing round it an unsceptred despot bidden take a fair womans eyes into his breast saw and shrank and now the eyes were carinthias he saw a savage bridegroom and a black ladderclimber and the sweetest of pardoning brides and the devil in him still insatiate for revenge upon her who held him to his word he wrote read tore the page trimmed the lamp and wrote again he remembered gower woodseers having warned him he would finish his career a monk not like feltre an oily convert but under the hood yes and extracting a chartreuse from his ramble through woods richer far than the philosophers milk of mother natures bosom there flamed the burning signal of release from his torments there his absolving refuge instead of his writing fruitless intricate impossible stuff to a woman the letter was renounced and shredded the dedicated ascetic contemplated a hooded shape washed of every earthly fleck it proved how men may by power of grip squeeze raptures out of pain chapter xlv contains a record of what was feared what was hoped and what happened the dame is at her thumps for attention to be called to the strangeness of it that a poor small sparse village hardly above a hamlet on the most unproductive of kentish

rouse excitement at stages of a narrative londons general eye upon little croridge was but another instance of the extraordinary and not so wonderful lady arpington equal to a parliament in herself

dying mother his wealth was counted multiplied by the ready naughts of those who know little and dread much sir meeson corby referred to an argument lord fleetwood had held on an occasion hotly against the logical consistency of the protestant faith and to his alarm lest some day all that immense amount of money should slip away from us to favour the machinations of roman catholicism the countess of cressett livia anticipated her no surprise at anything lord fleetwood might do she knew him so thereupon with the whirr of a covey on wing before the fowler our crested three of immemorial

wealthy young earl of fleetwood wedded to an adventuress and a target for the scandals emanating from the woman was daily without omission of a day seen walking piccadilly pavement in company once more with the pervert the jesuit agent that crafty catesby of a lord feltre arm in arm the pair of them and uninterruptedly conversing utterly unlike englishmen mr rose mackrell passed them and his breezy salutation of the earl was unobserved in my lords vacant glass optics as he sketched the scene london had report of the sinister tempter and the imperilled young probationer undisguisedly

government asks it vixenly of our impotent male which pretends beneath an air of sympathy that we should abstain from any compulsory action upon the law to interfere though the situation is confessedly grave and the aspect men assume is correspondingly to the last degree provokingly gravehalf alive that they are or void of patriotism or babylonian at heart lord fleetwoods yet undocked old associates vowed he smelt strong of the fumes of the whirled silver censerballs his disfavour had caused a stoppage of supplies causing vociferous abomination of their successful rivals the romish priests captain abrane sniffed loud as a horse condemnatory as a cat in speaking of him he said by george it comes to this we shall have to turn catholics for a loan watchdogs of the three repeated the gigantic gamblers melancholy roar and see what gap cried the ratiocination of alarm see the landslip it is in our body national and religious when exalted personages go that way to rome as you and the world have reflected in your sager moods an ordinary pebble may roll where it likes for individualism of the multitudinously obscure little affects us not so the costly jewel which is a congregation of ourselves in our envies and longings and genuflexions thick about its lustres the lapses of precious things must needs carry us both by weight and example and it will ceaselessly be that we are possessed by the treasure we possess we hang on it a still small voice of englands mind under panic sent up these truisms containing admonitions to the governing ladies they the most conservative of earthly bodies clamoured in return like cloudscud witches that have caught fire at their skirts from the torches of marshfire radicals they cited for his arrest the titled millionaire who made a slide for the idiots of the kingdom they stigmatized our liberty as a sophistry unless we have in it the sustaining element of justice and where is the justice that punishes his country for any fatal course a mad young croesus may take they shackled the hands of testators who endangered the salvation of coroneted boys by having sanction to bequeath vast wealth in bulk they said in truth that it was the liberty to be unchristian finally they screeched a petitioning of parliament to devote a night to a sitting and empower the lord chancellor to lay an embargo on the personal as well as the real estate of wealthy perverts in common prudence depriving rome of the coveted means to turn our religious weapons against us the three guardian ladies and their strings of followers headed over the fevered and benighted town as the records of the period attest windpiping these and similar solan notes from the undigested cropful of alarms lord fleetwoods expected conduct crammed into them they and all the world traced his present madness to the act foregoing that marriage they reviewed it to deplore it every known incident and the numbers imagined yet merely to deplore frightful comparisons of then with now rendered the historical shock to the marriage market matter for a sick smile evil genius of some sort beside him the wealthy young nobleman is sure to have he has got rid of one to take up with a viler first a sluttish trollop of german origin is foisted on him for life next he is misled to abjure the faith of his fathers for rome but patently desperation in the husband of such a wife weakened his resistance to the roman catholic perverts insinuations there we punctuate the full stop to our inquiries we have the secret and upon that suddenly comes a cyclonic gust and gossip twirls whines and falls to the twanging of an entirely new set of notes that furnish a tolerably agreeable tune on the whole o hear the marchioness of arpington proclaims not merely acquaintanceship with lord fleetwoods countess she professes esteem for the young person she has been heard to say that if the principality of wales were not a royal title a dignity of the kind would be conferred by the people of those mountains on the countess of fleetwood such unbounded enthusiasm there was for her character when she sojourned down there as it is they do speak of her in their welsh by some title their bards are offered prizes to celebrate her deeds you remember the regiment of mounted welsh gentlemen escorting her to her kentish seat with their band of the threestringed harps she is wellborn educated handsome a perfectly honest woman and a sound protestant quite the reverse of lord fleetwoods seeking to escape her it is she who flies she cannot forgive him his cruelties and infidelities and that is the reason why he threatens to commit the act of despair only she can save him she has flown for refuge to her uncle lord levelliers house at a place named croridgenot in the gazetteerhard of access and a home of poachers where shooting goes on hourly but most picturesque and romantic as she herself is lady arpington found her there nursing one of the wounded and her uncle on his deathbed obdurate all round against her husband but pensive when supplicated to consider her country endangered by rome she is a fervent patriot the tales of her whitechapel origin and heading mobs wielding bludgeons are absolutely false traceable to scandalizing anecdotists like mr rose mackrell she is the beautiful example of an injured wife doing honour to her sex in the punishment of a faithless husband yet so little cherishing her natural right to deal him retribution that we dare hope she will listen to her patriotic duty in consenting to the reconcilement which is lord fleetwoods alternative his wife or rome they say she has an incommunicable charm accounting for the price he puts on her now she holds aloof and he misses it let her but rescue him from englands most vigilant of her deadly enemies she will be entitled to the nations lasting gratitude she has her opportunity for winning the anglican english as formerly she won the dissenter welsh she may yet be the means of leading back the latter to our fold a notation of the cries in air at a time of surgent public excitement can hardly yield us music and the wording of them by the aid of compounds and transplants metaphors and similes only just within range of the arrows of phoebus bow ie the farthest flight known would while it might imitate the latent poetry expose venturesome writers to the wrath of a people commendably believing their language a perfected instrument when they prefer the request for a plateful and commissioning their literary police to brain audacious experimenters who enlarge or wing it beyond the downright aim at that mark the gossip of the time must therefore appear commonplace in resemblance to the panting venue a terre of the toad instead of the fiery steeds although we have documentary evidence that our countrys heart was movedin no common degree dr glossops lucid english has it at the head of a broadsheet ballad discovered by him wherein the connubially inclined young earl and the nation in turn beseech the countess to resume her place at esslemont and so save both from a terrific dragons jaw scarlet as the infernal flames described as fascinating the classes with the crests and the lining to their vests till down they jump and empty leave a headless trunk that rests these ballads burlesque to present reading mainly intended for burlesque by the wits who dogged without much enlivening an anxious period of our history when cornerstones were falling the way the young lord of the millions threatened to go did there is little doubt according to another part of their design rose mackrell boasts it indirectly in his memoirs interpret public opinion that is the english humour of itthe half laugh in their passing and not simulated shudder carinthia had a study of the humours of english character in the person of the wounded man she nursed on little croridge imagining it the most unobserved of english homes and herself as unimportant an object daniel charner took his wound as he took his medicine and his posset from her hand kindly and seemed to have a charitable understanding of lord levellier now that the old nobleman had driven a pellet of lead into him and laid him flat it pleased him to assure her that his mates were men of their word and had promised to pay the old lord with a rouse for it nothing worse her father used to speak of the clean hearts of the english as to the husbanding of revenge that is the no spot of bad blood to vitiate them captain john peter seconded all goodhumoured fighters for the long account they will surely win and it was one of his maxims my foe can spoil my face he beats me if he spoils my temper recalling the scene of her bridal daythe two strong englishmen at the shake of hands that had spoiled one anothers faces she was enlightened with a comprehension of her fathers love for the people seeing the spiritual of the gross ugly picture as not every man can do and but a warrior joan among women chillon shall teach the spanish people english heartiness she thought lord fleetwoods remarks on the expedition would have sufficed to stamp it righteous with her that was her logic of the low valuation of him she fancied herself absolutely released at his departure neither her sister riette nor her friend owain administering sentiment and common sense to her by turns could conceive how the passion for the recovery of her brothers military name fed the hope that she might aid in it how the hope fed the passion she had besides her hunger to be at the work she could do her chillons glory for morning sky above it such was the mind lady arpington brought the worlds wisdom to bear upon deeming it in the end female only in its wildness and obstinacy carinthias answers were few barely varied her repetition of my brother irritated the great lady whose argument was directed to make her see that these duties toward her brother were primarily owing to her husband the man she would reclaim and could guide and the countess of fleetwoods position her duty to society her dispensing of splendid hospitality the strengthening of her husband to do his duty to the nation the saving of him from a fatal stepfrom rome these were considerations for a reasonable woman to weigh before she threw up all to be off on the maddest of adventures inconceivable my dear child lady arpington proceeded until she heard herself as droning carinthias unmoved aspect of courteous attention appeared to invoke the prolongation of the sermon it criticized it had an air of reversing their positions while she listened to the charge of folly and incidentally replied her reason for not fearing roman catholic encroachments was she said her having known good catholics in the country she came from for herself she should die professing the faith of her father and mother behind her correct demeanour a rustic intelligence was exhibited she appreciated her duty to her marriage oath my husbands honour is quite safe with me neither england nor religion nor womans proper devotion to a husbands temporal and spiritual welfare had claims rivalling her devotion to her brother she could not explain a devotion that instigated her to an insensate course it seemed a kind of enthusiasm and it was coldly spoken in the tone referring to her husbands honour her brothers enterprise had her approval because her mothers prayer was for him to serve in the english army by running over to take a side in a spanish squabble she was asked and answered he will learn war my chillon will show his value he will come back a tried soldier she counted on his coming back she did i cannot take a step forward without counting on success we know the chances we are to meet my father has written of death we do not fear it so it is nothing to us we shall go together we shall not have to weep for one another the strange young womans avoidance of any popular sniffle of the pathetic had a recognized merit tell me lady arpington said abruptly this maid of yours who is to marry the secretary or whatever he wasyou are satisfied with her she is my dear servant madge a cloud opened as carinthia spoke the name she will be a true wife to him they will always be my friends nothing against the earl in that direction apparently unless his countess was blest with the density of frigidity societys emissary sketched its perils for unprotected beautiful woman an outline of the london quadrille henrietta danced in and she glanced at carinthia and asked have you thought of it carinthias eyes were on the great ladys their meaning was you hit my chief thought they were read as her farthest thought for the hint of henriettas weakness deadened her feelings with a reminder of warm and continued solicitations rebutted the beautiful creatures tortures at the idea of her exile from england an outwearied hopelessness expressed a passive sentiment very like indifference in the clear wide gaze she replied i have my proposal to her was cadiz with both our young ones she will not and there is an end to that part of the question lady arpington interpreted it by the gaze more than the words under subjection of the young womans character nevertheless she bore away carinthias consent to a final meeting with the earl at her house in london as soon as things were settled at croridge chillon whom she saw was just as hard unforgiving careless of his countrys dearest interests brother and sister were one heart of their one blood she mentioned the general impression in town that the countess and only she could save the earl from rome a flash of polite laughter was chillons response but after her inspection of the elegant athlete she did fancy it possible for a young wife even for henrietta to bear his name proudly in his absenceif that was worth a moments consideration beside the serious issues involved in her appeal to the countess especially when the suggestion regarding young wives left unprotected delicately conveyed to the husband had failed of its purpose the handsome husbands brows fluttered an interrogation as if her clearobscure should be further lighted and it could not be done he weighed the wife by the measure of the sister perhaps or his military head had no room for either his callousness to the danger of his countrys disintegration from the incessant becoming overt attacks of a foreign priesthood mightan indignant great ladys precipitation to prophecy said wouldbring chastisement on him she said it and she liked henrietta vowing to defeat her forecast as well as she could in a land seeming forsaken by stable principles its nobles breaking up its national church going over to rome embracing the faith of the impostor mahomet gossip fed to the starvation bone of lady arpingtons report until one late afternoon memorable for the breeding heat in the van of elemental artillery newsboys waved damp sheets of fresh print through the streets and societys guardians were brought to confess in shame and gladness that they had been growing sceptical of the active assistance of providence at first the terrible explosion of gunpowder at croridge alarmed them lest the timely power should have done too much a day later the general agitation was pacified lady arpington circulated the word safe and the world knew the disaster had not engulphed lady fleetwoods valuable life she had the news by word of mouth from the lovely mrs kirbylevellier sisterinlaw to the countess we are convinced we have proof of providence intervening when some terrific event of the number at its disposal accomplishes the thing and no more than the thing desired pitiful though it may seem for a miserly old lord to be blown up in his bed it is necessarily a subject of congratulation if the life or poor remnant of a life sacrificed was an impediment to our righteous wishes but this is a theme for the dame who would full surely have committed another breach of the treaty had there not been allusion to her sisterhoods view of the government of human affairs on the day preceding the catastrophe chillons men returned to work he and carinthia and mr wythan lunched with henrietta at stoneridge walking down to lekkatts they were astounded to see the figure of the spectral old lord on the plank to the powder store clad in his long black cloak erect he was crossing he told them to count his barrels a dream had disturbed him chillon fell to rapid talk upon various points of business and dispersed lord levelliers memory relating to his errand leaning on carinthias arm he went back to the house where he was put to bed in peace of mind his resuscitated physical vigour blocked all speculation for the young people assembled at stoneridge that night they hardly spoke they strangled thoughts forming as larvae of wishes henrietta would be away to lady arpingtons next day mr wythan to wales the two voyagers were sadder by sympathy than the two whom they were leaving to the clocks round of desert sameness about ten at night chillon and mr wythan escorted carinthia for the nights watch beside her uncle down to lekkatts it was midway that the knocks on air as of a muffled mallet at a door and at farther doors of caverns smote their ears and shook the ground after an instant of the silence following a shock carinthia touched her brothers arm and chillon said not my powder they ran till they had lekkatts in sight a half moon showed the house it stood fifty paces below a column of opal smoke had begun to wreathe and stretch a languid flag the rouse promised to lord levellier by daniel charners humorous mates had hit beyond its aim intended to give him a startor oneer in return it surpassed his angry shot at the body of them in effect carinthia entered his room and saw that he was lying stretched restfully she whispered of this to chillon and began upon her watch reading her spanish phrasebook and she could have wept if she had been a woman for tears her duty to stay in england with chillons fair wife crossed the beckoning pages like a black smoke her passion to go and share her brothers dangers left the question of its righteousness at each fall of the big breath her uncles grey head on his pillow was like a flintstone in chalk under her look by light of dawn the chin had dropped chapter xlvi a chapter of undercurrents and some surface flashes thus a round and a good old english practical repartee worthy a place in englands book of her historical popular jests conceived ingeniously no bit murderously even humanely if englishmen are to be allowed indulgence of a jolly hit back for an injurymore a feint than a real strokegave the miserly veteran his final quake and cut chillons knot lord levellier dead of the joke detracted from the funny idea there had been in the anticipation of his hearing the libertine explosion of his grand new powder and coming out cloaked to see what walls remained upright its cleverness however was magnified by the shades into which it had despatched him the man who started the rouse for old griphard was named nor did he shuffle his honours off chillon accused him and he regretfully grinned he would have owned to it eloquently excited by the extreme ingenuity but humour at the criminal bar is an abject thing that has to borrow from metaphysics for the expository words he lacked them entirely and as he could not fronting his master supply the defect with oaths he drew up and let out on the dead old lord who wanted a few pounds of blasting powder like anything else in everybodys way chillon expected the lowest of his countrymen to show some degree of chivalry upon occasions like the present he was too young to perceive how it is that a block of our speech in the needed direction drives it storming in another not the one closely expressing us carinthia liked the man she was grieved to hear of his having got the sack summarily when he might have had a further month of service or a months pay had not the workmens forbearance been much tried and they had not stolen they had bought the powder only intending to startle she touched her brothers native sense of fairness and vexed him with his cowardly devil of impatience which kicked at a simply stupid common man and behaved to a lordly offender smelling rascal civilly just as her father would havetreated the matter she said are we sorry for what has happened chillon the man had gone the injustice was done the master was left to reflect on the part played by his inheritance of the half share of ninety thousand pounds in his proper respect for lord levelliers memory harsh to an inferior is a horrible charge but the position of debtor to a titled cur brings a worse for endurance knowing a part of lord fleetwoods message to lord levellier suppressed the brides brother her chief guardian had treated the omission as of no importance and had all the while understood that he ought to give her his full guess at the reading of it or so his racked mind understood it now his old father had said a dumb tongue can be a heavy liar and lies are usurers coin we pay for ten thousand per cent his harshness in the past hour to a workman who had suffered with him and had not intended serious mischief was chillons unsounded motive for the resolution to be out of debt to the man he loathed there is a muse that smiles aloft surveying our acts from the wellsprings carinthia heard her brothers fuller version of the earls communication to her uncle before the wild day of her marriage not particularly fitted for the married state chillon phrased it saying he seems to have known himself he was honest so far she was advised to think it over that the man was her husband she had her brothers heart in her breast she could not misread him she thought it over and felt a slight drag of compassion for the reluctant bridegroom that was a stretch long leagues distant from love with her the sort of feeling one has for strange animals hurt and she had in her childish blindness done him a hurt and he had bitten her he was a weak young nobleman he had wealth for a likeness of strength he had no glory about his head why had he not chosen a woman to sit beside him who would have fancied his coronet a glory and his luxury a kindness but the poor young nobleman did not choose the sadly comic of his keeping to the pledge of his wordhis real wifethe tyrant of the tyrantclothed him the vision of him at the altar and on the coach and at the royal sovereign inn and into the dimness where a placidly smiling recollection met a curtain and lost the smile suppose that her duty condemned her to stay in england on guard over chillons treasure the perpetual struggle with a weak young nobleman of aimless tempers and rightabout changes pretending to the part of husband would she foresaw raise another figure of duty enchaining a weak young woman the world supported his pretension and her passion to serve as chillons comrade sank at a damping because it was flame chillon had done that lady arpington to some extent henrietta more a little incident pointing in no direction had left a shadow of a cloud consequent upon lady arpingtons mention of henriettas unprotectedness stepping up the hill to meet her sister on the morning of henriettas departure for london under the convoy of mr wythan carinthias long sight spied kit ines or a man like him in the meadow between lekkatts and croridge he stood before henrietta and vanished lightlegged at a gesture henrietta was descending to take her leave of her busied husband her cheeks were flushed she would not speak of the fellow except to reply oh a beggar and kept asking whether she ought not to stay at stoneridge and if she did she would lose the last of the opera in london how could she help to investigate the cause of an explosion so considerate to them she sang snatches of melodies clung to her husband protested her inability to leave him and went appearing torn away as well bid healthy children lie abed on a bright summer morning as think of holding this fair young woman bound to the circle of safety when she has her view of pleasure sparkling like the shoresea mermaids mirror suspicions were not of the brood carinthias bosom harboured suspicion of chillons wife carinthia could not feel an uncaptained vessel in the winds on high seas was imagined without a picturing of it the apparition of ives if it was he would not fit with any conjecture she sent a warning to madge and at the same time named the girls wedding day for her pained in doing it she had given the dear girl her word that she would be present at this of all marriages but a day or two days or more would have to be spent away from chillon and her hunger for every hour beside her brother confessed to the war going on within her as to which was her holier duty the one on the line of her inclinations or that one pointing to luxurychoice between a battlehorse and a cushionedchair between companionship with her glorious brother facing death and submission to a weak young nobleman claiming his husbands rights over her she had submitted had forgotten his icy strangeness had thought him love and hers was a breast for love it was owned by the sobbing rise of her breast at the thought and she might submit againin honour scorning the husband chillon scorned him yet chillon left the decision to her specified his excuses and henrietta and owain lady arpington gower woodseer all the worldcarinthia shuddered at the worlds blank eye on what it directs for the acquiescence of the woman that shred of herself she would become she felt herself becoming it when the view of her career beside her brother waned the dead rebecca living in her heart was the only soul among her friends whose voice was her own against the worlds but there came a turn where she and rebecca separated rebeccas insurgent wishes taking shape of prophecy robbed her of her friend owain to present her an impossible object that her mind could not compass or figure she bade rebecca rest and let her keep the fancy of owain as her good ghost of a sun in the mist of a frosty morning sweeter to her than an image of love though it were the very love the love of maidens dreams bursting the bud of romance issuing its flower delusive love drove away with a credulous maiden under an english heaven on a coach and four from a windy hilltop to a crash below and a stunned recovery in the street of small shops mud rain gloom language like musketfire and the wailing wounded no regrets her father had said they unman the heart we want for tomorrow she kept her look forward at the dead wall chillon had thrown up he did not reject her company his prospect of it had clouded and there were allusions to henriettas loneliness his carin could do her service by staying if she decided that way her enthusiasm dropped to the level of lifes common ground with her sustainment gone she beheld herself a titled doll and had sternly to shut her eyes on the behind scenes bar any shadowy approaches of womanly softness thinking her fathers daughter dishonoured in the submissive wife of the weak young nobleman chillon despised as below the title of man madge and gower came to stoneridge on their road to london three days before their union madge had no fear of ines but said i never let mr gower out of my sight perforce of studying him with the thirsty wonder consequent upon his proposal to her she had got fast hold of the skirts of his character she knew he was happy because he was always making her laugh at herself her manner of saying she hoped to give him a comfortable home so that he might never be sorry for what he had done was toned as in a church beautiful to her mistress speaking of my lords great kindness her eyes yearned for a second and fell humbly she said of kit ives hes found a new paytron sarah says mr woodseer tells her my lady its another nobleman lord brailstone has come into money lately and hired him for his pugilist when its not horseracing gower spoke of thanks to lord fleetwood for the independence allowing him to take a wife and settle to work in his little surrey home he too showed he could have said more and was advised not to push at a shut gate my lord would attend their wedding as well as my lady carinthia heard from madge counting it a pity that wealthy noblemen had no professions to hinder the doing of unprofitable things her sensibility was warmer on the weddingday of these two dear ones he graced the scene she admitted when reassured by his perfect reserve toward her personally he was the born nobleman in his friendliness with the bridal pair and respectfulness to mr woodseer high social breeding is an exquisite performance on the instrument we are and his behaviour to her left her mind at liberty for appreciation of it condescension was not seen his voice had no false note during the ceremony his eyelids blinked rapidly at the close he congratulated the united couple praising them each for the wisdom of their choice he said to his countess this is one of the hopeful marriages chiefly of your making she replied my prayers will be for them always they are fortunate who have your prayers he said and turned to sarah winch she was to let him know when she also had found her great philosopher sarah was like a fish on a bank taking gasps at the marvel of it all she blushed the pale pink of her complexion and murmured of happiness gower had gone headlong into happiness where philosophers are smirkers and mouthers of ordinary stuff his brightest remark was to put the question to his father the three good things of the isle of britain and treble the name of madge woodseer for a richer triad than the glamorgan man could summon pardonably foolish but mindful of a past condition of indiscipline natures philosopher said to the old minister your example saved me for this day at a turn of my road sir natures poor wild scholar paid that tribute to the regimental sectarian enough for proud philosophy to have done the thing demonstrably right gowers look at his madge and the world said that european rose of the coalblack order as one of his numerous pictures of her painted the girl was a torch in a cavern for dusky redness at her cheeks her responses beneath the book mr woodseer held open had flashed a distant scene through lord fleetwood quaint to notice was her reverence for the husband she set on a towering monument and her friendly wifely whispered jogs at the unpractical creatures forgetfulness of his wraps his books his writingdeskon this tremendous occasion his pipe again the earl could have sworn that despite her antecedents she brought her husband honest dower as surely as she gave the lucky pagan a whole heart and had a remarkably fine bust to house the organ too and a clarionet of a voice curiously like her mistresss and not a bad fellow but a heathen dog a worshipper of nature walked off with the girl whose voice had the ring of carinthias the powers do not explain their dispensations these two now one by united goodwill for the junction lord fleetwood himself drove through loudon to the hills where another carriage awaited them by his orders in the town of londons racecourse as soon as they were seated he nodded to them curtly from his box and drove back leaving them puzzled but his countess had not so very coldly seen him start his horses to convey the modest bridal pair his impulses to kindness could be politic before quitting whitechapel she went with sarah to look at the old shop of the fruits and vegetables they found it shut untenanted mr woodseer told them that the earl was owner of it by recent purchase and would not lease it he had to say why for the countess was dull to the notion of a sentimental desecration in the occupying of her bedchamber by poor tradespeople she was little flattered the great nobleman of her imagination when she lay there dwindled to a whimsy infant despot of his nursery capricious with his toys likely to damage himself if left to himself how it might occur she heard hourly from her hostess lady arpington from henrietta as well in different terms he seemed to her no longer the stationed nobleman but one of other idle men and the saddest of young men his weakness cast a net on her worse than that drag of compassion she foresaw the chance of his having experience of her own weakness if she was to be one among idle women she might drop to the love of him again chillons damping of her enthusiasm sank her to a mere breathing body miserably an animal body no comrade for a valiant brother this young mans feeble consort perhaps and a creature thirsting for pleasure disposed to sigh in the prospect of caresses enthusiasm gone her spirited imagination of active work on the field of danger beside her brother flapped a broken wing she fell too low in her esteem to charge it upon henrietta that she stood hesitating leaning on the hated side of the debate though she could almost have blamed chillon for refusing her his positive counsel and not ordering his wife to follow him once lady arpington reasoning with her on behalf of the husband who sought reconciliation sneered at her brothers project condemned it the more for his resolve to carry it out now that he had means the front of a shower sprang to carinthias eyelids now that her brother had means he from whom she might be divided was alert to keep his engagement and study war on the field as his father had done in foreign service offering england a trained soldier should his country subsequently need him the contrast of her heroic brother and a luxurious idle lord scattering blood of bird or stag and despising the soldiers profession had a singular bitter effect consequent on her scorn of words to defend the man her heart idolized this last of young women for weeping wept in the ladys presence the feminine trick was pardoned to her because her unaccustomed betrayal of that form of enervation was desired it was read as womans act of selfpity over her perplexity which is a melting act with the woman when there is no man to be dissolved by it so far lady arpington judged rightly carinthias tears shed at the thought of her brother under the worlds false judgement of him left her spiritless to resist her husbands advocates unusual as they were almost unknown they were thunderdrops and shook her all for the vivid surface the dame frets at stresses laid on undercurrents there is no bridling her unless the tale be here told of how lord brailstone in his frenzy of the disconcerted rival boasted over town the counterstroke he had dealt lord fleetwood by sending mrs levellier a statement of the latter noblemans base plot to thwart her husbands wager with his foul agent the repentant and wellpaid ruffian in person to verify every written word the towns conception of the necessity for the reunion of the earl and countess was too intense to let exciting scandal prosper moreover the towns bright anticipation of its concluding festivity on the domain of calesford argued such tattle down to a baffled adorers malice the countess of cressett having her cousin the beautiful mrs kirbylevellier in her house has denied lord brailstone admission at her door we can affirm he has written to her vehemently has called a second time has vowed publicly that mrs levellier shall have her warning against lord fleetwood the madness of jealousy was exhibited lady arpington pronounced him in his conduct unworthy the name of gentleman and how foolish the scandal he circulates lord fleetwoods one aim is to persuade his offended wife to take her place beside him he expresses regret everywhere that the death of her uncle lord levellier withholds her presence from calesford during her term of mourning and that he has given his word for the fete on a particular day before london runs quite dry his pledge of his word is notoriously inviolate the countess of cressettan extraordinary instance of a thrice married woman corrected in her addiction to play by her alliance with a rakish juveniledeclares she performs the part of hostess at the request of the countess of fleetwood perfectly convincing the more so if you have the gossips keen scent of a deduction since lord fleetwood and young lord cressett and the jesuit lord feltre have been seen confabulating with very sacerdotal countenances indeed three english noblemen not counting eighty years for the whole three and dear lady cressett fears she may be called on to rescue her boyhusband from a worse enemy than the green tables if lady fleetwood should unhappily prove unyielding as it shames the gentle sex to imagine she will be in fact we know through mrs levellier the meeting of reconciliation between the earl and the countess comes off at lady arpingtons by her express arrangement tomorrow none too soon the expectant world of london declared it the meeting came to pass three days before the great day at calesford carinthia and her lord were alone together this had been his burning wish at croridge where he could have poured his heart to her and might have moved the wifes but she had formed her estimate of him there she had in the comparison or clash of forces with him grown to contemplate the young man of wealth and rank who had once been impatient of an allusion to her father and sought now to part her from her brotherstop her breathing of fresh air sensationally too her ardour for the exercise of her inherited gifts attributed it to him that her fathers daughter had lived the mean existence in england pursuing a husband hounded by a mothers terrors the influences environing her and pressing her to submission sharpened her perusal of the small object largely endowed by circumstances to demand it she stood calmly discoursing with a tempered smile no longer a novice in the social manner an equal whom he had injured waited for his remarks gave ready replies and he bowing to the visible equality chafed at a sense of inferiority following his acknowledgement of it he was alone with her and next to dumb she froze a full heart as for his heart it could not speak at all it was a swinging lump the rational view of the situation was exposed to her and she listened to that favourably or at least attentively but with an edge to her civil smile when he hinted of entertainments voyages travels an excursion to her native mountain land her brother would then be facing death the rational view she admitted was one to be considered yes they were married they had a son they were bound to sink misunderstandings in the interests of their little son he ventured to say that the child was a link uniting them and she looked at him he blinked rapidly as she had seen him do of late but kept his eyes on her through the nervous flutter of the lids his pride making a determined stand for physical mastery though her look was but a look had there been reproach in it he would have found the voice to speak out her look was a cold sky above a hungering man she froze his heart from the marble of her own and because she was for adventuring with her brother at bloody work of civil war in the pay of a foreign governmenthe found a short refuge in that mute sneer and was hurled from it by an apparition of the welsh scene of the bitten infant and carinthia volunteering to do the bloody work which would have saved it which he had contested ridiculed right then her insanity now conjured the wretched figure of him opposing the martyr her splendid humaneness had offered her to be and dominated his reason subjected him to admireon to worship of the woman whatever she might do just such a feeling for a woman he had dreamed of in his younger time doubting that he would ever meet the fleshly woman to impose it his heart broke the frost she breathed yet if he gave way to the run of speech he knew himself unmanned and the fatal habit of superiority stopped his tongue after he had uttered the name he loved to speak as nearest to the embrace of her carinthiaso i think as i said we both see the common sense of the position i regret over and over againwell discuss all that when we meet after this calesford affair i shall have things to say you will overlook i am surewell men are menor try to perhaps im not worse thanwell say some you will i knowi have learnt itbe of great service help to me double my value i believe more than double it you will receive mehere or at croridge or esslemont and alone together as now i beg that was what he said having said it his escape from high tragics in the comfortable worldly tone rejoiced him to some extent also the courteous audience she gave him and her hand was not refused judging by her aspect the plain commonsense ground of their situation was accepted for the best opening step to their union though she must have had her feelings beneath it and god knew that he had her hand was friendly he could have thanked her for yielding her hand without a stage scene she had fine breeding by nature the gracefullest of trained ladies could not have passed through such an interview so perfectly in the right key and this was the woman he had seen at the wrestle with hideous death to save a muddy streetchild she touched the gentleman in him hard as it was while he held the hand of the wife his little sons mother who might be called his bride and drew him by the contact of their blood to a memory seeming impossible some other worlds attested realityshe the angel he the demon of itunimaginable yet present palpable a fact beyond his mind he let her hand fall scarce pressed did she expect more than the common sense of it to be said the more was due to her and should partly be said at their next meeting for the no further separating or else he would vow in his heart to spread it out over a whole lifes course of wakeful devotion with here and there a hint of his younger black nature better that except for a desire seizing him to make sacrifice of the demon he had been offer him up hideously naked to her mercy but it was a thing to be done by hints by fits by small doses she could only gradually be brought to the comprehension of how the man or demon found indemnification under his yoke of marriage in snatching her to torment perhaps betray and solace for the hurt to his pride in spreading a snare for the beautiful henrietta a confession it could be to none but the priest knowledge of carinthia would have urged him to the confession straightway in spite of horror the task of helping to wash a black soul white would have been her compensation for loss of companionship with her soldier brother she would have held hot iron to the rabid wound and come to a love of the rescued sufferer it seemed to please her when he spoke of mr rose mackrells applications to get back his volume of her fathers book of maxims there is mine she said for the sake of winning her quick gleam at any word of the bridal couple he conjured a picture of her madge and his gower saying that marriageas you will learnproves him honest from head to foot as she is in her way too oh she is was the answer we shall be driving down to them very soon carinthia it will delight them to see either of us my lord my lady adieu until i am over with this calesford he gestured as in fetters she spared him the my lording as she said adieu sensitive as she was and to his perception now lady arpington had a satisfactory two minutes with him before he left the house london town on the great day at calesford interchanged communications to the comforting effect that the countess of fleetwood would reign over the next entertainment chapter xlvii the last with a concluding word by the dame it is of seemingly good augury for the cause of a suppliant man however little for the man himself when she who has much to pardon can depict him in a manner that almost smiles not unlike a dandling nurse the miniature manchild sobbing off to sleep after a frenzy an example of a genus framed for excuses and he more than others chillon was amused up to inquisitive surprise by carinthias novel idea of her formerly dreaded riddle of a husband as she sketched the very rational alliance proposed to her and his kick at the fetters of calesford a shadowy dash for an image of the solicitous tyrant was added perforce to complete the scene following which her head moved sharply the subject was flung over her shoulder she was developing she might hold her ground with the husband if the alliance should be resumed and she would be a companion for henrietta in england she was now independent as to money and she could break an intolerable yoke without suffering privation he kept his wrath under determined not to use his influence either way sure though he was of her old fathers voting for her to quit the man and enter the field where qualities would be serviceable the man probably feared a scandal more than the loss of his wife in her going he had never been thrashedthe sole apology chillon discovered for him in a flushed review of the unavenged list of injuries carinthia had sustained his wise old father insisted on the value of an early thrashing to trim and shape the growth of most young men there was no proof of lord fleetwoods having schemed to thwart his wager so he put that accusation by thinking for an instant that if the man desired to have his wife with him and she left the country with her brother his own act would recoil or if she stayed to hear of a villany carinthias show of scorn could lash henrietta praised my lords kindness he had been one of the adorersas what man would not beand upon her at least he could hardly love her husband he had not wreaked his disappointment a young man of huge wealth having nothing to do but fatten his whims is the monster a rich country breeds under the blessing of peace his wife if a match for him has her work traced outmean work for the child of their father chillon thought she might be doing braver more suitable to the blood in her veins but women have to be considered as women not as possible heroines and supposing she held her own with this husband of hers which meant judging by the view of their unfolded characters at present a certain command of the freakish beast she whatever her task would not be the one set trotting he came to his opinion through the estimate he had recently formed of lord fleetwood and a study of his changed sister her brows gloomed at a recurrence to that subject their business of the expedition absorbed her each detail all the remarks he quoted of his chief hopeful or weariful for difficulties with the spanish government and with the english too started up at every turn and the rank and file of the contingent were mostly a rough lot where they were rather better than soaked weeds a small body of trained soldiers had sprung to the call to arms here and there an officer could wheel a regiment carinthia breasted discouragement english learn from blows chillon he might have added they lose half their number by having to learn from blows carin he said let me lead britons when the canteens fifty leagues to the rear yes yes it is a wine country she sighed but would the spaniards have sent for us if their experience told them they could not trust us chillon brightened rigorously yes yes theres just a something about our men at their best hard to find elsewhere were right in thinking that and our chief s the right man he is owains friend and countryman said carinthia and pleased her brother for talking like a girl in the midst of methodical calculations of the cost of this and that to purchase the supplies he would need she had an organizing head on her way down from london she had drawn on instructions from a london physician of old peninsula experience to pencil a list of the medical and surgical stores required by a campaigning army she had gained information of the london shops where they were to be procured she had learned to read medical prescriptions for the composition of drugs she was at her spanish still not behind him in the ordinary dialogue and able to correct him on points of spanish history relating to fortresses especially the basque a french bookseller had supplied her with the vicomte deschargues recently published volume of a travels in catalonia chillon saw paragraphs marked pages dogeared for reference at the same time the question of henrietta touched her anxiously lady arpingtons hints had sunk into them both i have thought of st jean de luz chillon if riette would consent to settle there french people are friendly you expect most of your work in and round the spanish pyrenees riette alone there said he and drew her by her love of him into his altered mind for he did not object to his wifes loneliness at cadiz when their plan was new london had taught her that a young woman in the giddy heyday of her beauty has to be guarded her belonging to us is the proud burden involving sacrifices but at st jean de luz if riette would consent to reside there lord fleetwoods absence and the neighbourhood of the war were reckoned on to preserve his yokefellow from any fit of the abominated softness which she had felt in one premonitory tremor during their late interview and deemed it vile compared with the life of action and service beside almost beside her brother sharing his dangers at least she would have had chillon speak peremptorily to his wife regarding the residence on the spanish borders adding in a despair and me with her to protect her unfair to riette if she cant decide voluntarily he said all he refrained from was the persuading her to stay in england and live reconciled with the gaoler of the dungeon as her feelings pictured it chillon and carinthia journeyed to london for purchases and a visit to lawyer banker and tradesmen on their way to meet his chief and owain wythan at southampton they lunched with livia the morrow was the great calesford day henrietta carolled of it lady arpington had been afllictingly demure on the theme of her presence at calesford within her term of mourning but i dont mourn and im not related to the defunct and i cant be denied the pleasure invented for my personal gratification henriettas happy flippancy pouted at the prudish objections moreover the adored columelli was to be her slave of song the termination of the london season had been postponed a whole week for calesford the utmost possible strain and her presence was understood to represent the countess of fleetwood temporarily in decorous retirement chillon was assured by her that the earl had expressed himself satisfied with his wifes reasonableness the rest will follow pleading on the earls behalf was a vain effort but she had her grounds for painting lord fleetwoods present mood to his countess in warm colours nothing short of devotion chillon londons extreme anxiety to see them united and the cause of it the immense good janey could do to her country should certainly be considered by her henrietta said she spoke feverishly a mention of st jean de luz for a residence inflicted it appeared a more violent toothache than she had suffered from the proposal of quarters in cadiz and now her husband had money she suggested his reinstatement in the english army chillon hushed that his chief had his word besides he wanted schooling in war why had he married his love for her was the answer and her beauty argued for the love but possessing her he was bound to win her a name so his reasoning ran to an accord with his military instincts and ambition nevertheless the mournful strange fact she recalled that they had never waltzed together since they were made one troubled his countenance in the mirror of hers instead of the waltz grief low worries dulness an eclipse of her had been the beautiful creatures portion it established mighty claims to a young husbands indulgence she hummed a few bars of his favourite old viennese waltz with chillon invitingly and reproachfully his loathing of lord fleetwood had to withstand an envious jump at the legs in his vison of her partner on the morrow he said youll think of some one absent you really do wish me to go my darling it is chillons wish she begged for the words she had them and then her feverishness abated to a simple sparkling composure carinthia had observed her she was heartsick under pressure of thoughts the heavier for being formless they signified in the sum her doom to see her brother leave england for the war and herself crumble to pieces from the imagined figure of herself beside him on or near the field they could not be phrased for they accused the beloved brother of a weakness in the excessive sense of obligation to the beautiful woman who had wedded him driving down to southampton by the nightcoach her tenderness toward henrietta held other thoughts unshaped except one that moved in its twilight murmuring of how the love of pleasure keeps us blind children and how the innocents are pushed by it to snap at wicked bait which the wealthy angle with pointed a charitable index on some of our social story the countess livia not an innocent like henrietta had escaped the poisoned tongues by contracting a third marriagein time lady arpington said and the knotty question was presented to a young mind why are the innocents tempted to their ruin and the darker natures allowed an escape any streetboy could have told her of the virtue in quick wits but her unexercised reflectiveness was on the highroad of accepted doctrines with their chorus of the moans of gossips for supernatural intervention to give us justice she had not learnt that those innocents pushed by an excessive love of pleasure are for the term lower in the scale than their wary darker cousins and must come to the diviner light of intelligence through suffering however the result of her meditations was to show her she was directed to be henriettas guardian after that she had no thoughts travelling beside chillon she was sheer sore feeling as of a body aching for its heart plucked out the bitterness of the separation to come between them prophesied a tragedy she touched his hand it was warm now during six days of travels from port to port along the southern and western coasts she joined in the inspection of the english contingent about to be shipped they and their chief and her brother were plain to sight like sample print of a books first page blank sheets for the rest of the volume if she might have been one among them she would have dared the reckless forecast her sensations were those of a bird that has flown into a room and beats wings against the ceiling and the windowpanes a close hard sky a transparent prison wall narrowed her powers mocked her soul she spoke little what she said impressed chillons chief owain wythan was glad to tell her the good friend had gone counter to the tide of her breast by showing satisfaction with the prospect that she would take her rightful place in the world her concentrated mind regarded the good friend as a phantom of a man the worlds echo his dead rebecca would have understood her passion to be her brothers comrade her abasement in the staying at home to guard his butterfly owain had never favoured her project he could not now perceive the special dangers chillon would be exposed to in her separation from him she had no means of explaining what she felt intensely that dangers death were nothing to either of them if they shared the fate together her rejected petition to her husband for an allowance of money on the day in wales became the vivid memory which brings out motives in its glow her husband hated her brother and why but the answer was lighted fierily down another avenue a true husband a lord of wealth would have rejoiced to help the brother of his wife he was the cause of chillons ruin and this adventure to restore his fortunes could she endure a close alliance with the man while her brothers life was imperilled carinthia rebuked her drowsy head for not having seen his reason for refusing at the time how long i am before i see anything that does not stare in my face she was a married woman whose order of mind rendered her singularly subject to the holiness of the tie and she was a weak woman she feared already at intervals now that action on a foreign field of the thunders and lightnings was denied imagination revealed her dissolving to the union with her husband and cried her comment on herself as the worlds basest of women for submitting to it while chillons life ran risks until finally she said not before i have my brother home safe an exclamation equal to a vow that being settled some appearance of equanimity returned she talked of the scarlet business as one she participated in as a distant spectator chillons chief was hurrying the embarkation of his troops within ten days the whole expedition would be afloat she was to post to london for further purchases he following to take leave of his wife and babe curiously but hardly remarked on during the bustle of work livia had been the one to send her short account of the great day at calesford henrietta the born correspondent pencilling a couple of lines she was well dreadfully fatigued rather a fright from a trip of her foot and fall over a low wire fence her message of love thrice underlined the repeated word henrietta was the last person carinthia would have expected to meet midway on the london road her name was called from a carriage as she drove up to the door of the winchester hostlery and in the lady over whose right eye and cheek a covering fold of silk concealed a bandage the voice was her sister riettes with her were two babes and their nursemaids chillon is down thereyou have left him there henrietta greeted her saw the reply and stepped out of her carriage you shall kiss the children afterwards come into one of the rooms janey alone together before an embrace she said in the voice of tears hardening to the worlds business chillon must not enter london you see the figure i am my characters in as bad case up therethanks to those men my husband has lost his golden riette when you see beneath the bandage he will have the right to put me away his beauty of beauties im fit only to dress as a pageboy and run at his heels my hero my poor dear he thinking i cared for nothing but amusement flattery was ever a punishment so cruel to the noblest of generous husbands because i know he will overlook it make light of it never reproach his riette and the rose he married comes to him a shrivelled leaf of a potpourri heap you havent seen me yet i was their beautiful woman i feel for my husband most she took breath carinthia pressed her lips on the cheek sensible to a hiss and henrietta pursued in words liker to sobs anywhere cadiz st jean de luz hospital work either anywhere my husband likes anything i want to work or ill sit and rock the children im awake at last janey were lambs to vultures with those men i dont pretend i was the perfect fool i thought myself so safe i let one of them squeeze my hand one day he swears you know what a passion is you have it for mountains and battles i for music i do remember one morning before sunrise driving back to town out of windsora dance the officers of the guardsand my lords trumpeter at the back of the coach blowing notes to melt a stone i found a mans hand had mine i remember lord fleetwood looking over his shoulder and smiling hard and lashing his horses but listenyes at calesford it happened heoh hear the name then chillon must never hear itlord brailstone was denied the right to step on lord fleetwoods grounds the opera company had finished selections from my pirata i went out for cool air little sir meeson beside me i had a folded gauze veil over my head tied at the chin in a bow some one ran up to melord brailstone he poured forth their poetry they suppose it the wine for their beautiful woman i dare say i laughed or told him to go and he began a tirade against lord fleetwood theres no mighty difference between one beast of prey and another let me get away from them all though now they would not lift an eyelid this is my husbands treasure returning to him we have to be burnt to come to our senses janeyoh you do wellit was fiendish old ballads melodrama plays i see they were built on mens deeds janey i could not believe it i have to believe it is forced down my throatthat man your husband because he could not forgive my choosing chillon schemed for chillons ruin i could not believe it until i saw in the glass this disfigured wretch he has made of me livia serves him she hates him for the tyrant he is she has opened my eyes and not for himself no for his revenge on me for my name to be as my face is he tossed me to his dogs fair game for them you do well janey he is capable of any villany and has been calling at livias door twice a day inquiring anxiously begs the first appointment possible he has no shame he is accustomed to buy men and women he thinks his money will buy my pardon give my face a new skin perhaps a woman swears to you janey by all she holds holy on earth it is not the loss of her beautythere will be a wrinkled patch on the cheek for life the surgeon says i am to bear a brown spot like a bruised peach they sell at the fruitshops cheap chillons riette i think of that the miserable wife i am for him without the beauty he loved so i think of myself as guilty a really guilty woman when i compare my loss with my husbands your accident dearest riettehow it happened carinthia said enfolding her because janey what have i ever been to chillon but the goodlooking thing he was proud of its gone oh the accident brailstone had pushed little corby away he held my hand kept imploring he wanted the usual two minutes and all to warn me againstive told you and he saw lord fleetwood coming i got my hand free and stepped back my head spinning and i fell that i recollect and a sight of flames like the end of the world i fell on one of the oillamps bordering the grass my veil lighted i had fainted those two men saw nothing but one another and little sir meeson was no help young lord cressett dashed out the flames they brought me to my senses for a second swoon livia says i woke moaning to be taken away from that hated calesford it was oh never to see that husband of yours again forgive him if you can not i i carry the mark of him to my grave i have called myself skindeep ever since day and nightthe name i deserve we will return to chillon together my own said carinthia it may not be so bad and in the hope that her lovely sister exaggerated a defacement leaving not much worse than a small scar her heart threw off its load of the recent perplexities daylight broke through her dark wood henrietta brought her liberty how far guilty her husband might be she was absolved from considering sufficiently guilty to release her upon that conclusion pity for the awakened riette shed purer teardrops through the gratitude she could not restrain could hardly conceal on her sisters behalf and her own henriettas prompt despatch to croridge to fetch the babes her journey down out of a sickroom to stop chillons visit to london proved her an awakened woman well paid for the stain on her face though the stain were lasting never had she loved henrietta never shown her so much love as on the road to the deepening colours of the west her sisterly warmth surprised the woeful spotted beauty with a reflection that this martial janey was after all a woman of feeling one whom her husband if he came to know it and the depth of it the rich sound of it would mourn in sackcloth to have lost and he did the dame interposes for the final word he mourned his loss of carinthia jane in sackcloth and ashes notwithstanding that he had the worlds affectionate condolences about him to comfort him by reason of his ungovernable countesss misbehaviour once more according to the report in running away with a young officer to take part in a foreign insurrection and when he was most the idol of his countrymen and countrywomen which it was once his immoderate aim to be he mourned her day and night knowing her spotless however wild a follower of her fathers maxims for men he believedsome have said his belief was not in errorthat the woman to aid and make him man and be the star in human form to him was miraculously revealed on the day of his walk through the foreign pine forest and his proposal to her at the ducal ball was an inspiration of his good genius continuing to his marriage morn and then running downwards like an overstrained reel under the leadership of his bad from turning to turning of that descent he saw himself advised to retrieve the fatal steps at each point attempting it just too late until too late by an hour he reached the seaport where his wife had embarked and her brother chillon john cruelly it was the common opinion refused him audience no syllable of the place whither she fled abroad was vouchsafed to him and his confessions of sins and repentance of them were breathed to empty air the wealthiest nobleman of all england stood on the pier watching the regiments of that doomed expedition mount ship ready with the bribe of the greater part of his possessions for a single word to tell him of his wifes destination lord feltre his companion has done us the service to make his emotions known he describes them true as the papist who sees every incident contribute to precipitate sinners into the bosom of his church but this we have warrant for saying did not occur before the earl had visited and strolled in the woods with his former secretary mr gower woodseer of whom so much has been told and he little better than an infidel declaring his aim to be at contentedness in life lord fleetwood might envy for a while he could not be satisfied with nature within six months of carinthia janes disappearance people had begun to talk of strange doings at calesford and some would have it that it was the rehearsal of a play in which friars were prominent characters for there the frocked gentry were seen flitting across the ground then the world learnt too surely that the dreaded evil had happened its wealthiest nobleman had gone over to the church of rome carrying all his personal and unentailed estate to squander it on images and a dogma calesford was attacked by the mobone of the notorious riots in our history was a result of the amazing marriage and roused the talk of it again over great britain when carinthia jane after two years of adventures and perils rarely encountered by women returned to these shores she was they say most anxious for news of her husband and then indeed it has been conjectured they might have been united to walk henceforward as one for life but for the sad fact that the earl of fleetwood had two months and some days previously abjured his rank his remaining property and his title to become there is one report the brother russett of the mountain monastery he visited in simple curiosity once with his betraying friend lord feltre or some say and so it may truly be it was an amateur monastery established by him down among his welsh mountains in which he served as a simple brother without any authority over the priests or what not he paid to act as his superiors monk of some sort he would be he was never the man to stop at anything half way mr rose mackrell in his memoirs was the first who revealed to the world that the mademoiselle de levellier of the french count fighting with the carlistsfalsely claimed by him as a frenchwomanwas in very truth carinthia jane the countess of fleetwood to whom carlists and legitimises alike were indebted for tender care of them on the field and in hospital and who rode from one camp through the other up to the tent of the pretender to the throne of spain bearing her petition for her brothers release which was granted in acknowledgement of her renowned humanity to both conflicting armies as the words translated by dr glossop run certain it is she brought her wounded brother safe home to england and prisoners in that war usually had short shrift for three years longer she was the countess of fleetwood widow of a living suicide mr rose mackrell describes the state of the marriage at that period no whisper of divorce did she tolerate six months after it was proved that brother russett had perished of his austerities or his heart we learn she said to the beseeching applicant for her hand mr owain wythan with the gift of it in compassion rebecca could foretell events carinthia jane had ever been ashamed of second marriages and the union with her friend rebeccas faithful simpleton gave it one supposes a natural air for he as little as she had previously known the wedded state she married him henrietta has written because of his wooing her with dogs eyes instead of words the once famous beauty carried a wrinkled spot on her cheek to her grave a saving disfigurement and the mark of changes in the story told you enough to make us think it a providential intervention for such ends as were in view so much i can say the facts related with some regretted omissions by which my story has so skeleton

conduct and that is very dependent upon accident and unless we have a perpetual whipping of the tender part of the readers mind interest in invisible persons must needs flag for it is an infant we
