undercurrents and some surface flashes xlvii the last with a concluding word by the dame chapter xxxix the red warning from a son of vapour desiring loneliness or else lord feltre's company fleetwood had to grant a deferred audience at home to various tradesmen absurdly fussy about having the house of his leased estate of calesford furnished complete and habitable on the very day stipulated by his peremptory orders that the place should be both habitable and hospitable they were right they were excused grand entertainments of london had been projected and he fell into the weariful business with them thinking of henrietta's insatiable appetite for the pleasures he had taken the lease of this burdensome calesford at an eight miles' drive from the northwest of town to gratify the devouring woman's taste which was to have all the luxuries of the town in a framework of country scenery gower woodseer and he were dining together in the evening the circumstance was just endurable but gower would play the secretary and doggedly subjected him to hear a statement of the woeful plight of countess livia's affairs gower commissioned to examine them remarked 'if we have all the figures' 'if we could stop the bleeding' fleetwood replied 'come to the opera to night i promised i promised abrane for to morrow there's no end to it this gambling mania's a flux not one of them except your old enemy corby keeps clear of it and they're at him for subsidies as they are at me and would be at you or any passenger on the suspected of a purse corby shines among them' that was heavy judgement enough gower thought no allusion to esslemont ensued the earl ate sparely and silently for the most part he was warmed a little at the opera by hearing henrietta's honest raptures over her columelli in the pirata but lord brailstone sat behind her and their exchange of ecstasies upon the tattered pathos of e il mio tradito amor was not moderately offensive his countenance in henrietta's presence had to be studied and interpreted by livia why did it darken the demurest of fuliginous intriguers argued that brail stone was but doing the spiriting required of him and would have to pay the penalty unrewarded let him italianize as much as he pleased not many months longer and there would be the bit of an outburst the whiff of scandal perhaps a shot and the rupture of an improvident alliance followed by henrietta's free hand to the moody young earl who would then have possession of the only woman he could ever love and at no cost jealousy of a man like brailstone however infatuated the man was too foolish he must perceive how matters were tending the die away acid eyeballs at the ceiling of a pair of fanatics per la musica might irritate a husband but the lover should read and know giddy as the beautiful creature deprived of her natural aliment seems in her excuseable hunger for it she has learnt her lesson she is not a reeling libertine brailstone peered through his eyelashes at the same shadow of a frown where no frown sat on his friend's brows displeasure was manifest and why fleetwood had given him the dispossessing shrug of the man out of the run and the hint of the tip for winning with the aid of operatic arias and though he was in fleetwood's books ever since the prize fight neither fleetwood nor the husband nor any skittishness of a timorous wife could stop the pursuer bent to capture the fairest and most inflaming woman of her day 'i prefer your stage columelli' fleetwood said 'i come from exile' said henrietta and her plea in excuse of ecstatics wrote her down as confessedly treasonable to the place quitted ambrose mallard entered the box beholding only his goddess livia their eyebrows and inaudible lips conversed eloquently he retired like a trumped card on the appearance of m de st ombre the courtly frenchman won the ladies to join him in whipping the cream of the world for five minutes and passed out before his flavour was exhausted brailstone took his lesson and departed to spy at them from other boxes and heave an inflated shirt front young cressett the bottle of effervescence dashed in and for him livia's face was motherly he rattled a tale of the highway robbery of sir meeson corby on one of his yorkshire moors the picture of the little baronet arose upon the narration and it amused chumley potts came to 'confirm every item' as he said 'plucked corby clean pistol at his head quite old style time ten pm suspects great britain king lords and commons and buttons twenty times tighter brosey mallard down on him for a few fighting men perfect answer to brosey' 'mr mallard did not mention the robbery' henrietta remarked 'feared to shock corby such a favoured swain' potts accounted for the omission 'brosey spilling last night' fleetwood asked 'at the palazzo we were' said potts 'luck pretty fair first off brosey did his trick and away and away and away went he more old brosey wins the wiser he gets i stayed' he swung to gower 'don't drink dry sillery after two am you read me' 'egyptian but decipherable' said gower the rising of the curtain drew his habitual groan from potts and he fled to collogue with the goodly number of honest fellows in the house of music who detested 'squallery' most of these afflicted pilgrims to the london conservatory were engaged upon the business of the goddess richly inspiring the heliconian choir but rendering the fountain waters heady here they had to be if they would enjoy the spectacle of london's biggest and choicest bouquet and in them too there was an unattached air during potts' cooling discourse of turf and tables except when he tossed them a morsel of tragedy or the latest joke not yet past the full gallop on its course their sparkle was transient woman had them fast compelled to think of them as not serious members of our group he assisted at the crush room exit and the happy riddance of the beautiful cousins dedicated to the merry london midnights' further pastures fleetwood's word was extracted that he would visit the 'palazzo' within a couple of hours potts exclaimed 'good you promise hang me if i don't think it 's the only certain thing a man can depend upon in this world' he left the earl and gower woodseer to their lunatic talk he still had his ideas about the association of the pair 'hard headed player of his own game that woodseer spite of his mumbo jumbo oracle kind of talk' mallard's turn of luck downward to the deadly drop had come under potts' first inspection of the table admiring his friend's audacity deploring his rashness reproving his persistency potts allowed his verdict to go by results for it was clear that mallard and fortune were in opposition something like real awe of the tremendous encounter kept him from a plunge or a bet mallard had got the vertigo he reported the gambler's launch on dementedness to the earl gower's less experienced optics perceived it the plainly doomed duellist with the insensible black goddess offered her all the advantages of the immortals challenged by flesh his effort to smile was a line cut awry in wood his big eyes were those of a cat for sociability he looked cursed and still he wore the smile in this condition the gambler runs to emptiness of everything he has his money his heart his brains like a coal truck on the incline of the rails to a collier mallard applied to the earl for a loan of fifty guineas he had them and lost them and he came not begging blustering for a second supply quite in the wrong tone potts knew fleetwood said 'back it with pistols brosey' and as potts related subsequently 'old brosey had the look of a staked horse' fortune and he having now closed the struggle perforce of his total disarmament he regained the wits we forfeit when we engage her he said to his friend chummy 'abrane tomorrow ah yes punts a thames waterman start of how many yards sunbury walton good reach course of two miles braney in good training straight business i mayn't be there but you chummy you mind old chums all cases of the kind safest back the professional unless you understand' fleetwood could not persuade gower to join the party the philosopher's pretext of much occupation masked a bashfully sentimental dislike of the flooding of quiet country places by the city's hordes 'you're right right' said fleetwood in sympathy resigned to the prospect of despising his associates without a handy helper he named esslemont once shot up a look at the sky and glanced it eastward three coaches were bound for sunbury from a common starting point at nine of the morning lord fleetwood lord brailstone and lord simon pitscrew were the whips two hours in advance of them the earl's famous purveyors of picnic feasts bowled along to pitch the riverside tent and spread the tables our upper and lower london world reported the earl as out on another of his expeditions and say what we will we must think kindly of a wealthy nobleman ever to the front to enliven the town's dusty eyes and increase old england's reputation for pre eminence in the sports he is the husband of the whitechapel countess got himself into that mess but whatever he does he puts the stamp of style on it he and the thing he sets his hand to they're neat they're finished they're fitted to trot together and they've a shining polish natural like a lily of the fields or say nature and art like the coat of a thoroughbred led into the paddock by his groom if you're of that mind present at the start in piccadilly gower took note of lord fleetwood's military promptitude to do the work he had no taste for and envied the self compression which could assume so pleasant an air he heard here and there crisp comments on his lordship's coach and horses and personal smartness the word 'style' which reflects handsomely on the connoisseur conferring it and the question whether one of the ladies up there was the countess his task of unearthing and disentangling the monetary affairs of 'one of the ladies' compelled the wish to belong to the party soon to be towering out of the grasp of bricks and delightfully gay spirited quick for fun a fellow he thought may brood upon nature but the real children of nature or she loves them best are those who have the careless chatter the ready laugh bright welcome for a holiday in catching the hour we are surely the bloom of the hour why yes and no need to lose the rosy wisdom of the children when we wrap ourselves in the patched old cloak of the man's on he went to his conclusions but the dame will have none of them though here was a creature bent on masonry work in his act of thinking to build a traveller's rest for thinkers behind him while the volatile were simply breaking their bubbles he was discontented all day both with himself and the sentences he coined a small street boy at his run along the pavement nowhither distanced him altogether in the race for the great secret precipitating the thought that the conscious are too heavily handicapped the unburdened unconscious win the goal ay but they leave no legacy so we must fret and stew and look into ourselves and seize the brute and scourge him just to make one serviceable step forward that is utter a single sentence worth the pondering for guidance gower imagined the fun upon middle thames the vulcan face of captain abrane the cries of his backers the smiles of the ladies lord fleetwood's happy style in the teeth of tattlean aurora's chariot for overriding it one might hope might almost see that he was coming to his better senses on a certain subject as for style overriding the worst of indignities has not scotia given her poet to the slack dependant of the gallows tree who so rantingly played his jig and wheeled it round in the shadow of that institution style was his he hit on the right style to top the situation and perpetually will he slip his head out of the noose to dance the poet's verse in fact style is the mantle of greatness and say that the greatness is beyond our reach we may at least pray to have the mantle strangest of fancies most unphilosophically gower conceived a woman's love as that which would bestow the gift upon a man so bare of it as he where was the woman he embraced the idea of the sex and found it resolving to a form of one he stood humbly before the one and she waned into swarms of her sisters so did she charge him with the loving of her sex not her and could it be denied if he wanted a woman's love just to give him a style no not that but to make him feel proud of himself that was the heart's way of telling him a secret in owning to a weakness within it the one he had thought of forthwith obtained her lodgement he discovered this truth in this roundabout way and knew it a truth by the warm fireside glow the contemplation of her cast over him dining alone as he usually had to do he was astonished to see the earl enter his room 'ah you always make the right choice' fleetwood said and requested him to come to the library when he had done eating gower imagined an accident a metallic ring was in the earl's voice one further mouthful finished dinner for gower was anxious concerning the ladies he joined the earl and asked 'safe oh yes we managed to keep it from them' said fleetwood 'nothing particular perhaps you'll think poor devil of a fellow father and mother alive too he did it out of hearing that 'a one merit mallard ambrose mallard he has blown his brains out' seated plunged in the armchair with stretched legs and eyes at the black fire grate fleetwood told of the gathering under the tent and mallard seen seen drinking champagne mallard no longer seen not missed 'he killed himself three fields off he must have been careful to deaden the sound small pocket pistol hardly big enough to but anything serves couple of brats came running up to chummy potts gentleman's body bloody in a ditch chummy came to me and we went clean dead in the mouth pointed up hole through the top of the skull we're crockery crockery i had to keep chummy standing i couldn't bring him back to our party we got help at a farm the body lies there and that's not the worst we found a letter to me in his pocket pencilled his last five minutes i don't see what he could have done except to go i can't tell you more i had to keep my face rowing and driving back but where is mr potts where can mr mallard be queer sensation to hear the ladies ask give me your hand' the earl squeezed gower's hand an instant and it was an act unknown for him to touch or bear a touch it said a great deal late at night he mounted to gower's room the funeral of the day's impressions had not been skaken off he kicked at it and sunk under it as his talk rambled 'add five thousand' he commented on the spread of livia's papers over the table 'i've been having an hour with her two thousand more she says better multiply by two and a half for a woman's confession we have to trust to her for some of the debts of honour see her in the morning no one masters her but you mind the first to be clear of must be st ombre i like the fellow but these frenchmen they don't spare women ambrose' the earl's eyelids quivered 'jealousy fired that shot quite groundless she 's cool as a marble venus as you said go straight from her house to esslemont i don't plead a case make the best account you can of it say you may say my eyes are opened i respect her if you think that says little say more it can't mean more whatever the countess of fleetwood may think due to her let her name it say my view of life way of life everything in me has changed i shall follow you i don't expect to march over the ground she has a heap to forgive her father owns or boasts in that book of his rose mackrell lent me he never forgave an injury' gower helped the quotation rubbing his hands over it for cover of his glee at the words he had been hearing 'never forgave an injury without a return blow for it the blow forgives good for the enemy to get it he called his hearty old pagan custom an action of the lungs with him and it's not in nature for injuries to digest in us they poison the blood if we try but then there's a manner of hitting back it is not to go an inch beyond the exact measure captain kirby warns us' fleetwood sighed down to a low groan 'lord feltre would have an answer for you she's a wife and a wife hitting back is not a pleasant well petticoats make the difference if she's for amends she shall exact them and she may be hard to satisfy she shall have her full revenge call it by any other term you like i did her a wrong i don't defend myself it 's not yet in the law courts i beg to wipe it out rectify it choose your phrase to the very fullest i look for the alliance with her to ' he sprang up and traversed the room 'we're all guilty of mistakes at starting i speak of men women are protected and if they're not there's the convent for them feltre says but a man has to live it on before the world and this life with these flies of fellows i fell into it in some way absolutely like the first bird i shot as a youngster and stood over the battered head and bloody feathers wondering there was ambrose mallard the same splintered bones blood come to his end and for a woman that woman the lady bearing the title of half mother to me god help me what are my sins she feels nothing or about as much as the mortuary paragraph of the newspapers for the dead man and i have ambrose mallard's look at her and st ombre talking together before he left the tent to cross the fields borrow beg or steal for money to play for her and not a glimpse of the winning post st ombre 's a cool player that 's at the bottom of the story he's cool because play doesn't bite him as it did ambrose i should say the other passion has never bitten him and he's alive and presentable ambrose under a sheet with chummy potts to watch chummy cried like a brat in the street for his lost mammy i left him crying and sobbing they have their feelings these children of vapour as you call them but how did i fall into the line with a set i despised she had my opinion of her gamblers and retorted that young cressett's turn for the fling is my doing i can't swear it's not there's one of my sins what's to wipe them out she has a tender feeling for the boy confessed she wanted governing why she's young in a way she has that particular vice of play she might be managed here's a lesson for her don't you think she might the right man the man she can respect fancy incorruptible he must let her see he has an eye for tricks she's not responsible for his mad passion was the cause cause of everything he did the kind of woman to send the shaft you called her diana seated you said she doesn't hunt she sits and lets fly her arrow well she showed feeling for young cressett and her hit at me was an answer it struck me on the mouth but she's an eternal anxiety a man she respects a man to govern her' fleetwood hurried his paces 'i couldn't have allowed poor ambrose besides he had not a chance never had in anything it wants a head wants the man who can say no to her the reveller's aurora you called her she has her beauty yes she respects you i should be relieved a load off me tell her all debts paid fifty thousand invested in her name and her husband's tell her speak it there's my consent if only the man to govern her she has it from me but repeat it as from me that sum and her portion would make a fair income for the two relieved by heaven what a relief go early coach to esslemont at eleven do my work there i haven't to repeat my directions i shall present myself two days after i wish lady fleetwood to do the part of hostess at calesford tell her i depute you to kiss my son for me now i leave you good night i shan't sleep i remember your saying bad visions come under the eyelids i shall keep mine open and read read her father's book of the maxims i generally find two or three at a dip to stimulate no wonder she venerates him that sort of progenitor is your permanent aristocracy hard enemy she must have some of her mother in her too abuse me to her admit the justice of reproaches but say reason good feeling i needn't grind at it say i respect her advise her to swallow the injury not intended for insult i don't believe anything higher than respect can be offered to a woman no defence of me to her but i'll tell you that when i undertook to keep my word with her i plainly said never mind good night if we meet in the morning let this business rest until it 's done i must drive to help poor chums and see about the inquest' fleetwood nodded from the doorway gower was left with humming ears chapter xl record of minor incidents they went to their beds doomed to lie and roam as the solitaries of a sleepless night they met next day like a couple emerging from sirocco deserts indisposed for conversation or even short companionship much of the night's dry turmoil in their heads each would have preferred the sight of an enemy and it was hardly concealed by them for they inclined to regard one another as the author of their infernal passage through the drear night's wilderness fleetwood was the civiller his immediate prospective duties being clear however abhorrent but he had inflicted a monstrous disturbance on the man he meant in his rash decisive way to elevate if not benefit gower's imagination foreign to his desires and his projects was playing juggler's tricks with him dramatizing upon hypotheses which mounted in stages and could pretend to be soberly conceivable assuming that the earl's wild hints overnight were a credible basis he transported himself to his first view of the countess livia the fountain of similes born of his prostrate adoration close upon the invasion and capture of him by the combined liqueurs in the giddy batlen lights and joining the arabian magic in his breast at the time with the more magical reality now proposed as a sequel to it he entered the land where dreams confess they are outstripped by revelations yet it startled him to hear the earl say 'you'll get audience at ten i've arranged make the most of the situation to her i refuse to help i foresee it 's the only way of solving this precious puzzle you do me and every one of us a service past paying not a man of her set worth she but you'll stop it no one else can of course you've had your breakfast off and walk yourself into a talkative mood as you tell me you do' 'one of the things i do when i've nobody to hear' said gower speculating whether the black sprite in this young nobleman was for sending him as a rod to scourge the lady an ingenious device that smelt of mediaeval courts and tickled his humour 'will she listen' he said gravely 'she will listen she has not to learn you admire you admit she has helped to trim and polish and the rest she declares you're incorruptible there's the ground open i fling no single sovereign more into that quicksand and i want not one word further on the subject i follow you to esslemont pray go' fleetwood pushed into the hall a footman was ordered to pack and deposit mr woodseer's portmanteau at the coach office 'the principal point is to make sure we have all the obligations' gower said 'you know the principal point' said the earl 'relieve me' he faced to the opening street door lord feltre stood in the framing of it a welcome sight the 'monastic man of fashion' of gower's phrase for him entered crooning condolences with a stretched waxen hand for his friend a partial nod for nature's worshipper inefficient at any serious issue of our human affairs as the earl would now discover gower left the two young noblemen to their greetings happily for him philosophy in the present instance after a round of profundities turned her lantern upon the comic aspect of his errand considering the countess livia and himself and the tyrant who benevolently and providentially or sardonically hurled them to their interview the situation was comic certainly in the sense of its being an illumination of this life's odd developments for thus had things come about that if it were possible even to think of the lady's condescending he thanks to the fair one he would see before evening was armed and proof against his old infatuation or any renewal of it and he had been taught to read through the beautiful twilighted woman as if she were burnt paper held at the fire consuming her his hopes hung elsewhere nevertheless an intellectual demon imp very lively in his head urged him to speculate on such a contest between them and weigh the engaging forces difficulties were perceived the scornful laughter on her side was plainly heard but his feeling of savage mastery far from beaten down swelled so as to become irritable for the trial and when he was near her house he held a review of every personal disadvantage he could summon incited by an array of limping deficiencies that flattered their arrogant leader with ideas of the power he had in spite of them in fact his emancipation from sentiment inspired the genial mood to tease women having to encounter a male adept at the weapon for the purpose must be either voluble or supportingly proud to keep the skin from shrinking which is a commencement of the retrogression and that has frequently been the beginning of a rout now the countess livia was a lady of queenly pose and the servitorial conventional speech likely at a push to prove beggarly when once on a common platform with a man of agile tongue instigated by his intellectual demon to pursue inquiries into her moral resources after a ruthless exposure of the wrecked material she would have to be after the various fashions defiant if she was to hold her own against pressure and seeing as she must the road of prudence point to conciliation it was calculable that she would take it hence a string of possible events astounding to mankind but equally calculable should one care to give imagination headway gower looked signally captain abrane's 'fiddler' while he waited at livia's house door a studious intimacy with such a lady was rather like the exposure of the silver moon to the astronomer's telescope the dame will have nought of an interview and colloquy not found mentioned in her collection of ballads concerning a person quite secondary in dr glossop's voluminous papers she as vehemently prohibits a narration of gower woodseer's proposal some hours later for the hand of the countess of fleetwood's transfixed maid madge because of the insignificance of the couple and though it was a quaint idyll of an affection slowly formed rationally based while seeming preposterous tending to bluntly funny utterances on both sides the girl was a creature of the enthusiasms and had lifted that passion of her constitution into higher than the worship of sheer physical bravery she had pitied mr gower woodseer for his apparently extreme albeit reverential devotion to her mistress the plainly worded terms of his asking a young woman of her position and her reputation to marry him came on her like an intrusion of dazzling day upon the closed eyelids of the night requiring time and her mistress's consent and his father's expressed approval before she could yield him an answer that might appear a forgetfulness of her station her ignorance her damaged character gower protested himself with truth a spotted pard an ignoramus and an outcast of all established classes as the worshipper of nature cannot well avoid being 'but what is it you like me for mr gower' madge longed to know that she might see a way in the strange land where he had planted her after a whirl and he replied 'i 've thought of you till i can say i love you because you have naturally everything i shoot at' the vastness of the compliment drove her to think herself empty of anything he named courage and its offspring honesty and devotedness constancy her bosom rose at the word 'yes constancy' he repeated and 'growing girls have to turn corners as you told me once' 'i did' said she reddening under a memory and abashed by his recollection of a moment she knew to have been weak with her or noisy of herself madge went straightway to her mistress and related her great event in the tone of a confession of crime her mistress's approbation was timidly suggested rather than besought it came on a flood carinthia's eyes filled she exclaimed 'oh that good man he chooses my madge for wife she said it rebecca said it mrs wythan saw and said mr woodseer loved my madge i hear her saying it then yes and yes from me for both your sakes dear girl he will have the faithfullest he will have the kindest oh and i shall know there can be a happy marriage in england' she summoned gower she clasped his hand to thank him for appreciating her servant and sister and for the happiness she had in hearing it and she gazed at him and the laden brows of her madge alternately encouraging him to repeat his recital of his pecuniary means for the poetry of the fact it verified feasting on the sketch of a four roomed cottage and an agricultural labourer's widow for cook and housemaid madge to listen to his compositions of the day in the evening madge to praise him madge to correct his vanity love was out of the count but carinthia's leaping sympathy decorated the baldness of the sketch and spied his features through the daubed mask he chose to wear as a member of the order of husbands without taking it for his fun dry material statements presented the reality she doated to think of moreover the marriage of these two renewed her belief in true marriages and their intention to unite was evidence of love 'my journey to england was worth all troubles for the meeting madge' she said 'i can look with pleasure to that day of my meeting her first the day it was then' she stopped madge felt the quivering upward of a whimper to a sob in her breast she slipped away 'it's a day that has come round to be repaired lady fleetwood' said gower 'if you will will you not he has had a blow the death of a friend violent death it has broken him he wants a month or so in your mountains i have thought him hard to deal with he is humane his enormous wealth has been his tempter madge and i will owe him our means of livelihood enough for cottagers until i carve my way his feelings are much more independent of his rank than those of most noblemen he will repeat your kind words to madge and me i am sure of it he has had heavy burdens he is young hardly formed yet he needs a helper i mean one allied to him you forgive me i left him with a catholic lord for comforter who regards my prescript of the study of nature when we're in grief as about the same as an offer of a dish of cold boiled greens silver and ivory images are more consoling neither he nor i can offer the right thing for lord fleetwood it will be found here and then your mountains more than i nearly as much as you he has a poet's ardour for mountain land he and mr wythan would soon learn to understand one another on that head if not as to management of mines' the pleading was crafty and it was penetrative in the avoidance of stress carinthia shook herself to feel moved the endeavour chilled her to a notion that she was but half alive she let the question approach her whether chillon could pardon lord fleetwood she with no idea of benignness might speak pardon's word to him on a late autumn evening years hence perhaps or to his friends to morrow if he would considerately keep distant she was upheld by the thought of her brother's more honourable likeness to their father in the certainty of his refusal to speak pardon's empty word or touch an offending hand without their father's warrant for the injury wiped out and as she had no wish for that to be done she could anticipate his withholding of the word for her brother at wrestle with his fallen fortunes was now the beating heart of carinthia's mind her husband was a shadow there he did obscure it and he might annoy he was unable to set it in motion he sat there somewhat like youth's apprehension of death the dark spot seen mistily at times through people's tears or visioned as in an ambush beyond the hills occasionally challenged to stimulate recklessness oftener overlooked acknowledged for the undesired remote of life's conditions life's evil fatal ill assorted yoke fellow and if it was in his power to burst out of his corner and be terrible to her she could bring up a force unnamed and unmeasured that being the blood of her father in her veins having done her utmost to guard her babe she said her prayers she stood for peace or the struggle 'does lord fleetwood speak of coming here' she said 'to morrow' 'i go to croridge to morrow' 'your ladyship returns' 'yes i return mr gower you have fifty minutes before you dress for dinner' he thought only of the exceeding charity of the intimation and he may be excused for his not seeing the feminine full answer it was in an implied unmeditated contrast he went gladly to find his new comrade his flower among grass blades the wonderful creature astonishing him and surcharging his world by setting her face at him opening her breast to him breathing a young man's word of words from a woman's mouth his flower among grass blades for a head looking studiously down she was his fountain of wisdom as well in the assurance she gave him of the wisdom of his choice but madge had put up the 'prize fighter's lass' by way of dolly defence to cover her amazed confusion when the proposal of this well liked gentleman to a girl such as she sounded churchy he knocked it over easily it left however a bee at his ear and an itch to transfer the buzzer's attentions and tease his darling for she had betrayed herself as right good game nor is there happier promise of life long domestic enlivenment for a prescient man of letters than he has in the contemplation of a pretty face showing the sensitiveness to the sting which is not allowed to poison her temper and is short of fetching tears the dear innocent girl gave this pleasing promise moreover she could be twisted to laugh at herself just a little now the young woman who can do that has already jumped the hedge into the highroad of philosophy and may become a philosopher's mate in its by ways where the minute discoveries are the notable treasures they had their ramble agreeable to both despite the admonitory dose administered to one of them they might have been espied at a point or two from across the parkpalings their laughter would have caught an outside pedestrian's hearing whatever the case owain wythan riding down off croridge big with news of her brother for the countess dined at her table and walking up the lane to the esslemont arms on a moonless night to mount his horse pitched against an active and as it was deemed by gower's observation of his eyes a scientific fist the design to black them finely was attributable to the dyeing accuracy of the stroke a single blow had done it mr wythan's watch and purse were untouched and a second look at the swollen blind peepers led gower to surmise that they were in the calculation of the striker his own he walked next day to the royal sovereign inn there he came upon the earl driving his phaeton fleetwood jumped down and gower told of the mysterious incident as the chief thing he had to tell not rendering it so mysterious in his narrative style he had the art of indicating darkly 'ines you mean' fleetwood cried and he appeared as nauseated and perplexed as he felt why should ines assault mr wythan it happened that the pugilist's patron had within the last fifteen minutes driven past a certain thirty acre meadow sight of which on his way to carinthia had stirred him he had even then an idea of his old deeds dogging him to bind him every one of them the smallest 'but you've nothing to go by' he said 'why guess at this rascal more than another' gower quoted mrs rundles and the ostler for witnesses to kit's visit yesterday to the royal sovereign though kit shunned the bar of the esslemont arms 'i guess pretty clearly because i suspect he was hanging about and saw me and madge together' 'consolations for failures in town by the way you are complimented and i don't think you deserved it however there was just the chance to stop a run to perdition but madge madge i'd swear to the girl' 'not so hard as i' said gower and spoke of the oath to come between the girl and him fleetwood's dive into the girl's eyes drew her before him he checked a spirt of exclamations 'you fancy the brute had a crack for revenge and mistook his man' 'that's what i want her ladyship to know' said gower 'how could you let her hear of it' 'nothing can be concealed from her' the earl was impressionable to the remark in his disgust at the incident it added a touch of a new kind of power to her image 'she's aware of my coming' 'to day or to morrow' they scaled the phaeton and drove 'you undervalue lord feltre you avoid your adversaries' fleetwood now rebuked his hearer 'it 's an easy way to have the pull of them in your own mind you might learn from him he's willing for controversy nature worship or aboriginal genuflexion he calls it anglicanism methodism he stands to engage them it can't be doubted that in days of trouble he has a faith stout as a rock with an oracle in it as he says and he's right men who go into battle require a rock to back them or a staff to lean on you have your secret you think as far as i can see it's to keep you from going into any form of battle' the new influence at work on the young nobleman was evident if only in the language used gower answered mildly 'that can hardly be said of a man who's going to marry' 'perhaps not lady fleetwood is aware' 'lady fleetwood does me the honour to approve my choice' 'you mean you're dead on to it with this girl' 'for a year or more' 'fond of her' 'all my heart' 'in love' 'yes in love the proof of it is i 've asked her now i can support her as a cottager leaning on the three per cents' 'well it helps you to a human kind of talk it carries out your theories i never disbelieved in your honesty the wisdom's another matter did you ever tell any one that there's not an act of a man's life lies dead behind him but it is blessing or cursing him every step he takes' 'by that' rejoined gower 'i can say lord feltre proves there's wisdom in the truisms of devoutness' he thought the catholic lord had gone a step or two to catch an eel fleetwood was looking on the backward of his days beholding a melancholy sunset with a grimace in it 'lord feltre might show you the leanness of philosophy you would learn from hearing him an old gnawed bone for the dog that chooses to be no better than a dog' 'the vertiginous roast haunch is recommended' gower said 'see a higher than your own head good sir but hang the man he manages to hit on the thing he wants' fleetwood set his face at gower with cutting heartiness 'in love you say and madge and mean it to be the holy business well poor old chummy always gave you credit for knowing how to play your game she has given proof she 's a good girl i don't see why it shouldn't end well that attack on the welshman's the bad lookout explained if you like but women's impressions won't get explained away we must down on our knees or they her ladyship attentive at all to affairs of the house' 'every day with queeney at intervals with leddings' 'excellent you speak like a fellow recording the devout observances of a great dame with her minor and superior ecclesiastical comforters regular at church' 'her ladyship goes' 'a woman without religion gower woodseer is a weed on the water or she's hard as nails we shall see generally madge and the youngster parade the park at this hour i drive round to the stables go in and offer your version of that rascally dog's trick it seems the nearest we can come at he's a sot and drunken dogs 'll do anything i've had him on my hands and i've got the stain of him' they trotted through esslemont park gates 'i've got that place calesford on my hands too' the earl said suddenly moved to a liking for his kentish home he and gower were struck by a common thought of the extraordinary burdens his indulgence in impulses drew upon him present circumstances pictured to gower the opposing weighed and matured good reason for his choosing madge and he complimented himself in his pity for the earl but fleetwood as he reviewed a body of acquaintances perfectly free from the wretched run in harness though they had their fits and their whims was pushed to the conclusion that fatalism marked his particular course through life he could not hint at such an idea to the unsympathetic fellow or rather the burly antagonist to anything of the sort beside him lord feltre would have understood and appreciated it instantly where is aid to be had if we have the fates against us feltre knew the power he said was an example of 'the efficacy of supplications' he had been 'fatally driven to find the power' and had found it on the road to rome of course not a delectable road for an english nobleman except that the noise of another convert in pilgrimage on it would deal our english world a lively smack the very stroke that heavy body wants but the figure of a 'monastic man of fashion' was antipathetic to the earl and he flouted an english protestant mass merely because of his being highly individual and therefore revolutionary for the minority he cast his bitter cud aside 'my man should have arrived lady fleetwood at home' gower spoke of her having gone to croridge in the morning 'has she taken the child' 'she has yes for the air of the heights' 'for greater security lady arpington praises the thoughtful mother i rather expected to see the child' 'they can't be much later' gower supposed 'you don't feel your long separation from the object' letting him have his cushion for pins gower said 'it needs all my philosophy he was pricked and probed for the next five minutes not bad rallying the earl could be smart when he smarted then they descended the terrace to meet lady fleetwood driving her pony trap she gave a brief single nod to the salute of her lord quite in the town lady's manner surprisingly chapter xli in which the fates are seen and a choice of the refuges from them the home of husband and wife was under one roof at last fleetwood went like one deported to his wing of the house physically sensible in the back turned to his wife's along the corridor that our ordinary comparison for the division of a wedded twain is correct she was arctic and antarctic he had to be perforce of the distance she put between them a removal of either of them from life or from 'the act of breathing' as gower woodseer's contempt of the talk about death would call it was an imaginable way of making it a wider division ambrose mallard was far enough from his fatal lady now farther than the poles asunder ambrose if the clergy will allow him has found his peace but the road and the means he chose were a madman's the blotting of our character to close our troubles is the final proof of our being 'sons of vapour' according to gower woodseer's heartless term for poor ambrose and the lot they have their souls and above philosophy 'natural' or unnatural they may find a shelter they can show in their desperation that they are made of blood as philosophers rather fail of doing an insignificant brainless creature like feltre had wits by the aid of his religion to help or be charitable to his fellows particularly the sinners in the crisis of life surpassing any philosopher's information of her ladyship's having inspected the apartments to see to the minutest of his customary luxuries cut at him all round his valet had it from the footmen and maids and their speaking of it meant a liking for their mistress and that liking added to her official solicitude on his behalf touched a soft place in him and blew an icy wind he was frozen where he was warmed here was evidence of her intending the division to be a fixed gap she had entered this room and looked about her he was here to feel her presence in her absence some one or something had schooled her too her large eyed directness of gaze was the same as at that inn and in wales but her easy sedateness was novel her english almost the tone of the english world he gathered it at least from the few remarks below stairs his desire to be with her was the desire to escape the phantasm of the woman haunting to subjugate him when they were separate he could kill illusion by magnifying and clawing at her visible angles and audible false notes and he did it until his recollections joined to the sight of her when a clash of the thought of what she had been and the thought of what she was had the effect of conjuring a bitter sweet image that was a more seductive illusion strange to think this woman once loved the man who was not half the value of the man she no longer loved he took a shot at cynicism but hit no mark this woman protected her whole sex they sat at the dinner table alone thanks to a handsome wench's attractions for a philosopher married and parents of a lusty son this was their first sitting at table together the mouth that said 'i guard my rooms' was not obtruded she talked passingly of her brother much of lady arpington and of old mr woodseer and though she reserved a smile there was no look of a lock on her face she seemed pleased to be treated very courteously she returned the stately politeness in exactest measure very simply as well her face had now an air of homeliness well suited to an english household interior she could chat any pauses occurring he was the one guilty of them she did not allow them to be barrier chasms or 'strids' for the leap with effort she crossed them like the mountain maid over a gorge's plank kept her tones perfectly her madge and mr gower woodseer made a conversible topic she was inquisitive for accounts of spanish history and the land of spain they passed into the drawing room she had heard of the fate of the poor child in wales she said without a comment 'i see now i ought to have backed your proposal' he confessed and was near on shivering she kept silent proudly or regretfully open on her workbasket was a spanish guide book and a map attached to it she listened to descriptions of cadiz malaga seville granada her curiosity was chiefly for detailed accounts of catalonia and the pyrenees 'hardly the place for you there's a perpetual heaving of carlism in those mountains your own are quieter for travellers' he remarked and for a moment her lips moved to some likeness of a smile a dimple in a flowing thought he remarked the come and go of it he regretted his inability to add to her knowledge of the spanish pyrenees books helped her at present she said feeling acutely that hostility would have brought them closer than her uninviting civility he spoke of the assault on mr wythan and gower woodseer's conjecture and of his having long since discharged the rascal ines to which her unreproachful answer 'you made use of those men my lord' sent a cry ringing through him recalling feltre's words as to the grip men progressively are held in by their deeds done 'oh quite true we change our views and ways of life' he said thinking she might set her considerations on other points of his character but this reflection was a piece of humility not yet in his particular estimate of his character and he spurned it an act of pride that drove his mind for occupation to contemplate hers which speedily became an embrace of her character until he was asking whether the woman he called wife and dared not clasp was one of those rarest who can be idealized by virtue of their being known for the young man embracing a character loses grasp of his own is plucked out of himself and passes into it to see the creature he is with the other's eyes and feel for the other as a very self such is the privilege and the chastisement of the young gower woodseer's engagement with the girl madge was a happier subject for expatiation and agreement her deeper tones threw a light on gower and where she saw goodness he could at least behold the natural philosopher practically philosophizing 'the girl shall have a dowry from me' he said and the sum named was large her head bent acknowledgingly money had small weight with her now his perception of it stripped him and lamed him he wished her ladyship good night she stood up and performed a semi ceremonious obeisance neatly adapted to their mutual position she had a well bred mother probably she would sleep no such expectation could soothe the friend and some might be thinking misleader of ambrose mallard before he had ocular proof that the body lay underground his promise was given to follow it to the grave a grave in consecrated earth ambrose died of the accidental shot of a pocket pistol he customarily carried loaded two intimate associates of the dead man swore to that habit of his they lied to get him undisputed christian burial aha the earl laughed outright at chummy potts's nursery qualms the old fellow had to do it and he lied like a man for the sake of ambrose mallard's family so much is owing to our friend can ecclesiastical casuists decide upon cases of conscience affecting men of the world a council sat upon the case the whole night long a committee of the worldly held argumentation in a lower chamber these are nights that weaken us to below the level of women a shuttle worked in fleetwood's head he defended the men of the world lord feltre oiled them damned them kindled them to a terrific expiatory blaze and extinguishingly salved and wafted aloft the released essence of them maniacal for argument fleetwood rejected the forgiveness of sins if sins they be prove them sins and the suffering is of necessity everlasting his insomnia logic insisted whichever side he took his wife was against him not in speech but in her look she was a dumb figure among the wranglers clouded up to the neck her look said she knew more of him than they knew he departed next day for london after kissing his child and he would have done wisely to abstain from his exhibition of the paternal knowing it a step to conciliation he checked his impulsive warmth under the apprehension that the mother would take it for a piece of acting to propitiate and his lips pecked the baby's cheek its mother held arms for it immediately not without reason did his heart denounce her as a mere mother with little of a mind to see the recent series of feverishly sleepless nights disposed him to snappish irritability or the thirst for tenderness gower had singular experiences of him on the drive north westward he scarcely spoke he said once 'if you mean to marry you'll be wanting to marry soon of course' and his curt nod before the reply was formulated appeared to signify the sooner the better and deliverance for both of us honest though he might be sometimes deep and sometimes picturesque the philosopher's day had come to an end how can philosophy minister to raw wounds when we are in a rageing gale of the vexations battered to right and left religion has a nourishing breast philosophy is breastless religion condones offences philosophy has no forgiveness is an untenanted confessional 'wide air to a cry in anguish' feltre says all the way to london fleetwood endured his companion letting him talk when he would he spent the greater part of the night discussing human affairs and spiritual with lord feltre whose dialectical exhortations and insinuations were of the feeblest but to an isolated young man yearning for the tenderness of a woman thinking but of her grievances the ointment brought comfort it soothed him during his march to and away from ambrose mallard's grave where it seemed to him curious and even pitiable that chumley potts should be so inconsolably shaken well and if the priests have the secret of strengthening the backbone for a bend of the knee in calamity why not go to the priests chummy potts's hearing was not addressed nor was the chief person in the meditation affected by a question that merely jumped out of his perturbed interior business at calesford kept fleetwood hanging about london several days further and his hatred of a place he wasted time and money to decorate grew immeasurable it distorted the features of the beautiful woman for whose pleasure the grand entertainments to be held there had somewhere or other when felon spectres were abroad over earth been conceived he could then return to esslemont gower was told kindly with intentional coldness that he could take a seat in the phaeton if he liked and he liked and took it anything to get to that girl of his whatever the earl's inferiors did their inferior station was not suffered to discolour it for his judgement but an increasing antagonism to woodseer's philosophy which the fellow carried through with perpetual scorings of satisfaction caused him to set a hard eye on the damsel under the grisly spotting shadow of the sottish bruiser of whom after once touching the beast he could not rub his hands clean and he chose to consider the winning of the prize fighter's lass the final triumph or flag on the apex of the now despised philosophy vain to ask how he had come to be mixed up with the lot or why the stolidly conceited pretentious fellow had seat here as by right beside him we sow and we reap 'plant for sugar and taste the cane' some one says this woodseer probably he can when it suits him tickle the ears of the worldlings and there is worthier stuff to remember stuff to nourish feltre's 'wisdom of our fathers' rightly named religion more in the country when he traversed sweep and rise of open land carinthia's image began to shine and she threw some of her light on madge who made woodseer appear tolerable sagacious absurdly enviable as when we have the fit to wish we were some four foot the fellow's philosophy wore a look of practical craft he was going to the girl he liked and she was one could swear an honest girl and she was a comely girl a girl to stick to a man her throwing over a sot was creditable her mistress loved her that said much for any mortal creature man or woman loved by carinthia could not be cowardly could not be vile must have high qualities next to religion she stood for a test of us had she any strong sense of religion in addition to the formal trooping to one of their pallid protestant churches lord feltre might prove useful to her for merely the comprehension of the signification of religion steadies us it had done that for him the earl owned he broke a prolonged silence by remarking to gower 'you haven't much to say to day' and the answer was 'very little when i'm walking i'm picking up and when i'm driving i'm putting together' gower was rallied on the pursuit of the personal object in both cases he pointed at sheep shepherd farmer over the hedge all similarly occupied and admitted shamelessly that he had not a thought for company scarce a word to fling 'ideas in gestation are the dullest matter you can have' 'there i quite agree with you' said fleetwood abrane chummy potts brailstone little corby were brighter comrades and these were his ixionides hitherto his carving of a way in the world had been sufficiently ill considered was it preferable to be a loutish philosopher since the death of ambrose mallard he felt woodseer's title for that crew grind harshly and he tried to provoke a repetition of it that he might burst out in wrathful defence of his friends to be named friends when they were vilified defence of poor ambrose at least the sinner who or one as bad might have reached to pardon through the priesthood gower offered him no chance entering esslemont air fleetwood tossed his black mood to the winds she breathed it she was a mountain girl and found it hard to forgive our lowlands she would learn tolerance taking her flights at seasons the yacht if she is anything of a sailor may give her a taste of england's pleasures she will have a special allowance for distribution among old mr woodseer's people as to the rest of the countess of fleetwood's wishes her family ranks with her husband's in claims of any kind on him there would be she would require and had a right to demand say a warm half hour of explanations he knew the tone for them and so little did he revolve it apprehensively that his mind sprang beyond to the hearing from her mouth of her not intending further to 'guard her rooms' how quietly the words were spoken there was a charm in the retrospect of her mouth and manner one of the rare women who never pout or attitudinize she could fling her glove gracefully one might add capturingly under every aspect she was a handsome belligerent the words he had to combat pleased his memory some good friend lady arpington probably had instructed her in the art of dressing to match her colour concerning himself he made no stipulation but he reflected on lord feltre's likely estimate of her as a bit of a heathen and it might be to her advantage were she and feltre to have some conversations whatever the faith a faith should exist for without the sentiment of religion a woman he says is where she was when she left the gates of eden a man is not much farther feltre might have saved ambrose mallard he is however right in saying that the woman with the sentiment of religion in her bosom is a box of holy incense distinguishing her from all other women empty of it she is devil's bait at best she is a creature who cannot overlook an injury or must be exacting god knows what humiliations before she signs the treaty informed at the house that her ladyship had been staying up on croridge for the last two days fleetwood sent his hardest shot of the eyes at gower let her be absent it was equal to the first move of war and absolved him from contemplated proposals to make amends but the enforced solitary companionship with this ruminator of a fellow set him asking whether the godless dog he had picked up by the wayside was not incarnate another of the sins he had to expiate day after day almost hourly some new stroke fell on him why was he selected for persecution because he was wealthy the fates were driving him in one direction no doubt of that this further black mood evaporated and like a cessation of english storm weather bequeathed him gloom ashamed of the mood he was nevertheless directed by its final shadows to see the ruminating tramp in gower and in madge the prize fighter's jilt and round about esslemont a world eyeing an earl of fleetwood who painted himself the man he was or was held to be by getting together such a collection from the daughter of the old buccaneer to the ghastly corpse of ambrose mallard why clearly wealth was the sole origin and agent of the mischief with somewhat less of it he might have walked in his place among the nation's elect the 'herd of the gilt horns' untroubled by ambitions and ideas arriving thus far he chanced to behold gower and madge walking over the grounds near the western plantation and he regretted the disappearance of them with the fellow talking hard into the girl's ear those two could think he had been of some use the man pretending to philosophical depth was at any rate honest one could swear to the honesty of the girl though she had been a reckless hussy their humble little hopes and means to come to union approached after a fashion hymning at his ears those two were pleasanter to look on than amorous lords and great ladies who are interesting only when they are wicked four days of desolate wanderings over the estate were occupied chiefly in his decreeing the fall of timber that obstructed views and was the more imperatively doomed for his bailiff's intercession 'sound wood' the trees might be they had to assist in defraying the expense of separate establishments a messenger to queeney from croridge then announced the countess's return 'for a couple of hours' queeney said it was the day when her ladyship examined the weekly bills of the household that was in the early morning the post brought my lord a letter from countess livia a most infrequent writer she had his word to pay her debts what next was she for asking he shrugged opened the letter and stared at the half dozen lines the signification of them rapped on his consciousness of another heavy blow before he was perfectly intelligent all possible anticipation seemed here outdone insomuch that he held palpable evidence of the fates at work to harass and drive him she was married to the young earl of cressett' fleetwood printed the lines on his eyeballs they were the politely flowing feminine of a statement of the fact which might have been in one line they flourished wantonly they were deadly blunt and of all men this youngster who struck at him through her lips with the reproach that he had sped the good looking little beast upon his road to ruin perhaps to ambrose mallard's end chapter xlii the retarded courtship carinthia reached esslemont near noon she came on foot and had come unaccompanied stick in hand her dress looped for the roads madge bustled her shorter steps up the park beside her fleetwood met her on the terrace 'no one can be spared at croridge' she said 'i go back before dark' apology was not thought of she seemed wound to the pitch he bowed he led into the morning room 'the boy is at croridge' 'with me he has his nurse madge was at home here more than there' 'why do you go back' 'i am of use to my brother' 'forgive me in what way' 'he has enemies about him they are the workmen of lord levellier they attacked lekkatts the other night and my uncle fired at them out of a window and wounded a man they have sworn they will be revenged mr wythan is with my brother to protect him' 'two men very well they don't want if there's danger a woman's aid in protecting him' she smiled and her smile was like the hint of the steel blade an inch out of sheath 'my brother does not count me a weak woman' 'oh no no one would think that' fleetwood said hurriedly and heartily 'least of all men i carinthia but you might be rash' 'my brother knows me cautious' 'chillon' 'it is my brother's name' 'you used to call him by his name 'i love his name' 'ah well i may be pardoned for wishing to hear what part you play there' 'i go the rounds with my brother' 'armed' 'we carry arms' 'queer sight to see in england but there are rascals in this country too' she was guilty of saying though not pointedly 'we do not hire defenders' 'in civilized lands ' he began and stopped 'you have mr wythan' 'yes we are three' 'you call him i think owain' 'i do' 'in your brother's hearing' 'yes my lord it would be in your hearing if you were near' 'no harm no doubt' 'there is none' 'but you will not call your brother chillon to me' 'you dislike the name' 'i learn to like everything you do and say and every person you like' 'it is by mr wythan's dead wife's request that i call him by his name he is our friend he is a man to trust' 'the situation ' fleetwood hung swaying between the worldly view of it and the white light of this woman's nature flashed on his emotion into his mind 'you shall be trusted for judging if he is your friend he is my friend i have missed the sight of our boy you heard i was at esslemont' 'i heard from madge' 'it is positive you must return to croridge' 'i must be with my brother yes' 'your ladyship will permit me to conduct you' her head assented there was nothing to complain of but he had not gained a step the rule is that when we have yielded initiative to a woman we are unable to recover it without uncivil bluster so therefore women dealing with gentlemen are allowed unreasonable advantages he had never granted it in colloquy or act to any woman but this one consequently he was to see that if the gentleman in him was not put aside the lady would continue moving on lines of the independence he had likewise yielded or rather flung to her unless as a result he besieged and wooed his wife his wife would hold on a course inclining constantly farther from the union he desired yet how could he begin to woo her if he saw no spark of womanly tenderness he asked himself because the beginning of the wooing might be checked by the call on him for words of repentance only just possible to conceive imagine them uttered and she has the initiative for life she would not have it certainly with a downright brute but he was not that in an extremity of bitterness he fished up a drowned old thought of all his torments being due to the impulsive half brute he was and between the good and the bad in him the sole point of strength was a pride likely as the smooth simplicity of her indifference showed him soon to be going down prostrate beneath her feet wholly a brute well he had to say that playing the perfect brute with any other woman he would have his mastery the summoning of an idea of personal power to match this woman in a contest was an effort exhausting the idea they passed out of esslemont gates together at that hour of the late afternoon when south westerly breezes after a summer gale drive their huge white flocks over blue fields fresh as morning on the march to pile the crown of the sphere and end a troubled day with grandeur up the lane by the park they had open land to the heights of croridge 'splendid clouds' fleetwood remarked she looked up thinking of the happy long day's walk with her brother to the styrian baths pleasure in the sight made her face shine superbly 'a flying switzerland mr woodseer says' she replied 'england is beautiful on days like these for walking i think the english climate very good' he dropped a murmur 'it should suit so good a walker' and burned to compliment her spirited easy stepping and scorned himself for the sycophancy it would be before they were on the common ground of a restored understanding but an approval of any of her acts threatened him with enthusiasm for the whole of them her person included and a dam in his breast had to keep back the flood 'you quote woodseer to me carinthia i wish you knew lord feltre he can tell you of every cathedral convent and monastery in europe and syria nature is well enough she is as he says a savage men's works acting under divine direction to escape from that tangle are better worthy of study perhaps if one has done wrong for example' 'i could listen to him' she said 'you would not need except yes one thing your father's book speaks of not forgiving an injury' 'my father does he thinks it weakness to forgive an injury women do and are disgraced they are thought slavish my brother is much stronger than i am he is my father alive in that' 'it is anti christian some would think' 'let offending people go he would not punish them they may go where they will be forgiven for them our religion is a happy retreat we are glad they have it my father and my brother say that injury forbids us to be friends again my father was injured by the english admiralty he never forgave it but he would have fought one of their ships and offered his blood any day if his country called to battle' 'you have the same feeling you mean' 'i am a woman i follow my brother whatever he decides it is not to say he is the enemy of persons offending him only that they have put the division' 'they repent' 'if they do they do well for themselves' 'you would see them in sackcloth and ashes' 'i would pray to be spared seeing them' 'you can entirely forget well other moments other feelings' 'they may heighten the injury' 'carinthia i should wish to speak plainly if i could and tell you' 'you speak quite plainly my lord' 'you and i cannot be strangers or enemies' 'we cannot be i would not be to be friends we should be separate' 'you say you are a woman you have a heart then' for if not what have you was added in the tone 'my heart is my brother's' she said 'all your heart' 'my heart is my brother's until one of us drops' 'there is not another on earth beside your brother chillon' 'there is my child' the dwarf square tower of croridge village church fronted them against the sky seen of both 'you remember it' he said and she answered 'i was married there' 'you have not forgotten that injury carinthia' 'i am a mother' 'by all the saints you hit hard justly not you our deeds are the hard hitters we learn when they begin to flagellate stroke upon stroke suppose we hold a costly thing in the hand and dash it to the ground no recovery of it none that must be what your father meant i can't regret you are a mother we have a son a bond how can i describe the man i was' he muttered 'possessed sort of werewolf you are my wife' 'i was married to you my lord' 'it's a tie of a kind' 'it binds me' 'obey you said' 'obey it i do' 'you consider it holy' 'my father and my mother spoke to me of the marriage tie i read the service before i stood at the altar it is holy it is dreadful i will be true to it' 'to your husband' 'to his name to his honour' 'to the vow to live with him' 'my husband broke that for me' 'carinthia if he bids you begs you to renew it god knows what you may save me from' 'pray to god do not beg of me my lord i have my brother and my little son no more of husband for me god has given me a friend too a man of humble heart my brother's friend my dear rebecca's husband he can take them from me no one but god see the splendid sky we have' with those words she barred the gates on him at the same time she bestowed the frank look of an amiable face brilliant in the lively red of her exercise in its bent bow curve along the forehead out of the line of beauty touching as her voice was to make an undertone of anguish swell an ecstasy so he felt it for his mood was now the lover's a torture smote him to find himself transported by that voice at his ear to the scene of the young bride in thirty acre meadow 'i propose to call on captain kirby levellier tomorrow carinthia' he said 'the name of his house' 'my brother is not now any more in the english army' she replied 'he has hired a furnished house named stoneridge' 'he will receive me i presume' 'my brother is a courteous gentleman my lord' 'here is the church and here we have to part for today do we' 'good bye to you my lord' she said he took her hand and dropped the dead thing 'your idea is to return to esslemont some day or other' 'for the present' was her strange answer she bowed she stepped on on she sped leaving him at the stammered beginning of his appeal to her their parting by the graveyard of the church that had united them was what the world would class as curious to him it was a further and a well marked stroke of the fatality pursuing him he sauntered by the graveyard wall until her figure slipped out of sight it went like a puffed candle and still it haunted the corner where last seen her vanishing seemed to say that less of her belonged to him than the phantom his eyes retained behind them somewhere there was in his pocket a memento of ambrose mallard that the family had given him at his request he felt the lump it had an answer for all perplexities it had been charged and emptied since it was in his possession and it could be charged again the thing was a volume as big as the world to study for the touch of a finger one could have its entirely satisfying contents and fly and be a raven of that night wherein poor ambrose wanders lost but cured of human wounds he leaned on the churchyard wall having the graves to the front of eyes bent inward they were protestant graves not so impressive to him as the wreathed and gilt of those under dedication to feltre's madonna but whatever they were they had ceased to nurse an injury or feel the pain for having inflicted it their wrinkles had gone from them whether of anger or suffering ambrose mallard lay as peaceful in consecrated ground and chumley potts would be unlikely to think that the helping to lay ambrose in his quiet last home would cost him a roasting until priestly intercession availed so chummy continues a protestant dull consciences can but this is incomprehensible that she nursing her injury should be perfectly civil she is a woman without emotion she is a woman full of emotion one man knows she ties him to her to make him feel the lash of his remorse he feels it because of her casting him from her and so civilly if this were a catholic church one might go in and give the stained soul free way to get a cleansing as it is here are the graves the dead everywhere have their sanctity even the heathen fleetwood read the name of the family of meek on several boards at the head of the graves jonathan meek died at the age of ninety five a female meek had eighty nine years in this life ezra meek gave up the ghost prematurely with a couplet at eighty one a healthy spot croridge or there were virtues in the meek family he reflected and had a shudder that he did not trace to its cause beyond an acknowledgement of a desire for the warm smell of incense chapter xliii on the road to the act of penance his customary wrestle with the night drove lord fleetwood in the stillness of the hour after matins from his hated empty esslemont up again to the village of the long lived people enjoying the moist earthiness of the air off the ironstone he rode fasting a good preparatory state for the simple pleasures which are virtually the great nourisher's teats to her young the earl was relieved of his dejection by a sudden filling of his nostrils fat esslemont underneath had no such air except on the mornings of his walk over the salzkammergut and black forest regions he had never consciously drawn that deep breath of the satisfied rapture charging the whole breast with thankfulness huntsmen would know it if the chase were not urgent to pull them at the tail of the running beast once or twice on board his yacht he might have known something like it but the salt sea breeze could not be disconnected from his companion lord feltre and a thought of feltre swung vapour of incense all about him breathing this air of the young sun's kiss of earth his invigoration repelled the seductions of the burnt oriental gums besides as he had told his friend it was the sincerity of the catholic religion not the seductiveness that won him to a form of homage the bend of the head of a foreign observer at a midnight mass asceticism though it may not justify error is a truth in itself it is the essence extracted of the scourge flesh vanquished and it stands apart from controversy those monks of the forested mountain heights rambling for their herbs know the blessedness to be found in mere breathing a neighbour readiness to yield the breath inspires it the more for when we do not dread our end the sense of a free existence comes back to us we have the prized gift to infancy under the piloting of manhood but before we taste that happiness we must perform our penance 'no living happiness can be for the unclean' as the holy father preached to his flock of the monastery dispersing at matins ay but penance penance is there not such a thing as the doing of penance out of the church in the manly fashion so to regain the right to be numbered among the captains of the world's fighting men incontestably the best of comrades whether or no they led away on a cataract leap at the gates of life boldly to say we did a wrong will clear our sky for a few shattering peals the penitential act means youth put behind us and a steady course ahead but for the keeping of a steady course men made of blood in the walks of the world must be steadied say it plainly mated there is the humiliating point of our human condition we must have beside us and close beside us the woman we have learned to respect supposing ourselves lucky enough to have found her 'that required other scale of the human balance' as woodseer calls her now he has got her wiser than lord feltre in reference to men and women we get no balance without her that is apparently the positive law and by reason of men's wretched enslavement it is the dance to dissolution when we have not honourable union with women feltre's view of women sees the devilish or the angelical and to most men women are knaves or ninnies hence do we behold rascals or imbeciles in the offspring of most men he embraced the respected woman's character with the usual effect to see with her sight and she beheld a speckled creature of the intermittent whims and moods and spites the universal patron whose ambition to be leader of his world made him handle foul brutes corrupt and cause their damnation they retort with curses in their pangs she was expected to pardon the husband who had not abstained from his revenge on her for keeping him to the pledge of his word and what a revenge he had flung the world at her she is consequently to be the young bride she was on the memorable morning of the drive off these heights of croridge down to thirty acre meadow it must be a saint to forgive such offences and she is not one she is deliciously not one neither a genevieve nor a griselda he handed her the rod to chastise him her exchange of christian names with the welshman would not do it she was too transparently sisterly provincially simple she was in fact respected any whipping from her was child's play to him on whom if he was to be made to suffer the vision of the intense felicity of austerest asceticism brought the sensation as bracingly as the boreal morning animates men of high blood in ice regions she could but gently sting even if vindictive along the heights outside the village some way below a turn of the road to lekkatts a gentleman waved hand the earl saluted with his whip and waited for him 'nothing wrong mr wythan' 'nothing to fear my lord' 'i get a trifle uneasy' 'the countess will not leave her brother' a glow of his countess's friendliness for this open faced prompt speaking good fellow of the faintly inky eyelids and possibly sheepish inclinations melted fleetwood our downright repentance of misconduct toward a woman binds us at least to the tolerant recognition of what poor scraps of consolement she may have picked up between then and now when we can stretch fist in flame to defy it on the oath of her being a woman of honour the earl alighted and said 'her brother i suspect is the key of the position' 'he's worth it she loves her brother' said mr wythan betraying a feature of his quick race with whom the reflection upon a statement is its lightning in advance gratified by the instant apprehension of his meaning fleetwood interpreted the welshman's 'i have to see the brother worthy of her love can you tell me the hour likely to be convenient' mr wythan thought an appointment unnecessary which conveyed the sufficient assurance of audience granted 'you know her brother well mr wythan' 'know him as if i had known him for years they both come to the mind as faith comes no saying how one swears by them' fleetwood eyed the welsh gentleman with an idea that he might readily do the same by him mr wythan's quarters were at the small village inn whither he was on his way to breakfast the earl slipped an arm through the bridle reins and walked beside him listening to an account of the situation at lekkatts it was that extraordinary complication of moves and checks which presents in the main a knot for the powers above to cut a miserly old lord withholds arrears of wages his workmen strike at a critical moment his nephew moved by common humanity draws upon crippled resources to supply their extremer needs though they are ruining his interests they made one night a demonstration of the terrorizing sort round lekkatts to give him a chorus and the old lord fired at them out of window and wounded a man for that they vowed vengeance all the new gunpowder milled in surrey was for some purpose of his own stored by lord levellier on the alder island of the pond near his workshops a quarter of a mile below the house they refused whatever their object to let a pound of it be moved at a time when at last the government had undertaken to submit it to experiments and there they stood on ground too strong for 'the captain' as they called him to force because of the quantity stored at lekkatts being largely beyond the amount under cover of lord levellier's licence the old lord was very ill and he declined to see a doctor but obstinately kept from dying his nephew had to guard him and at the same time support an enemy having just cause of complaint this however his narrow means would not much longer permit him to do the alternative was then offered him of either siding arbitrarily against the men and his conscience or of taking a course 'imprudent on the part of a presumptive heir' mr wythan said hurriedly at the little inn's doorsteps 'you make one of his lordship's guard' said fleetwood 'the countess her brother and i yes' 'danger at all' 'not so much to fear while the countess is with us' 'fear is not a word for carinthia' her name on the earl's lips drew a keen shot of the eye from mr wythan and he read the signification of the spoken name 'you know what every cambrian living thinks of her my lord' 'she shall not have one friend the less for me' fleetwood's hand was out for a good bye and the hand was grasped by one who looked happy in doing it he understood and trusted the man after that warmed in thinking how politic his impulses could be his intention of riding up to croridge at noon to request his interview with mr kirby levellier was then stated 'the key of the position as you said' mr wythan remarked not proffering an opinion of it more than was expressed by a hearty rosy countenance that had to win its way with the earl before excuse was found for the venturesome repetition of his phrase cantering back to that home of the loves of gower woodseer and madge winch the thought of his first act of penance done without his feeling the poorer for it reconciled fleetwood to the aspect of the hollow place he could not stay beneath the roof his task of breakfasting done he was off before the morning's delivery of letters riding round the country under croridge soon up there again and henrietta might be at home he was reminded by hearing band music as he followed the directions to the house named stoneridge the band consisted of eight wind instruments they played astonishingly well for itinerant musicians by curious chance they were playing a selection from the pirata presently he heard the notes to 'il mio tradito amor' they had hit upon henrietta's favourite piece at the close of it he dismounted flung the reins to his groom and addressing a compliment to the leader was deferentially saluted with a 'my lord' henrietta stood at the window a servant held the door open for him to enter he went in and the beautiful young woman welcomed him 'oh my dear lord you have given me such true delight how very generous of you' he protested ignorance she had seen him speak to the conductor and receive the patron's homage and who but he knew her adored of operas or would have had the benevolent impulse to think of solacing her exile from music in the manner so sure of her taste she was at her loveliest her features were one sweet bloom as of the sunny flower garden and touched to the heart by the music and the kindness she looked the look that kisses innocently he felt feeling himself on the same good ground while he could own he admired the honey creature much as an amateur may admire one of the pictures belonging to the nation 'and you have come ' she said 'we are to believe in happy endings' he shrugged as the modest man should who says 'if it depends on me' but the words were firmly spoken and could be credited 'janey is with her brother down at lekkatts things are at a deadlock a spice of danger enough to relieve the dulness and where there is danger janey's at home' henrietta mimicked her janey 'parades with her brother at night old military cap on her head firearms primed sings her austrian mountain songs or the light cavalry call till it rings all day in my ears she has a thrilling contralto you are not to think her wild my lord she's for adventure or domesticity whichever the fates decree she really is coming to the perfect tone' 'speak of her' said the earl 'she can't yet overlook ' 'it's in the family she will overlook anything her brother excuses' 'i'm here to see him' 'i heard it from mr wythan' 'owain i believe' henrietta sketched apologies with a sidled head soft pout wavy hand 'he belongs to the order of primitive people his wife the same pattern one supposes pledged them to their christian names the man is a simpleton but a gentleman and janey holds his dying wife's wish sacred we are all indebted to him' 'whatever she thinks right' said fleetwood the fair young woman's warm nature flew out to him on a sparkle of grateful tenderness in return for his magnanimity oblivious of the inflamer it was and her heart thanked him more warmly without the perilous show of emotion when she found herself secure she was beautiful she was tempting and probably the weakest of players in the ancient game of two and clearly she was not disposed to the outlaw game was only a creature of ardour that he could see seeing the misinterpretation a fellow like brailstone would put upon a temporary flush of the feminine and the advantage he would take of it perhaps not unsuccessfully the dog he committed the absurdity of casting a mental imprecation at the cunning tricksters of emotional women and yelled at himself in the worn old surplice of the converted rake but letting his mind run this way the tradito amor of the band outside the lady's window was instantly traced to lord brailstone so convictingly that he now became a very counsel for an injured husband in denunciation of the seductive compliment henrietta prepared to conduct him to lekkatts her bonnet was brought she drew forth a letter from a silken work bag and raised it livia's handwriting 'i 've written my opinion' he said 'not too severe pray' 'posted' 'livia wanted a protector' 'and chose what on earth are you saying' livia and her boyish lord were abandoned on the spot though henrietta could have affirmed stoutly that there was much to be pleaded if a female advocate dared it and a man would but hear his fingers were at the leaves of a spanish dictionary 'oh yes and here we have a book of travels in spain' she said 'everything spanish for janey now you are aware no' he was unaware and desired to be told 'janey's latest idea only she would have conceived the notion you solve our puzzle my lord' she renewed the thanks she persisted in offering for the military music now just ceasing vexatiously considering that it was bad policy for him to be unmasking brailstone to her at the same time the blindness which rendered her unconscious of brailstone's hand in sending members of a military band to play selections from the favourite opera they had jointly drunk of to ecstasy was creditable touching when one thought of the pursuer's many devices not omitting some treason on the part of her present friend 'tell me i solve' he said henrietta spied the donkey basket bearing the two little ones 'yes i hope so on our way down' she made answer 'i want you to see the pair of love birds in a nest' the boy and girl were seen lying side by side both fast asleep fair haired girl dark haired boy faced to one another 'temper' said fleetwood when he had taken observation of them 'very imperious mr boy' she replied straightening her back under a pretty frown to convey the humour of the infant tyrant the father's mind ran swiftly on a comparison of the destinies of the two children from his estimate of their parents many of gower woodseer's dicta converging to reawaken thoughts upon nature's laws which a knowledge of his own nature blackened he had to persuade himself that this child of his was issue of a loving union he had to do it violently conjuring a vivid picture of the mother in bud and his recognition of her young charm the pain of keeping to his resolve to quit her lest she should subjugate him and despoil him of his wrath the fatalism in his coming and going the romantic freak it had been a situation then so clearly wrought now blurred past comprehension but there must have been love or some love on his part otherwise he was bound to pray for the mother to predominate in the child all but excluding its father carinthia's image as a result ascended sovereignty and he hung to it for if we are human creatures with consciences nothing is more certain than that we make our taskmasters of those to whom we have done a wrong the philosopher says between lord feltre and gower woodseer influenced pretty equally by each of them this young nobleman was wakening to the claims of others youth's infant conscience fleetwood now conceived the verbal supplication for his wife's forgiveness involved in the act of penance and verbal meant abject with him going so far it would mean naked precise no slurring that he knew and a tremor went over him women then are really the half of the world in power as much as in their number if men pretend to a step above the savage or well his wife was a power he had forgotten the puzzle spoken of by henrietta when she used the word again and expressed her happiness in the prospect before them caused by his presence of course 'you are aware my dear lord janey worships her brother he was defeated by some dastardly contrivance in a wager to do wonderful feats for money money money a large stake how we come off our high horses i hadn't an idea of money before i was married i think of little else my husband has notions of honour he engaged himself to pay a legacy of debts his uncle would not pay debts long due to him he was reduced to the shift of wagering on his great strength and skill he could have done it his enemy managed enemy there was he had to sell out of the army in consequence i shall never have janey's face of suffering away from my sight he is a soldier above all things it seems hard on me but i cannot blame him for snatching at an opportunity to win military distinction he is in treaty for the post of aide to the colonel the general of the english contingent bound for spain for the cause of the queen my husband will undertake to be at the orders of his chief as soon as he can leave this place janey goes with him according to present arrangements' passing through a turnstile that led from the road across a meadow slope to the broken land below henrietta had view of the earl's hard white face and she hastened to say 'you have altered that my lord she is devoted to her brother and her brother running dangers and danger in itself is an attraction to her but her husband will have the first claim she has her good sense she will never insist on going if you oppose she will be ready to fill her station it will be her pride and her pleasure' henrietta continued in the vein of these assurances and carinthia's character was shooting lightnings through him withering that of the woman who referred to his wife's good sense and her station and certainly would not have betrayed herself by such drawlings if she had been very positive that carinthia's disposition toward wealth and luxury resembled hers she knew the reverse or so his contemptuously generous effort to frame an apology for the stuff he was hearing considered it his wife was lost to him that fact smote on his breast the moment he heard of her desire to go with her brother wildest of enterprises but a criminal saw himself guilty of a large part in the disaster the two heroical souls were striving desperately to repair if her chillon went carinthia would go sure as flame is drawn to air the exceeding splendour in the character of a young woman injured as she had been soft to love as he knew her and giving her husband no other rival than a beloved brother no ground of complaint save her devotion to her brother pervaded him without illuminating or lifting rather with an indication of a foul contrast that prostrated him half of our funny heathen lives we are bent double to gather things we have tossed away was one of the numbers of apposite sayings that hummed about him for a chorus of the world's old wisdom in derision when he descended the heathy path and had sight of carinthia beside her chillon would it be the same thing if he had it in hand again did he wish it to be the same was not he another man by the leap of his heart to the woman standing down there he was a better man but recent spiritual exercises brought him to see superstitiously how by that sign she was lost to him for everlastingly in this life the better pays for the worse thus is the better a proved thing both chillon and carinthia it is probable might have been stirred to deeper than compassion had the proud young nobleman taken them into his breast to the scouring of it exposing the grounds of his former brutality his gradual enlightenment his ultimate acknowledgement of the pricelessness of the woman he had won to lose her an imploring of forgiveness would not have been necessary with those two however great their or the woman's astonishment at the revelation of an abysmal male humanity a complete exposure of past meanness is the deed of present courage certain of its reward without as well as within for then we show our fellows that the slough is cast but life is a continuous fight and members of the social world display its degree of civilization by fighting in armour most of them are born in it and their armour is more sensitive than their skins it was fleetwood's instinct of his inability to fling it off utterly which warned him of his loss of the wife whose enthusiasm to wait on her brother in danger might have subsided into the channel of duty even tenderness had he been able resolutely to strip himself bare this was the further impossible to him because of a belief he now imposed upon himself to cover the cowardly shrinking from so extreme a penitential act that such confessions are due from men to the priest only and that he could confess wholly and absolutely to the priest to heaven therefore under seal and in safety but with perfect repentance so compelled to keep his inner self unknown he fronted chillon courteously in the somewhat lofty seeming of a guarded manner he requested audience for a few minutes observing the princely figure of the once hated man and understanding henrietta's sheer womanly choice of him carinthia's idolatry too as soon as he had spoken the man was in his voice chillon said 'it concerns my sister i have to think in that case her wish is to be present your lordship will shorten the number of minutes for the interview by permitting it' fleetwood encountered carinthia's eyes they did not entreat or defy they seconded her brother and were a civil shining naught on her husband he bowed his head constrained feeling heavily the two to one she replied to the look 'my brother and i have a single mind we save time by speaking three together my lord' he was led into the long room of the workshop where various patterns of muskets rifles pistols and swords were stars crosses wedges over the walls and a varnished wooden model of a piece of cannon occupied the middle place on a block contempt of military weapons and ridicule of the art of war were common on those days among a people beginning to sit with habitual snugness at the festive board provided for them by the valour of their fathers fleetwood had not been on the side of the banqueting citizens though his country's journals and her feasted popular wits made a powerful current to whelm opposition but the appearance of the woman his wife here her head surrounded by destructive engines in the form of trophy and the knowledge that this woman bearing his name designed to be out at the heels of a foreign army or tag rag of uniformed rascals inspired him to reprobate men's bad old game as heartily as good sense does in the abstract and as derisively as it is the way with comfortable islanders before the midnight trumpet notes of panic have tumbled them to their legs he took his chair sickened he was the next moment taking carinthia's impression of chillon compelled to it by an admiration that men and women have alike for shapes of strength in the mould of grace over whose firm build a flicker of agility seems to run for the young soldier's figure was visibly in its repose prompt to action as the mind's movement this was her brother her enthusiasm for her brother was explained to him no sooner did he have the conception of it than it plucked at him painfully and feeling himself physically eclipsed by the object of carinthia's enthusiasm his pride of the rival counselled him to preserve the mask on what was going on within lest it should be seen that he was also morally beaten at the outset a trained observation told him moreover that her chillon's correctly handsome features despite their conventional urbanity could knit to smite and held less of the reserves of mercy behind them than carinthia's glorious barbaric ruggedness her eyes each time she looked at her brother had without doating the light as of the rise of happy tears to the underlids as they had on a certain day at the altar when 'my lord' was 'my husband' more shyly then he would have said as beautifully but for envy of the frank pellucid worship in that look on her proved hero it was the jewel of all the earth to win back to himself and it subjected him through his desire for it to a measurement with her idol in character quality strength hardness he heard the couple pronouncing sentence of his loss by anticipation why had she primed her brother to propose the council of three addressing them separately he could have been his better or truer self the sensation of the check imposed on him was instructive as to her craft and the direction of her wishes she preferred the braving of hazards and horrors beside her brother in scorn of the advantages he could offer and he yearned to her for despising by comparison the bribe he proposed in the hope that he might win her to him she was with religion to let him know the meanness of wealth thus at the edge of the debate or contest the young lord's essential nobility disarmed him and the revealing of it which would have appealed to carinthia and chillon both was forbidden by its constituent pride which helped him to live and stood obstructing explanatory speech chapter xliv between the earl the countess and her brother and of a silver cross carinthia was pleased by hearing lord fleetwood say to her 'your madge and my gower are waiting to have the day named for them' she said 'i respect him so much for his choice of madge they shall not wait if i am to decide' 'old mr woodseer has undertaken to join them' 'it is in whitechapel they will be married' the blow that struck was not intended and fleetwood passed it under her brother's judicial eye any small chance word may carry a sting for the neophyte in penitence 'my lawyers will send down the settlement on her to be read to them to day or to morrow with the interest on that and the sum he tells me he has in the funds they keep the wolf from the door a cottage door they have their cottage there's an old song of love in a cottage his liking for it makes him seem wiser than his clever sayings he'll work in that cottage' 'they have a good friend to them in you my lord it will not be poverty for their simple wants i hear of the little cottage in surrey where they are to lodge at first before they take one of their own' 'we will visit them' 'when i am in england i shall visit them often' he submitted 'the man up here wounded is recovering' 'yes my lord i am learning to nurse the wounded with the surgeon to direct me' 'matters are sobering down the workmen' 'they listen to reason so willingly when we speak personally we find' the earl addressed chillon 'your project of a spanish expedition reminds me of favourable reports of your chief' 'thoroughly able and up to the work' chillon answered 'queer people to meddle with' 'we 're on the right side on the dispute' 'it counts napoleon says a spanish civil war promises bloody doings' 'any war does that' 'in the peninsula it's war to the knife a merciless business' 'good schooling for the profession' fleetwood glanced she was collected and attentive 'i hear from mrs levellier that carinthia would like to be your companion' 'my sister has the making of a serviceable hospital nurse' 'you hear the chatter of london' 'i have heard it' 'you encourage her mr levellier' 'she will be useful better there than here my lord' 'i claim a part in the consultation' 'there 's no consultation she determines to go' 'we can advise her of all the risks' 'she has weighed them every one' 'in the event of accidents the responsibility for having persuaded her would rest on you' 'my brother has not persuaded me' carinthia's belltones intervened 'i proposed it the persuasion was mine it is my happiness to be near him helping if i can' 'lady fleetwood i am entitled to think that your brother yielded to a request urged in ignorance of the nature of the risks a woman runs' 'my brother does not yield to a request without examining it all round my lord and i do not i know the risks an evil that we should not endure life may go there can be no fear for me' she spoke plain truth the soul of this woman came out in its radiance to subdue him as her visage sometimes did and her voice enlarged her words she was a warrior woman life her sword death her target never to be put to shame unconquerable no such symbolical image smote him but he had an impression the prose of it as in the scene of the miners' cottares her lord could have knelt to her and for an unprotesting longer space now he choked a sigh shrugged and said in the world's patient manner with mad people 'you have set your mind on it you see it rose coloured you would not fear no but your friends would have good reason to fear it's a menagerie in revolt over there it is not really the place for you abandon the thought i beg' 'i shall if my brother does not go' said carinthia laughter of spite at a remark either silly or slyly defiant was checked in fleetwood by the horror of the feeling that she had gone was ankle deep in bloody mire captive prey of a rabble soldiery meditating the shot or stab of the blessed end out of woman's half of our human muddle he said to chillon 'pardon me war is a detestable game women in the thick of it add a touch to the brutal hideousness of the whole thing' chillon said 'we are all of that opinion men have to play the game women serving in hospital make it humaner' 'their hospitals are not safe' 'well safety' for safety is nowhere to be had but the earl pleaded 'at least in our country' 'in our country women are safe' 'they are we may say protected' 'laws and constables are poor protection for them' 'the women we name ladies are pretty safe as a rule' 'my sister then was the exception' after a burning half minute the earl said 'i have to hear it from you mr levellier you see me here' that was handsomely spoken but lord fleetwood had been judged and put aside his opening of an old case to hint at repentance for brutality annoyed the man who had let him go scathless for a sister's sake 'the grounds of your coming my lord are not seen my time is short' 'i must i repeat be consulted with regard to lady fleetwood's movements' 'my sister does not acknowledge your claim' 'the countess of fleetwood's acts involve her husband' 'one has to listen at times to what old sailors call caribbee' chillon exclaimed impatiently half aloud 'my sister received your title she has to support it she did not receive the treatment of a wife or lady or woman or domestic animal the bond is broken as far as it bears on her subjection she holds to the rite thinks it sacred you can be at rest as to her behaviour in other respects your lordship does not exist for her' 'the father of her child must exist for her' 'you raise that curtain my lord' in the presence of three it would not bear a shaking carinthia said in pity of his torture 'i have my freedom and am thankful for it to follow my brother to share his dangers with him that is more to me than luxury and the married state i take only my freedom' 'our boy you take the boy' 'my child is with my sister henrietta 'where' 'we none know yet' 'you still mistrust me' her eyes were on a man that she had put from her peaceably and she replied with sweetness in his ears with shocks to a sinking heart 'my lord you may learn to be a gentle father to the child i pray you may my brother and i will go if it is death for us i pray my child may have his father and god directing his father' her speech had the clang of the final 'yes i hope if it be the worst happening i pray too' said he and drooped and brightened desperately 'but you too carinthia you could aid by staying by being with the boy and me carinthia' he clasped her name the vapour left to him of her 'i have learnt learnt what i am what you are i have to climb a height to win back the wife i threw away she was unknown to me i to myself nearly as much i sent a warning of the kind of husband for you a poor kind i just knew myself well enough for that you claimed my word the blessing of my life if i had known it we were married i played i see the beast i played money is power they say i see the means it is to damn the soul unless we unless a man does what i do now' fleetwood stopped he had never spoken such words arterial words as they were though the commonest and with moist brows dry lips he could have resumed have said more have taken this woman this dream of the former bride the present stranger into his chamber of the brave aims and sentenced deeds her brother in the room was the barrier and she sat mute large eyed expressionless he had plunged low in the man's hearing the air of his lungs was thick hard to breathe for shame of a degradation so extreme chillon imagined him to be sighing he had to listen further 'soul' had been an uttered word when the dishonouring and mishandling brute of a young nobleman stuttered a compliment to carinthia on her 'faith in god's assistance and the efficacy of prayer' he jumped to his legs not to be shouting 'hound' at him he said under control 'god's name shall be left to the church my sister need not be further troubled she has shown she is not persuaded by me matters arranged here quickly we start if i am asked whether i think she does wisely to run the risks in an insurrectionary country rather than remain at home exposed to the honours and amusements your lordship offers i think so she is acting in her best interests she has the choice of being abroad with me or staying here unguarded by me she has had her experience she chooses rightly paint the risks she runs you lay the colours on those she escapes' she thanks the treatment she has undergone for her freedom to choose i am responsible for nothing but the not having stood against her most wretched marriage it might have been foreseen out there in the war she is protected here she is with i spare your lordship the name' fleetwood would have heard harsher had he not been carinthia's husband he withheld his reply the language moved him to proud hostility but the speaker was carinthia's brother he said to her 'you won't forget gower and madge' she gave him a smile in saying 'it shall be settled for a day after next week' the forms of courtesy were exchanged at the closing of the door on him chillon said 'he did send a message i gathered it without the words from our uncle griphard i thought him in honour bound to you and it suited me that i should' 'i was a blindfold girl dearest no warning would have given me sight' said carinthia 'that was my treachery to the love of my brother i dream of father and mother reproaching me' the misery of her time in england had darkened her mind's picture of the early hour with chillon on the heights above the forsaken old home and the enthusiasm of her renewed devotion to her brother giving it again as no light of a lost eden as the brilliant step she was taking with him from their morning eastern alps to smoky crimson pyrenees and spanish sierras she could imagine the cavernous interval her punishment for having abandoned a sister's duties in the quest of personal happiness but simultaneously the growing force of her mind's intelligence wherein was no enthusiasm to misdirect by overcolouring enabled her to gather more than a suspicion of comparative feebleness in the man stripped of his terrors she penetrated the discrowned tyrant's nature some distance deep enough to be quit of her foregoing alarms these combined with his assured high style had woven him the magical coat threadbare to quiet scrutiny she matched him beside her brother the dwarfed object was then observed and it was not for a woman to measure herself beside him she came however of a powerful blood and he was pressing her back on her resources without the measurement or a thought of it she did that which is the most ordinary and the least noticed of our daily acts in civilized intercourse she subjected him to the trial of the elements composing him by collision with what she felt of her own and it was because she felt them strongly aware of her feeling them but unaware of any conflict that the wrestle occurred she flung him pitied him and passed on along her path elsewhere this can be done when love is gone it is done more or less at any meeting of men and men and men and women who love not are perpetually doing it unconsciously or sensibly even in their love a time for the trial arrives among certain of them and the leadership is assumed and submission ensues tacitly nothing of the contention being spoken perhaps nothing definitely known in carinthia's case her revived enthusiasm for her brother drove to the penetration of the husband pleading to thwart its course his offer was wealth that is luxury amusement ease the sub audible 'himself' into the bargain was disregarded not counting with one who was an upward rush of fire at the thought that she was called to share her brother's dangers chillon cordially believed the earl to be the pestilent half madman junction with whom is a constant trepidation for the wife when it is not a screaming plight he said so and carinthia let him retain his opinion she would have said it herself to support her scheme though 'mad' applied to a man moving in the world with other men was not understood by her with henrietta for the earl's advocate she was patient as the deaf rock wall enthusiam can be against entreaties to change its direction or bid it disperse the 'private band of picked musicians' at the disposal of the countess of fleetwood and opera singers henrietta mentioned resonant names hired for wonderful nights at esslemont and calesford or on board the earl's beautiful schooner yacht were no temptation nor did henrietta's allusions to his broken appearance move his wife except in her saying regretfully 'he changes' on the hall table at esslemont a letter from his bankers informed the earl of a considerable sum of money paid in to his account in the name of lord brailstone chumley potts hanging at him like a dog without a master since the death of his friend ambrose had journeyed down 'anxious about you' he said anxious about or attracted by the possessor of ambrose mallard's 'clean sweeper' the silver mounted small pistol sight of which he begged to have and to lengthened his jaw on hearing it was loaded a loaded pistol this dark little one to the right of the earl's blotting pad and pens had the look of a fearful link with his fallen chaps and fishy hue potts maundered moralities upon 'life' holding the thing in his hand weighing it eyeing the muzzle he 'couldn't help thinking of what is going to happen to us after it all' and 'brosey knows now' was followed by a twitch of one cheek and the ejaculation 'forever ' fleetwood alive and ambrose dead were plucking the startled worldling to a peep over the verge into our abyss and the young lord's evident doing of the same commanded chumley potts' imitation of him under the cloud ambrose had become for both of them he was recommended to see lord feltre if he had a desire to be instructed on the subject of the mitigation of our pains in the regions below potts affirmed that he meant to die a protestant christian thereupon carrying a leaden burden of unlaughed laughable stuff in his breast and chummy's concluding remark to speed him 'damn it no we'll stick to our religion' fleetwood strode off to his library and with the names of the ixionides of his acquaintance ringing round his head proceeded to strike one of them off the number privileged at the moment to intrude on him others would follow this one must be the first to go he wrote the famous letter to lord brailstone which debarred the wily pursuer from any pretext to be running down into mrs levellier's neighbourhood and also precluded the chance of his meeting the fair lady at calesford with the brevity equivalent to the flick of a glove on the cheek lord brailstone was given to understand by lord fleetwood that relations were at an end between them no explanation was added a single sentence executed the work and in the third person he did not once reflect on the outcry in the ear of london coming from the receiver of such a letter upon payment of a debt the letter posted and flying lord fleetwood was kinder to chumley potts he had a friendly word for gower woodseer though both were heathens after their diverse fashions neither of them likely ever to set out upon the grand old road of rome lord feltre's 'appian way of the saints and comforters' chummy was pardoned when they separated at night for his reiterated allusions to the temptation of poor ambrose mallard's conclusive little weapon lying on the library table within reach of a man's arm chair in its case and the case locked yes but easily opened 'provoking every damnable sort of mortal curiosity' the soundest men among us have their fits of the blues fleetwood was told 'not wholesome' chummy shook his head resolutely and made himself comprehensibly mysterious he meant well he begged his old friend to promise he would unload and keep it unloaded 'for i know the infernal worry you have deuced deal worse than a night's bad luck' said he and fleetwood smiled sourly at the world's total ignorance of causes his wretchedness was due now to the fact that the aforetime huntress refused to be captured he took a silver cross from a table drawer and laid it on the pistol case 'there chummy' he said that was all not sermonizing or proselytizing he was partly comprehended by chumley potts fully a week later the unsuspecting fellow soon to be despatched in the suite of brailstone bore away an unwontedly affectionate dismissal to his bed and spoke some rather squeamish words himself as he recollected with disgust when he ran about over london repeating his executioner's the cross on the pistol case may have conduced to lord fleetwood's thought that his days among unrepentant ephemeral protestant sinners must have their immediate termination these old friends were the plague infected clothes he flung off his body but the cross where it lay forbidding a movement of the hand to that box was authoritative to decree his passage through a present torture by the agency of the hand he held back from the solution of his perplexity at the cost which his belief in the eternal would pay henrietta had mentioned her husband's defeat by some dastardly contrivance he had to communicate for the disburdening of his soul not only that he was guilty but the meanest of criminals in being no more than half guilty his training told him of the contempt women entertain toward the midway or cripple sinner when they have no special desire to think him innocent how write or even how phrase his having merely breathed in his ruffian's hearing the wish that he might hear of her husband's defeat and with what object here too a woman might years hence if not forgive bend her head resignedly over the man's vile nature supposing strong passion his motive but the name for the actual motive it would not bear writing or any phrasing round it an unsceptred despot bidden take a fair woman's eyes into his breast saw and shrank and now the eyes were carinthia's he saw a savage bridegroom and a black ladder climber and the sweetest of pardoning brides and the devil in him still insatiate for revenge upon her who held him to his word he wrote read tore the page trimmed the lamp and wrote again he remembered gower woodseer's having warned him he would finish his career a monk not like feltre an oily convert but under the hood yes and extracting a chartreuse from his ramble through woods richer far than the philosopher's milk of mother nature's bosom there flamed the burning signal of release from his torments there his absolving refuge

was but another instance of the extraordinary and not so wonderful lady arpington equal to a parliament in herself spoke of the place and the countess courted by her repentant lord brailstone and chumley potts were town criers of the executioner letter each had received from the earl potts with his chatter of a suicide's pistol kept loaded in a case under a two inch long silver cross and with sundry dramatic taps on the forehead jottings over the breast and awful grimace of devoutness there was no mistaking him the young nobleman of the millions was watched the town spyglass had him in its orbit tales of the ancestral fleetwoods ran beside rumours of a papist priest at the bedside of the foredoomed to error's dying mother his wealth was counted multiplied by the ready naughts of those who know little and dread much sir meeson corby referred to an argument lord fleetwood had held on an occasion hotly against the logical consistency of the protestant faith and to his alarm lest some day 'all that immense amount of money should slip away from us to favour the machinations of roman catholicism' the countess of cressett livia anticipated her no surprise at anything lord fleetwood might do she knew him so thereupon with the whirr of a covey on wing before the fowler our crested three of immemorial antiquity and a presumptive immortality the ladies endor eldritch and cowry shot up again hooting across the dormant chief city old england's fell word of the scarlet shimmer above the nether pit flames rome an ancient horror in the blood of the population conceiving the word to signify beak fang and claw the fiendish ancient enemy of the roasting day of yore heard and echoed sleepless at the work of the sapper in preparation for the tiger's leap rome is keen to spy the foothold of english stability and her clasp of a pillar of the structure sends tremors to our foundations the coupling of rome and england's wealthiest nobleman struck a match to terrorize the fire insurance of smithfield that meteoric intractable perhaps wicked but popular reputedly clever manifestly evil starred enormously wealthy young earl of fleetwood wedded to an adventuress and a target for the scandals emanating from the woman was daily without omission of a day seen walking piccadilly pavement in company once more with the pervert the jesuit agent that crafty catesby of a lord feltre arm in arm the pair of them and uninterruptedly conversing utterly unlike englishmen mr rose mackrell passed them and his breezy salutation of the earl was unobserved in my lord's vacant glass optics as he sketched the scene london had report of the sinister tempter and the imperilled young probationer undisguisedly entering the roman catholic chapel of a fashionable district chapel erected on pervert's legacies down a small street at the corner of a grandee square by tolerance or connivance of our constabulary entering it linked and linked they issued their heads bent for the operation of the tonsure you would say two english noblemen but is there no legislation to stop the disease our female government asks it vixenly of our impotent male which pretends beneath an air of sympathy that we should abstain from any compulsory action upon the law to interfere though the situation is confessedly grave and the aspect men assume is correspondingly to the last degree provokingly grave half alive that they are or void of patriotism or babylonian at heart lord fleetwood's yet undocked old associates vowed he 'smelt strong' of the fumes of the whirled silver censer balls his disfavour had caused a stoppage of supplies causing vociferous abomination of their successful rivals the romish priests captain abrane sniffed loud as a horse condemnatory as a cat in speaking of him he said 'by george it comes to this we shall have to turn catholics for a loan' watchdogs of the three repeated the gigantic gambler's melancholy roar and see what gap cried the ratiocination of alarm see the landslip it is in our body national and religious when exalted personages go that way to rome as you and the world have reflected in your sager moods an ordinary pebble may roll where it likes for individualism of the multitudinously obscure little affects us not so the costly jewel which is a congregation of ourselves in our envies and longings and genuflexions thick about its lustres the lapses of precious things must needs carry us both by weight and example and it will ceaselessly be that we are possessed by the treasure we possess we hang on it a still small voice of england's mind under panic sent up these truisms containing admonitions to the governing ladies they the most conservative of earthly bodies clamoured in return like cloud scud witches that have caught fire at their skirts from the torches of marsh fire radicals they cited for his arrest the titled millionaire who made a slide for the idiots of the kingdom they stigmatized our liberty as a sophistry unless we have in it the sustaining element of justice and where is the justice that punishes his country for any fatal course a mad young croesus may take they shackled the hands of testators who endangered the salvation of coroneted boys by having sanction to bequeath vast wealth in bulk they said in truth that it was the liberty to be un christian finally they screeched a petitioning of parliament to devote a night to a sitting and empower the lord chancellor to lay an embargo on the personal as well as the real estate of wealthy perverts in common prudence depriving rome of the coveted means to turn our religious weapons against us the three guardian ladies and their strings of followers headed over the fevered and benighted town as the records of the period attest windpiping these and similar solan notes from the undigested cropful of alarms lord fleetwood's expected conduct crammed into them they and all the world traced his present madness to the act foregoing that marriage they reviewed it to deplore it every known incident and the numbers imagined yet merely to deplore frightful comparisons of then with now rendered the historical shock to the marriage market matter for a sick smile evil genius of some sort beside him the wealthy young nobleman is sure to have he has got rid of one to take up with a viler first a sluttish trollop of german origin is foisted on him for life next he is misled to abjure the faith of his fathers for rome but patently desperation in the husband of such a wife weakened his resistance to the roman catholic pervert's insinuations there we punctuate the full stop to our inquiries we have the secret and upon that suddenly comes a cyclonic gust and gossip twirls whines and falls to the twanging of an entirely new set of notes that furnish a tolerably agreeable tune on the whole o hear the marchioness of arpington proclaims not merely acquaintanceship with lord fleetwood's countess she professes esteem for the young person she has been heard to say that if the principality of wales were not a royal title a dignity of the kind would be conferred by the people of those mountains on the countess of fleetwood such unbounded enthusiasm there was for her character when she sojourned down there as it is they do speak of her in their welsh by some title their bards are offered prizes to celebrate her deeds you remember the regiment of mounted welsh gentlemen escorting her to her kentish seat with their band of the three stringed harps she is well born educated handsome a perfectly honest woman and a sound protestant quite the reverse of lord fleetwood's seeking to escape her it is she who flies she cannot forgive him his cruelties and infidelities and that is the reason why he threatens to commit the act of despair only she can save him she has flown for refuge to her uncle lord levellier's house at a place named croridge not in the gazetteer hard of access and a home of poachers where shooting goes on hourly but most picturesque and romantic as she herself is lady arpington found her there nursing one of the wounded and her uncle on his death bed obdurate all round against her husband but pensive when supplicated to consider her country endangered by rome she is a fervent patriot the tales of her whitechapel origin and heading mobs wielding bludgeons are absolutely false traceable to scandalizing anecdotists like mr rose mackrell she is the beautiful example of an injured wife doing honour to her sex in the punishment of a faithless husband yet so little cherishing her natural right to deal him retribution that we dare hope she will listen to her patriotic duty in consenting to the reconcilement which is lord fleetwood's alternative his wife or rome they say she has an incommunicable charm accounting for the price he puts on her now she holds aloof and he misses it let her but rescue him from england's most vigilant of her deadly enemies she will be entitled to the nation's lasting gratitude she has her opportunity for winning the anglican english as formerly she won the dissenter welsh she may yet be the means of leading back the latter to our fold a notation of the cries in air at a time of surgent public excitement can hardly yield us music and the wording of them by the aid of compounds and transplants metaphors and similes only just within range of the arrows of phoebus' bow ie the farthest flight known would while it might imitate the latent poetry expose venturesome writers to the wrath of a people commendably believing their language a perfected instrument when they prefer the request for a plateful and commissioning their literary police to brain audacious experimenters who enlarge or wing it beyond the downright aim at that mark the gossip of the time must therefore appear commonplace in resemblance to the panting venue a terre of the toad instead of the fiery steed's although we have documentary evidence that our country's heart was moved in no common degree dr glossop's lucid english has it at the head of a broadsheet ballad discovered by him wherein the connubially inclined young earl and the nation in turn beseech the countess to resume her place at esslemont and so save both from a terrific dragon's jaw scarlet as the infernal flames described as fascinating 'the classes with the crests and the lining to their vests till down they jump and empty leave a headless trunk that rests' these ballads burlesque to present reading mainly intended for burlesque by the wits who dogged without much enlivening an anxious period of our history when corner stones were falling the way the young lord of the millions threatened to go did there is little doubt according to another part of their design rose mackrell boasts it indirectly in his memoirs interpret public opinion that is the english humour of it the half laugh in their passing and not simulated shudder carinthia had a study of the humours of english character in the person of the wounded man she nursed on little croridge imagining it the most unobserved of english homes and herself as unimportant an object daniel charner took his wound as he took his medicine and his posset from her hand kindly and seemed to have a charitable understanding of lord levellier now that the old nobleman had driven a pellet of lead into him and laid him flat it pleased him to assure her that his mates were men of their word and had promised to pay the old lord with a 'rouse' for it nothing worse her father used to speak of the 'clean hearts of the english' as to the husbanding of revenge that is the 'no spot of bad blood' to vitiate them captain john peter seconded all good humoured fighters 'for the long account' they will surely win and it was one of his maxims 'my foe can spoil my face he beats me if he spoils my temper' recalling the scene of her bridal day the two strong englishmen at the shake of hands that had spoiled one another's faces she was enlightened with a comprehension of her father's love for the people seeing the spiritual of the gross ugly picture as not every man can do and but a warrior joan among women chillon shall teach the spanish people english heartiness she thought lord fleetwood's remarks on the expedition would have sufficed to stamp it righteous with her that was her logic of the low valuation of him she fancied herself absolutely released at his departure neither her sister riette nor her friend owain administering sentiment and common sense to her by turns could conceive how the passion for the recovery of her brother's military name fed the hope that she might aid in it how the hope fed the passion she had besides her hunger to be at the work she could do her chillon's glory for morning sky above it such was the mind lady arpington brought the world's wisdom to bear upon deeming it in the end female only in its wildness and obstinacy carinthia's answers were few barely varied her repetition of 'my brother' irritated the great lady whose argument was directed to make her see that these duties toward her brother were primarily owing to her husband the man she would reclaim and could guide and the countess of fleetwood's position her duty to society her dispensing of splendid hospitality the strengthening of her husband to do his duty to the nation the saving of him from a fatal step from rome these were considerations for a reasonable woman to weigh before she threw up all to be off on the maddest of adventures 'inconceivable my dear child' lady arpington proceeded until she heard herself as droning carinthia's unmoved aspect of courteous attention appeared to invoke the prolongation of the sermon it criticized it had an air of reversing their positions while she listened to the charge of folly and incidentally replied her reason for not fearing roman catholic encroachments was she said her having known good catholics in the country she came from for herself she should die professing the faith of her father and mother behind her correct demeanour a rustic intelligence was exhibited she appreciated her duty to her marriage oath 'my husband's honour is quite safe with me' neither england nor religion nor woman's proper devotion to a husband's temporal and spiritual welfare had claims rivalling her devotion to her brother she could not explain a devotion that instigated her to an insensate course it seemed a kind of enthusiasm and it was coldly spoken in the tone referring to 'her husband's honour' her brother's enterprise had her approval because 'her mother's prayer was for him to serve in the english army' by running over to take a side in a spanish squabble she was asked and answered 'he will learn war my chillon will show his value he will come back a tried soldier' she counted on his coming back she did 'i cannot take a step forward without counting on success we know the chances we are to meet my father has written of death we do not fear it so it is nothing to us we shall go together we shall not have to weep for one another' the strange young woman's avoidance of any popular sniffle of the pathetic had a recognized merit 'tell me' lady arpington said abruptly 'this maid of yours who is to marry the secretary or whatever he was you are satisfied with her' 'she is my dear servant madge' a cloud opened as carinthia spoke the name 'she will be a true wife to him they will always be my friends' nothing against the earl in that direction apparently unless his countess was blest with the density of frigidity society's emissary sketched its perils for unprotected beautiful woman an outline of the london quadrille henrietta danced in and she glanced at carinthia and asked 'have you thought of it' carinthia's eyes were on the great lady's their meaning was 'you hit my chief thought' they were read as her farthest thought for the hint of henrietta's weakness deadened her feelings with a reminder of warm and continued solicitations rebutted the beautiful creature's tortures at the idea of her exile from england an outwearied hopelessness expressed a passive sentiment very like indifference in the clear wide gaze she replied 'i have my proposal to her was cadiz with both our young ones she will not' and there is an end to that part of the question lady arpington interpreted it by the gaze more than the words under subjection of the young woman's character nevertheless she bore away carinthia's consent to a final meeting with the earl at her house in london as soon as things were settled at croridge chillon whom she saw was just as hard unforgiving careless of his country's dearest interests brother and sister were one heart of their one blood she mentioned the general impression in town that the countess and only she could save the earl from rome a flash of polite laughter was chillon's response but after her inspection of the elegant athlete she did fancy it possible for a young wife even for henrietta to bear his name proudly in his absence if that was worth a moment's consideration beside the serious issues involved in her appeal to the countess especially when the suggestion regarding young wives left unprotected delicately conveyed to the husband had failed of its purpose the handsome husband's brows fluttered an interrogation as if her clear obscure should be further lighted and it could not be done he weighed the wife by the measure of the sister perhaps or his military head had no room for either his callousness to the danger of his country's disintegration from the incessant becoming overt attacks of a foreign priesthood might an indignant great lady's precipitation to prophecy said would bring chastisement on him she said it and she liked henrietta vowing to defeat her forecast as well as she could in a land seeming forsaken by stable principles its nobles breaking up its national church going over to rome embracing the faith of the impostor mahomet gossip fed to the starvation bone of lady arpington's report until one late afternoon memorable for the breeding heat in the van of elemental artillery newsboys waved damp sheets of fresh print through the streets and society's guardians were brought to confess in shame and gladness that they had been growing sceptical of the active assistance of providence at first the 'terrible explosion of gunpowder at croridge' alarmed them lest the timely power should have done too much a day later the general agitation was pacified lady arpington circulated the word 'safe' and the world knew the disaster had not engulphed lady fleetwood's valuable life she had the news by word of mouth from the lovely mrs kirby levellier sister in law to the countess we are convinced we have proof of providence intervening when some terrific event of the number at its disposal accomplishes the thing and no more than the thing desired pitiful though it may seem for a miserly old lord to be blown up in his bed it is necessarily a subject of congratulation if the life or poor remnant of a life sacrificed was an impediment to our righteous wishes but this is a theme for the dame who would full surely have committed another breach of the treaty had there not been allusion to her sisterhood's view of the government of human affairs on the day preceding the catastrophe chillon's men returned to work he and carinthia and mr wythan lunched with henrietta at stoneridge walking down to lekkatts they were astounded to see the figure of the spectral old lord on the plank to the powder store clad in his long black cloak erect he was crossing he told them to count his barrels a dream had disturbed him chillon fell to rapid talk upon various points of business and dispersed lord levellier's memory relating to his errand leaning on carinthia's arm he went back to the house where he was put to bed in peace of mind his resuscitated physical vigour blocked all speculation for the young people assembled at stoneridge that night they hardly spoke they strangled thoughts forming as larvae of wishes henrietta would be away to lady arpington's next day mr wythan to wales the two voyagers were sadder by sympathy than the two whom they were leaving to the clock's round of desert sameness about ten at night chillon and mr wythan escorted carinthia for the night's watch beside her uncle down to lekkatts it was midway that the knocks on air as of a muffled mallet at a door and at farther doors of caverns smote their ears and shook the ground after an instant of the silence following a shock carinthia touched her brother's arm and chillon said 'not my powder' they ran till they had lekkatts in sight a half moon showed the house it stood fifty paces below a column of opal smoke had begun to wreathe and stretch a languid flag the 'rouse' promised to lord levellier by daniel charner's humorous mates had hit beyond its aim intended to give him a start or 'one er in return' it surpassed his angry shot at the body of them in effect carinthia entered his room and saw that he was lying stretched restfully she whispered of this to chillon and began upon her watch reading her spanish phrasebook and she could have wept if she had been a woman for tears her duty to stay in england with chillon's fair wife crossed the beckoning pages like a black smoke her passion to go and share her brother's dangers left the question of its righteousness at each fall of the big breath her uncle's grey head on his pillow was like a flintstone in chalk under her look by light of dawn the chin had dropped chapter xlvi a chapter of undercurrents and some surface flashes thus a round and a good old english practical repartee worthy a place in england's book of her historical popular jests conceived ingeniously no bit murderously even humanely if englishmen are to be allowed indulgence of a jolly hit back for an injury more a feint than a real stroke gave the miserly veteran his final quake and cut chillon's knot lord levellier dead of the joke detracted from the funny idea there had been in the anticipation of his hearing the libertine explosion of his grand new powder and coming out cloaked to see what walls remained upright its cleverness however was magnified by the shades into which it had despatched him the man who started the 'rouse for old griphard' was named nor did he shuffle his honours off chillon accused him and he regretfully grinned he would have owned to it eloquently excited by the extreme ingenuity but humour at the criminal bar is an abject thing that has to borrow from metaphysics for the expository words he lacked them entirely and as he could not fronting his master supply the defect with oaths he drew up and let out on the dead old lord who wanted a few pounds of blasting powder like anything else in everybody's way chillon expected the lowest of his countrymen to show some degree of chivalry upon occasions like the present he was too young to perceive how it is that a block of our speech in the needed direction drives it storming in another not the one closely expressing us carinthia liked the man she was grieved to hear of his having got the sack summarily when he might have had a further month of service or a month's pay had not the workmen's forbearance been much tried and they had not stolen they had bought the powder only intending to startle she touched her brother's native sense of fairness and vexed him with his cowardly devil of impatience which kicked at a simply stupid common man and behaved to a lordly offender smelling rascal civilly just as her father would have treated the matter she said 'are we sorry for what has happened chillon' the man had gone the injustice was done the master was left to reflect on the part played by his inheritance of the half share of ninety thousand pounds in his proper respect for lord levellier's memory harsh to an inferior is a horrible charge but the position of debtor to a titled cur brings a worse for endurance knowing a part of lord fleetwood's message to lord levellier suppressed the bride's brother her chief guardian had treated the omission as of no importance and had all the while understood that he ought to give her his full guess at the reading of it or so his racked mind understood it now his old father had said a dumb tongue can be a heavy liar and lies are usurers' coin we pay for ten thousand per cent his harshness in the past hour to a workman who had suffered with him and had not intended serious mischief was chillon's unsounded motive for the resolution to be out of debt to the man he loathed there is a muse that smiles aloft surveying our acts from the well springs carinthia heard her brother's fuller version of the earl's communication to her uncle before the wild day of her marriage 'not particularly fitted for the married state' chillon phrased it saying 'he seems to have known himself he was honest so far' she was advised to think it over that the man was her husband she had her brother's heart in her breast she could not misread him she thought it over and felt a slight drag of compassion for the reluctant bridegroom that was a stretch long leagues distant from love with her the sort of feeling one has for strange animals hurt and she had in her childish blindness done him a hurt and he had bitten her he was a weak young nobleman he had wealth for a likeness of strength he had no glory about his head why had he not chosen a woman to sit beside him who would have fancied his coronet a glory and his luxury a kindness but the poor young nobleman did not choose the sadly comic of his keeping to the pledge of his word his real wife the tyrant of the tyrant clothed him the vision of him at the altar and on the coach and at the royal sovereign inn and into the dimness where a placidly smiling recollection met a curtain and lost the smile suppose that her duty condemned her to stay in england on guard over chillon's treasure the perpetual struggle with a weak young nobleman of aimless tempers and rightabout changes pretending to the part of husband would she foresaw raise another figure of duty enchaining a weak young woman the world supported his pretension and her passion to serve as chillon's comrade sank at a damping because it was flame chillon had done that lady arpington to some extent henrietta more a little incident pointing in no direction had left a shadow of a cloud consequent upon lady arpington's mention of henrietta's unprotectedness stepping up the hill to meet her sister on the morning of henrietta's departure for london under the convoy of mr wythan carinthia's long sight spied kit ines or a man like him in the meadow between lekkatts and croridge he stood before henrietta and vanished light legged at a gesture henrietta was descending to take her leave of her busied husband her cheeks were flushed she would not speak of the fellow except to reply 'oh a beggar' and kept asking whether she ought not to stay at stoneridge and if she did she would lose the last of the opera in london how could she help to investigate the cause of an explosion so considerate to them she sang snatches of melodies clung to her husband protested her inability to leave him and went appearing torn away as well bid healthy children lie abed on a bright summer morning as think of holding this fair young woman bound to the circle of safety when she has her view of pleasure sparkling like the shore sea mermaid's mirror suspicions were not of the brood carinthia's bosom harboured suspicion of chillon's wife carinthia could not feel an uncaptained vessel in the winds on high seas was imagined without a picturing of it the apparition of ives if it was he would not fit with any conjecture she sent a warning to madge and at the same time named the girl's wedding day for her pained in doing it she had given the dear girl her word that she would be present at this of all marriages but a day or two days or more would have to be spent away from chillon and her hunger for every hour beside her brother confessed to the war going on within her as to which was her holier duty the one on the line of her inclinations or that one pointing to luxury choice between a battle horse and a cushioned chair between companionship with her glorious brother facing death and submission to a weak young nobleman claiming his husband's rights over her she had submitted had forgotten his icy strangeness had thought him love and hers was a breast for love it was owned by the sobbing rise of her breast at the thought and she might submit again in honour scorning the husband chillon scorned him yet chillon left the decision to her specified his excuses and henrietta and owain lady arpington gower woodseer all the world carinthia shuddered at the world's blank eye on what it directs for the acquiescence of the woman that shred of herself she would become she felt herself becoming it when the view of her career beside her brother waned the dead rebecca living in her heart was the only soul among her friends whose voice was her own against the world's but there came a turn where she and rebecca separated rebecca's insurgent wishes taking shape of prophecy robbed her of her friend owain to present her an impossible object that her mind could not compass or figure she bade rebecca rest and let her keep the fancy of owain as her good ghost of a sun in the mist of a frosty morning sweeter to her than an image of love though it were the very love the love of maidens' dreams bursting the bud of romance issuing its flower delusive love drove away with a credulous maiden under an english heaven on a coach and four from a windy hill top to a crash below and a stunned recovery in the street of small shops mud rain gloom language like musket fire and the wailing wounded no regrets her father had said they unman the heart we want for to morrow she kept her look forward at the dead wall chillon had thrown up he did not reject her company his prospect of it had clouded and there were allusions to henrietta's loneliness 'his carin could do her service by staying if she decided that way' her enthusiasm dropped to the level of life's common ground with her sustainment gone she beheld herself a titled doll and had sternly to shut her eyes on the behind scenes bar any shadowy approaches of womanly softness thinking her father's daughter dishonoured in the submissive wife of the weak young nobleman chillon despised as below the title of man madge and gower came to stoneridge on their road to london three days before their union madge had no fear of ines but said 'i never let mr gower out of my sight' perforce of studying him with the thirsty wonder consequent upon his proposal to her she had got fast hold of the skirts of his character she 'knew he was happy because he was always making her laugh at herself' her manner of saying 'she hoped to give him a comfortable home so that he might never be sorry for what he had done' was toned as in a church beautiful to her mistress speaking of my lord's great kindness her eyes yearned for a second and fell humbly she said of kit ives 'he's found a new paytron sarah says mr woodseer tells her my lady it's another nobleman lord brailstone has come into money lately and hired him for his pugilist when it's not horseracing' gower spoke of thanks to lord fleetwood for the independence allowing him to take a wife and settle to work in his little surrey home he too showed he could have said more and was advised not to push at a shut gate my lord would attend their wedding as well as my lady carinthia heard from madge counting it a pity that wealthy noblemen had no professions to hinder the doing of unprofitable things her sensibility was warmer on the wedding day of these two dear ones he graced the scene she admitted when reassured by his perfect reserve toward her personally he was the born nobleman in his friendliness with the bridal pair and respectfulness to mr woodseer high social breeding is an exquisite performance on the instrument we are and his behaviour to her left her mind at liberty for appreciation of it condescension was not seen his voice had no false note during the ceremony his eyelids blinked rapidly at the close he congratulated the united couple praising them each for the wisdom of their choice he said to his countess 'this is one of the hopeful marriages chiefly of your making' she replied 'my prayers will be for them always' 'they are fortunate who have your prayers' he said and turned to sarah winch she was to let him know when she also had found her 'great philosopher' sarah was like a fish on a bank taking gasps at the marvel of it all she blushed the pale pink of her complexion and murmured of 'happiness' gower had gone headlong into happiness where philosophers are smirkers and mouthers of ordinary stuff his brightest remark was to put the question to his father 'the three good things of the isle of britain' and treble the name of madge woodseer for a richer triad than the glamorgan man could summon pardonably foolish but mindful of a past condition of indiscipline nature's philosopher said to the old minister 'your example saved me for this day at a turn of my road sir' nature's poor wild scholar paid that tribute to the regimental sectarian enough for proud philosophy to have done the thing demonstrably right gower's look at his madge and the world said that 'european rose of the coal black order' as one of his numerous pictures of her painted the girl was a torch in a cavern for dusky redness at her cheeks her responses beneath the book mr woodseer held open had flashed a distant scene through lord fleetwood quaint to notice was her reverence for the husband she set on a towering monument and her friendly wifely whispered jogs at the unpractical creature's forgetfulness of his wraps his books his writing desk on this tremendous occasion his pipe again the earl could have sworn that despite her antecedents she brought her husband honest dower as surely as she gave the lucky pagan a whole heart and had a remarkably fine bust to house the organ too and a clarionet of a voice curiously like her mistress's and not a bad fellow but a heathen dog a worshipper of nature walked off with the girl whose voice had the ring of carinthia's the powers do not explain their dispensations these two now one by united good will for the junction lord fleetwood himself drove through loudon to the hills where another carriage awaited them by his orders in the town of london's race course as soon as they were seated he nodded to them curtly from his box and drove back leaving them puzzled but his countess had not so very coldly seen him start his horses to convey the modest bridal pair his impulses to kindness could be politic before quitting whitechapel she went with sarah to look at the old shop of the fruits and vegetables they found it shut untenanted mr woodseer told them that the earl was owner of it by recent purchase and would not lease it he had to say why for the countess was dull to the notion of a sentimental desecration in the occupying of her bedchamber by poor tradespeople she was little flattered the great nobleman of her imagination when she lay there dwindled to a whimsy infant despot of his nursery capricious with his toys likely to damage himself if left to himself how it might occur she heard hourly from her hostess lady arpington from henrietta as well in different terms he seemed to her no longer the stationed nobleman but one of other idle men and the saddest of young men his weakness cast a net on her worse than that drag of compassion she foresaw the chance of his having experience of her own weakness if she was to be one among idle women she might drop to the love of him again chillon's damping of her enthusiasm sank her to a mere breathing body miserably an animal body no comrade for a valiant brother this young man's feeble consort perhaps and a creature thirsting for pleasure disposed to sigh in the prospect of caresses enthusiasm gone her spirited imagination of active work on the field of danger beside her brother flapped a broken wing she fell too low in her esteem to charge it upon henrietta that she stood hesitating leaning on the hated side of the debate though she could almost have blamed chillon for refusing her his positive counsel and not ordering his wife to follow him once lady arpington reasoning with her on behalf of the husband who sought reconciliation sneered at her brother's project condemned it the more for his resolve to carry it out now that he had means the front of a shower sprang to carinthia's eyelids now that her brother had means he from whom she might be divided was alert to keep his engagement and study war on the field as his father had done in foreign service offering england a trained soldier should his country subsequently need him the contrast of her heroic brother and a luxurious idle lord scattering blood of bird or stag and despising the soldier's profession had a singular bitter effect consequent on her scorn of words to defend the man her heart idolized this last of young women for weeping wept in the lady's presence the feminine trick was pardoned to her because her unaccustomed betrayal of that form of enervation was desired it was read as woman's act of self pity over her perplexity which is a melting act with the woman when there is no man to be dissolved by it so far lady arpington judged rightly carinthia's tears shed at the thought of her brother under the world's false judgement of him left her spiritless to resist her husband's advocates unusual as they were almost unknown they were thunder drops and shook her all for the vivid surface the dame frets at stresses laid on undercurrents there is no bridling her unless the tale be here told of how lord brailstone in his frenzy of the disconcerted rival boasted over town the counterstroke he had dealt lord fleetwood by sending mrs levellier a statement of the latter nobleman's base plot to thwart her husband's wager with his foul agent the repentant and well paid ruffian in person to verify every written word the town's conception of the necessity for the reunion of the earl and countess was too intense to let exciting scandal prosper moreover the town's bright anticipation of its concluding festivity on the domain of calesford argued such tattle down to a baffled adorer's malice the countess of cressett having her cousin the beautiful mrs kirby levellier in her house has denied lord brailstone admission at her door we can affirm he has written to her vehemently has called a second time has vowed publicly that mrs levellier shall have her warning against lord fleetwood the madness of jealousy was exhibited lady arpington pronounced him in his conduct unworthy the name of gentleman and how foolish the scandal he circulates lord fleetwood's one aim is to persuade his offended wife to take her place beside him he expresses regret everywhere that the death of her uncle lord levellier withholds her presence from calesford during her term of mourning and that he has given his word for the fete on a particular day before london runs quite dry his pledge of his word is notoriously inviolate the countess of cressett an extraordinary instance of a thrice married woman corrected in her addiction to play by her alliance with a rakish juvenile declares she performs the part of hostess at the request of the countess of fleetwood perfectly convincing the more so if you have the gossips' keen scent of a deduction since lord fleetwood and young lord cressett and the jesuit lord feltre have been seen confabulating with very sacerdotal countenances indeed three english noblemen not counting eighty years for the whole three and dear lady cressett fears she may be called on to rescue her boy husband from a worse enemy than the green tables if lady fleetwood should unhappily prove unyielding as it shames the gentle sex to imagine she will be in fact we know through mrs levellier the meeting of reconciliation between the earl and the countess comes off at lady arpington's by her express arrangement to morrow 'none too soon' the expectant world of london declared it the meeting came to pass three days before the great day at calesford carinthia and her lord were alone together this had been his burning wish at croridge where he could have poured his heart to her and might have moved the wife's but she had formed her estimate of him there she had in the comparison or clash of forces with him grown to contemplate the young man of wealth and rank who had once been impatient of an allusion to her father and sought now to part her from her brother stop her breathing of fresh air sensationally too her ardour for the exercise of her inherited gifts attributed it to him that her father's daughter had lived the mean existence in england pursuing a husband hounded by a mother's terrors the influences environing her and pressing her to submission sharpened her perusal of the small object largely endowed by circumstances to demand it she stood calmly discoursing with a tempered smile no longer a novice in the social manner an equal whom he had injured waited for his remarks gave ready replies and he bowing to the visible equality chafed at a sense of inferiority following his acknowledgement of it he was alone with her and next to dumb she froze a full heart as for his heart it could not speak at all it was a swinging lump the rational view of the situation was exposed to her and she listened to that favourably or at least attentively but with an edge to her civil smile when he hinted of entertainments voyages travels an excursion to her native mountain land her brother would then be facing death the rational view she admitted was one to be considered yes they were married they had a son they were bound to sink misunderstandings in the interests of their little son he ventured to say that the child was a link uniting them and she looked at him he blinked rapidly as she had seen him do of late but kept his eyes on her through the nervous flutter of the lids his pride making a determined stand for physical mastery though her look was but a look had there been reproach in it he would have found the voice to speak out her look was a cold sky above a hungering man she froze his heart from the marble of her own and because she was for adventuring with her brother at bloody work of civil war in the pay of a foreign government he found a short refuge in that mute sneer and was hurled from it by an apparition of the welsh scene of the bitten infant and carinthia volunteering to do the bloody work which would have saved it which he had contested ridiculed right then her insanity now conjured the wretched figure of him opposing the martyr her splendid humaneness had offered her to be and dominated his reason subjected him to admire on to worship of the woman whatever she might do just such a feeling for a woman he had dreamed of in his younger time doubting that he would ever meet the fleshly woman to impose it his heart broke the frost she breathed yet if he gave way to the run of speech he knew himself unmanned and the fatal habit of superiority stopped his tongue after he had uttered the name he loved to speak as nearest to the embrace of her 'carinthia so i think as i said we both see the common sense of the position i regret over and over again we'll discuss all that when we meet after this calesford affair i shall have things to say you will overlook i am sure well men are men or try to perhaps i'm not worse than we'll say some you will i know i have learnt it be of great service help to me double my value i believe more than double it you will receive me here or at croridge or esslemont and alone together as now i beg' that was what he said having said it his escape from high tragics in the comfortable worldly tone rejoiced him to some extent also the courteous audience she gave him and her hand was not refused judging by her aspect the plain common sense ground of their situation was accepted for the best opening step to their union though she must have had her feelings beneath it and god knew that he had her hand was friendly he could have thanked her for yielding her hand without a stage scene she had fine breeding by nature the gracefullest of trained ladies could not have passed through such an interview so perfectly in the right key and this was the woman he had seen at the wrestle with hideous death to save a muddy street child she touched the gentleman in him hard as it was while he held the hand of the wife his little son's mother who might be called his bride and drew him by the contact of their blood to a memory seeming impossible some other world's attested reality she the angel he the demon of it unimaginable yet present palpable a fact beyond his mind he let her hand fall scarce pressed did she expect more than the common sense of it to be said the 'more' was due to her and should partly be said at their next meeting for the no further separating or else he would vow in his heart to spread it out over a whole life's course of wakeful devotion with here and there a hint of his younger black nature better that except for a desire seizing him to make sacrifice of the demon he had been offer him up hideously naked to her mercy but it was a thing to be done by hints by fits by small doses she could only gradually be brought to the comprehension of how the man or demon found indemnification under his yoke of marriage in snatching her to torment perhaps betray and solace for the hurt to his pride in spreading a snare for the beautiful henrietta a confession it could be to none but the priest knowledge of carinthia would have urged him to the confession straightway in spite of horror the task of helping to wash a black soul white would have been her compensation for loss of companionship with her soldier brother she would have held hot iron to the rabid wound and come to a love of the rescued sufferer it seemed to please her when he spoke of mr rose mackrell's applications to get back his volume of her father's book of maxims 'there is mine' she said for the sake of winning her quick gleam at any word of the bridal couple he conjured a picture of her madge and his gower saying 'that marriage as you will learn proves him honest from head to foot as she is in her way too' 'oh she is' was the answer 'we shall be driving down to them very soon carinthia' 'it will delight them to see either of us my lord' 'my lady adieu until i am over with this calesford' he gestured as in fetters she spared him the my lording as she said adieu sensitive as she was and to his perception now lady arpington had a satisfactory two minutes with him before he left the house london town on the great day at calesford interchanged communications to the comforting effect that the countess of fleetwood would reign over the next entertainment chapter xlvii the last with a concluding word by the dame it is of seemingly good augury for the cause of a suppliant man however little for the man himself when she who has much to pardon can depict him in a manner that almost smiles not unlike a dandling nurse the miniature man child sobbing off to sleep after a frenzy an example of a genus framed for excuses and he more than others chillon was amused up to inquisitive surprise by carinthia's novel idea of her formerly dreaded riddle of a husband as she sketched the very rational alliance proposed to her and his kick at the fetters of calesford a shadowy dash for an image of the solicitous tyrant was added perforce to complete the scene following which her head moved sharply the subject was flung over her shoulder she was developing she might hold her ground with the husband if the alliance should be resumed and she would be a companion for henrietta in england she was now independent as to money and she could break an intolerable yoke without suffering privation he kept his wrath under determined not to use his influence either way sure though he was of her old father's voting for her to quit the man and enter the field where qualities would be serviceable the man probably feared a scandal more than the loss of his wife in her going he had never been thrashed the sole apology chillon discovered for him in a flushed review of the unavenged list of injuries carinthia had sustained his wise old father insisted on the value of an early thrashing to trim and shape the growth of most young men there was no proof of lord fleetwood's having schemed to thwart his wager so he put that accusation by thinking for an instant that if the man desired to have his wife with him and she left the country with her brother his own act would recoil or if she stayed to hear of a villany carinthia's show of scorn could lash henrietta praised my lord's kindness he had been one of the adorers as what man would not be and upon her at least he could hardly love her husband he had not wreaked his disappointment a young man of huge wealth having nothing to do but fatten his whims is the monster a rich country breeds under the blessing of peace his wife if a match for him has her work traced out mean work for the child of their father chillon thought she might be doing braver more suitable to the blood in her veins but women have to be considered as women not as possible heroines and supposing she held her own with this husband of hers which meant judging by the view of their unfolded characters at present a certain command of the freakish beast she whatever her task would not be the one set trotting he came to his opinion through the estimate he had recently formed of lord fleetwood and a study of his changed sister her brows gloomed at a recurrence to that subject their business of the expedition absorbed her each detail all the remarks he quoted of his chief hopeful or weariful for difficulties with the spanish government and with the english too started up at every turn and the rank and file of the contingent were mostly a rough lot where they were rather better than soaked weeds a small body of trained soldiers had sprung to the call to arms here and there an officer could wheel a regiment carinthia breasted discouragement 'english learn from blows chillon' 'he might have added they lose half their number by having to learn from blows carin' 'he said let me lead britons' 'when the canteen's fifty leagues to the rear yes' 'yes it is a wine country' she sighed 'but would the spaniards have sent for us if their experience told them they could not trust us' chillon brightened rigorously 'yes yes there's just a something about our men at their best hard to find elsewhere we're right in thinking that and our chief 's the right man' 'he is owain's friend and countryman' said carinthia and pleased her brother for talking like a girl in the midst of methodical calculations of the cost of this and that to purchase the supplies he would need she had an organizing head on her way down from london she had drawn on instructions from a london physician of old peninsula experience to pencil a list of the medical and surgical stores required by a campaigning army she had gained information of the london shops where they were to be procured she had learned to read medical prescriptions for the composition of drugs she was at her spanish still not behind him in the ordinary dialogue and able to correct him on points of spanish history relating to fortresses especially the basque a french bookseller had supplied her with the vicomte d'eschargue's recently published volume of a travels in catalonia chillon saw paragraphs marked pages dog eared for reference at the same time the question of henrietta touched her anxiously lady arpington's hints had sunk into them both 'i have thought of st jean de luz chillon if riette would consent to settle there french people are friendly you expect most of your work in and round the spanish pyrenees' 'riette alone there' said he and drew her by her love of him into his altered mind for he did not object to his wife's loneliness at cadiz when their plan was new london had taught her that a young woman in the giddy heyday of her beauty has to be guarded her belonging to us is the proud burden involving sacrifices but at st jean de luz if riette would consent to reside there lord fleetwood's absence and the neighbourhood of the war were reckoned on to preserve his yokefellow from any fit of the abominated softness which she had felt in one premonitory tremor during their late interview and deemed it vile compared with the life of action and service beside almost beside her brother sharing his dangers at least she would have had chillon speak peremptorily to his wife regarding the residence on the spanish borders adding in a despair 'and me with her to protect her' 'unfair to riette if she can't decide voluntarily' he said all he refrained from was the persuading her to stay in england and live reconciled with the gaoler of the dungeon as her feelings pictured it chillon and carinthia journeyed to london for purchases and a visit to lawyer banker and tradesmen on their way to meet his chief and owain wythan at southampton they lunched with livia the morrow was the great calesford day henrietta carolled of it lady arpington had been afllictingly demure on the theme of her presence at calesford within her term of mourning 'but i don't mourn and i'm not related to the defunct and i can't be denied the pleasure invented for my personal gratification' henrietta's happy flippancy pouted at the prudish objections moreover the adored columelli was to be her slave of song the termination of the london season had been postponed a whole week for calesford the utmost possible strain and her presence was understood to represent the countess of fleetwood temporarily in decorous retirement chillon was assured by her that the earl had expressed himself satisfied with his wife's reasonableness 'the rest will follow' pleading on the earl's behalf was a vain effort but she had her grounds for painting lord fleetwood's present mood to his countess in warm colours 'nothing short of devotion chillon' london's extreme anxiety to see them united and the cause of it the immense good janey could do to her country should certainly be considered by her henrietta said she spoke feverishly a mention of st jean de luz for a residence inflicted it appeared a more violent toothache than she had suffered from the proposal of quarters in cadiz and now her husband had money she suggested his reinstatement in the english army chillon hushed that his chief had his word besides he wanted schooling in war why had he married his love for her was the answer and her beauty argued for the love but possessing her he was bound to win her a name so his reasoning ran to an accord with his military instincts and ambition nevertheless the mournful strange fact she recalled that they had never waltzed together since they were made one troubled his countenance in the mirror of hers instead of the waltz grief low worries dulness an eclipse of her had been the beautiful creature's portion it established mighty claims to a young husband's indulgence she hummed a few bars of his favourite old viennese waltz with 'chillon' invitingly and reproachfully his loathing of lord fleetwood had to withstand an envious jump at the legs in his vison of her partner on the morrow he said 'you'll think of some one absent' 'you really do wish me to go my darling it is chillon's wish' she begged for the words she had them and then her feverishness abated to a simple sparkling composure carinthia had observed her she was heart sick under pressure of thoughts the heavier for being formless they signified in the sum her doom to see her brother leave england for the war and herself crumble to pieces from the imagined figure of herself beside him on or near the field they could not be phrased for they accused the beloved brother of a weakness in the excessive sense of obligation to the beautiful woman who had wedded him driving down to southampton by the night coach her tenderness toward henrietta held other thoughts unshaped except one that moved in its twilight murmuring of how the love of pleasure keeps us blind children and how the innocents are pushed by it to snap at wicked bait which the wealthy angle with pointed a charitable index on some of our social story the countess livia not an innocent like henrietta had escaped the poisoned tongues by contracting a third marriage 'in time' lady arpington said and the knotty question was presented to a young mind why are the innocents tempted to their ruin and the darker natures allowed an escape any street boy could have told her of the virtue in quick wits but her unexercised reflectiveness was on the highroad of accepted doctrines with their chorus of the moans of gossips for supernatural intervention to give us justice she had not learnt that those innocents pushed by an excessive love of pleasure are for the term lower in the scale than their wary darker cousins and must come to the diviner light of intelligence through suffering however the result of her meditations was to show her she was directed to be henrietta's guardian after that she had no thoughts travelling beside chillon she was sheer sore feeling as of a body aching for its heart plucked out the bitterness of the separation to come between them prophesied a tragedy she touched his hand it was warm now during six days of travels from port to port along the southern and western coasts she joined in the inspection of the english contingent about to be shipped they and their chief and her brother were plain to sight like sample print of a book's first page blank sheets for the rest of the volume if she might have been one among them she would have dared the reckless forecast her sensations were those of a bird that has flown into a room and beats wings against the ceiling and the window panes a close hard sky a transparent prison wall narrowed her powers mocked her soul she spoke little what she said impressed chillon's chief owain wythan was glad to tell her the good friend had gone counter to the tide of her breast by showing satisfaction with the prospect that she would take her rightful place in the world her concentrated mind regarded the good friend as a phantom of a man the world's echo his dead rebecca would have understood her passion to be her brother's comrade her abasement in the staying at home to guard his butterfly owain had never favoured her project he could not now perceive the special dangers chillon would be exposed to in her separation from him she had no means of explaining what she felt intensely that dangers death were nothing to either of them if they shared the fate together her rejected petition to her husband for an allowance of money on the day in wales became the vivid memory which brings out motives in its glow her husband hated her brother and why but the answer was lighted fierily down another avenue a true husband a lord of wealth would have rejoiced to help the brother of his wife he was the cause of chillon's ruin and this adventure to restore his fortunes could she endure a close alliance with the man while her brother's life was imperilled carinthia rebuked her drowsy head for not having seen his reason for refusing at the time 'how long i am before i see anything that does not stare in my face' she was a married woman whose order of mind rendered her singularly subject to the holiness of the tie and she was a weak woman she feared already at intervals now that action on a foreign field of the thunders and lightnings was denied imagination revealed her dissolving to the union with her husband and cried her comment on herself as the world's basest of women for submitting to it while chillon's life ran risks until finally she said 'not before i have my brother home safe' an exclamation equal to a vow that being settled some appearance of equanimity returned she talked of the scarlet business as one she participated in as a distant spectator chillon's chief was hurrying the embarkation of his troops within ten days the whole expedition would be afloat she was to post to london for further purchases he following to take leave of his wife and babe curiously but hardly remarked on during the bustle of work livia had been the one to send her short account of the great day at calesford henrietta the born correspondent pencilling a couple of lines she was well dreadfully fatigued rather a fright from a trip of her foot and fall over a low wire fence her message of love thrice underlined the repeated word henrietta was the last person carinthia would have expected to meet midway on the london road her name was called from a carriage as she drove up to the door of the winchester hostlery and in the lady over whose right eye and cheek a covering fold of silk concealed a bandage the voice was her sister riette's with her were two babes and their nursemaids 'chillon is down there you have left him there' henrietta greeted her saw the reply and stepped out of her carriage 'you shall kiss the children afterwards come into one of the rooms janey' alone together before an embrace she said in the voice of tears hardening to the world's business 'chillon must not enter london you see the figure i am my character's in as bad case up there thanks to those men my husband has lost his golden riette when you see beneath the bandage he will have the right to put me away his beauty of beauties i'm fit only to dress as a page boy and run at his heels my hero my poor dear he thinking i cared for nothing but amusement flattery was ever a punishment so cruel to the noblest of generous husbands because i know he will overlook it make light of it never reproach his riette and the rose he married comes to him a shrivelled leaf of a potpourri heap you haven't seen me yet i was their beautiful woman i feel for my husband most' she took breath carinthia pressed her lips on the cheek sensible to a hiss and henrietta pursued in words liker to sobs 'anywhere cadiz st jean de luz hospital work either anywhere my husband likes anything i want to work or i'll sit and rock the children i'm awake at last janey we're lambs to vultures with those men i don't pretend i was the perfect fool i thought myself so safe i let one of them squeeze my hand one day he swears you know what a passion is you have it for mountains and battles i for music i do remember one morning before sunrise driving back to town out of windsor a dance the officers of the guards and my lord's trumpeter at the back of the coach blowing notes to melt a stone i found a man's hand had mine i remember lord fleetwood looking over his shoulder and smiling hard and lashing his horses but listen yes at calesford it happened he oh hear the name then chillon must never hear it lord brailstone was denied the right to step on lord fleetwood's grounds the opera company had finished selections from my pirata i went out for cool air little sir meeson beside me i had a folded gauze veil over my head tied at the chin in a bow some one ran up to me lord brailstone he poured forth their poetry they suppose it the wine for their beautiful woman i dare say i laughed or told him to go and he began a tirade against lord fleetwood there's no mighty difference between one beast of prey and another let me get away from them all though now they would not lift an eyelid this is my husband's treasure returning to him we have to be burnt to come to our senses janey oh you do well it was fiendish old ballads melodrama plays i see they were built on men's deeds janey i could not believe it i have to believe it is forced down my throat that man your husband because he could not forgive my choosing chillon schemed for chillon's ruin i could not believe it until i saw in the glass this disfigured wretch he has made of me livia serves him she hates him for the tyrant he is she has opened my eyes and not for himself no for his revenge on me for my name to be as my face is he tossed me to his dogs fair game for them you do well janey he is capable of any villany and has been calling at livia's door twice a day inquiring anxiously begs the first appointment possible he has no shame he is accustomed to buy men and women he thinks his money will buy my pardon give my face a new skin perhaps a woman swears to you janey by all she holds holy on earth it is not the loss of her beauty there will be a wrinkled patch on the cheek for life the surgeon says i am to bear a brown spot like a bruised peach they sell at the fruit shops cheap chillon's riette i think of that the miserable wife i am for him without the beauty he loved so i think of myself as guilty a really guilty woman when i compare my loss with my husband's' 'your accident dearest riette how it happened' carinthia said enfolding her 'because janey what have i ever been to chillon but the good looking thing he was proud of it's gone oh the accident brailstone had pushed little corby away he held my hand kept imploring he wanted the usual two minutes and all to warn me against i've told you and he saw lord fleetwood coming i got my hand free and stepped back my head spinning and i fell that i recollect and a sight of flames like the end of the world i fell on one of the oil lamps bordering the grass my veil lighted i had fainted those two men saw nothing but one another and little sir meeson was no help young lord cressett dashed out the flames they brought me to my senses for a second swoon livia says i woke moaning to be taken away from that hated calesford it was oh never to see that husband of yours again forgive him if you can not i i carry the mark of him to my grave i have called myself skin deep ever since day and night the name i deserve' 'we will return to chillon together my own' said carinthia 'it may not be so bad' and in the hope that her lovely sister exaggerated a defacement leaving not much worse than a small scar her heart threw off its load of the recent perplexities daylight broke through her dark wood henrietta brought her liberty how far guilty her husband might be she was absolved from considering sufficiently guilty to release her upon that conclusion pity for the awakened riette shed purer tear drops through the gratitude she could not restrain could hardly conceal on her sister's behalf and her own henrietta's prompt despatch to croridge to fetch the babes her journey down out of a sick room to stop chillon's visit to london proved her an awakened woman well paid for the stain on her face though the stain were lasting never had she loved henrietta never shown her so much love as on the road to the deepening colours of the west her sisterly warmth surprised the woeful spotted beauty with a reflection that this martial janey was after all a woman of feeling one whom her husband if he came to know it and the depth of it the rich sound of it would mourn in sackcloth to have lost and he did the dame interposes for the final word he mourned his loss of carinthia jane in sackcloth and ashes notwithstanding that he had the world's affectionate condolences about him to comfort him by reason of his ungovernable countess's misbehaviour once more according to the report in running away with a young officer to take part in a foreign insurrection and when he was most the idol of his countrymen and countrywomen which it was once his immoderate aim to be he mourned her day and night knowing her spotless however wild a follower of her father's maxims for men he believed some have said his belief was not in error that the woman to aid and make him man and be the star in human form to him was miraculously revealed on the day of his walk through the foreign pine forest and his proposal to her at the ducal ball was an inspiration of his good genius continuing to his marriage morn and then running downwards like an overstrained reel under the leadership of his bad from turning to turning of that descent he saw himself advised to retrieve the fatal steps at each point attempting it just too late until too late by an hour he reached the seaport where his wife had embarked and her brother chillon john cruelly it was the common opinion refused him audience no syllable of the place whither she fled abroad was vouchsafed to him and his confessions of sins and repentance of them were breathed to empty air the wealthiest nobleman of all england stood on the pier watching the regiments of that doomed expedition mount ship ready with the bribe of the greater part of his possessions for a single word to tell him of his wife's destination lord feltre his companion has done us the service to make his emotions known he describes them true as the papist who sees every incident contribute to precipitate sinners into the bosom of his church but this we have warrant for saying did not occur before the earl had visited and strolled in the woods with his former secretary mr gower woodseer of whom so much has been told and he little better than an infidel declaring his aim to be at contentedness in life lord fleetwood might envy for a while he could not be satisfied with nature within six months of carinthia jane's disappearance people had begun to talk of strange doings at calesford and some would have it that it was the rehearsal of a play in which friars were prominent characters for there the frocked gentry were seen flitting across the ground then the world learnt too surely that the dreaded evil had happened its wealthiest nobleman had gone over to the church of rome carrying all his personal and unentailed estate to squander it on images and a dogma calesford was attacked by the mob one of the notorious riots in our history was a result of the amazing marriage and roused the talk of it again over great britain when carinthia jane after two years of adventures and perils rarely encountered by women returned to these shores she was they say most anxious for news of her husband and then indeed it has been conjectured they might have been united to walk henceforward as one for life but for the sad fact that the earl of fleetwood had two months and some days previously abjured his rank his remaining property and his title to become there is one report the brother russett of the mountain monastery he visited in simple curiosity once with his betraying friend lord feltre or some say and so it may truly be it was an amateur monastery established by him down among his welsh mountains in which he served as a simple brother without any authority over the priests or what not he paid to act as his superiors monk of some sort he would be he was never the man to stop at anything half way mr rose mackrell in his memoirs was the first who revealed to the world that the mademoiselle de levellier of the french count fighting with the carlists falsely claimed by him as a frenchwoman was in very truth carinthia jane the countess of fleetwood to whom carlists and legitimises alike were indebted for tender care of them on the field and in hospital and who rode from one camp through the other up to the tent of the pretender to the throne of spain bearing her petition for her brother's release which was granted in acknowledgement of her 'renowned humanity to both conflicting armies' as the words translated by dr glossop run certain it is she brought her wounded brother safe home to england and prisoners in that war usually had short shrift for three years longer she was the countess of fleetwood 'widow of a living suicide' mr rose mackrell describes the state of the marriage at that period no whisper of divorce did she tolerate six months after it was proved that brother russett had perished of his austerities or his heart we learn she said to the beseeching applicant for her hand mr owain wythan with the gift of it in compassion 'rebecca could foretell events' carinthia jane had ever been ashamed of second marriages and the union with her friend rebecca's faithful simpleton gave it one supposes a natural air for he as little as she had previously known the wedded state she married him henrietta has written because of his wooing her with dog's eyes instead of words the once famous beauty carried a wrinkled spot on her cheek to her grave a saving disfigurement and the mark of changes in the story told you enough to make us think it a providential intervention for such ends as were in view so much i can say the facts related with some regretted omissions by which my story has so skeleton a look are those that led to the lamentable conclusion but the melancholy the pathos of it the heart of all england stirred by it have been and the panting excitement it was to every listener sacrificed in the vain effort to render events as consequent to your understanding as a piece of logic through an exposure of character character must ever be a mystery only to be explained in some degree by conduct and that is very dependent upon accident and unless we have a perpetual whipping of the tender part of the reader's mind interest in invisible persons must needs flag for it is an infant we address and the storyteller whose art excites an infant to serious attention succeeds best with english people assuredly i rejoice to think though i have to pray their patience here while that philosophy and exposure of
