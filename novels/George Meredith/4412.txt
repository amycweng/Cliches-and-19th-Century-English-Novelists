chapter xl clares diary chapter xli austin returns chapter xlii nature speaks chapter xliii again the magian conflict chapter xliv the last scene chapter xlv lady blandish to austin wentworth chapter i some years ago a book was published under the title of the pilgrims scrip it consisted of a selection of original aphorisms by an anonymous gentleman who in this bashful manner gave a bruised heart to the world he made no pretension to novelty our new thoughts have thrilled dead bosoms he wrote by which avowal it may be seen that youth had manifestly gone from him since he had ceased to be jealous of the ancients there was a halfsigh floating through his pages for those days of intellectual coxcombry when ideas come to us affecting the embraces of virgins and swear to us they are ours alone and no one else have they ever visited and we believe them for an example of his ideas of the sex he said i expect that woman will be the last thing civilized by man some excitement was produced in the bosoms of ladies by so monstrous a scorn of them one adventurous person betook herself to the heralds college and there ascertained that a griffin between two wheatsheaves which stood on the titlepage of the book formed the crest of sir austin absworthy bearne feverel baronet of raynham abbey in a certain western county folding thames a man of wealth and honour and a somewhat lamentable history the outline of the baronets story was by no means new he had a wife and he had a friend his marriage was for love his wife was a beauty his friend was a sort of poet his wife had his whole heart and his friend all his confidence when he selected denzil somers from among his college chums it was not on account of any similarity of disposition between them but from his intense worship of genius which made him overlook the absence of principle in his associate for the sake of such brilliant promise denzil had a small patrimony to lead off with and that he dissipated before he left college thenceforth he was dependent upon his admirer with whom he lived filling a nominal post of bailiff to the estates and launching forth verse of some satiric and sentimental quality for being inclined to vice and occasionally and in a quiet way practising it he was of course a sentimentalist and a satirist entitled to lash the age and complain of human nature his earlier poems published under the pseudonym of diaper sandoe were so pure and bloodless in their love passages and at the same time so biting in their moral tone that his reputation was great among the virtuous who form the larger portion of the english bookbuying public electionseasons called him to balladpoetry on behalf of the tory party diaper possessed undoubted fluency but did little though sir austin was ever expecting much of him a languishing inexperienced woman whose husband in mental and in moral stature is more than the ordinary height above her and who now that her first romantic admiration of his lofty bearing has worn off and her fretful little refinements of taste and sentiment are not instinctively responded to is thrown into no wholesome household collision with a fluent man fluent in prose and rhyme lady feverel when she first entered on her duties at raynham was jealous of her husbands friend by degrees she tolerated him in time he touched his guitar in her chamber and they played rizzio and mary together for i am not the first who found the name of mary fatal says a subsequent sentimental alliterative lovepoem of diapers such was the outline of the story but the baronet could fill it up he had opened his soul to these two he had been noble love to the one and to the other perfect friendship he had bid them be brother and sister whom he loved and live a golden age with him at raynham in fact he had been prodigal of the excellences of his nature which it is not good to be and like timon he became bankrupt and fell upon bitterness the faithless lady was of no particular family an orphan daughter of an admiral who educated her on his halfpay and her conduct struck but at the man whose name she bore after five years of marriage and twelve of friendship sir austin was left to his loneliness with nothing to ease his heart of love upon save a little baby boy in a cradle he forgave the man he put him aside as poor for his wrath the woman he could not forgive she had sinned every way simple ingratitude to a benefactor was a pardonable transgression for he was not one to recount and crush the culprit under the heap of his good deeds but her he had raised to be his equal and he judged her as his equal she had blackened the worlds fair aspect for him in the presence of that world so different to him now he preserved his wonted demeanor and made his features a flexible mask mrs doria forey his widowed sister said that austin might have retired from his parliamentary career for a time and given up gaieties and that kind of thing her opinion founded on observation of him in public and private was that the light thing who had taken flight was but a feather on her brothers feverelheart and his ordinary course of life would be resumed there are times when common men cannot bear the weight of just so much hippias feverel one of his brothers thought him immensely improved by his misfortune if the loss of such a person could be so designated and seeing that hippias received in consequence free quarters at raynham and possession of the wing of the abbey she had inhabited it is profitable to know his thoughts if the baronet had given two or three blazing dinners in the great hall he would have deceived people generally as he did his relatives and intimates he was too sick for that fit only for passive acting the nursemaid waking in the night beheld a solitary figure darkening a lamp above her little sleeping charge and became so used to the sight as never to wake with a start one night she was strangely aroused by a sound of sobbing the baronet stood beside the cot in his long black cloak and travelling cap his fingers shaded a lamp and reddened against the fitful darkness that ever and anon went leaping up the wall she could hardly believe her senses to see the austere gentleman dead silent dropping tear upon tear before her eyes she lay stonestill in a trance of terror and mournfulness mechanically counting the tears as they fell one by one the hidden face the fall and flash of those heavy drops in the light of the lamp he held the upright awful figure agitated at regular intervals like a piece of clockwork by the low murderous catch of his breath it was so piteous to her poor human nature that her heart began wildly palpitating involuntarily the poor girl cried out to him oh sir and fell aweeping sir austin turned the lamp on her pillow and harshly bade her go to sleep striding from the room forthwith he dismissed her with a purse the next day once when he was seven years old the little fellow woke up at night to see a lady bending over him he talked of this the next day but it was treated as a dream until in the course of the day his uncle algernon was driven home from lobourne cricketground with a broken leg then it was recollected that there was a family ghost and though no member of the family believed in the ghost none would have given up a circumstance that testified to its existence for to possess a ghost is a distinction above titles algernon feverel lost his leg and ceased to be a gentleman in the guards of the other uncles of young richard cuthbert the sailor perished in a spirited boat expedition against a slaving negro chief up the niger some of the gallant lieutenants trophies of war decorated the little boys playshed at raynham and he bequeathed his sword to richard whose hero he was the diplomatist and beau vivian ended his flutterings from flower to flower by making an improper marriage as is the fate of many a beau and was struck out of the list of visitors algernon generally occupied the baronets disused townhouse a wretched being dividing his time between horse and card exercise possessed it was said of the absurd notion that a man who has lost his balance by losing his leg may regain it by sticking to the bottle at least whenever he and his brother hippias got together they never failed to try whether one leg or two stood the bottle best much of a puritan as sir austin was in his habits he was too good a host and too thorough a gentleman to impose them upon his guests the brothers and other relatives might do as they would while they did not disgrace the name and then it was final they must depart to behold his countenance no more algernon feverel was a simple man who felt subsequent to his misfortune as he had perhaps dimly fancied it before that his career lay in his legs and was now irrevocably cut short he taught the boy boxing and shooting and the arts of fence and superintended the direction of his animal vigour with a melancholy vivacity the remaining energies of algernons mind were devoted to animadversions on swift bowling he preached it over the county struggling through laborious literary compositions addressed to sporting newspapers on the decline of cricket it was algernon who witnessed and chronicled young richards first fight which was with young tom blaize of belthorpe farm three years the boys senior hippias feverel was once thought to be the genius of the family it was his ill luck to have strong appetites and a weak stomach and as one is not altogether fit for the battle of life who is engaged in a perpetual contention with his dinner hippias forsook his prospects at the bar and in the embraces of dyspepsia compiled his ponderous work on the fairy mythology of europe he had little to do with the hope of raynham beyond what he endured from his juvenile tricks a venerable lady known as greataunt grantley who had money to bequeath to the heir occupied with hippias the background of the house and shared her candles with him these two were seldom seen till the dinner hour for which they were all day preparing and probably all night remembering for the eighteenth century was an admirable trencherman and cast age aside while there was a dish on the table mrs doris foray was the eldest of the three sisters of the baronet a florid affable woman with fine teeth exceedingly fine light wavy hair a norman nose and a reputation for understanding men and that with these practical creatures always means the art of managing them she had married an expectant younger son of a good family who deceased before the fulfilment of his prospects and casting about in her mind the future chances of her little daughter and sole child clare she marked down a probability the far sight the deep determination the resolute perseverance of her sex where a daughter is to be provided for and a man to be overthrown instigated her to invite herself to raynham where with that daughter she fixed herself the other two feverel ladies were the wife of colonel wentworth and the widow of mr justice harley and the only thing remarkable about them was that they were mothers of sons of some distinction austin wentworths story was of that wretched character which to be comprehended that justice should be dealt him must be told out and openly which no one dares now do for a fault in early youth redeemed by him nobly according to his light he was condemned to undergo the worlds harsh judgment not for the faultfor its atonement married his mothers housemaid whispered mrs doria with a ghastly look and a shudder at young men of republican sentiments which he was reputed to entertain the compensation for injustice says the pilgrims scrip is that in that dark ordeal we gather the worthiest around us and the baronets fair friend lady blandish and some few true men and women held austin wentworth high he did not live with his wife and sir austin whose mind was bent on the future of our species reproached him with being barren to posterity while knaves were propagating the principal characteristic of the second nephew adrian harley was his sagacity he was essentially the wise youth both in counsel and in action in action the pilgrims scrip observes wisdom goes by majorities adrian had an instinct for the majority and as the world invariably found him enlisted in its ranks his appellation of wise youth was acquiesced in without irony the wise youth then had the world with him but no friends nor did he wish for those troublesome appendages of success he caused himself to be required by people who could serve him feared by such as could injure not that he went out of the way to secure his end or risked the expense of a plot he did the work as easily as he ate his daily bread adrian was an epicurean one whom epicurus would have scourged out of his garden certainly an epicurean of our modern notions to satisfy his appetites without rashly staking his character was the wise youths problem for life he had no intimates except gibbon and horace and the society of these fine aristocrats of literature helped him to accept humanity as it had been and was a supreme ironic procession with laughter of gods in the background why not laughter of mortals also adrian had his laugh in his comfortable corner he possessed peculiar attributes of a heathen god he was a disposer of men he was polished luxurious and happyat their cost he lived in eminent selfcontent as one lying on soft cloud lapt in sunshine nor jove nor apollo cast eye upon the maids of earth with cooler fire of selection or pursued them in the covert with more sacred impunity and he enjoyed his reputation for virtue as something additional stolen fruits are said to be sweet undeserved rewards are exquisite the best of it was that adrian made no pretences he did not solicit the favourable judgment of the world nature and he attempted no other concealment than the ordinary mask men wear and yet the world would proclaim him moral as well as wise and the pleasing converse every way of his disgraced cousin austin in a word adrian harley had mastered his philosophy at the early age of oneandtwenty many would be glad to say the same at that age twicetold they carry in their breasts a burden with which adrians was not loaded mrs doria was nearly right about his heart a singular mishap at his birth possibly or before it had unseated that organ and shaken it down to his stomach where it was a much lighter nay an inspiring weight and encouraged him merrily onward throned there it looked on little that did not arrive to gratify it already that region was a trifle prominent in the person of the wise youth and carried as it were the flag of his philosophical tenets in front of him he was charming after dinner with men or with women delightfully sarcastic perhaps a little too unscrupulous in his moral tone but that his moral reputation belied him and it must be set down to generosity of disposition such was adrian harley another of sir austins intellectual favourites chosen from mankind to superintend the education of his son at raynham adrian had been destined for the church he did not enter into orders he and the baronet had a conference together one day and from that time adrian became a fixture in the abbey his father died in his promising sons college term bequeathing him nothing but his legal complexion and adrian became stipendiary officer in his uncles household a playfellow of richards occasionally and the only comrade of his age that he ever saw was master ripton thompson the son of sir austins solicitor a boy without a character a comrade of some description was necessary for richard was neither to go to school nor to college sir austin considered that the schools were corrupt and maintained that young lads might by parental vigilance be kept pretty secure from the serpent until eve sided with him a period that might be deferred he said he had a system of education for his son how it worked we shall see chapter ii october shone royally on richards fourteenth birthday the brown beechwoods and golden birches glowed to a brilliant sun banks of moveless cloud hung about the horizon mounded to the west where slept the wind promise of a great day for raynham as it proved to be though not in the manner marked out already archerybooths and cricketingtents were rising on the lower grounds towards the river whither the lads of bursley and lobourne in boats and in carts shouting for a day of ale and honour jogged merrily to match themselves anew and pluck at the living laurel from each others brows like manly britons the whole park was beginning to be astir and resound with holiday cries sir austin feverel a thorough good tory was no gamepreserver and could be popular whenever he chose which sir males papworth on the other side of the river a fasthanded whig and terror to poachers never could be half the village of lobourne was seen trooping through the avenues of the park fiddlers and gipsies clamoured at the gates for admission white smocks and slate surmounted by hats of serious brim and now and then a scarlet cloak smacking of the old country dotted the grassy sweeps to the levels and all the time the star of these festivities was receding further and further and eclipsing himself with his reluctant serf ripton who kept asking what they were to do and where they were going and how late it was in the day and suggesting that the lads of lobourne would be calling out for them and sir austin requiring their presence without getting any attention paid to his misery or remonstrances for richard had been requested by his father to submit to medical examination like a boor enlisting for a soldier and he was in great wrath he was flying as though he would have flown from the shameful thought of what had been asked of him byandby he communicated his sentiments to ripton who said they were those of a girl an offensive remark remembering which richard after they had borrowed a couple of guns at the bailiffs farm and ripton had fired badly called his friend a fool feeling that circumstances were making him look wonderfully like one ripton lifted his head and retorted defiantly im not this angry contradiction so very uncalled for annoyed richard who was still smarting at the loss of the birds owing to riptons bad shot and was really the injured party he therefore bestowed the abusive epithet on ripton anew and with increase of emphasis you shant call me so then whether i am or not says ripton and sucks his lips this was becoming personal richard sent up his brows and stared at his defier an instant he then informed him that he certainly should call him so and would not object to call him so twenty times do it and see returns ripton rocking on his feet and breathing quick with a gravity of which only boys and other barbarians are capable richard went through the entire number stressing the epithet to increase the defiance and avoid monotony as he progressed while ripton bobbed his head every time in assent as it were to his comrades accuracy and as a record for his profound humiliation the dog they had with them gazed at the extraordinary performance with interrogating wags of the tail twenty times duly and deliberately richard repeated the obnoxious word at the twentieth solemn iteration of riptons capital shortcoming ripton delivered a smart backhander on richards mouth and squared precipitately perhaps sorry when the deed was done for he was a kindhearted lad and as richard simply bowed in acknowledgment of the blow he thought he had gone too far he did not know the young gentleman he was dealing with richard was extremely cool shall we fight here he said anywhere you like replied ripton a little more into the wood i think we may be interrupted and richard led the way with a courteous reserve that somewhat chilled riptons ardour for the contest on the skirts of the wood richard threw off his jacket and waistcoat and quite collected waited for ripton to do the same the latter boy was flushed and restless older and broader but not so tightlimbed and wellset the gods sole witnesses of their battle betted dead against him richard had mounted the white cockade of the feverels and there was a look in him that asked for tough work to extinguish his brows slightly lined upward at the temples converging to a knot about the wellset straight nose his full grey eyes open nostrils and planted feet and a gentlemanly air of calm and alertness formed a spirited picture of a young combatant as for ripton he was all abroad and fought in schoolboy stylethat is he rushed at the foe head foremost and struck like a windmill he was a lumpy boy when he did hit he made himself felt but he was at the mercy of science to see him come dashing in blinking and puffing and whirling his arms abroad while the felling blow went straight between them you perceived that he was fighting a fight of desperation and knew it for the dreaded alternative glared him in the face that if he yielded he must look like what he had been twenty times calumniously called and he would die rather than yield and swing his windmill till he dropped poor boy he dropped frequently the gallant fellow fought for appearances and down he went the gods favour one of two parties prince turnus was a noble youth but he had not pallas at his elbow ripton was a capital boy he had no science he could not prove he was not a fool when one comes to think of it ripton did choose the only possible way and we should all of us have considerable difficulty in proving the negative by any other ripton came on the unerring fist again and again and if it was true as he said in short colloquial gasps that he required as much beating as an egg to be beaten thoroughly a fortunate interruption alone saved our friend from resembling that substance the boys heard summoning voices and beheld mr morton of poer hall and austin wentworth stepping towards them a truce was sounded jackets were caught up guns shouldered and off they trotted in concert through the depths of the wood not stopping till that and halfadozen fields and a larch plantation were well behind them when they halted to take breath there was a mutual study of faces riptons was much discoloured and looked fiercer with its natural warpaint than the boy felt nevertheless he squared up dauntlessly on the new ground and richard whose wrath was appeased could not refrain from asking him whether he had not really had enough never shouts the noble enemy well look here said richard appealing to common sense im tired of knocking you down ill say youre not a fool if youll give me your hand ripton demurred an instant to consult with honour who bade him catch at his chance he held out his hand there and the boys grasped hands and were fast friends ripton had gained his point and richard decidedly had the best of it so they were on equal ground both could claim a victory which was all the better for their friendship ripton washed his face and comforted his nose at a brook and was now ready to follow his friend wherever he chose to lead they continued to beat about for birds the birds on the raynham estates were found singularly cunning and repeatedly eluded the aim of these prime shots so they pushed their expedition into the lands of their neighbors in search of a stupider race happily oblivious of the laws and conditions of trespass unconscious too that they were poaching on the demesne of the notorious farmer blaize the freetrade farmer under the shield of the papworths no worshipper of the griffin between two wheatsheaves destined to be much allied with richards fortunes from beginning to end farmer blaize hated poachers and especially young chaps poaching who did it mostly from impudence he heard the audacious shots popping right and left and going forth to have a glimpse at the intruders and observing their size swore he would teach my gentlemen a thing lords or no lords richard had brought down a beautiful cockpheasant and was exulting over it when the farmers portentous figure burst upon them cracking an avenging horsewhip his salute was ironical havin good sport gentlemen are ye just bagged a splendid bird radiant richard informed him oh farmer blaize gave an admonitory flick of the whip just let me clap eye ont then say please interposed ripton who was not blind to doubtful aspects farmer blaize threw up his chin and grinned grimly please to you sir why my chap you looks as if ye didnt much mind what come tyer nose i reckon you looks an old poacher you do tall ye what tis he changed his banter to business that birds mine now you jest hand him over and sheer off you dam young scoundrels i know ye and he became exceedingly opprobrious and uttered contempt of the name of feverel richard opened his eyes if you wants to be horsewhipped youll stay where yare continued the farmer giles blaize never stands nonsense then well stay quoth richard good so bet if you will havet havet my men as a preparatory measure farmer blaize seized a wing of the bird on which both boys flung themselves desperately and secured it minus the pinion thats your game cried the farmer heres a taste of horsewhip for ye i never stands nonsense and sweetch went the mighty whip well swayed the boys tried to close with him he kept his distance and lashed without mercy black blood was made by farmer blaize that day the boys wriggled in spite of themselves it was like a relentless serpent coiling and biting and stinging their young veins to madness probably they felt the disgrace of the contortions they were made to go through more than the pain but the pain was fierce for the farmer laid about from a practised arm and did not consider that he had done enough till he was well breathed and his ruddy jowl inflamed he paused to receive the remainder of the cockpheasant in his face take your beastly bird cried richard money my lads and interest roared the farmer lashing out again shameful as it was to retreat there was but that course open to them they decided to surrender the field look you big brute richard shook his gun hoarse with passion id have shot you if id been loaded mind if i come across you when im loaded you coward ill fire the unenglish nature of this threat exasperated farmer blaize and he pressed the pursuit in time to bestow a few farewell stripes as they were escaping tightbreeched into neutral territory at the hedge they parleyed a minute the farmer to inquire if they had had a mortal good tanning and were satisfied for when they wanted a further instalment of the same they were to come for it to belthorpe farm and there it was in pickle the boys meantime exploding in menaces and threats of vengeance on which the farmer contemptuously turned his back ripton had already stocked an armful of flints for the enjoyment of a little skirmishing richard however knocked them all out saying no gentlemen dont fling stones leave that to the blackguards just one shy at him pleaded ripton with his eye on farmer blaizes broad mark and his whole mind drunken with a sudden revelation of the advantages of light troops in opposition to heavies no said richard imperatively no stones and marched briskly away ripton followed with a sigh his leaders magnanimity was wholly beyond him a good spanking mark at the farmer would have relieved master ripton it would have done nothing to console richard feverel for the ignominy he had been compelled to submit to ripton was familiar with the rod a monster much despoiled of his terrors by intimacy birchfever was past with this boy the horrible sense of shame selfloathing universal hatred impotent vengeance as if the spirit were steeped in abysmal blackness which comes upon a courageous and sensitive youth condemned for the first time to taste this piece of fleshly bitterness and suffer what he feels is a defilement ripton had weathered and forgotten he was seasoned wood and took the world pretty wisely not reckless of castigation as some boys become nor oversensitive as to dishonour as his friend and comrade beside him was richards blood was poisoned he had the fever on him severely he would not allow stoneflinging because it was a habit of his to discountenance it mere gentlemanly considerations has scarce shielded farmer blaize and certain very ungentlemanly schemes were coming to ghastly heads in the tumult of his brain rejected solely from their glaring impracticability even to his young intelligence a sweeping and consummate vengeance for the indignity alone should satisfy him something tremendous must be done and done without delay at one moment he thought of killing all the farmers cattle next of killing him challenging him to single combat with the arms and according to the fashion of gentlemen but the farmer was a coward he would refuse then he richard feverel would stand by the farmers bedside and rouse him rouse him to fight with powder and ball in his own chamber in the cowardly midnight where he might tremble but dare not refuse lord cried simple ripton while these hopeful plots were raging in his comrades brain now sparkling for immediate execution and anon lapsing disdainfully dark in their chances of fulfilment how i wish youd have let me notch him ricky im a safe shot i never miss i should feel quite jolly if id spanked him once we should have had the beat of him at that game i say and a sharp thought drew riptons ideas nearer home i wonder whether my nose is as bad as he says where can i see myself to these exclamations richard was deaf and he trudged steadily forward facing but one object after tearing through innumerable hedges leaping fences jumping dykes penetrating brambly copses and getting dirty ragged and tired ripton awoke from his dream of farmer blaize and a blue nose to the vivid consciousness of hunger and this grew with the rapidity of light upon him till in the course of another minute he was enduring the extremes of famine and ventured to question his leader whither he was being conducted raynham was out of sight they were a long way down the valley miles from lobourne in a country of sour pools yellow brooks rank pasturage desolate heath solitary cows were seen the smoke of a mud cottage a cart piled with peat a donkey grazing at leisure oblivious of an unkind world geese by a horsepond gabbling as in the first loneliness of creation uncooked things that a famishing boy cannot possibly care for and must despise ripton was in despair where are you going to he inquired with a voice of the last time of asking and halted resolutely richard now broke his silence to reply anywhere anywhere ripton took up the moody word but aint you awfully hungry he gasped vehemently in a way that showed the total emptiness of his stomach no was richards brief response not hungry riptons amazement lent him increased vehemence why you havent had anything to eat since breakfast not hungry i declare im starving i feel such a gnawing i could eat dry bread and cheese richard sneered not for reasons that would have actuated a similar demonstration of the philosopher come cried ripton at all events tell us where youre going to stop richard faced about to make a querulous retort the injured and hapless visage that met his eye disarmed him the lads nose though not exactly of the dreaded hue was really becoming discoloured to upbraid him would be cruel richard lifted his head surveyed the position and exclaiming here dropped down on a withered bank leaving ripton to contemplate him as a puzzle whose every new move was a worse perplexity chapter iii among boys there are laws of honour and chivalrous codes not written or formally taught but intuitively understood by all and invariably acted upon by the loyal and the true the race is not nearly civilized we must remember thus not to follow your leader whithersoever he may think proper to lead to back out of an expedition because the end of it frowns dubious and the present fruit of it is discomfort to quit a comrade on the road and return home without him these are tricks which no boy of spirit would be guilty of let him come to any description of mortal grief in consequence better so than have his own conscience denouncing him sneak some boys who behave boldly enough are not troubled by this conscience and the eyes and the lips of their fellows have to supply the deficiency they do it with just as haunting and even more horrible pertinacity than the inner voice and the result if the probation be not very severe and searching is the same the leader can rely on the faithfulness of his host the comrade is sworn to serve master ripton thompson was naturally loyal the idea of turning off and forsaking his friend never once crossed his mind though his condition was desperate and his friends behaviour that of a bedlamite he announced several times impatiently that they would be too late for dinner his friend did not budge dinner seemed nothing to him there he lay plucking grass and patting the old dogs nose as if incapable of conceiving what a thing hunger was ripton took halfadozen turns up and down and at last flung himself down beside the taciturn boy accepting his fate now the chance that works for certain purposes sent a smart shower from the sinking sun and the wet sent two strangers for shelter in the lane behind the hedge where the boys reclined one was a travelling tinker who lit a pipe and spread a tawny umbrella the other was a burly young countryman pipeless and tentless they saluted with a nod and began recounting for each others benefit the daylongdoings of the weather as it had affected their individual experience and followed their prophecies both had anticipated and foretold a bit of rain before night and therefore both welcomed the wet with satisfaction a monotonous betweenwhiles kind of talk they kept droning in harmony with the still hum of the air from the weather theme they fell upon the blessings of tobacco how it was the poor mans friend his company his consolation his comfort his refuge at night his first thought in the morning better than a wife chuckled the tinker no curtainlecturin with a pipe your pipe ant a shrew that be it the other chimed in your pipe doant mak ye out wi all the cash saturday evenin take one said the tinker in the enthusiasm of the moment handing a grimy short clay speedtheplough filled from the tinkers pouch and continued his praises penny a day and there yare primed better than a wife ha ha and you can get rid of it if ye wants for

repentance after it not nohow master it doant andspeedtheplough cocked his eyeit doant eat up half the victuals your pipe doant here the honest yeoman gesticulated his keen sense of a clincher which the tinker acknowledged and having so to speak sealed up the subject by saying the best thing that could be said the two smoked for some time in silence to the drip and patter of the shower ripton solaced his wretchedness by watching them through the briar hedge he saw the tinker stroking a white cat and appealing to her every now and then as his missus for an opinion or a confirmation and he thought that a curious sight speedtheplough was stretched at full length with his boots in the rain and his head amidst the tinkers pots smoking profoundly contemplative the minutes seemed to be taken up alternately by the grey puffs from their mouths it was the tinker who renewed the colloquy said he times is bad his companion assented surely but it somehow comes round right resumed the tinker why look here wheres the good o moping i sees it all come round right and tight now i travels about ive got my beat casion calls me tother day to newcastleeh coals ejaculated speedtheplough sonorously coals echoed the tinker you ask what i goes there for mayhap never you mind one sees a mort o life in my trade not for coals it isnt and i dont carry em there neither anyhow i comes back londons my

wells honest work im thinkin varmer bollop i dont owe no grudge to varmer blaize i do and i shud like to stick a lucifer in his rick some dry windy night speedtheplough screwed up an eye villainously he wants hittin in the windjest where the pocket is master do varmer blaize and hell cry out o lor varmer blaize will you wont get the better o varmer blaize by no means as i makes out if ye doant hit into him jest there the tinker sent a rapid succession of white clouds from his mouth and said that would be taking the devils side of a bad case speedtheplough observed energetically that if farmer blaize was on the other he should be on that side there was a young gentleman close by who thought with him the hope of raynham had lent a careless halfcompelled attention to the foregoing dialogue wherein a common labourer and a travelling tinker had propounded and discussed one of the most ancient theories of transmundane dominion and influence on mundane affairs he now started to his feet and came tearing through the briar hedge calling out for one of them to direct them the nearest road to bursley the tinker was kindling preparations for his tea under the tawny umbrella a loaf was set forth on which riptons eyes stuck in the edge fastened ravenously speedtheplough volunteered information that bursley was a good three mile from where they stood and a good eight mile from lobourne ill give you halfacrown for that loaf my good fellow said richard to the tinker its a bargain quoth the tinker eh missus his cat replied by humping her back at the dog the halfcrown was tossed down and ripton who had just succeeded in freeing his limbs from the briar prickly as a hedgehog collared the loaf those young squires be sharpset and no mistake said the tinker to his companion come well to bursley after em and talk it out over a pot o beer speedtheplough was nothing loath and in a short time they were following the two lads on the road to bursley while a horizontal blaze shot across the autumn and from the western edge of the raincloud chapter iv search for the missing boys had been made everywhere over raynham and sir austin was in grievous discontent none had seen them save austin wentworth and mr morton the baronet sat construing their account of the flight of the lads when they were hailed and resolved it into an act of rebellion on the part of his son at dinner he drank the young heirs health in ominous silence adrian harley stood up in his place to propose the health his speech was a fine piece of rhetoric he warmed in it till after the ciceronic model inanimate objects were personified and richards tablenapkin and vacant chair were invoked to follow the steps of a peerless father and uphold with his dignity the honour of the feverels austin wentworth whom a soldiers death compelled to take his fathers place in support of the toast was tame after such magniloquence but the reply the thanks which young richard should have delivered in person were not forthcoming adrians oratory had given but a momentary life to napkin and chair the company of honoured friends and aunts and uncles remotest cousins were glad to disperse and seek amusement in music and tea sir austin did his utmost to be hospitably cheerful and requested them to dance if he had desired them to laugh he would have been obeyed and in as hearty a manner how triste said mrs doria forey to lobournes curate as that most enamoured automaton went through his paces beside her with professional stiffness one who does not suffer can hardly assent the curate answered basking in her beams ah you are good exclaimed the lady look at my clare she will not dance on her cousins birthday with anyone but him what are we to do to enliven these people alas madam you cannot do for all what you do for one the curate sighed and wherever she wandered in discourse drew her back with silken strings to gaze on his enamoured soul he was the only gratified stranger present the others had designs on the young heir lady attenbury of longford house had brought her highlypolished specimen of marketware the lady juliana jaye for a first introduction to him thinking he had arrived at an age to estimate and pine for her black eyes and pretty pert mouth the lady juliana had to pair off with a dapper papworth and her mama was subjected to the gallantries of sir miles who talked land and steamengines to her till she was sick and had to be impertinent in selfdefence lady blandish the delightful widow sat apart with adrian and enjoyed his sarcasms on the company by ten at night the poor show ended and the rooms were dark dark as the prognostics multitudinously hinted by the disappointed and chilled guests concerning the probable future of the hope of raynham little clare kissed her mama curtsied to the lingering curate and went to bed like a very good girl immediately the maid had departed little clare deliberately exchanged night attire for that of day she was noted as an obedient child her light was allowed to burn in her room for halfanhour to counteract her fears of the dark she took the light and stole on tiptoe to richards room no richard was there she peeped in further and further a trifling agitation of the curtains shot her back through the door and along the passage to her own bedchamber with extreme expedition she was not much alarmed but feeling guilty she was on her guard in a short time she was prowling about the passages again richard had slighted and offended the little lady and was to be asked whether he did not repent such conduct toward his cousin not to be asked whether he had forgotten to receive his birthday kiss from her for if he did not choose to remember that miss clare would never remind him of it and tonight should be his last chance of a reconciliation thus she meditated sitting on a stair and presently heard richards voice below in the hall shouting for supper master richard has returned old benson the butler tolled out intelligence to sir austin well said the baronet he complains of being hungry the butler hesitated with a look of solemn disgust let him eat heavy benson hesitated still more as he announced that the boy had called for wine it was an unprecedented thing sir austins brows were portending an arch but adrian suggested that he wanted possibly to drink his birthday and claret was conceded the boys were in the vortex of a partridgepie when adrian strolled in to them they had now changed characters richard was uproarious he drank a health with every glass his cheeks were flushed and his eyes brilliant ripton looked very much like a rogue on the tremble of detection but his honest hunger and the partridgepie shielded him awhile from adrians scrutinizing glance adrian saw there was matter for study if it were only on master riptons betraying nose and sat down to hear and mark good sport gentlemen i trust to hear he began his quiet banter and provoked a loud peal of laughter from richard ha ha i say rip havin good sport gentlemen are ye you remember the farmer your health parson we havent had our sport yet were going to have some firstrate sport oh well we havent much show of birds we shot for pleasure and returned them to the proprietors youre fond of game parson ripton is a dead shot in what cousin austin calls the kingdom of wouldhavedone and mighthavebeen up went the birds and cries rip ive forgotten to load oh horip some more claretdo just leave that nose of yours aloneyour health ripton thompson the birds hadnt the decency to wait for him and so parson its their fault and not rips you havent a dozen brace at your feet what have you been doing at home cousin rady playing hamlet in the absence of the prince of denmark the day without

quote sandoe you know you like him rady but if youve missed me im sorry rip and i have had a beautiful day weve made new acquaintances weve seen the world im the monkey that has seen the world and im going to tell you all about it first theres a gentleman who takes a rifle for a fowlingpiece next theres a farmer who warns everybody gentleman and beggar off his premises next theres a tinker and a ploughman who think that god is always fighting with the devil which shall command the kingdoms of the earth the tinkers for god and the ploughman ill drink your health ricky said adrian interrupting oh i forgot parsoni mean no harm adrian im only telling what ive heard no harm my dear boy returned adrian im perfectly aware that zoroaster is not dead you have been listening to a common creed drink the fireworshippers if you will heres to zoroaster then cried richard i say rippy well drink the fireworshippers tonight wont we a fearful conspiratorial frown that would not have disgraced guido fawkes was darted back from the plastic features of master ripton richard gave his lungs loud play why what did you say about blaizes rippy didnt you say it was fun another hideous and silencing frown was riptons answer adrian matched the innocent youths and knew that there was talking under the table see thought he this boy has tasted his first scraggy morsel of life today and already he talks like an old stager and has if i mistake not been acting too my respected chief he apostrophized sir austin combustibles are only the more dangerous for compression this boy will be ravenous for earth when he is let loose and very soon make his share of it look as foolish as yonder gamepiea prophecy adrian kept to himself uncle algernon shambled in to see his nephew before the supper was finished and his more genial presence brought out a little of the plot look here uncle said richard would you let a churlish old brute of a farmer strike you without making him suffer for it i fancy i should return the compliment my lad replied his uncle of course you would so would i and he shall suffer for it the boy looked savage and his uncle patted him down ive boxed his son ill box him said richard shouting for more wine what boy is it old blaize has been putting you up never mind uncle the boy nodded mysteriously look there adrian read on riptons face he says never mind and lets it out did we beat today uncle yes boy and wed beat them any day they bowl fair id beat them on one leg theres only watkins and featherdene among them worth a farthing we beat cries richard then well have some more wine and drink their healths the bell was rung wine ordered presently comes in heavy benson to say supplies are cut off one bottle and no more the captain whistled adrian shrugged the bottle however was procured by adrian subsequently he liked studying intoxicated urchins one subject was at richards heart about which he was reserved in the midst of his riot too proud to inquire how his father had taken his absence he burned to hear whether he was in disgrace he led to it repeatedly and it was constantly evaded by algernon and adrian at last when the boy declared a desire to wish his father goodnight adrian had to tell him that he was to go straight to bed from the suppertable young richards face fell at that and his gaiety forsook him he marched to his room without another word adrian gave sir austin an able version of his sons behaviour and adventures dwelling upon this sudden taciturnity when he heard of his fathers resolution not to see him the wise youth saw that his chief was mollified behind his moveless mask and went to bed and horace leaving sir austin in his study long hours the baronet sat alone the house had not its usual influx of feverels that day austin wentworth was staying at poer hall and had only come over for an hour at midnight the house breathed sleep sir austin put on his cloak and cap and took the lamp to make his rounds he apprehended nothing special but with a mind never at rest he constituted himself the sentinel of raynham he passed the chamber where the greataunt grantley lay who was to swell richards fortune and so perform her chief business on earth by her door he murmured good creature you sleep with a sense of duty done and paced on reflecting she has not made money a demon of discord and blessed her he had his thoughts at hippiass somnolent door and to them the world might have subscribed a monomaniac at large watching over sane people in slumber thinks adrian harley as he hears sir austins footfall and truly that was a strange object to seewhere is the fortress that has not one weak gate where the man who is sound at each particular angle ay meditates the recumbent cynic more or less mad is not every mothers son favourable circumstancesgood air good company two or three good rules rigidly adhered tokeep the world out of bedlam but let the world fly into a passion and is not bedlam the safest abode for it sir austin ascended the stairs and bent his steps leisurely toward the chamber where his son was lying in the left wing of the abbey at the end of the gallery which led to it he discovered a dim light doubting it an illusion sir austin accelerated his pace this wing had aforetime a bad character notwithstanding what years had done to polish it into fair repute the raynham kitchen stuck to tradition and preserved certain stories of ghosts seen there that effectually blackened it in the susceptible minds of new housemaids and undercrooks whose fears would not allow the sinner to wash his sins sir austin had heard of the tales circulated by his domestics underground he cherished his own belief but discouraged theirs and it was treason at raynham to be caught traducing the left wing as the baronet advanced the fact of a light burning was clear to him a slight descent brought him into the passage and he beheld a poor human candle standing outside his sons chamber at the same moment a door closed hastily he entered richards room the boy was absent the bed was unpressed no clothes about nothing to show that he had been there that night sir austin felt vaguely apprehensive has he gone to my room to await me thought the fathers heart something like a tear quivered in his arid eyes as he meditated and hoped this might be so his own sleepingroom faced that of his son he strode to it with a quick heart it was empty alarm dislodged anger from his jealous heart and dread of evil put a thousand questions to him that were answered in air after pacing up and down his room he determined to go and ask the boy thompson as he called ripton what was known to him the chamber assigned to master ripton thompson was at the northern extremity of the passage and overlooked lobourne and the valley to the west the bed stood between the window and the door six austin found the door ajar and the interior dark to his surprise the boy thompsons couch as revealed by the rays of his lamp was likewise vacant he was turning back when he fancied he heard the sibilation of a whispering in the room sir austin cloaked the lamp and trod silently toward the window the heads of his son richard and the boy thompson were seen crouched against the glass holding excited converse together sir austin listened but he listened to a language of which he possessed not the key their talk was of fire and of delay of expected agrarian astonishment of a farmers huge wrath of violence exercised upon gentlemen and of vengeance talk that the boys jerked out by fits and that came as broken links of a chain impossible to connect but they awake curiosity the baronet condescended to play the spy upon his son over lobourne and the valley lay black night and innumerable stars how jolly i feel exclaimed ripton inspired by claret and then after a luxurious pausei think that fellow has pocketed his guinea and cut his lucky richard allowed a long minute to pass during which the baronet waited anxiously for his voice hardly recognizing it when he heard its altered tones if he has ill go and ill do it myself you would returned master ripton well im hangedi say if you went to school wouldnt you get into rows perhaps he hasnt found the place where the box was stuck in i think he funks it i almost wish you hadnt done it upon my honoureh look there what was that that looked like somethingi say do you think we shall ever be found out master ripton intoned this abrupt interrogation verb seriously i dont think about it said richard all his faculties bent on signs from lobourne well but ripton persisted suppose we are found out if we are i must pay for it sir austin breathed the better for this reply he was beginning to gather a clue to the dialogue his son was engaged in a plot and was moreover the leader of the plot he listened for further enlightenment what was the fellows name inquired ripton his companion answered tom bakewell ill tell you what continued ripton you let it all clean out to your cousin and uncle at supperhow capital claret is with partridgepie what a lot i atedidnt you see me frown the young sensualist was in an ecstasy of gratitude to his late refection and the slightest word recalled him to it richard answered him yes and felt your kick it doesnt matter radys safe and uncle never blabs well my plan is to keep it close youre never safe if you donti never drank much claret before ripton was off again wont i now though clarets my wine you know it may come out any day and then were done for he rather incongruously appended richard only took up the businessthread of his friends rambling chatter and answered youve got nothing to do with it if we are havent i though i didnt stickin the box but im an accomplice thats clear besides added ripton do you think i should leave you to bear it all on your shoulders i aint that sort of chap ricky i can tell you sir austin thought more highly of the boy thompson still it looked a detestable conspiracy and the altered manner of his son impressed him strangely he was not the boy of yesterday to sir austin it seemed as if a gulf had suddenly opened between them the boy had embarked and was on the waters of life in his own vessel it was as vain to call him back as to attempt to erase what time has written with the judgment blood this child for whom he had prayed nightly in such a fervour and humbleness to god the dangers were about him the temptations thick on him and the devil on board piloting if a day had done so much what would years do were prayers and all the watchfulness he had expended of no avail a sensation of infinite melancholy overcame the poor gentlemana thought that he was fighting with a fate in this beloved boy he was half disposed to arrest the two conspirators on the spot and make them confess and absolve themselves but it seemed to him better to keep an unseen eye over his son sir austins old system prevailed adrian characterized this system well in saying that sir austin wished to be providence to his son if immeasurable love were perfect wisdom one human being might almost impersonate providence to another alas love divine as it is can do no more than lighten the house it inhabitsmust take its shape sometimes intensify its narrownesscan spiritualize but not expel the old lifelong lodgers abovestairs and below sir austin decided to continue quiescent the valley still lay black beneath the large autumnal stars and the exclamations of the boys were becoming fevered and impatient byandby one insisted that he had seen a twinkle the direction he gave was out of their anticipations again the twinkle was announced both boys started to their feet it was a twinkle in the right direction now hes done it cried richard in great heat now you may say old blaizell soon be old blazes rip i hope hes asleep im sure hes snoringlook there hes alight fast enough hes dry hell burni say ripton reassumed the serious intonation do you think theyll ever suspect us what if they do we must brunt it of course we will but i say i wish you hadnt given them the scent though i like to look innocent i cant when i know people suspect me lord look there isnt it just beginning to flare up the farmers grounds were indeed gradually standing out in sombre shadows ill fetch my telescope said richard ripton somehow not liking to be left alone caught hold of him no dont go and lose the best of it here ill throw open the window and we can see the window was flung open and the boys instantly stretched half their bodies out of it ripton appearing to devour the rising flames with his mouth richard with his eyes opaque and statuesque stood the figure of the baronet behind them the wind was low dense masses of smoke hung amid the darting snakes of fire and a red malign light was on the neighbouring leafage no figures could be seen apparently the flames had nothing to contend against for they were making terrible strides into the darkness oh shouted richard overcome by excitement if i had my telescope we must have it let me go and fetch it i will the boys struggled together and sir austin stepped back as he did so a cry was heard in the passage he hurried out closed the chamber and came upon little clare lying senseless along the door chapter v in the morning that followed this night great gossip was interchanged between raynham and lobourne the village told how farmer blaize of belthorpe farm had his pick feloniously set fire to his stables had caught fire himself had been all but roasted alive in the attempt to rescue his cattle of which numbers had perished in the flames raynham counterbalanced arson with an authentic ghost seen by miss clare in the left wing of the abbeythe ghost of a lady dressed in deep mourning a scar on her forehead and a bloody handkerchief at her breast frightful to behold and no wonder the child was frightened out of her wits and lay in a desperate state awaiting the arrival of the london doctors it was added that the servants had all threatened to leave in a body and that sir austin to appease them had promised to pull down the entire left wing like a gentleman for no decent creature said lobourne could consent to live in a haunted house rumour for the nonce had a stronger spice of truth than usual poor little clare lay ill and the calamity that had befallen farmer blaize as regards his rick was not much exaggerated sir austin caused an account of it be given him at breakfast and appeared so scrupulously anxious to hear the exact extent of injury sustained by the farmer that heavy benson went down to inspect the scene mr benson returned and acting under adrians malicious advice framed a formal report of the catastrophe in which the farmers breeches figured and certain cooling applications to a part of the farmers person sir austin perused it without a smile he took occasion to have it read out before the two boys who listened very demurely as to an ordinary newspaper incident only when the report particularized the garments damaged and the unwonted distressing position farmer blaize was reduced to in his bed an indecorous fit of sneezing laid hold of master ripton thompson and richard bit his lip and burst into loud laughter ripton joining him lost to consequences i trust you feel for this poor man said sir austin to his son somewhat sternly he saw no sign of feeling it was a difficult task for sir austin to keep his old countenance toward the hope of raynham knowing him the accompliceincendiary and believing the deed to have been unprovoked and wanton but he must do so he knew to let the boy have a fair trial against himself be it said moreover that the baronets possession of his sons secret flattered him it allowed him to act and in a measure to feel like providence enabled him to observe and provide for the movements of creatures in the dark he therefore treated the boy as he commonly did and richard saw no change in his father to make him think he was suspected the youngsters game was not so easy against adrian adrian did not shoot or fish voluntarily he did nothing to work off the destructive nervous fluid or whatever it may be which is in mans nature so that two culprit boys once in his power were not likely to taste the gentle hand of mercy and richard and ripton paid for many a trout and partridge spared at every minute of the day ripton was thrown into sweats of suspicion that discovery was imminent by some stray remark or message from adrian he was as a fish with the hook in his gills mysteriously caught without having nibbled and dive into what depths he would he was sensible of a summoning force that compelled him perpetually towards the gasping surface which he seemed inevitably approaching when the dinnerbell sounded there the talk was all of farmer blaize if it dropped adrian revived it and his caressing way with ripton was just such as a keen sportsman feels toward the creature that had owned his skill and is making its appearance for the world to acknowledge the same sir austin saw the manoeuvres and admired adrians shrewdness but he had to check the young natural lawyer for the effect of so much masked examination upon richard was growing baneful this fish also felt the hook in his gills but this fish was more of a pike and lay in different waters where there were old stumps and black roots to wind about and defy alike strong pulling and delicate handling in other words richard showed symptoms of a disposition to take refuge in lies you know the grounds my dear boy adrian observed to him tell me do you think it easy to get to the rick unperceived i hear they suspect one of the farmers turnedoff hands i tell you i dont know the grounds richard sullenly replied not adrian counterfeited courteous astonishment i thought mr thompson said you were over there yesterday ripton glad to speak the truth hurriedly assured adrian that it was not he had said so not you had good sport gentlemen hadnt you oh yes mumbled the wretched victims reddening as they remembered in adrians slightly drawled rusticity of tone farmer blaizes first address to them i suppose you were among the fireworshippers last night too persisted adrian in some countries i hear they manage their best sport at nighttime and beat up for game with torches it must be a fine sight after all the country would be dull if we hadnt a rip here and there to treat us to a little conflagration a rip laughed richard to his friends disgust and alarm at his daring you dont mean this rip do you mr thompson fire a rick i should as soon suspect you my dear boyyou are aware young gentlemen that it is rather a serious thing eh in this country you know the landlord has always been the pet of the laws by the way adrian continued as if diverging to another topic you met two gentlemen of the road in your explorations yesterday magians now if i were a magistrate of the county like sir miles papworth my suspicions would light upon those gentlemen a tinker and a ploughman i think you said mr thompson not well say two ploughmen more likely two tinkers said richard oh if you wish to exclude the ploughmanwas he out of employ ripton with adrians eyes inveterately fixed on him stammered an affirmative the tinker or the ploughman the ploughm ingenuous ripton looking about as if to aid himself whenever he was able to speak the truth beheld richards face blackening at him and swallowed back half the word the ploughman adrian took him up cheerily then we have here a ploughman out of employ given a ploughman out of employ and a rick burnt the burning of a rick is an act of vengeance and a ploughman out of employ is a vengeful animal the rick and the ploughman are advancing to a juxtaposition motive being established we have only to prove their proximity at a certain hour and our ploughman voyages beyond seas is it transportation for rickburning inquired ripton aghast adrian spoke solemnly they shave your head you are manacled your diet is sour bread and cheeseparings you work in strings of twenties and thirties arson is branded on your backs in an enormous a theological works are the sole literary recreation of the wellconducted and deserving consider the fate of this poor fellow and what an act of vengeance brings him to do you know his name how should i know his name said richard with an assumption of innocence painful to see sir austin remarked that no doubt it would soon be known and adrian perceived that he was to quiet his line marvelling a little at the baronets blindness to what was so clear he would not tell for that would ruin his influence with richard still he wanted some present credit for his discernment and devotion the boys got away from dinner and after deep consultation agreed upon a course of conduct which was to commiserate with farmer blaize loudly and make themselves look as much like the public as it was possible for two young malefactors to look one of whom already felt adrians enormous a devouring his back with the fierceness of the promethean eagle and isolating him forever from mankind adrian relished their novel tactics sharply and led them to lengths of lamentation for farmer blaize do what they might the hook was in their gills the farmers whip had reduced them to bodily contortions these were decorous compared with the spiritual writhings they had to perform under adrians manipulation ripton was fast becoming a coward and richard a liar when next morning austin wentworth came over from poer hall bringing news that one mr thomas bakewell yeoman had been arrested on suspicion of the crime of arson and lodged in jail awaiting the magisterial pleasure of sir miles papworth austins eye rested on richard as he spoke these terrible tidings the hope of raynham returned his look perfectly calm and had moreover the presence of mind not to look at ripton chapter vi as soon as they could escape the boys got together into an obscure corner of the park and there took counsel of their extremity whatever shall we do now asked ripton of his leader scorpion girt with fire was never in a more terrible prisonhouse than poor ripton around whom the raging element he had assisted to create seemed to be drawing momently narrower circles theres only one chance said richard coming to a dead halt and folding his arms resolutely his comrade inquired with the utmost eagerness what that chance might be richard fixed his eyes on a flint and replied we must rescue that fellow from jail ripton gazed at his leader and fell back with astonishment my dear ricky but how are we to do it richard still perusing his flint replied we must manage to get a file in to him and a rope it can be done i tell you i dont care what i pay i dont care what i do he must be got out bother that old blaize exclaimed ripton taking off his cap to wipe his frenzied forehead and brought down his friends reproof never mind old blaize now talk about letting it out look at you im ashamed of you you talk about robin hood and king richard why you havent an atom of courage why you let it out every second of the day whenever rady begins speaking you start i can see the perspiration rolling down you are you afraidand then you contradict yourself you never keep to one story now follow me we must risk everything to get him out mind that and keep out of adrians way as much as you can and keep to one story with these sage directions the young leader marched his companionculprit down to inspect the jail where tom bakewell lay groaning over the results of the supermundane conflict and the victim of it that he was in lobourne austin wentworth had the reputation of the poor mans friend a title he earned more largely ere he went to the reward god alone can give to that supreme virtue dame bakewell the mother of tom on hearing of her sons arrest had run to comfort him and render him what help she could but this was only sighs and tears and oh deary me which only perplexed poor tom who bade her leave an unlucky chap to his fate and not make himself a thundering villain whereat the dame begged him to take heart and he should have a true comforter and though its a gentleman thats coming to you tomfor he never refuses a poor body said mrs bakewell its a true christian tom and the lord knows if the sight of him maynt be the saving of you for hes light to look on and a sermon to listen to he is tom was not prepossessed by the prospect of a sermon and looked a sullen dog enough when austin entered his cell he was surprised at the end of halfanhour to find himself engaged in mantoman conversation with a gentleman and a christian when austin rose to go tom begged permission to shake his hand take and tell young master up at the abbey that i ant the chap to peach hell know hes a young gentleman asll make any man do as he wants em hes a mortal wild young gentleman and im a ass thats where tis but i ant a blackguard tell him that sir this was how it came that austin eyed young richard seriously while he told the news at raynham the boy was shy of austin more than of adrian why he did not know but he made it a hard task for austin to catch him alone and turned sulky that instant austin was not clever like adrian he seldom divined other peoples ideas and always went the direct road to his object so instead of beating about and setting the boy on the alert at all points crammed to the muzzle with lies he just said tom bakewell told me to let you know he does not intend to peach on you and left him richard repeated the intelligence to ripton who cried aloud that tom was a brick he shant suffer for it said richard and pondered on a thicker rope and sharper file but will your cousin tell was riptons reflection he richards lip expressed contempt a ploughman refuses to peach and you ask if one of our family will ripton stood for the twentieth time reproved on this point the boys had examined the outer walls of the jail and arrived at the conclusion that toms escape might be managed if tom had spirit and the rope and file could be anyway reached to him but to do this somebody must gain admittance to his cell and who was to be taken into their confidence try your cousin ripton suggested after much debate richard smiling wished to know if he meant adrian no no ripton hurriedly reassured him austin the same idea was knocking at richards head lets get the rope and file first said he and to bursley they went for those implements to defeat the law ripton procuring the file at one shop and richard the rope at another with such masterly cunning did they lay their measures for the avoidance of every possible chance of detection and better to assure this in a wood outside bursley richard stripped to his shirt and wound the rope round his body tasting the tortures of anchorites and penitential friars that nothing should be risked to make toms escape a certainty sir austin saw the marks at night as his son lay asleep through the halfopened folds of his bedgown it was a severe stroke when after all their stratagems and trouble austin wentworth refused the office the boys had zealously designed for him time pressed in a few days poor tom would have to face the redoubtable sir miles and get committed for rumours of overwhelming evidence to convict him were rife about lobourne and farmer blaizes wrath was unappeasable again and again young richard begged his cousin not to see him disgraced and to help him in this extremity austin smiled on him my dear ricky said he there are two ways of getting out of a scrape a long way and a short way when youve tried the roundabout method and failed come to me and ill show you the straight route richard was too entirely bent upon the roundabout method to consider this advice more than empty words and only ground his teeth at austins unkind refusal he imparted to ripton at the eleventh hour that they must do it themselves to which ripton heavily assented on the day preceding poor toms doomed appearance before the magistrate dame bakewell had an interview with austin who went to raynham immediately and sought adrians counsel upon what was to be done homeric laughter and nothing else could be got out of adrian when he heard of the doings of these desperate boys how they had entered dame bakewells smallest of retail shops and purchased tea sugar candles and comfits of every description till the shop was clear of customers how they had then hurried her into her little backparlour where richard had torn open his shirt and revealed the coils of rope and ripton displayed the point of a file from a serpentine recess in his jacket how they had then told the astonished woman that the rope she saw and the file she saw were instruments for the liberation of her son that there existed no other means on earth to save him they the boys having unsuccessfully attempted all how upon that richard had tried with the utmost earnestness to persuade her to disrobe and wind the rope round her own person and ripton had aired his eloquence to induce her to secrete the file how when she resolutely objected to the rope both boys began backing the file and in an evil hour she feared said dame bakewell she had rewarded the gracious permission given her by sir miles papworth to visit her son by tempting tom to file the law though thanks be to the lord dame bakewell added tom had turned up his nose at the file and so she had told young master richard who swore very bad for a young gentleman boys are like monkeys remarked adrian at the close of his explosions the gravest actors of farcical nonsense that the world possesses may i never be where there are no boys a couple of boys left to themselves will furnish richer fun than any troop of trained comedians no no art arrives at the artlessness of nature in matters of comedy you cant simulate the ape your antics are dull they havent the charming inconsequence of the natural animal look at these two think of the shifts they are put to all day long they know i know all about it and yet their serenity of innocence is all but unruffled in my presence youre sorry to think about the end of the business austin so am i i dread the idea of the curtain going down besides it will do ricky a world of good a practical lesson is the best lesson sinks deepest said austin but whether he learns good or evil from it is the question at stake adrian stretched his length at ease this will be his first nibble at experience old times fruit hateful to the palate of youth for which season only hath it any nourishment experience you know coleridges capital similemournful you call it well all wisdom is mournful tis therefore coz that the wise do love the comic muse their own high food would kill them you shall find great poets rare philosophers night after night on the broad grin before a row of yellow lights and mouthing masks why because alls dark at home the stage is the pastime of great minds thats how it comes that the stage is now down an age of rampant little minds my dear austin how i hate that cant of yours about an age of workyou and your mortons and your parsons brawnley rank radicals all of you base materialists what does diaper sandoe sing of your age of work listen an age of petty tit for tat an age of busy gabble an age thats like a brewers vat fermenting for the rabble an age thats chaste in love but lax to virtuous abuses whose gentlemen and ladies wax too dainty for their uses an age that drives an iron horse of time and space defiant exulting in a giants force and trembling at the giant an age of quaker hue and cut by mammon misbegotten see the mad hamlet mouth and strut and mark the kings of cotton from this unrest lo early wreckd a future staggers crazy ophelia of the ages deckd with woeful weed and daisy murmuring get your parson brawnley to answer that adrian changed the restingplace of a leg and smiled the age was an old battlefield between him and austin my parson brawnley as you call him has answered it said austin not by hoping his best which would probably leave the age to go mad to your satisfaction but by doing it and he has and will answer your diaper sandoe in better verse as he confutes him in a better life you dont see sandoes depth adrian replied consider that phrase ophelia of the ages is not brawnley like a dozen other leading spiritsi think thats your termjust the metaphysical hamlet to drive her mad she poor maid asks for marriage and smiling babes while my lord lover stands questioning the infinite and rants to the impalpable austin laughed marriage and smiling babes she would have in abundance if brawnley legislated wait till you know him he will be over at poer hall shortly and you will see what a man of the age means but now pray consult with me about these boys oh those boys adrian tossed a hand are there boys of the age as well as men not then boys are better than men boys are for all ages what do you think austin theyve been studying latudes escape i found the book open in rickys room on the top of jonathan wild jonathan preserved the secrets of his profession and taught them nothing so theyre going to make a latude of mr tom bakewell hes to be bastille bakewell whether he will or no let them let the wild colt run free we cant help them we can only look on we should spoil the play adrian always made a point of feeding the fretful beast impatience with pleasantriesa not congenial diet and austin the most patient of human beings began to lose his selfcontrol you talk as if time belonged to you adrian we have but a few hours left us work first and joke afterwards the boys fate is being decided now so is everybodys my dear austin yawned the epicurean yes but this boy is at present under our guardianshipunder yours especially not yet not yet adrian interjected languidly no getting into scrapes when i have him the leash young hound the collar young colt im perfectly irresponsible at present you may have something different to deal with when you are responsible if you think that i take my young prince as i find him coz a julian or a caracalla a constantine or a nero then if he will play the fiddle to a conflagration he shall play it well if he must be a disputatious apostate at any rate he shall understand logic and men and have the habit of saying his prayers then you leave me to act alone said austin rising without a single curb adrian gesticulated an acquiesced withdrawal im sure you would not still more certain you cannot do harm and be mindful of my prophetic words whatevers done old blaize will have to be bought off theres the affair settled at once i suppose i must go to the chief tonight and settle it myself we cant see this poor devil condemned though its nonsense to talk of a boy being the prime instigator austin cast an eye at the complacent languor of the wise youth his cousin and the little that he knew of his fellows told him he might talk forever here and not be comprehended the wise youths two ears were stuffed with his own wisdom one evil only adrian dreaded it was clearthe action of the law as he was moving away adrian called out to him stop austin there dont be anxious you invariably take the glum side ive done something never mind what if you go down to belthorpe be civil but not obsequious you remember the tactics of scipio africanus against the punic elephants well dont say a wordin thine ear coz ive turned master blaizes elephants if they charge twill be a feint and back to the destruction of his serried ranks you understand not well tis as well only let none say that i sleep if i must see him tonight i go down knowing he has not got us in his power the wise youth yawned and stretched out a hand for any book that might be within his reach austin left him to look about the grounds for richard chapter vii a little laurelshaded temple of white marble looked out on the river from a knoll bordering the raynham beechwoods and was dubbed by adrian daphnes bower to this spot richard had retired and there austin found him with his head buried in his hands a picture of desperation whose last shift has been defeated he allowed austin to greet him and sit by him without lifting his head perhaps his eyes were not presentable wheres your friend austin began gone was the answer sounding cavernous from behind hair and fingers an explanation presently followed that a summons had come for him in the morning from mr thompson and that mr ripton had departed against his will in fact ripton had protested that he would defy his parent and remain by his friend in the hour of adversity and at the post of danger sir austin signified his opinion that a boy should obey his parent by giving orders to benson for riptons box to be packed and ready before noon and riptons alacrity in taking the baronets view of filial duty was as little feigned as his offer to richard to throw filial duty to the winds he rejoiced that the fates had agreed to remove him from the very hot neighbourhood of lobourne while he grieved like an honest lad to see his comrade left to face calamity alone the boys parted amicably as they could hardly fail to do when ripton had sworn fealty to the feverels with a warmth that made him declare himself bond and due to appear at any stated hour and at any stated place to fight all the farmers in england on a mandate from the heir of the house so youre left alone said austin contemplating the boys shapely head im glad of it we never know whats in us till we stand by ourselves there appeared to be no answer forthcoming vanity however replied at last he wasnt much support remember his good points now hes gone ricky oh he was staunch the boy grumbled and a staunch friend is not always to be found now have you tried your own way of rectifying this business ricky i have done everything and failed there was a pause and then the deeptoned evasion tom bakewells a coward i suppose poor fellow said austin in his kind way he doesnt want to get into a deeper mess i dont think hes a coward he is a coward cried richard do you think if i had a file i would stay in prison id be out the first night and he might have had the rope tooa rope thick enough for a couple of men his size and weight ripton and i and ned markham swung on it for an hour and it didnt give way hes a coward and deserves his fate ive no compassion for a coward nor i much said austin richard had raised his head in the heat of his denunciation of poor tom he would have hidden it had he known the thought in austins clear eyes while he faced them i never met a coward myself austin continued i have heard of one or two one let an innocent man die for him how base exclaimed the boy yes it was bad austin acquiesced bad richard scorned the poor contempt how i would have spurned him he was a coward i believe he pleaded the feelings of his family in his excuse and tried every means to get the man off i have read also in the confessions of a celebrated philosopher that in his youth he committed some act of pilfering and accused a young servantgirl of his own theft who was condemned and dismissed for it pardoning her guilty accuser what a coward shouted richard and he confessed it publicly you may read it yourself he actually wrote it down and printed it you have the book in your fathers library would you have done so much richard faltered no he admitted that he never could have told people then who is to call that man a coward said austin he expiated his cowardice as all who give way in moments of weakness and are not cowards must do the coward chooses to think god does not see i shall escape he who is not a coward and has succumbed knows that god has seen all and it is not so hard a task for him to make his heart bare to the world worse i should fancy it to know myself an impostor when men praised me young richards eyes were wandering on austins gravely cheerful face a keen intentness suddenly fixed them and he dropped his head so i think youre wrong ricky in calling this poor tom a coward because he refuses to try your means of escape austin resumed a coward hardly objects to drag in his accomplice and where the person involved belongs to a great family it seems to me that for a poor ploughlad to volunteer not to do so speaks him anything but a coward richard was dumb altogether to surrender his rope and file was a fearful sacrifice after all the time trepidation and study he had spent on those two saving instruments if he avowed toms manly behaviour richard feverel was in a totally new position whereas by keeping tom a coward richard feverel was the injured one and to seem injured is always a luxury sometimes a necessity whether among boys or men in austin the magian conflict would not have lasted long he had but a blind notion of the fierceness with which it raged in young richard happily for the boy austin was not a preacher a single instance a cant phrase a fatherly manner might have wrecked him by arousing ancient or latent opposition the born preacher we feel instinctively to be our foe he may do some good to the wretches that have been struck down and lie gasping on the battlefield he rouses antagonism in the strong richards nature left to itself wanted little more than an indication of the proper track and when he said tell me what i can do austin he had fought the best half of the battle his voice was subdued austin put his hand on the boys shoulder you must go down to farmer blaize well said richard sullenly divining the deed of penance youll know what to say to him when youre there the boy bit his lip and frowned ask a favour of that big brute austin i cant just tell him the whole case and that you dont intend to stand by and let the poor fellow suffer without a friend to help him out of his scrape but austin the boy pleaded i shall have to ask him to help off tom bakewell how can i ask him when i hate him austin bade him go and think nothing of the consequences till he got there richard groaned in soul youve no pride austin perhaps not you dont know what it is to ask a favour of a brute you hate richard stuck to that view of the case and stuck to it the faster the more imperatively the urgency of a movement dawned upon him why continued the boy i shall hardly be able to keep my fists off him surely youve punished him enough boy said austin he struck me richards lip quivered he dared not come at me with his hands he struck me with a whip hell be telling everybody that he horsewhipped me and that i went down and begged his pardon begged his pardon a feverel beg his pardon oh if i had my will the man earns his bread ricky you poached on his grounds he turned you off and you fired his rick and ill pay him for his loss and i wont do any more because you wont ask a favour of him no i will not ask a favour of him austin looked at the boy steadily you prefer to receive a favour from poor tom bakewell at austins enunciation of this obverse view of the matter richard raised his brow dimly a new light broke in upon him favour from tom bakewell the ploughman how do you mean austin to save yourself an unpleasantness you permit a country lad to sacrifice himself for you i confess i should not have so much pride pride shouted richard stung by the taunt and set his sight hard at the blue ridges of the hills not knowing for the moment what else to do austin drew a picture of tom in prison and repeated toms volunteer statement the picture though his intentions were far from designing it so had to richard whose perception of humour was infinitely keener a horrible chawbacon smack about it visions of a grinning lout open from ear to ear unkempt coarse splayfooted rose before him and afflicted him with the strangest sensations of disgust and comicality mixed up with pity and remorsea sort of twisted pathos there lay tom hobnail tom a baconmunching reckless beerswilling animal and yet a man a dear brave human heart notwithstanding capable of devotion and unselfishness the boys better spirit was touched and it kindled his imagination to realize the abject figure of poor clodpole tom and surround it with a halo of mournful light his soul was alive feelings he had never known streamed in upon him as from an ethereal casement an unwonted tenderness an embracing humour a consciousness of some ineffable glory an irradiation of the features of humanity all this was in the bosom of the boy and through it all the vision of an actual hobnail tom coarse unkempt open from ear to ear whose presence was a finger of shame to him and an oppression of clodpole yet toward whom he felt just then a lovingkindness beyond what he felt for any living creature he laughed at him and wept over him he prized him while he shrank from him it was a genial strife of the angel in him with constituents less divine but the angel was uppermost and led the vanextinguished loathing humanized laughter transfigured pridepride that would persistently contemplate the corduroys of gaping tom and cry to richard in the very tone of adrians ironic voice behold your benefactor austin sat by the boy unaware of the sublimer tumult he had stirred little of it was perceptible in richards countenance the lines of his mouth were slightly drawn his eyes hard set into the distance he remained thus many minutes finally he jumped to his legs saying ill go at once to old blaize and tell him austin grasped his hand and together they issued out of daphnes bower in the direction of lobourne chapter viii farmer blaize was not so astonished at the visit of richard feverel as that young gentleman expected him to be the farmer seated in his easychair in the little lowroofed parlour of an oldfashioned farmhouse with a long clay pipe on the table at his elbow and a veteran pointer at his feet had already given audience to three distinguished members of the feverel blood who had come separately according to their accustomed secretiveness and with one object in the morning it was sir austin himself shortly after his departure arrived austin wentworth close on his heels algernon known about lobourne as the captain popular wherever he was known farmer blaize reclined in considerable elation he had brought these great people to a pretty low pitch he had welcomed them hospitably as a british yeoman should but not budged a foot in his demands not to the baronet not to the captain not to good young mr wentworth for farmer blaize was a solid englishman and on hearing from the baronet a frank confession of the hold he had on the family he determined to tighten his hold and only relax it in exchange for tangible advantagescompensation to his pocket his wounded person and his still more wounded sentiments the total indemnity being in round figures three hundred pounds and a spoken apology from the prime offender young mister richard even then there was a reservation provided the farmer said nobody had been tampering with any of his witnesses in that ease farmer blaize declared the money might go and he would transport tom bakewell as he had sworn he would and it goes hard too with an accomplice by law added the farmer knocking the ashes leisurely out of his pipe he had no wish to bring any disgrace anywhere he respected the inmates of raynham abbey as in duty bound he should be sorry to see them in trouble only no tampering with his witnesses he was a man for law rank was much money was much but law was more in this country law was above the sovereign to tamper with the law was treason to the realm i come to you direct the baronet explained i tell you candidly what way i discovered my son to be mixed up in this miserable affair i promise you indemnity for your loss and an apology that shall i trust satisfy your feelings assuring you that to tamper with witnesses is not the province of a feverel all i ask of you in return is not to press the prosecution at present it rests with you i am bound to do all that lies in my power for this imprisoned man how and wherefore my son was prompted to suggest or assist in such an act i cannot explain for i do not know hum said the farmer i think i do you know the cause sir austin stared i beg you to confide it to me least i can pretty nigh neighbour it with a guess said the farmer we ant good friends sir austin me and your son just nownot to say cordial i ye see sir austin im a man as dont like young gentlemen apoachin on his grounds without his permissionin special when birds is plentiful on their own it appear he do like it consequently i has to flick this whipas them fellers at the races all in this ere rings mine as much as to say and whos been hit hes had fair warnin im sorry fort but thats just the case sir austin retired to communicate with his son when he should find him algernons interview passed off in ale and promises he also assured farmer blaize that no feverel could be affected by his proviso no less did austin wentworth the farmer was satisfied moneys safe i know said he now for the pology and farmer blaize thrust his legs further out and his head further back the farmer naturally reflected that the three separate visits had been conspired together still the baronets frankness and the baronets not having reserved himself for the third and final charge puzzled him he was considering whether they were a deep or a shallow lot when young richard was announced a pretty little girl with the roses of thirteen springs in her cheeks and abundant beautiful bright tresses tripped before the boy and loitered shyly by the farmers armchair to steal a look at the handsome newcomer she was introduced to richard as the farmers niece lucy desborough the daughter of a lieutenant in the royal navy and what was better though the farmer did not pronounce it so loudly a real good girl neither the excellence of her character nor her rank in life tempted richard to inspect the little lady he made an awkward bow and sat down the farmers eyes twinkled her father he continued fought and fell for his coontry a man as fights fors coontrys a right to hould up his headay with any in the land desbroughs o dorset dye know that family master feverel richard did not know them and by his air did not desire to become acquainted with any offshoot of that family she can make puddens and pies the farmer went on regardless of his auditors gloom shes a lady as good as the best of em i dont care about their being catholicsthe desbroughs o dorset are gentlemen and shes good for the pianer too she strums to me of evenins im for the old tunes shes for the new gallike while shes with me she shall be taught things usel she can parleyvoo a good un and foot it as it goes been in france a couple of year i prefer the singin of t to the talkin of t come luce toon upehye wunt that song abort the viffendeera femalefarmer blaize volunteered the translation of the titlewho wears theyou guess what and marches along with the french sojers a pretty brazen bit o goods i shd fancy mademoiselle lucy corrected her uncles french but objected to do more the handsome cross boy had almost taken away her voice for speech as it was and sing in his company she could not so she stood a hand on her uncles chair to stay herself from falling while she wriggled a dozen various shapes of refusal and shook her head at the farmer with fixed eyes aha laughed the farmer dismissing her they soon learn the difference twixt the young un and the old un go along luce and learn yer lessons for tomorrow reluctantly the daughter of the royal navy glided away her uncles head followed her to the door where she dallied to catch a last impression of the young strangers lowering face and darted through farmer blaize laughed and chuckled she ant so fond of her uncle as that every day not that she ant a good nursethe kindest little soul youd meet of a winters walk shell read t ye and make drinks and sing too if ye likes it and she wont be tired a obstinate good un she be bless her the farmer may have designed by these eulogies of his niece to give his visitor time to recover his composure and establish a common topic his diversion only irritated and confused our shameeaten youth richards intention had been to come to the farmers threshold to summon the farmer thither and in a loud and haughty tone then and there to take upon himself the whole burden of the charge against tom bakewell he had strayed during his passage to belthorpe somewhat back to his old nature and his being compelled to enter the house of his enemy sit in his chair and endure an introduction to his family was more than he bargained for he commenced blinking hard in preparation for the horrible dose to which delay and the farmers cordiality added inconceivable bitters farmer blaize was quite at his ease nowise in a hurry he spoke of the weather and the harvest of recent doings up at the abbey glanced over that years cricketing hoped that no future feverel would lose a leg to the game richard saw and heard arson in it all he blinked harder as he neared the cup in a moment of silence he seized it with a gasp mr blaize i have come to tell you that i am the person who set fire to your rick the other night an odd consternation formed about the farmers mouth he changed his posture and said ay thats what yere come to tell me sir yes said richard firmly and that be all yes richard reiterated the farmer again changed his posture then my lad yeve come to tell me a lie farmer blaize looked straight at the boy undismayed by the dark flush of ire he had kindled you dare to call me a liar cried richard starting up i say the farmer renewed his first emphasis and smacked his thigh thereto thats a lie richard held out his clenched fist you have twice insulted me you have struck me you have dared to call me a liar i would have apologizedi would have asked your pardon to have got off that fellow in prison yes i would have degraded myself that another man should not suffer for my deed quite proper interposed the farmer and you take this opportunity of insulting me afresh youre a coward sir nobody but a coward would have insulted me in his own house sit ye down sit ye down young master said the farmer indicating the chair and cooling the outburst with his hand sit ye down dont ye be hasty if ye hadnt been hasty tother day we shd a been friends yet sit ye down sir i shd be sorry to reckon you out a liar mr feverel or anybody o your name i respects yer father though were oppsite politics im willin to think well o you what i say is that as you say ant the trewth mind i dont like you none the worse fort but it ant what is thats all you knows it as wells i richard disdaining to show signs of being pacified angrily reseated himself the farmer spoke sense and the boy after his late interview with austin had become capable of perceiving vaguely that a towering passion is hardly the justification for a wrong course of conduct come continued the farmer not unkindly what else have you to say here was the same bitter cup he had already once drained brimming at richards lips again alas poor human nature that empties to the dregs a dozen of these evil drinks to evade the single one which destiny less cruel had insisted upon the boy blinked and tossed it off i came to say that i regretted the revenge i had taken on you for your striking me farmer blaize nodded and now yeve done young gentleman still another cupful i should be very much obliged richard formally began but his stomach was turned he could but sip and sip and gather a distaste which threatened to make the penitential act impossible very much obliged he repeated much obliged if you would be so kind and it struck him that had he spoken this at first he would have given it a wording more persuasive with the farmer and more worthy of his own pride more honest in fact for a sense of the dishonesty of what he was saying caused him to cringe and simulate humility to deceive the farmer and the more he said the less he felt his words and feeling them less he inflated them more so kind he stammered so kind fancy a feverel asking this big brute to be so kind as to do me the favour me the favour to exert yourself its all to please austin to endeavour tohem to theres no saying it the cup was full as ever richard dashed at it again what i came to ask is whether you would have the kindness to try what you could do what an infamous shame to have to beg like this do to savedo to ensurewhether you would have the kindness it seemed out of all human power to gulp it down the draught grew more and more abhorrent to proclaim ones iniquity to apologize for ones wrongdoing thus much could be done but to beg a favour of the offended partythat was beyond the selfabasement any feverel could consent to pride however whose inevitable battle is against itself drew aside the curtains of poor toms prison crying a second time behold your benefactor and with the words burning in his ears richard swallowed the dose well then i want you mr blaizeif you dont mindwill you help me to get this man bakewell off his punishment to do farmer blaize justice he waited very patiently for the boy though he could not quite see why he did not take the gate at the first offer oh said he when he heard and had pondered on the request hum ha well see about it tmorrow but if hes innocent you know we shant makn guilty it was i did it richard declared the farmers halfamused expression sharpened a bit so young gentleman and youre sorry for the nights work i shall see that you are paid the full extent of your losses thankee said the farmer drily and if this poor man is released tomorrow i dont care what the amount is farmer blaize deflected his head twice in silence bribery one motion expressed corruption the other now said he leaning forward and fixing his elbows on his knees while he counted the case at his fingers ends excuse the liberty but wishin to know where this ere moneys to come from i shd like jest task if so be sir austin know o this my father knows nothing of it replied richard the farmer flung back in his chair lie number two said his shoulders soured by the british aversion to being plotted at and not dealt with openly and yeve the money ready young gentleman i shall ask my father for it and hell handt out certainly he will richard had not the slightest intention of ever letting his father into his counsels a good three hundred pounds ye know the farmer suggested no consideration of the extent of damages and the size of the sum affected young richard who said boldly he will not object when i tell him i want that sum it was natural farmer blaize should be a trifle suspicious that a youths guarantee would hardly be given for his fathers readiness to disburse such a thumping bill unless he had previously received his fathers sanction and authority hum said he why not a told him before the farmer threw an objectionable shrewdness into his query that caused richard to compress his mouth and glance high farmer blaize was positive twas a lie hum ye still hold tot you fired the rick he asked the blame is mine quoth richard with the loftiness of a patriot of old rome na na the straightforward briton put him aside ye didt or ye didnt dot did ye dot or no thrust in a corner richard said i did it farmer blaize reached his hand to the bell it was answered in an instant by little lucy who received orders to fetch in a dependent at belthorpe going by the name of the bantam and made her exit as she had entered with her eyes on the young stranger now said the farmer these be my principles im a plain man mr feverel above board with me and youll find me handsome try to circumvent me and im a ugly customer ill show you ive no animosity your father paysyou apologize thats enough for me let tom bakewell fightt out with the law and ill look on the law wasnt on the spot i suppose so the law aint much witness but i am leastwise the bantam is i tell you young gentleman the bantam sawt its no moral use whatever your denyin that evdence and wheres the good sir i ask what comes of t whether it be you or whether it be tom bakewellaint all one if i holds back aint it simlar its the trewth i want and heret comes added the farmer as miss lucy ushered in the bantam who presented a curious figure for that rare divinity to enliven chapter ix in build of body gait and stature giles jinkson the bantam was a tolerably fair representative of the punic elephant whose part with diverse anticipations the generals of the blaize and feverel forces from opposing ranks expected him to play giles surnamed the bantam on account of some forgotten sally of his youth or infancy moved and looked elephantine it sufficed that giles was well fed to assure that giles was faithfulif uncorrupted the farm which supplied to him ungrudging provender had all his vast capacity for work in willing exercise the farmer who held the farm his instinct reverenced as the fountain source of beef and bacon to say nothing of beer which was plentiful at belthorpe and good this farmer blaize well knew and he reckoned consequently that here was an animal always to be relied ona sort of human composition out of dog horse and bull a cut above each of these quadrupeds in usefulness and costing proportionately more but on the whole worth the money and therefore invaluable as everything worth its money must be to a wise man when the stealing of grain had been made known at belthorpe the bantam a fellowthresher with tom bakewell had shared with him the shadow of the guilt farmer blaize if he hesitated which to suspect did not debate a second as to which he would discard and when the bantam said he had seen tom secreting pilkins in a sack farmer blaize chose to believe him and off went poor tom told to rejoice in the clemency that spared his appearance at sessions the bantams small sleepy orbits saw many things and just at the right moment it seemed he was certainly the first to give the clue at belthorpe on the night of the conflagration and he may therefore have seen poor tom retreating stealthily from the scene as he averred he did lobourne had its say on the subject rustic lobourne hinted broadly at a young woman in the case and moreover told a tale of how these fellowthreshers had in noble rivalry one day turned upon each other to see which of the two threshed the best whereof the bantam still bore marks and malice it was said however there he stood and tugged his forelocks to the company and if truth really had concealed herself in him she must have been hard set to find her unlikeliest hidingplace now said the farmer marshalling forth his elephant with the confidence of one who delivers his ace of trumps tell this young gentleman what ye saw on the night of the fire bantam the bantam jerked a bit of a bow to his patron and then swung round fully obscuring him from richard richard fixed his eyes on the floor while the bantam in rudest doric commenced his narrative knowing what was to come and thoroughly nerved to confute the main incident richard barely listened to his barbarous locution but when the recital arrived at the point where the bantam affirmed he had seen tm baakll wis owen hoies richard faced him and was amazed to find himself being mutely addressed by a series of intensely significant grimaces signs and winks what do you mean why are you making those faces at me cried the boy indignantly farmer blaize leaned round the bantam to have a look at him and beheld the stolidest mask ever given to man baint makin no faces at nobody growled the sulky elephant the farmer commanded him to face about and finish a see tm baakll the bantam recommenced and again the contortions of a horrible wink were directed at richard the boy might well believe this churl was lying and he did and was emboldened to exclaim you never saw tom bakewell set fire to that rick the bantam swore to it grimacing an accompaniment i tell you said richard i put the lucifers there myself the suborned elephant was staggered he meant to telegraph to the young gentleman that he was loyal and true to certain gold pieces that had been given him and that in the right place and at the right time he should prove so why was he thus suspected why was he not understood a thowt i see un then muttered the bantam trying a middle course this brought down on him the farmer who roared thought ye thought what dye mean speak out and dont be thinkin thought what the devils that how could he see who it was on a pitchdark night richard put in thought the farmer bellowed louder thoughtdevil take ye when ye took ye oath ont hulloa what are ye screwin yer eye at mr feverel fori say young gentleman have you spoke to this chap before now i replied richard i have not seen him before farmer blaize grasped the two arms of the chair he sat on and glared his doubts come said he to the bantam speak out and ha done wit say what ye saw and none o yer thoughts damn yer thoughts ye saw tom bakewell fire that there rick the farmer pointed at some muskpots in the window what business ha you to be athinkin youre a witness thinkin ant evdence whatll ye say to morrow before magistrate mind what you says today youll stick by tomorrow thus adjured the bantam hitched his breech what on earth the young gentleman meant he was at a loss to speculate he could not believe that the young gentleman wanted to be transported but if he had been paid to help that why he would and considering that this days evidence rather bound him down to the morrows he determined after much ploughing and harrowing through obstinate shocks of hair to be not altogether positive as to the person it is possible that he became thereby more a mansion of truth than he previously had been for the night as he said was so dark that you could not see your hand before your face and though as he expressed it you might be mortal sure of a man you could not identify him upon oath and the party he had taken for tom bakewell and could have sworn to might have been the young gentleman present especially as he was ready to swear it upon oath so ended the bantam no sooner had he ceased than farmer blaize jumped up from his chair and made a fine effort to lift him out of the room from the point of his toe he failed and sank back groaning with the pain of the exertion and disappointment theyre liars every one he cried liars perjrers bribers and crruptersstop to the bantam who was slinking away youve done for yerself already you swore to it a dint said the bantam doggedly you swore tot the farmer vociferated afresh the bantam played a tune upon the handle of the door and still affirmed that he did not a double contradiction at which the farmer absolutely raged in his chair and was hoarse as he called out a third time that the bantam had sworn to it noa said the bantam ducking his poll noa he repeated in a lower note and then while a sombre grin betokening idiotic enjoyment of his profound casuistical quibble worked at his jaw not upn oath he added with a twitch of the shoulder and an angular jerk of the elbow farmer blaize looked vacantly at richard as if to ask him what he thought of englands peasantry after the sample they had there richard would have preferred not to laugh but his dignity gave way to his sense of the ludicrous and he let fly a shout the farmer was in no laughing mood he turned a wide eye back to the door lucky form he exclaimed seeing the bantam had vanished for his fingers itched to break that stubborn head he grew very puffy and addressed richard solemnly now look ye here mr feverel youve been atampering with my witness its no use denyin i say y ave sir you or some of ye i dont care about no feverel my witness there has been bribed the bantams been bribed and he shivered his pipe with an energetic thump on the tablebribed i knows it i could swear tot upon oath richard inquired with a grave face ay upon oath said the farmer not observing the impertinence id take my bible oath ont hes been corrupted my

old inclination to revolt my father knows of this said he very loudly and staring as he spoke right through the farmer who has played me false who would betray me to him it was austin no one knew it

about a poor man though hes a villain good afternoon sir richard marched hastily out of the room and through the garden never so much as deigning a glance at his wistful little guide who hung at the garden gate to watch him up the lane wondering a world of fancies about the handsome proud boy chapter x to have determined upon an act something akin to heroism in its way and to have fulfilled it by lying heartily and so subverting the whole structure built by good resolution seems a sad downfall if we forget what human nature in its green weedy spring is composed of young richard had quitted his cousin austin fully resolved to do his penance and drink the bitter cup and he had drunk it drained many cups to the dregs and it was to no purpose still they floated before him brimmed trebly bitter away from austins influence he was almost the same boy who had slipped the guinea into tom bakewells hand and the lucifers into farmer blaizes rick for good seed is long ripening a good boy is not made in a minute enough that the seed was in him he chafed on his road to raynham at the scene he had just endured and the figure of belthorpes fat tenant burnt like hot copper on the tablet of his brain insufferably condescending and what was worse in the right richard obscured as his minds eye was by wounded pride saw that clearly and hated his enemy for it the more heavy bensons tongue was knelling dinner as richard arrived at the abbey he hurried up to his room to dress accident or design had laid the book of sir austins aphorisms open on the dressingtable hastily combing his hair richard glanced down and read the dog returneth to his vomit the liar must eat his lie underneath was interjected in pencil the devils mouthful young richard ran downstairs feeling that his father had struck him in the face sir austin marked the scarlet stain on his sons cheekbones he sought the youths eye but richard would not look and sat conning his plate an abject copy of adrians succulent air at that employment how could he pretend to the relish of an epicure when he was painfully endeavouring to masticate the devils mouthful heavy benson sat upon the wretched dinner hippias usually the silent member as if awakened by the unnatural stillness became sprightly like the goatsucker owl at night and spoke much of his book his digestion and his dreams and was spared both by algernon and adrian one inconsequent dream he related about fancying himself quite young and rich and finding himself suddenly in a field cropping razors around him when just as he had by steps dainty as those of a french dancingmaster reached the middle he to his dismay beheld a path clear of the bloodthirsty steelcrop which he might have taken at first had he looked narrowly and there he was hippiass brethren regarded him with eyes that plainly said they wished he had remained there sir austin however drew forth his notebook and jotted down a reflection a composer of aphorisms can pluck blossoms even from a razorcrop was not hippiass dream the very counterpart of richards position he had he looked narrowly might have taken the clear path he too had been making dainty steps till he was surrounded by the grinning blades and from that text sir austin preached to his son when they were alone little clare was still too unwell to be permitted to attend the dessert and father and son were soon closeted together it was a strange meeting they seemed to have been separated so long the father took his sons hand they sat without a word passing between them silence said most the boy did not understand his father his father frequently thwarted him at times he thought his father foolish but that paternal pressure of his hand was eloquent to him of how warmly he was beloved he tried once or twice to steal his hand away conscious it was melting him the spirit of his pride and old rebellion whispered him to be hard unbending resolute hard he had entered his fathers study hard he had met his fathers eyes he could not meet them now his father sat beside him gently with a manner that was almost meekness so he loved this boy the poor gentlemans lips moved he was praying internally to god for him by degrees an emotion awoke in the boys bosom love is that blessed wand which wins the waters from the hardness of the heart richard fought against it for the dignity of old rebellion the tears would come hot and struggling over the dams of pride shamefully fast they began to fall he could no longer conceal them or check the sobs sir austin drew him nearer and nearer till the beloved head was on his breast an hour afterwards adrian harley austin wentworth and algernon feverel were summoned to the baronets study adrian came last there was a style of affable omnipotence about the wise youth as he slung himself into a chair and made an arch of the points of his fingers through which to gaze on his blundering kinsmen careless as one may be whose sagacity has foreseen and whose benevolent efforts have forestalled the point of danger at the threshold adrian crossed his legs and only intruded on their introductory remarks so far as to hum half audibly at intervals ripton and richard were two pretty men in parody of the old ballad young richards red eyes and the baronets ruffled demeanour told him that an explanation had taken place and a reconciliation that was well the baronet would now pay cheerfully adrian summed and considered these matters and barely listened when the baronet called attention to what he had to say which was elaborately to inform all present what all present very well knew that a rick had been fired that his son was implicated as an accessory to the fact that the perpetrator was now imprisoned and that richards family were as it seemed to him bound in honour to do their utmost to effect the mans release then the baronet stated that he had himself been down to belthorpe his son likewise and that he had found every disposition in blaize to meet his wishes the lamp which ultimately was sure to be lifted up to illumine the acts of this secretive race began slowly to dispread its rays and as statement followed statement they saw that all had known of the business that all had been down to belthorpe all save the wise youth adrian who with due deference and a sarcastic shrug objected to the proceeding as putting them in the hands of the man blaize his wisdom shone forth in an oration so persuasive and aphoristic that had it not been based on a plea against honour it would have made sir austin waver but its basis was expediency and the baronet had a better aphorism of his own to confute him with expediency is mans wisdom adrian harley doing right is gods adrian curbed his desire to ask sir austin whether an attempt to counteract the just working of the law was doing right the direct application of an aphorism was unpopular at raynham i am to understand then said he that blaize consents not to press the prosecution of course he wont algernon remarked confound him hell have his money and what does he want besides these agricultural gentlemen are delicate customers to deal with however if he really consents i have his promise said the baronet fondling his son young richard looked up to his father as if he wished to speak he said nothing and sir austin took it as a mute reply to his caresses and caressed him the more adrian perceived a reserve in the boys manner and as he was not quite satisfied that his chief should suppose him to have been the only idle and not the most acute and vigilant member of the family he commenced a crossexamination of him by asking who had last spoken with the tenant of belthorpe i think i saw him last murmured richard and relinquished his fathers hand adrian fastened on his prey and left him with a distinct and satisfactory assurance of his amicable intentions no said richard not the feverels joined in astounded chorus richard sidled away from his father and repeated a shamefaced no was he hostile inquired adrian smoothing his palms and smiling yes the boy confessed here was quite another view of their position adrian generally patient of results triumphed strongly at having evoked it and turned upon austin wentworth reproving him for inducing the boy to go down to belthorpe austin looked grieved he feared that richard had faded in his good resolve i thought it his duty to go he observed it was said the baronet emphatically and you see what comes of it sir adrian struck in these agricultural gentlemen i repeat are delicate customers to deal with for my part i would prefer being in the hands of a policeman we are decidedly collared by blaize what were his words ricky give it in his own doric he said he would transport tom bakewell adrian smoothed his palms and smiled again then they could afford to defy mr blaize he informed them significantly and made once more a mysterious allusion to the punic elephant bidding his relatives be at peace they were attaching in his opinion too much importance to richards complicity the man was a fool and a very extraordinary arsonite to have an accomplice at all it was a thing unknown in the annals of rickburning but one would be severer than law itself to say that a boy of fourteen had instigated to crime a fullgrown man at that rate the boy was father of the man with a vengeance and one might hear next that the baby was father of the boy they would find common sense a more benevolent ruler than poetical metaphysics when he had done austin with his customary directness asked him what he meant i confess adrian said the baronet hearing him expostulate with austins stupidity i for one am at a loss i have heard that this man bakewell chooses voluntarily not to inculpate my son seldom have i heard anything that so gratified me it is a view of innate nobleness in the rustics character which many a gentleman might take example from we are bound to do our utmost for the man and saying that he should pay a second visit to belthorpe to inquire into the reasons for the farmers sudden exposition of vindictiveness sir austin rose before he left the room algernon asked richard if the farmer had vouchsafed any reasons and the boy then spoke of the tampering with the witnesses and the bantams not upon oath which caused adrian to choke with laughter even the baronet smiled at so cunning a distinction as that involved in swearing a thing and not swearing it upon oath how little he exclaimed does one yeoman know another to elevate a distinction into a difference is the natural action of their minds i will point that out to blaize he shall see that the idea is native born richard saw his father go forth adrian too was ill at ease this trotting down to belthorpe spoils all said he the affair would pass over tomorrowblaize has no witnesses the old rascal is only standing out for more money no he isnt richard corrected him its not that im sure he believes his witnesses have been tampered with as he calls it what if they have boy adrian put it boldly the ground is cut from under his feet blaize told me that if my father would give his word there had been nothing of the sort he would take it my father will give his word then said adrian you had better stop him from going down austin looked at adrian keenly and questioned him whether he thought the farmer was justified in his suspicions the wise youth was not to be entrapped he had only been given to understand that the witnesses were tolerably unstable and like the bantam ready to swear lustily but not upon the book how given to understand he chose not to explain but he reiterated that the chief should not be allowed to go down to belthorpe sir austin was in the lane leading to the farm when he heard steps of some one running behind him it was dark and he shook off the hand that laid hold of his cloak roughly not recognizing his son its i sir said richard panting pardon me you mustnt go in there why not said the baronet putting his arm about him not now continued the boy i will tell you all tonight i must see the farmer myself it was my fault sir ii lied to himthe liar must eat his lie oh forgive me for disgracing you sir i did iti hope i did it to save tom bakewell let me go in alone and speak the truth go and i will wait for you here said his father the wind that bowed the old elms and shivered the dead leaves in the air had a voice and a meaning for the baronet during that halfhours lonely pacing up and down under the darkness awaiting his boys return the solemn gladness of his heart gave nature a tongue through the desolation flying overheadthe wailing of the mother of plenty across the bareswept landhe caught intelligible signs of the beneficent order of the universe from a heart newly confirmed in its grasp of the principle of human goodness as manifested in the dear child who had just left him confirmed in its belief in the ultimate victory of good within us without which nature has neither music nor meaning and is rock stone tree and nothing more in the dark the dead leaves beating on his face he had a word for his notebook there is for the mind but one grasp of happiness from that uppermost pinnacle of wisdom whence we see that this world is well designed chapter xi of all the chief actors in the bakewell comedy master ripton thompson awaited the fearful morning which was to decide toms fate in dolefullest mood and suffered the gravest mental terrors adrian on parting with him had taken casual occasion to speak of the position of the criminal in modern europe assuring him that international treaty now did what universal empire had aforetime done and that among atlantic barbarians now as among the scythians of old an offender would find precarious refuge and an emissary haunting him in the paternal home under the roofs of law and removed from the influence of his conscienceless young chief the staggering nature of the act he had put his hand to its awful felonious aspect overwhelmed ripton he saw it now for the first time why its next to murder he cried out to his amazed soul and wandered about the house with a prickly skin thoughts of america and commencing life afresh as an innocent gentleman had crossed his disordered brain he wrote to his friend richard proposing to collect disposable funds and embark in case of toms breaking his word or of accidental discovery he dared not confide the secret to his family as his leader had sternly enjoined him to avoid any weakness of that kind and being by nature honest and communicative the restriction was painful and melancholy fell upon the boy mama thompson attributed it to love the daughters of parchment rallied him concerning miss clare forey his hourly letters to raynham and silence as to everything and everybody there his nervousness and unwonted propensity to sudden inflammation of the cheeks were set down for sure signs of the passion miss letitia thompson the pretty and least parchmenty one destined by her papa for the heir of raynham and perfectly aware of her brilliant future up to which she had since riptons departure dressed and grimaced and studied cadences the latter with such success though not yet fifteen that she languished to her maid and melted the small factotum footmanmiss letty whose insatiable thirst for intimations about the young heir ripton could not satisfy tormented him daily in revenge and once quite unconsciously gave the lad a fearful turn for after dinner when mr thompson read the paper by the fire preparatory to sleeping at his accustomed post and mama thompson and her submissive female brood sat tasking the swift intricacies of the needle and emulating them with the tongue miss letty stole behind riptons chair and introduced between him and his book the latin initial letter large and illuminated of the theme she supposed to be absorbing him as it did herself the unexpected vision of this accusing captain of the alphabet this resplendent and haunting a fronting him bodily threw ripton straight back in his chair while guilt with her ancient indecision what colours to assume on detection flew from red to white from white to red across his fallen chaps letty laughed triumphantly amor the word she had in mind certainly has a connection with arson but the delivery of a letter into master riptons hands furnished her with other and likelier appearances to study for scarce had ripton plunged his head into the missive than he gave way to violent transports such as the healthyminded little damsel for all her languishing cadences deemed she really could express were a downright declaration to be made to her the boy did not stop at table quickly recollecting the presence of his family he rushed to his own room and now the girls ingenuity was taxed to gain possession of that letter she succeeded of course she being a huntress with few scruples and the game unguarded with the eyes of amazement she read this foreign matter dear riptonif tom had been committed i would have shot old blaize do you know my father was behind us that night when clare saw the ghost and heard all we said before the fire burst out it is no use trying to conceal anything from him well as you are in an awful state i will tell you all about it after you left ripton i had a conversation with austin and he persuaded me to go down to old blaize and ask him to help off tom i went for i would have done anything for tom after what he said to austin and i defied the old churl to do his worst then he said if my father paid the money and nobody had tampered with his witnesses he would not mind if tom did get off and he had his chief witness in called the bantam very like his master i think and the bantam began winking at me tremendously as you say and said he had sworn he saw tom bakewell but not upon oath he meant not on the bible he could swear to it but not on the bible i burst out laughing and you should have seen the rage old blaize was in it was splendid fun then we had a consultation at home austin rady my father uncle algernon who has come down to us again and your friend in prosperity and adversity rdf my father said he would go down to old blaize and give him the word of a gentleman we had not tampered with his witnesses and when he was gone we were all talking and rady says he must not see the farmer i am as certain as i live that it was rady bribed the bantam well i ran and caught up my father and told him not to go in to old blaize but i would and eat my words and tell him the truth he waited for me in the lane never mind what passed between me and old blaize he made me beg and pray of him not to press it against tom and then to complete it he brought in a little girl a niece of his and says to me shes your best friend after all and told me to thank her a little girl twelve years of age what business had she to mix herself up in my matters depend upon it ripton wherever there is mischief there are girls i think she had the insolence to notice my face and ask me not to be unhappy i was polite of course but i would not look at her well the morning came and tom was had up before sir miles papworth it was sir miles gout gave us the time or tom would have been had up before we could do anything adrian did not want me to go but my father said i should accompany him and held my hand all the time i shall be careful about getting into these scrapes again when you have done anything honourable you do not mind but getting among policemen and magistrates makes you ashamed of yourself sir miles was very attentive to my father and me and dead against tom we sat beside him and tom was brought in sir miles told my father that if there was one thing that showed a low villain it was rickburning what do you think of that i looked him straight in the face and he said to me he was doing me a service in getting tom committed and clearing the country of such fellows and rady began laughing i hate rady my father said his son was not in haste to inherit and have estates of his own to watch and sir miles laughed too i thought we were discovered at first then they began the examination of tom the tinker was the first witness and he proved that tom had spoken against old blaize and said something about burning his rick i wished i had stood in the lane to bursley with him alone our country lawyer we engaged for tom crossquestioned him and then he said he was not ready to swear to the exact words that had passed between him and tom i should think not then came another who swore he had seen tom lurking about the farmers grounds that night then came the bantam and i saw him look at rady i was tremendously excited and my father kept pressing my hand just fancy my being brought to feel that a word from that fellow would make me miserable for life and he must perjure himself to help me that comes of giving way to passion my father says when we do that we are calling in the devil as doctor well the bantam was told to state what he had seen and the moment he began rady who was close by me began to shake and he was laughing i knew though his face was as grave as sir miles you never heard such a rigmarole but i could not laugh he said he thought he was certain he had seen somebody by the rick and it was tom bakewell who was the only man he knew who had a grudge against farmer blaize and if the object had been a little bigger he would not mind swearing to tom and would swear to him for he was dead certain it was tom only what he saw looked smaller and it was pitchdark at the time he was asked what time it was he saw the person steal away from the rick and then he began to scratch his head and said suppertime then they asked what time he had supper and he said nine oclock by the clock and we proved that at nine oclock tom was drinking in the alehouse with the tinker at bursley and sir miles swore and said he was afraid he could not commit tom and when he heard that tom looked up at me and i say he is a noble fellow and no one shall sneer at tom while i live mind that well sir miles asked us to dine with him and tom was safe and i am to have him and educate him if i like for my servant and i will and i will give money to his mother and make her rich and he shall never repent he knew me i say rip the bantam must have seen me it was when i went to stick in the lucifers as we were all going home from sir miless at night he has lots of redfaced daughters but i did not dance with them though they had music and were full of fun and i did not care to i was so delighted and almost let it out when we left and rode home rady said to my father the bantam was not such a fool as he was thought and my father said one must be in a state of great personal exaltation to apply that epithet to any man and rady shut his mouth and i gave my pony a clap of the heel for joy i think my father suspects what rady did and does not approve of it and he need not have done it after all and might have spoilt it i have been obliged to order him not to call me ricky for he stops short at rick so that everybody knows what he means my dear austin is going to south america my pony is in capital condition my father is the cleverest and best man in the world clare is a little better i am quite happy i hope we shall meet soon my dear old rip and we will not get into any more tremendous scrapes will wei remain your sworn friend richard doria feverel ps i am to have a nice river yacht goodbye rip mind you learn to box mind you are not to show this to any of your friends on pain of my displeasure nb lady b was so angry when i told her that i had not come to her before she would do anything in the world for me i like her next best to my father and austin goodbye old rip poor little letitia after three perusals of this ingenuous epistle where the laws of punctuation were so disregarded resigned it to one of the pockets of her brother riptons best jacket deeply smitten with the careless composer and so ended the last act of the bakewell comedy in which the curtain closes with sir austins pointing out to his friends the beneficial action of the system in it from beginning to end chapter xii laying of ghosts is a public duty and as the mystery of the apparition that had frightened little clare was never solved on the stage of events at raynham where dread walked the abbey let us go behind the scenes a moment morally superstitious as the baronet was the character of his mind was opposed to anything like spiritual agency in the affairs of men and when the matter was made clear to him it shook off a weight of weakness and restored his mental balance so that from this time he went about more like the man he had once been grasping more thoroughly the great truth that this world is well designed nay he could laugh on hearing adrian in reminiscence of the ill luck of one of the family members at its first manifestation call the uneasy spirit algernons leg mrs doria was outraged she maintained that her child had seen not to believe in it was almost to rob her of her personal property after satisfactorily studying his old state of mind in her sir austin moved by pity took her aside one day and showed her that her ghost could write words in the flesh it was a letter from the unhappy lady who had given richard birthbrief cold lines simply telling him his house would be disturbed by her no more cold lines but penned by what heartbroken abnegation and underlying them with what anguish of soul like most who dealt with him lady feverel thought her husband a man fatally stern and implacable and she acted as silly creatures will act when they fancy they see a fate against them she neither petitioned for her right nor claimed it she tried to ease her hearts yearning by stealth and now she renounced all mrs doria not wanting in the family tenderness and softness shuddered at him for accepting the sacrifice so composedly but he bade her to think how distracting to this boy would be the sight of such relations between mother and father a few years and as man he should know and judge and love her let this be her penance not inflicted by me mrs doria bowed to the system for another not opining when it would be her turn to bow for herself further behind the scenes we observe rizzio and mary grown older much disenchanted she discrowned dishevelledhe with gouty fingers on a greasy guitar the diaper sandoe of promise lends his pen for small hires his fame has sunk his bodily girth has sensibly increased what he can do and will do is still his theme meantime the juice of the juniper is in requisition and it seems that those small hires cannot be performed without it returning from her wretched journey to her wretcheder home the lady had to listen to a mild reproof from easygoing diapera reproof so mild that he couched it in blank verse for seldom writing metrically now he took to talking it with a fluent sympathetic tear he explained to her that she was damaging her interests by these proceedings nor did he shrink from undertaking to elucidate wherefore pluming a smile upon his succulent mouth he told her that the poverty she lived in was utterly unbefitting her gentle nurture and that he had reason to believecould assure herthat an annuity was on the point of being granted her by her husband and diaper broke his bud of a smile into full flower as he delivered this information she learnt that he had applied to her husband for money it is hard to have ones prop of selfrespect cut away just when we are suffering a martyrs agony at the stake there was a five minutes tragic colloquy in the recesses behind the scenestotally tragic to diaper who had fondly hoped to bask in the warm sun of that annuity and reemerge from his state of grub the lady then wrote the letter sir austin held open to his sister the atmosphere behind the scenes is not wholesome so having laid the ghost we will return and face the curtain that infinitesimal dose of the world which master ripton thompson had furnished to the system with such instantaneous and surprising effect was considered by sir austin to have worked well and to be for the time quite sufficient so that ripton did not receive a second invitation to raynham and richard had no special intimate of his own age to rub his excessive vitality against and wanted none his hands were full enough with tom bakewell moreover his father and he were heart in heart the boys mind was opening and turned to his father affectionately reverent at this period when the young savage grows into higher influences the faculty of worship is foremost in him at this period jesuits will stamp the future of their chargeling flocks and all who bring up youth by a system and watch it know that it is the malleable moment boys possessing any mental or moral force to give them a tendency then predestinate their careers or if under supervision take the impress that is given them not often to cast it off and seldom to cast it off altogether in sir austins notebook was written between simple boyhood and adolescencethe blossoming seasonon the threshold of puberty there is one unselfish hoursay spiritual seedtime he took care that good seed should be planted in richard and that the most fruitful seed for a youth namely example should be of a kind to germinate in him the love of every form of nobleness i am only striving to make my son a christian he said answering them who persisted in expostulating with the system and to these instructions he gave an aim first be virtuous he told his son and then serve your country with heart and soul the youth was instructed to cherish an ambition for statesmanship and he and his father read history and the speeches of british orators to some purpose for one day sir austin found him leaning crosslegged and with his hand to his chin against a pedestal supporting the bust of chatham contemplating the hero of our parliament his eyes streaming with tears people said the baronet carried the principle of example so far that he only retained his boozing dyspeptic brother hippias at raynham in order to exhibit to his son the woeful retribution nature wreaked upon a life of indulgence poor hippias having now become a walking complaint this was unjust but there is no doubt he made use of every illustration to disgust or encourage his son that his neighbourhood afforded him and did not spare his brother for whom richard entertained a contempt in proportion to his admiration of his father and was for flying into penitential extremes which sir austin had to soften the boy prayed with his father morning and night how is it sir he said one night i cant get tom bakewell to pray does he refuse sir austin asked he seems to be ashamed to richard replied he wants to know what is the good and i dont know what to tell him im afraid it has gone too far with him said sir austin and until he has had some deep sorrows he will not find the divine want of prayer strive my son when you represent the people to provide for their education he feels everything now through a dull impenetrable rind culture is halfway to heaven tell him my son should he ever be brought to ask how he may know the efficacy of prayer and that his prayer will be answered tell him he quoted the pilgrims scrip who rises from prayer a better man his prayer is answered i will sir said richard and went to sleep happy happy in his father and in himself the youth now lived conscience was beginning to inhabit him and he carried some of the freightage known to men though in so crude a form that it overweighed him now on this side now on that the wise youth adrian observed these further progressionary developments in his pupil soberly cynical he was under sir austins interdict not to banter him and eased his acrid humours inspired by the sight of a felonious young rickburner turning saint by grave affectations of sympathy and extreme accuracy in marking the not widelydistant dates of his various changes the breadandwater phase lasted a fortnight the vegetarian an imitation of his cousin austin little better than a month the religious somewhat longer the religiouspropagandist when he was for converting the heathen of lobourne and burnley and the domestics of the abbey including tom bakewell longer still and hard to bearhe tried to convert adrian all the while tom was being exercised like a raw recruit richard had a drillsergeant from the nearest barracks down for him to give him a proper pride in himself and marched him to and fro with immense satisfaction and nearly broke his heart trying to get the roundshouldered rustic to take in the rudiments of letters for the boy had unbounded hopes for tom as a hero in grain richards pride also was cast aside he affected to be and really thought he was humble whereupon adrian as by accident imparted to him the fact that men were animals and he an animal with the rest of them i an animal cries richard in scorn and for weeks he was as troubled by this rudiment of selfknowledge as tom by his letters sir austin had him instructed in the wonders of anatomy to restore his selfrespect seedtime passed thus smoothly and adolescence came on and his cousin clare felt what it was to be of an opposite sex to him she too was growing but nobody cared how she grew outwardly even her mother seemed absorbed in the sprouting of the green offshoot of the feverel tree and clare was his handmaiden little marked by him lady blandish honestly loved the boy she would tell him if i had been a girl i would have had you for my husband and he with the frankness of his years would reply and how do you know i would have had you causing her to laugh and call him a silly boy for had he not heard her say she would have had him terrible words he knew not then the meaning of you dont read your fathers book she said her own copy was bound in purple velvet giltedged as decorative ladies like to have holier books and she carried it about with her and quoted it and adrian remarked to mrs doria hunted a noble quarry and deliberately aimed at him therewith which mrs doria chose to believe and regretted her brother would not be on his guard see here said lady blandish pressing an almondy fingernail to one of the aphorisms which instanced how age and adversity must clayenclose us ere we can effectually resist the magnetism of any human creature in our path can you understand it child richard informed her that when she read he could well then my squire she touched his cheek and ran her fingers through his hair learn as quick as you can not to be all hither and yon with a hundred different attractions as i was before i met a wise man to guide me is my father very wise richard asked i think so the lady emphasized her individual judgment do you richard broke forth and was stopped by a beating of his heart do iwhat she calmly queried i was going to say do youi mean i love him so much lady blandish smiled and slightly coloured they frequently approached this theme and always retreated from it always with the same beating of heart to richard accompanied by the sense of a growing mystery which however did not as yet generally disturb him life was made very pleasant to him at raynham as it was part of sir austins principle of education that his boy should be thoroughly joyous and happy and whenever adrian sent in a satisfactory report of his pupils advancement which he did pretty liberally diversions were planned just as prizes are given to diligent schoolboys and richard was supposed to have all his desires gratified while he attended to his studies the system flourished tall strong bloomingly healthy he took the lead of his companions on land and water and had more than one bondsman in his service besides ripton thompsonthe boy without a destiny perhaps the boy with a destiny was growing up a trifle too conscious of it his generosity to his occasional companions was princely but was exercised something too much in the manner of a prince and notwithstanding his contempt for baseness he would overlook that more easily than an offence to his pride which demanded an utter servility when it had once been rendered susceptible if richard had his followers he had also his feuds the papworths were as subservient as ripton but young ralph morton the nephew of mr morton and a match for richard in numerous promising qualities comprising the noble science of fisticuffs this youth spoke his mind too openly and moreover would not be snubbed there was no middle course for richards comrades between high friendship or absolute slavery he was deficient in those cosmopolite habits and feelings which enable boys and men to hold together without caring much for each other and like every insulated mortal he attributed the deficiency of which he was quite aware to the fact of his possessing a superior nature young ralph was a lively talker therefore argued richards vanity he had no intellect he was affable therefore he was frivolous the women liked him therefore he was a butterfly in fine young ralph was popular and our superb prince denied the privilege of despising ended by detesting him early in the days of their contention for leadership richard saw the absurdity of affecting to scorn his rival ralph was an eton boy and hence being robust a swimmer and a cricketer a swimmer and a cricketer is nowhere to be scorned in youths republic finding that manoeuvre would not do richard was prompted once or twice to entrench himself behind his greater wealth and his position but he soon abandoned that also partly because his chilliness to ridicule told him he was exposing himself and chiefly that his heart was too chivalrous and so he was dragged into the lists by ralph and experienced the luck of champions for cricket and for diving ralph bore away the belt richards middlestump tottered before his ball and he could seldom pick up more than three eggs underwater to ralphs halfdozen he was beaten too in jumping and running why will silly mortals strive to the painful pinnacles of championship or why once having reached them not have the magnanimity and circumspection to retire into private life immediately stung by his defeats richard sent one of his dependent papworths to poer hall with a challenge to ralph barthrop morton matching himself to swim across the thames and back once twice or thrice within a less time than he ralph barthrop morton would require for the undertaking it was accepted and a reply returned equally formal in the trumpeting of christian names wherein ralph barthrop morton acknowledged the challenge of richard doria feverel and was his man the match came off on a midsummer morning under the direction of captain algernon sir austin was a spectator from the cover of a plantation by the riverside unknown to his son and to the scandal of her sex lady blandish accompanied the baronet he had invited her attendance and she obeying her frank nature and knowing what the pilgrims scrip said about prudes at once agreed to view the match pleasing him mightily for was not here a woman worthy the golden ages of the world one who could look upon man as a creature divinely made and look with a mind neither tempted nor taunted by the serpent such a woman was rare sir austin did not discompose her by uttering his praises she was conscious of his approval only in an increased gentleness of manner and something in his voice and communications as if he were speaking to a familiar a very high compliment from him while the lads were standing ready for the signal to plunge from the steep decline of greensward into the shining waters sir austin called upon her to admire their beauty and she did and even advanced her head above his shoulder delicately in so doing and just as the start was given a bonnet became visible to richard young ralph was heels in air before he moved and then he dropped like lead he was beaten by several lengths the result of the match was unaccountable to all present and richards friends unanimously pressed him to plead a false start but though the youth with full confidence in his better style and equal strength had backed himself heavily against his rival and had lost his little riveryacht to ralph he would do nothing of the sort it was the bonnet had beaten him not ralph the bonnet typical of the mystery that caused his heart those violent palpitations was his dear detestable enemy and now as he progressed from mood to mood his ambition turned towards a field where ralph could not rival him and where the bonnet was etherealized and reigned glorious mistress a check to the pride of a boy will frequently divert him to the path where lie his subtlest powers richard gave up his companions servile or antagonistic he relinquished the material world to young ralph and retired into himself where he was growing to be lord of kingdoms where beauty was his handmaid and history his minister and time his ancient harper and sweet romance his bride where he walked in a realm vaster and more gorgeous than the great orient peopled with the heroes that have been for there is no princely wealth and no loftiest heritage to equal this early one that is made bountifully common to so many when the ripening blood has put a spark to the imagination and the earth is seen through rosy mists of a thousand freshawakened nameless and aimless desires panting for bliss and taking it as it comes making of any sight or sound perforce of the enchantment they carry with them a key to infinite because innocent pleasure the passions then are gambolling cubs not the ravaging gluttons they grow to they have their teeth and their talons but they neither tear nor bite they are in counsel and fellowship with the quickened heart and brain the whole sweet system moves to music something akin to the indications of a change in the spirit of his son which were now seen sir austin had marked down to be expected as due to his plan the blushes of the youth his long vigils his clinging to solitude his abstraction and downcast but not melancholy air were matters for rejoicing to the prescient gentleman for it comes said he to dr clifford of lobourne after consulting him medically on the youths behalf and being assured of his soundness it comes of a thoroughly sane condition the blood is healthy the mind virtuous neither instigates the other to evil and both are perfecting toward the flower of manhood if he reach that purein the untainted fulness and perfection of his natural powersi am indeed a happy father but one thing he will owe to me that at one period of his life he knew paradise and could read gods handwriting on the earth now those abominations whom you call precocious boysyour little pet monsters doctorand who can wonder that the world is what it is when it is full of themas they will have no divine time to look back upon in their own lives how can they believe in innocence and goodness or be other than sons of selfishness and the devil but my boy and the baronet dropped his voice to a key that was touching to hear my boy if he fall will fall from an actual region of purity he dare not be a sceptic as to that whatever his darkness he will have the guiding light of a memory behind him so much is secure to talk nonsense or poetry or the dash between the two in a tone of profound sincerity and to enunciate solemn discordances with received opinion so seriously as to convey the impression of a spiritual insight is the peculiar gift by which monomaniacs having first persuaded themselves contrive to influence their neighbours and through them to make conquest of a good half of the world for good or for ill sir austin had this gift he spoke as if he saw the truth and persisting in it so long he was accredited by those who did not understand him and silenced them that did we shall see was all the argument left to dr clifford and other unbelievers so far certainly the experiment had succeeded a comelier bracer better boy was nowhere to be met his promise was undeniable the vessel too though it lay now in harbour and had not yet been proved by the buffets of the elements on the great ocean had made a good trial trip and got well through stormy weather as the records of the bakewell comedy witnessed to at raynham no augury could be hopefuller the fates must indeed be hard the ordeal severe the destiny dark that could destroy so bright a spring but bright as it was the baronet relaxed nothing of his vigilant supervision he said to his intimates every act every fostered inclination almost every thought in this blossoming season bears its seed for the future the living tree now requires incessant watchfulness and acting up to his light sir austin did watch the youth submitted to an examination every night before he sought his bed professedly to give an account of his studies but really to recapitulate his moral experiences of the day he could do so for he was pure any wildness in him that his father noted any remoteness or richness of fancy in his expressions was set down as incidental to the blossoming season there is nothing like a theory for binding the wise sir austin despite his rigid watch and ward knew less of his son than the servant of his household and he was deaf as well as blind adrian thought it his duty to tell him that the youth was consuming paper lady blandish likewise hinted at his mooning propensities sir austin from his lofty watchtower of the system had foreseen it he said but when he came to hear that the youth was writing poetry his wounded heart had its reasons for being much disturbed surely said lady blandish you knew he scribbled a very different thing from writing poetry said the baronet no feverel has ever written poetry i dont think its a sign of degeneracy the lady remarked he rhymes very prettily to me a london phrenologist and a friendly oxford professor of poetry quieted sir austins fears the phrenologist said he was totally deficient in the imitative faculty and the professor that he was equally so in the rhythmic and instanced several consoling false quantities in the few effusions submitted to him added to this sir austin told lady blandish that richard had at his best done what no poet had ever been known to be capable of doing he had with his own hands and in cold blood committed his virgin manuscript to the flames which made lady blandish sigh forth poor boy killing ones darling child is a painful imposition for a youth in his blossoming season who fancies himself a poet to be requested to destroy his firstborn without a reason though to pretend a reason cogent enough to justify the request were a mockery is a piece of abhorrent despotism and richards blossoms withered under it a strange man had been introduced to him who traversed and bisected his skull with sagacious stiff fingers and crushed his soul while in an infallible voice declaring him the animal he was making him feel such an animal not only his blossoms withered his being seemed to draw in its shoots and twigs and when coupled thereunto the strange man having departed his work done his father in his tenderest manner stated that it would give him pleasure to see those same precocious utterly valueless scribblings among the cinders the last remaining mental blossoms spontaneously fell away richards spirit stood bare he protested not enough that it could be wished he would not delay a minute in doing it desiring his father to follow him he went to a drawer in his room and from a cleanlinen recess never suspected by sir austin the secretive youth drew out bundle after bundle each neatly tied named and numbered and pitched them into flames and so farewell my young ambition and with it farewell all true confidence between father and son chapter xiii it was now as sir austin had written it down the magnetic age the age of violent attractions when to hear mention of love is dangerous and to see it a communication of the disease people at raynham were put on their guard by the baronet and his reputation for wisdom was severely criticized in consequence of the injunctions he thought fit to issue through butler and housekeeper down to the lower household for the preservation of his son from any visible symptom of the passion a footman and two housemaids are believed to have been dismissed on the report of heavy benson that they were in or inclining to the state upon which an undercook and a dairymaid voluntarily threw up their places averring that they did not want no young men but to have their sex spied after by an old wretch like that indicating the ponderous butler was a little too much for a christian woman and then they were ungenerous enough to glance at bensons wellknown marital calamity hinting that some men met their deserts so intolerable did heavy bensons espionage become that raynham would have grown depopulated of its womankind had not adrian interfered who pointed out to the baronet what a fearful arm his butler was wielding sir austin acknowledged it despondently it only shows said he with a fine spirit of justice how all but impossible it is to legislate where there are women i do not object he added i hope i am too just to object to the exercise of their natural inclinations all i ask from them is discreetness ay said adrian whose discreetness was a marvel no gadding about in couples continued the baronet no kissing in public such occurrences no boy should witness whenever people of both sexes are thrown together they will be silly and where they are highfed uneducated and barely occupied it must be looked for as a matter of course let it be known that i only require discreetness discreetness therefore was instructed to reign at the abbey under adrians able tuition the fairest of its domestics acquired that virtue discreetness too was enjoined to the upper household sir austin who had not previously appeared to notice the case of lobournes hopeless curate now desired mrs doria to interdict or at least discourage his visits for the appearance of the man was that of an embodied sigh and groan really austin said mrs doria astonished to find her brother more awake than she had supposed i have never allowed him to hope let him see it then replied the baronet let him see it the man amuses me said mrs doria you know we have few amusements here we inferior creatures i confess i should like a barrelorgan better that reminds one of town and the opera and besides it plays more than one tune however since you think my society bad for him let him stop away with the selfdevotion of a woman she grew patient and sweet the moment her daughter clare was spoken of and the business of her life in view mrs dorias maternal heart had betrothed the two cousins richard and clare had already beheld them espoused and fruitful for this she yielded the pleasures of town for this she immured herself at raynham for this she bore with a thousand follies exactions inconveniences things abhorrent to her and heaven knows what forms of torture and selfdenial which are smilingly endured by that greatest of voluntary martyrsa mother with a daughter to marry mrs doria an amiable widow had surely married but for her daughter clare the ladys hair no woman could possess without feeling it her pride it was the daily theme of her ladysmaida natural aureole to her head she was gay witty still physically youthful enough to claim a destiny and she sacrificed it to accomplish her daughters sacrificed as with heroic scissors hair wit gaietylet us not attempt to enumerate how much more than may be said and she was only one of thousands thousands who have no portion of the heros reward for he may reckon on applause and condolence and sympathy and honour they poor slaves must look for nothing but the opposition of their own sex and the sneers of ours o sir austin had you not been so blinded what an aphorism might have sprung from this point of observation mrs doria was coolly told between sister and brother that during the magnetic age her daughters presence at raynham was undesirable instead of nursing offence her sole thought was the mountain of prejudice she had to contend against she bowed and said clare wanted seaairshe had never quite recovered the shock of that dreadful night how long mrs doria wished to know might the peculiar period be expected to last that said sir austin depends a year perhaps he is entering on it i shall be most grieved to lose you helen clare is nowhow old seventeen she is marriageable marriageable austin at seventeen dont name such a thing my child shall not be robbed of her youth our women marry early helen my child shall not the baronet reflected a moment he did not wish to lose his sister as you are of that opinion helen said he perhaps we may still make arrangements to retain you with us would you think it advisable to send clareshe should know disciplineto some establishment for a few months to an asylum austin cried mrs doria controlling her indignation as well as she could to some select superior seminary helen there are such to be found austin mrs doria exclaimed and had to fight with a moisture in her eyes unjust absurd she murmured the baronet thought it a natural proposition that clare should be a bride or a schoolgirl i cannot leave my child mrs doria trembled where she goes i go i am aware that she is only one of our sex and therefore of no value to the world but she is my child i will see poor dear that you have no cause to complain of her i thought sir austin remarked that you acquiesced in my views with regard to my son yesgenerally said mrs doria and felt culpable that she had not before and could not then tell her brother that he had set up an idol in his housean idol of flesh more retributive and abominable than wood or brass or gold but she had bowed to the idol too longshe had too entirely bound herself to gain her project by subserviency she had and she dimly perceived it committed a greater fault in tactics in teaching her daughter to bow to the idol also love of that kind richard took for tribute he was indifferent to clares soft eyes the parting kiss he gave her was ready and cold as his father could desire sir austin now grew eloquent to him in laudation of manly pursuits but richard thought his eloquence barren his attempts at companionship awkward and all manly pursuits and aims life itself vain and worthless to what end sighed the blossomless youth and cried aloud as soon as he was relieved of his fathers society what was the good of anything whatever he didwhichever path he selected led back to raynham and whatever he did however wretched and wayward he showed himself only confirmed sir austin more and more in the truth of his previsions tom bakewell now the youths groom had to give the baronet a report of his young masters proceedings in common with adrian and while there was no harm to tell tom spoke out he do ride like fire every day to pigs snout naming the highest hill in the neighbourhood and stand there and stare never movin like a mad un and then hoam agin all slack as if hed been beaten in a race by somebody there is no woman in that mused the baronet he would have ridden back as hard as he went reflected this profound scientific humanist had there been a woman in it he would shun vast expanses and seek shade concealment solitude the desire for distances betokens emptiness and undirected hunger when the heart is possessed by an image we fly to wood and forest like the guilty adrians report accused his pupil of an extraordinary access of cynicism exactly said the baronet as i foresaw at this period an insatiate appetite is accompanied by a fastidious palate nothing but the quintessences of existence and those in exhaustless supplies will satisfy this craving which is not to be satisfied hence his bitterness life can furnish no food fitting for him the strength and purity of his energies have reached to an almost divine height and roam through the inane poetry love and suchlike are the drugs earth has to offer to high natures as she offers to low ones debauchery tis a sign this sourness that he is subject to none of the empiricisms that are afloat now to keep him clear of them the titans had an easier task in storming olympus as yet however it could not be said that sir austins system had failed on the contrary it had reared a youth handsome intelligent wellbred and observed the ladies with acute emphasis innocent where they asked was such another young man to be found oh said lady blandish to sir austin if men could give their hands to women unsoiledhow different would many a marriage be she will be a happy girl who calls richard husband happy indeed was the baronets caustic ejaculation but where shall i meet one equal to him and his match i was innocent when i was a girl said the lady sir austin bowed a reserved opinion do you think no girls innocent sir austin gallantly thought them all so no that you know they are not said the lady stamping but they are more innocent than boys i am sure because of their education madam you see now what a youth can be perhaps when my system is published or ratherto speak more humblywhen it is practised the balance may be restored and we shall have virtuous young men its too late for poor me to hope for a husband from one of them said the lady pouting and laughing it is never too late for beauty to waken love returned the baronet and they trifled a little they were approaching daphnes bower which they entered and sat there to taste the coolness of a descending midsummer day the baronet seemed in a humour for dignified fooling the lady for serious converse i shall believe again in arthurs knights she said when i was a girl i dreamed of one and he was in quest of the san greal if you like and showed his good taste by turning aside for the more tangible san blandish of course you consider it would have been so sighed the lady ruffling i can only judge by our generation said sir austin with a bend of homage the lady gathered her mouth either we are very mighty or you are very weak both madam but whatever we are and if we are bad bad we love virtue and truth and lofty souls in men and when we meet those qualities in them we are constant and would die for themdie for them ah you know men but not women the knights possessing such distinctions must be young i presume said sir austin old or young but if old they are scarce capable of enterprise they are loved for themselves not for their deeds ah yesah said the lady intellect may subdue womenmake slaves of them and they worship beauty perhaps as much as you do but they only love for ever and are mated when they meet a noble nature sir austin looked at her wistfully and did you encounter the knight of your dream not then she lowered her eyelids it was prettily done and how did you bear the disappointment my dream was in the nursery the day my frock was lengthened to a gown i stood at the altar i am not the only girl that has been made a woman in a day and given to an ogre instead of a true knight good god exclaimed sir austin women have much to bear here the couple changed characters the lady became gay as the baronet grew earnest you know it is our lot she said and we are allowed many amusements if we fulfil our duty in producing children that like our virtue is its own reward then as a widow i have wonderful privileges to preserve which you remain a widow certainly she responded i have no trouble now in patching and piecing that rag the world callsa character i can sit at your feet every day unquestioned to be sure others do the same but they are female eccentrics and have cast off the rag altogether sir austin drew nearer to her you would have made an admirable mother madam this from sir austin was very like positive wooing it is he continued ten thousand pities that you are not one do you think so she spoke with humility i would he went on that heaven had given you a daughter would you have thought her worthy of richard our blood madam should have been one the lady tapped her toe with her parasol but i am a mother she said richard is my son yes richard is my boy she reiterated sir austin most graciously appended call him ours madam and held his head as if to catch the word from her lips which however she chose to refuse or defer they made the coloured west a common point for their eyes and then sir austin said as you will not say ours let me and as you have therefore an equal claim on the boy i will confide to you a project i have lately conceived the announcement of a project hardly savoured of a coming proposal but for sir austin to confide one to a woman was almost tantamount to a declaration so lady blandish thought and so said her soft deepeyed smile as she perused the ground while listening to the project it concerned richards nuptials he was now nearly eighteen he was to marry when he was fiveandtwenty meantime a young lady some years his junior was to be sought for in the homes of england who would be every way fitted by education instincts and bloodon each of which qualifications sir austin unreservedly enlargedto espouse so perfect a youth and accept the honourable duty of assisting in the perpetuation of the feverels the baronet went on to say that he proposed to set forth immediately and devote a couple of months to the first essay in his coelebite search i fear said lady blandish when the project had been fully unfolded you have laid down for yourself a difficult task you must not be too exacting i know it the baronets shake of the head was piteous even in england she will be rare but i confine myself to no class if i ask for blood it is for untainted not what you call high blood i believe many of the middle classes are frequently more carefulmore purebloodedthan our aristocracy show me among them a godfearing family who educate their childreni should prefer a girl without brothers and sistersas a christian damsel should be educatedsay on the model of my son and she may be penniless i will pledge her to richard feverel lady blandish bit her lip and what do you do with richard while you are absent on this expedition oh said the baronet he accompanies his father then give it up his future bride is now pinafored and breadandbuttery she romps she cries she dreams of play and pudding how can he care for her he thinks more at his age of old women like me he will be certain to kick against her and destroy your plan believe me sir austin ay ay do you think that said the baronet lady blandish gave him a multitude of reasons ay true he muttered adrian said the same he must not see her how could i think of it the child is naked woman he would despise her naturally naturally echoed the lady then madam and the baronet rose there is one thing for me to determine upon i must for the first time in his life leave him will you indeed said the lady it is my duty having thus brought him up to see that he is properly matednot wrecked upon the quicksands of marriage as a youth so delicately trained might be more easily than another betrothed he will be safe from a thousand snares i may i think leave him for a term my precautions have saved him from the temptations of his season and under whose charge will you leave him lady blandish inquired she had emerged from the temple and stood beside sir austin on the upper steps under a clear summer twilight madam he took her hand and his voice was gallant and tender under whose but yours as the baronet said this he bent above her hand and raised it to his lips lady blandish felt that she had been wooed and asked in wedlock she did not withdraw her hand the baronets salute was flatteringly reverent he deliberated over it as one going through a grave ceremony and he the scorner of women had chosen her for his homage lady blandish forgot that she had taken some trouble to arrive at it she received the exquisite compliment in all its unique honeysweet for in love we must deserve nothing or the fine bloom of fruition is gone the ladys hand was still in durance and the baronet had not recovered from his profound inclination when a noise from the neighbouring beechwood startled the two actors in this courtly pantomime they turned their heads and beheld the hope of raynham on horseback surveying the scene the next moment he had galloped away chapter xiv all night richard tossed on his bed with his heart in a rapid canter and his brain bestriding it traversing the rich untasted world and the great realm of mystery from which he was now restrained no longer months he had wandered about the gates of the bonnet wondering sighing knocking at them and getting neither admittance nor answer he had the key now his own father had given it to him his heart was a lightning steed and bore him on and on over limitless regions bathed in superhuman beauty and strangeness where cavaliers and ladies leaned whispering upon close green swards and knights and ladies cast a splendour upon savage forests and tilts and tourneys were held in golden courts lit to a glorious day by ladies eyes one pair of which dimly visioned constantly distinguishable followed him through the boskage and dwelt upon him in the press beaming while he bent above a hand glittering white and fragrant as the frosted blossom of a may night awhile the heart would pause and flutter to a shock he was in the act of consummating all earthly bliss by pressing his lips to the small white hand only to do that and die cried the magnetic youth to fling the jewel of life into that one cup and drink it off he was intoxicated by anticipation for that he was born there was then some end in existence something to live for to kiss a womans hand and die he would leap from the couch and rush to pen and paper to relieve his swarming sensations scarce was he seated when the pen was dashed aside the paper sent flying with the exclamation have i not sworn i would never write again sir austin had shut that safetyvalve the nonsense that was in the youth might have poured harmlessly out and its urgency for ebullition was so great that he was repeatedly oblivious of his oath and found himself seated under the lamp in the act of composition before pride could speak a word possibly the pride even of richard feverel had been swamped if the act of composition were easy at such a time and a single idea could stand clearly foremost but myriads were demanding the first place chaotic hosts like ranks of stormy billows pressed impetuously for expression and despair of reducing them to form quite as much as pride to which it pleased him to refer his incapacity threw down the powerless pen and sent him panting to his outstretched length and another headlong career through the rosygirdled land toward morning the madness of the fever abated somewhat and he went forth into the air a lamp was still burning in his fathers room and richard thought as he looked up that he saw the evervigilant head on the watch instantly the lamp was extinguished the window stood cold against the hues of dawn strong pulling is an excellent medical remedy for certain classes of fever richard took to it instinctively the clear fresh water burnished with sunrise sparkled against his arrowy prow the soft deep shadows curled smiling away from his gliding keel overhead solitary morning unfolded itself from blossom to bud from bud to flower still delicious changes of light and colour to whose influences he was heedless as he shot under willows and aspens and across sheets of riverreaches pure mirrors to the upper glory himself the sole tenant of the stream somewhere at the founts of the world lay the land he was rowing toward something of its shadowed lights might be discerned here and there it was not a dream now he knew there was a secret abroad the woods were full of it the waters rolled with it and the winds oh why could not one in these days do some high knightly deed which should draw down ladies eyes from their heaven as in the days of arthur to such a meaning breathed the unconscious sighs of the youth when he had pulled through his first feverish energy he was off bursley and had lapsed a little into that musing quietude which follows strenuous exercise when he heard a hail and his own name called it was no lady no fairy but young ralph morton an irruption of miserable masculine prose heartily wishing him abed with the rest of mankind richard rowed in and jumped ashore ralph immediately seized his arm saying that he desired earnestly to have a talk with him and dragged the magnetic youth from his waterdreams up and down the wet mown grass that he had to say seemed to be difficult of utterance and richard though he barely listened soon had enough of his old rivals gladness at seeing him and exhibited signs of impatience whereat ralph as one who branches into matter somewhat foreign to his mind but of great human interest and importance put the question to him i say what womans name do you like best i dont know any quoth richard indifferently why are you out so early in answer to this ralph suggested that the name of mary might be considered a pretty name richard agreed that it might be the housekeeper at raynham half the women cooks and all the housemaids enjoyed that name the name of mary was equivalent for women at home yes i know said ralph we have lots of marys its so common oh i dont like mary best what do you think richard thought it just like another do you know ralph continued throwing off the mask and plunging into the subject id do anything on earth for some namesone or two its not mary nor lucy clarindas pretty but its like a novel claribel i like names beginning with cl i prefer the cls are always gentle and lovely girls you would die for dont you think so richard had never been acquainted with any of them to inspire that emotion indeed these urgent appeals to his fancy in feminine names at five oclock in the morning slightly surprised him though he was but half awake to the outer world by degrees he perceived that ralph was changed instead of the lusty boisterous boy his rival in manly sciences who spoke straightforwardly and acted up to his speech here was an abashed and blushpersecuted youth who sued piteously for a friendly ear wherein to pour the one idea possessing him gradually too richard apprehended that ralph likewise was on the frontiers of the realm of mystery perhaps further toward it than he himself was and then as by a sympathetic stroke was revealed to him the wonderful beauty and depth of meaning in feminine names the theme appeared novel and delicious fitted to the season and the hour but the hardship was that richard could choose none from the number all were the same to him he loved them all dont you really prefer the cls said ralph persuasively not better than the names ending in a and y richard replied wishing he could for ralph was evidently ahead of him come under these trees said ralph and under the trees ralph unbosomed his name was down for the army eton was quitted for ever in a few months he would have to join his regiment and before he left he must say goodbye to his friends would richard tell him mrs foreys address he had heard she was somewhere by the sea richard did not remember the address but said he would willingly take charge of any letter and forward it ralph dived his hand into his pocket here it is but dont let anybody see it my aunts name is not clare said richard perusing what was composed of the exterior formula youve addressed it to clare herself that was plain to see emmeline clementina matilda laura countess blandish richard continued in a low tone transferring the names and playing on the musical strings they were to him then he said names of ladies how they sweeten their names he fixed his eyes on ralph if he discovered anything further he said nothing but bade the good fellow goodbye jumped into his boat and pulled down the tide the moment ralph was hidden by an abutment of the banks richard perused the address for the first time it struck him that his cousin clare was a very charming creature he remembered the look of her eyes and especially the last reproachful glance she gave him at parting what business had ralph to write to her did she not belong to richard feverel he read the words again and again clare doria forey why clare was the name he liked bestnay he loved it doria tooshe shared his own name with him away went his heart not at a canter now at a gallop as one who sights the quarry he felt too weak to pull clare doria foreyoh perfect melody sliding with the tide he heard it fluting in the bosom of the hills when nature has made us ripe for love it seldom occurs that the fates are behindhand in furnishing a temple for the flame above greenflashing plunges of a weir and shaken by the thunder below lilies golden and white were swaying at anchor among the reeds meadowsweet hung from the banks thick with weed and trailing bramble and there also hung a daughter of earth her face was shaded by a broad straw hat with a flexible brim that left her lips and chin in the sun and sometimes nodding sent forth a light of promising eyes across her shoulders and behind flowed large loose curls brown in shadow almost golden where the ray touched them she was simply dressed befitting decency and the season on a closer inspection you might see that her lips were stained this blooming young person was regaling on dewberries they grew between the bank and the water apparently she found the fruit abundant for her hand was making pretty progress to her mouth fastidious youth which revolts at woman plumping her exquisite proportions on breadandbutter and would we must suppose joyfully have her scraggy to have her poetical can hardly object to dewberries indeed the act of eating them is dainty and induces musing the dewberry is a sister to the lotus and an innocent sister you eat mouth eye and hand are occupied and the undrugged mind free to roam and so it was with the damsel who knelt there the little skylark went up above her all song to the smooth southern cloud lying along the blue from a dewy copse dark over her nodding hat the blackbird fluted calling to her with thrice mellow note the kingfisher flashed emerald out of green osiers a bowwinged heron travelled aloft seeking solitude a boat slipped toward her containing a dreamy youth and still she plucked the fruit and ate and mused as if no fairy prince were invading her territories and as if she wished not for one or knew not her wishes surrounded by the green shaven meadows the pastoral summer buzz the weirfalls thundering white amid the breath and beauty of wild flowers she was a bit of lovely human life in a fair setting a terrible attraction the magnetic youth leaned round to note his proximity to the weirpiles and beheld the sweet vision stiller and stiller grew nature as at the meeting of two electric clouds her posture was so graceful that though he was making straight for the weir he dared not dip a scull just then one enticing dewberry caught her eyes he was floating by unheeded and saw that her hand stretched low and could not gather what it sought a stroke from his right brought him beside her the damsel glanced up dismayed and her whole shape trembled over the brink richard sprang from his boat into the water pressing a hand beneath her foot which she had thrust against the crumbling wet sides of the bank to save herself he enabled her to recover her balance and gain safe earth whither he followed her chapter xv he had landed on an island of the stillvexed bermoothes the world lay wrecked behind him raynham hung in mists remote a phantom to the vivid reality of this white hand which had drawn him thither away thousands of leagues in an eyetwinkle hark how ariel sang overhead what splendour in the heavens what marvels of beauty about his enchanted brows and o you wonder fair flame by whose light the glories of being are now first seenradiant miranda prince ferdinand is at your feet or is it adam his rib taken from his side in sleep and thus transformed to make him behold his paradise and lose it the youth looked on her with as glowing an eye it was the first woman to him and shemankind was all caliban to her saving this one princely youth so to each other said their changing eyes in the moment they stood together he pale and she blushing she was indeed sweetly fair and would have been held fair among rival damsels on a magic shore and to a youth educated by a system strung like an arrow drawn to the head he it might be guessed could fly fast and far with her the soft rose in her cheeks the clearness of her eyes bore witness to the bodys virtue and health and happy blood were in her bearing had she stood before sir austin among rival damsels that scientific humanist for the consummation of his system would have thrown her the handkerchief for his son the wide summerhat nodding over her forehead to her brows seemed to flow with the flowing heavy curls and those firethreaded mellow curls only halfcurls waves of hair call them rippling at the ends went like a sunny redveined torrent down her back almost to her waist a glorious vision to the youth who embraced it as a flower of beauty and read not a feature there were curious features of colour in her face for him to have read her brows thick and brownish against a soft skin showing the action of the blood met in the bend of a bow extending to the temples long and level you saw that she was fashioned to peruse the sights of earth and by the pliability of her brows that the wonderful creature used her faculty and was not going to be a statue to the gazer under the dark thick brows an arch of lashes shot out giving a wealth of darkness to the full frank blue eyes a mystery of meaningmore than brain was ever meant to fathom richer henceforth than all mortal wisdom to prince ferdinand for when nature turns artist and produces contrasts of colour on a fair face where is the sage or what the oracle shall match the depth of its lightest look prince ferdinand was also fair in his slim boatingattire his figure looked heroic his hair rising from the parting to the right of his forehead in what his admiring lady blandish called his plume fell away slanting silkily to the temples across the nearly imperceptible upward curve of his brows therefelt more than seen so slight it wasand gave to his profile a bold beauty to which his bashful breathless air was a flattering charm an arrow drawn to the head capable of flying fast and far with her he leaned a little forward drinking her in with all his eyes and young love has a thousand then truly the system triumphed just ere it was to fall and could sir austin have been content to draw the arrow to the head and let it fly when it would fly he might have pointed to his son again and said to the world match him such keen bliss as the youth had in the sight of her an innocent youth alone has powers of soul in him to experience o women says the pilgrims scrip in one of its solitary outbursts women who like and will have for hero a rake how soon are you not to learn that you have taken bankrupts to your bosoms and that the putrescent gold that attracted you is the slime of the lake of sin if these two were ferdinand and miranda sir austin was not prospero and was not present or their fates might have been different so they stood a moment changing eyes and then miranda spoke and they came down to earth feeling no less in heaven she spoke to thank him for his aid she used quite common simple words and used them no doubt to express a common simple meaning but to him she was uttering magic casting spells and the effect they had on him was manifested in the incoherence of his replies which were too foolish to be chronicled the couple were again mute suddenly miranda with an exclamation of anguish and innumerable lights and shadows playing over her lovely face clapped her hands crying aloud my book my book and ran to the bank prince ferdinand was at her side what have you lost he said my book she answered her delicious curls swinging across her shoulders to the stream then turning to him oh no no let me entreat you not to she said i do not so very much mind losing it and in her eagerness to restrain him she unconsciously laid her gentle hand upon his arm and took the force of motion out of him indeed i do not really care for the silly book she continued withdrawing her hand quickly and reddening pray do not the young gentleman had kicked off his shoes no sooner was the spell of contact broken than he jumped in the water was still troubled and discoloured by his introductory adventure and though he ducked his head with the spirit of a dabchick the book was missing a scrap of paper floating from the bramble just above the water and looking as if fire had caught its edges and it had flown from one adverse element to the other was all he could lay hold of and he returned to land disconsolately to hear mirandas murmured mixing of thanks and pretty expostulations let me try again he said no indeed she replied and used the awful threat i will run away if you do which effectually restrained him her eye fell on the firestained scrap of paper and brightened as she cried there there you have what i want it is that i do not care for the book no please you are not to look at it give it me before her playfully imperative injunction was fairly spoken richard had glanced at the document and discovered a griffin between two wheatsheaves his crest in silver and belowo wonderment immense his own handwriting he handed it to her she took it and put it in her bosom who would have thought that where all else perished odes idyls lines stanzas this one sonnet to the stars should be miraculously reserved for such a starry fatepassing beatitude as they walked silently across the meadow richard strove to remember the hour and the mood of mind in which he had composed the notable production the stars were invoked as seeing and foreseeing all to tell him where then his love reclined and so forth hesper was complacent enough to do so and described her in a couplet through sunsets amber see me shining fair as her blue eyes shine through her golden hair and surely no words could be more prophetic here were two blue eyes and golden hair and by some strange chance that appeared like the working of a divine finger she had become the possessor of the prophecy she that was to fulfil it the youth was too charged with emotion to speak doubtless the damsel had less to think of or had some trifling burden on her conscience for she seemed to grow embarrassed at last she drew up her chin to look at her companion under the nodding brim of her hat and the action gave her a charmingly freakish air crying but where are you going to you are wet through let me thank you again and pray leave me and go home and change instantly wet replied the magnetic muser with a voice of tender interest not more than one foot i hope i will leave you while you dry your stockings in the sun at this she could not withhold a shy laugh not i but you you would try to get that silly book for me and you are dripping wet are you not very uncomfortable in all sincerity he assured her that he was not and you really do not feel that you are wet he really did not and it was a fact that he spoke truth she pursed her dewberry mouth in the most comical way and her blue eyes lightened laughter out of the halfclosed lids i cannot help it she said her mouth opening and sounding harmonious bells of laughter in his ears pardon me wont you his face took the same soft smiling curves in admiration of her not to feel that you have been in the water the very moment after she musically interjected seeing she was excused its true he said and his own gravity then touched him to join a duet with her which made them no longer feel strangers and did the work of a month of intimacy better than sentiment laughter opens the breast to love opens the whole breast to his full quiver instead of a corner here and there for a solitary arrow hail the occasion propitious o british young and laugh and treat love as an honest god and dabble not with the sentimental rouge these two laughed and the souls of each cried out to other it is i it is i they laughed and forgot the cause of their laughter and the sun dried his light river clothing and they strolled toward the blackbirds copse and stood near a stile in sight of the foam of the weir and the manycoloured rings of eddies streaming forth from it richards boat meanwhile had contrived to shoot the weir and was swinging bottom upward broadside with the current down the rapid backwater will you let it go said the damsel eying it curiously it cant be stopped he replied and could have added what do i care for it now his old life was whirled away with it dead drowned his new life was with her alive divine she flapped low the brim of her hat you must really not come any farther she softly said and will you go and not tell me who you are he asked growing bold as the fears of losing her came across him and will you not tell me before you gohis face burnedhow you came by thatthat paper she chose to select the easier question for answer you ought to know me we have been introduced sweet was her winning offhand affability then who in heavens name are you tell me i never could have forgotten you you have i think she said impossible that we could ever have met and i forget you she looked up at him do you remember belthorpe belthorpe belthorpe quoth richard as if he had to touch his brain to recollect there was such a place do you mean old blaizes farm then i am old blaizes niece she tripped him a soft curtsey the magnetized youth gazed at her by what magic was it that this divine sweet creature could be allied with that old churl then whatwhat is your name said his mouth while his eyes added o wonderful creature how came you to enrich the earth have you forgot the desboroughs of dorset too she peered at him from a sidebend of the flapping brim the desboroughs of dorset a light broke in on him and have you grown to this that little girl i saw there he drew close to her to read the nearest features of the vision she could no more laugh off the piercing fervour of his eyes her volubility fluttered under his deeply wistful look and now neither voice was high and they were mutually constrained you see she murmured we are old acquaintances richard with his eyes still intently fixed on her returned you are very beautiful the words slipped out perfect simplicity is unconsciously audacious her overpowering beauty struck his heart and like an instrument that is touched and answers to the touch he spoke miss desborough made an effort to trifle with this terrible directness but his eyes would not be gainsaid and checked her lips she turned away from them her bosom a little rebellious praise so passionately spoken and by one who has been a damsels first dream dreamed of nightly many long nights and clothed in the virgin silver of her thoughts in bud praise from him is coin the heart cannot reject if it would she quickened her steps i have offended you said a mortally wounded voice across her shoulder that he should think so were too dreadful oh no no you would never offend me she gave him her whole sweet face then whywhy do you leave me because she hesitated i must go no you must not go why must you go do not go indeed i must she said pulling at the obnoxious broad brim of her hat and interpreting a pause he made for his assent to her rational resolve shyly looking at him she held her hand out and said goodbye as if it were a natural thing to say the hand was pure whitewhite and fragrant as the frosted blossom of a maynight it was the hand whose shadow cast before he had last night bent his head reverentially above and kissedresigning himself thereupon over to execution for payment of the penalty of such daringby such bliss well rewarded he took the hand and held it gazing between her eyes goodbye she said again as frankly as she could and at the same time slightly compressing her fingers on his in token of adieu it was a signal for his to close firmly upon hers you will not go pray let me she pleaded her sweet brows suing in wrinkles you will not go mechanically he drew the white hand nearer his thumping heart i must she faltered piteously you will not go oh yes yes tell me do you wish to go the question was a subtle one a moment or two she did not answer and then forswore herself and said yes do youyou wish to go he looked with quivering eyelids under hers a fainter yes responded you wishwish to leave me his breath went with the words indeed i must her hand became a closer prisoner all at once an alarming delicious shudder went through her frame from him to her it coursed and back from her to him forward and back loves electric messenger rushed from heart to heart knocking at each till it surged tumultuously against the bars of its prison crying out for its mate they stood trembling in unison a lovely couple under these fair heavens of the morning when he could get his voice it said will you go but she had none to reply with and could only mutely bend upward her gentle wrist then farewell he said and dropping his lips to the soft fair hand kissed it and hung his head swinging away from her ready for death strange that now she was released she should linger by him strange that his audacity instead of the executioner brought blushes and timid tenderness to his side and the sweet words you are not angry with me with you o beloved cried his soul and you forgive me fair charity i think it was rude of me to go without thanking you again she said and again proffered her hand the sweet heavenbird shivered out his song above him the gracious glory of heaven fell upon his soul he touched her hand not moving his eyes from her nor speaking and she with a soft word of farewell passed across the stile and up the pathway through the dewy shades of the copse and out of the arch of the light away from his eyes and away with her went the wild enchantment he looked on barren air but it was no more the world of yesterday the marvellous splendours had sown seeds in him ready to spring up and bloom at her gaze and in his bosom now the vivid conjuration of her tones her face her shape makes them leap and illumine him like fitful summer lightningsghosts of the vanished sun there was nothing to tell him that he had been making love and declaring it with extraordinary rapidity nor did he know it soft flushed cheeks sweet mouth strange sweet brows eyes of softest fire how could his ripe eyes behold you and not plead to keep you nay how could he let you go and he seriously asked himself that question tomorrow this place will have a memorythe river and the meadow and the white falling weir his heart will build a temple here and the skylark will be its highpriest and the old blackbird its glossygowned chorister and there will be a sacred repast of dewberries today the grass is grass his heart is chased by phantoms and finds rest nowhere only when the most tender freshness of his flower comes across him does he taste a moments calm and no sooner does it come than it gives place to keen pangs of fear that she may not be his for ever erelong he learns that her name is lucy erelong he meets ralph and discovers that in a day he has distanced him by a sphere he and ralph and the curate of lobourne join in their walks and raise classical discussions on ladies hair fingering a thousand delicious locks from those of cleopatra to the borgias fair fair all of them fair sighs the melancholy curate as are those women formed for our perdition i think we have in this country what will match the italian or the greek his mind flutters to mrs doria richard blushes before the vision of lucy and ralph whose heroines hair is a dark luxuriance dissents and claims a noble share in the slaughter of men for darkhaired wonders they have no mutual confidences but they are singularly kind to each other these three children of instinct chapter xvi lady blandish and others who professed an interest in the fortunes and future of the systematized youth had occasionally mentioned names of families whose alliance according to apparent calculations would not degrade his blood and over these names secretly preserved on an open leaf of the notebook sir austin as he neared the metropolis distantly dropped his eye there were names historic and names mushroomic names that the conqueror might have called in his musterroll names that had been clearly tossed into the upper stratum of civilized lifer by a millwheel or a merchantstool against them the baronet had written m or po or prsignifying money position principles favouring the latter with special brackets the wisdom of a worldly man which he could now and then adopt determined him before he commenced his round of visits to consult and sound his solicitor and his physician thereanent lawyers and doctors being the rats who know best the merits of a house and on what sort of foundation it may be standing sir austin entered the great city with a sad mind the memory of his misfortune came upon him vividly as if no years had intervened and it were but yesterday that he found the letter telling him that he had no wife and his son no mother he wandered on foot through the streets the first night of his arrival looking strangely at the shops and shows and bustle of the world from which he had divorced himself feeling as destitute as the poorest vagrant he had almost forgotten how to find his way about and came across his old mansion in his efforts to regain his hotel the windows were alightsigns of merry life within he stared at it from the shadow of the opposite side it seemed to him he was a ghost gazing upon his living past and then the phantom which had stood there mocking while he felt as other menthe phantom now flesh and blood reality seized and convulsed his heart and filled its unforgiving crevices with bitter ironic venom he remembered by the time reflection returned to him that it was algernon who had the house at his disposal probably giving a cardparty or something of the sort in the morning too he remembered that he had divorced the world to wed a system and must be faithful to that exacting spouse who now alone of things on earth could fortify and recompense him mr thompson received his client with the dignity and emotion due to such a rentroll and the unexpectedness of the honour he was a thin stately man of law garbed as one who gave audience to acred bishops and carrying on his countenance the stamp of paternity to the parchment skins and of a virtuous attachment to port wine sufficient to increase his respectability in the eyes of moral britain after congratulating sir austin on the fortunate issue of two or three suits and being assured that the baronets business in town had no concern therewith mr thompson ventured to hope that the young heir was all his father could desire him to be and heard with satisfaction that he was a pattern to the youth of the age a difficult time of life sir austin said the old lawyer shaking his head we must keep our eyes on themkeep awake the mischief is done in a minute we must take care to have seen where we planted and that the root was sound or the mischief will do itself in spite of or under the very spectacles of supervision said the baronet his legal adviser murmured exactly as if that were his own idea adding it is my plan with ripton who has had the honour of an introduction to you and a very pleasant time he spent with my young friend whom he does not forget ripton follows the law he is articled to me and will i trust succeed me worthily in your confidence i bring him into town in the morning i take him back at night i think i may say that i am quite content with him do you think said sir austin fixing his brows that you can trace every act of his to its motive the old lawyer bent forward and humbly requested that this might be repeated do yousir austin held the same searching expressiondo you establish yourself in a radiating centre of intuition do you base your watchfulness on so thorough an acquaintance with his character so perfect a knowledge of the instrument that all its movementseven the eccentric onesare anticipated by you and provided for the explanation was a little too long for the old lawyer to entreat another repetition winking with the painful deprecation of a deaf man mr thompson smiled urbanely coughed conciliatingly and said he was afraid he could not affirm that much though he was happily enabled to say that ripton had borne an extremely good character at school i find sir austin remarked as sardonically he relaxed his inspecting pose and mien there are fathers who are content to be simply obeyed now i require not only that my son should obey i would have him guiltless of the impulse to gainsay my wishesfeeling me in him stronger than his undeveloped nature up to a certain period where my responsibility ends and his commences man is a selfacting machine he cannot cease to be a machine but though selfacting he may lose the powers of selfguidance and in a wrong course his very vitalities hurry him to perdition young he is an organism ripening to the set mechanic diurnal round and while so he needs all the angels to hold watch over him that he grow straight and healthy and fit for what machinal duties he may have to perform mr thompson agitated his eyebrows dreadfully he was utterly lost he respected sir austins estates too much to believe for a moment he was listening to downright folly yet how otherwise explain the fact of his excellent client being incomprehensible to him for a middleaged gentleman and one who has been in the habit of advising and managing will rarely have a notion of accusing his understanding and mr thompson had not the slightest notion of accusing his but the baronets condescension in coming thus to him and speaking on the subject nearest his heart might well affect him and he quickly settled the case in favour of both parties pronouncing mentally that his honoured client had a meaning and so deep it was so subtle that no wonder he experienced difficulty in giving it fitly significant words sir austin elaborated his theory of the organism and the mechanism for his lawyers edification at a recurrence of the word healthy mr thompson caught him up i apprehended you oh i agree with you sir austin entirely allow me to ring for my son ripton i think if you condescend to examine him you will say that regular habits and a diet of nothing but lawreadingfor other forms of literature i strictly interdicthave made him all that you instance mr thompsons hand was on the bell sir austin arrested him permit me to see the lad at his occupation said he our old friend ripton sat in a room apart with the confidential clerk mr beazley a veteran of law now little better than a document looking already signed and sealed and shortly to be delivered who enjoined nothing from his pupil and companion save absolute silence and sounded his praises to his father at the close of days when it had been rigidly observednot caring or considering the finished dry old document that he was under what kind of spell a turbulent commonplace youth could be charmed into stillness for six hours of the day ripton was supposed to be devoted to the study of blackstone a tome of the classic legal commentator lay extended outside his desk under the partially lifted lid of which nestled the assiduous students headlaw being thus brought into direct contact with his brainpan the officedoor opened and he heard not his name was called and he remained equally moveless his method of taking in blackstone seemed absorbing as it was novel comparing notes i daresay whispered mr thompson to sir austin i call that study the confidential clerk rose and bowed obsequious senility is it like this every day beazley mr thompson asked with parental pride ahem the old clerk replied he is like this every day sir i could not ask more of a mouse sir austin stepped forward to the desk his proximity roused one of riptons senses which blew a pall to the others down went the lid of the desk dismay and the ardours of study flashed together in riptons face he slouched from his perch with the air of one who means rather to defend his position than welcome a superior the right hand in his waistcoat pocket fumbling a key the left catching at his vacant stool sir austin put two fingers on the youths shoulder and said leaning his head a little on one side in a way habitual to him i am glad to find my sons old comrade thus profitably occupied i know what study is myself but beware of prosecuting it too excitedly come you must not be offended at our interruption you will soon take up the thread again besides you know you must get accustomed to the visits of your client so condescending and kindly did this speech sound to mr thompson that seeing ripton still preserve his appearance of disorder and sneaking defiance he thought fit to nod and frown at the youth and desired him to inform the baronet what particular part of blackstone he was absorbed in mastering at that moment ripton hesitated an instant and blundered out with dubious articulation the law of gravelkind what law said sir austin perplexed gravelkind again rumbled riptons voice sir austin turned to mr thompson for an explanation the old lawyer was shaking his lawbox singular he exclaimed he will make that mistake what law sir ripton read his error in the sternly painful expression of his fathers face and corrected himself gavelkind sir ah said mr thompson with a sigh of relief gravelkind indeed gavelkind an old kentishhe was going to expound but sir austin assured him he knew it and a very absurd law it was adding i should like to look at your sons notes or remarks on the judiciousness of that family arrangement if he had any you were making notes or referring to them as we entered said mr thompson to the sucking lawyer a very good plan which i have always enjoined on you were you not ripton stammered that he was afraid he hid not any notes to show worth seeing what were you doing then sir making notes muttered ripton looking incarnate subterfuge exhibit ripton glanced at his desk and then at his father at sir austin and at the confidential clerk he took out his key it would not fit the hole exhibit was peremptorily called again in his praiseworthy efforts to accommodate the keyhole ripton discovered that the desk was already unlocked mr thompson marched to it and held the lid aloft a book was lying open within which ripton immediately hustled among a mass of papers and tossed into a dark corner not before the glimpse of a coloured frontispiece was caught by sir austins eye the baronet smiled and said you study heraldry too are you fond of the science ripton replied that he was very fond of itextremely attached and threw a further pile of papers into the dark corner the notes had been less conspicuously placed and the search for them was tedious and vain papers not legal or the fruits of study were found that made mr thompson more intimate with the condition of his sons exchequer nothing in the shape of a remark on the law of gavelkind mr thompson suggested to his son that they might be among those scraps he had thrown carelessly into the dark corner ripton though he consented to inspect them was positive they were not there what have we here said mr thompson seizing a neatly folded paper addressed to the editor of a law publication as ripton brought them forth one by one forthwith mr thompson fixed his spectacles and read aloud to the editor of the jurist sirin your recent observations on the great case of crim mr thompson hemd and stopped short like a man who comes unexpectedly upon a snake in his path mr beazleys feet shuffled sir austin changed the position of an arm its on the other side i think gasped ripton mr thompson confidently turned over and intoned with emphasis to absalom the son of david the little jew usurer of bond court whitecross gutters for his introduction to venus i o u five pounds when i can pay signed ripton thompson underneath this fictitious legal instrument was discreetly appended mem document not binding there was a pause an awful underbreath of sanctified wonderment and reproach passed round the office sir austin assumed an attitude mr thompson shed a glance of severity on his confidential clerk who parried by throwing up his hands ripton now fairly bewildered stuffed another paper under his fathers nose hoping the outside perhaps would satisfy him it was marked legal considerations mr thompson had no idea of sparing or shielding his son in fact like many men whose selflove is wounded by their offspring he felt vindictive and was ready to sacrifice him up to a certain point for the good of both he therefore opened the paper expecting something worse than what he had hitherto seen despite its formal heading and he was not disappointed the legal considerations related to the case regarding which ripton had conceived it imperative upon him to address a letter to the editor of the jurist and was indeed a great case and an ancient revived apparently for the special purpose of displaying the forensic abilities of the junior counsel for the plaintiff mr ripton thompson whose assistance the attorneygeneral in his opening statement congratulated himself on securing a rather unusual thing due probably to the eminence and renown of that youthful gentleman at the bar of his country so much was seen from the copy of a report purporting to be extracted from a newspaper and prefixed to the junior counsels remarks or legal considerations on the conduct of the case the admissibility and nonadmissibility of certain evidence and the ultimate decision of the judges mr thompson senior lifted the paper high with the spirit of one prepared to do execution on the criminal and in the voice of a towncrier varied by a bitter accentuation and satiric singsong tone deliberately read vulcan v mars the attorneygeneral assisted by mr ripton thompson appeared on behalf of the plaintiff mr serjeant cupid qc and mr capital opportunity for the defendant oh snapped mr thompson senior peering venom at the unfortunate ripton over his spectacles your notes are on that issue sir thus you employ your time sir with another sideshot at the confidential clerk who retired immediately behind a strong entrenchment of shrugs mr thompson was pushed by the devil of his rancour to continue reading this case is too well known to require more than a partial summary of particulars ahem we will skip the particulars however partial said mr thompson ahwhat do you mean here sirbut enough i think we may be excused your legal considerations on such a case this is how you employ your lawstudies sir you put them to this purpose mr beazley you will henceforward sit alone i must have this young man under my own eye sir austin permit me to apologize to you for subjecting you to a scene so disagreeable it was a fathers duty not to spare him mr thompson wiped his forehead as brutus might have done after passing judgment on the scion of his house these papers he went on fluttering riptons precious lucubrations in a waving judicial hand i shall retain the day will come when he will regard them with shame and it shall be his penance his punishment to do so stop he cried as ripton was noiselessly shutting his desk have you more of them sir of a similar description rout them out let us know you at your worst what have you therein that corner ripton was understood to say he devoted that corner to old briefs on important cases mr thompson thrust his trembling fingers among the old briefs and turned over the volume sir austin had observed but without much remarking it for his suspicions had not risen to print a manual of heraldry the baronet politely and it may be ironically inquired before it could well escape i like it very much said ripton clutching the book in dreadful torment allow me to see that you have our arms and crest correct the baronet proffered a hand for the book a griffin between two wheatsheaves cried ripton still clutching it nervously mr thompson without any notion of what he was doing drew the book from riptons hold whereupon the two seniors laid their grey heads together over the titlepage it set forth in attractive characters beside a coloured frontispiece which embodied the promise displayed there the entrancing adventures of miss random a strange young lady had there been a black hole within the area of those law regions to consign ripton to there and then or an iron rod handy to mortify his sinful flesh mr thompson would have used them as it was he contented himself by looking black holes and iron rods at the detected youth who sat on his perch insensible to what might happen next collapsed mr thompson cast the wicked creature down with a pah he however took her up again and strode away with her sir austin gave ripton a forefinger and kindly touched his head saying goodbye boy at some future date richard will be happy to see you at raynham undoubtedly this was a great triumph to the system chapter xvii the conversation between solicitor and client was resumed is it possible quoth mr thompson the moment he had ushered his client into his private room that you will consent sir austin to see him and receive him again certainly the baronet replied why not this by no means astonishes me when there is no longer danger to my son he will be welcome as he was before he is a schoolboy i knew it i expected it the results of your principle thompson one of the very worst books of that abominable class exclaimed the old lawyer opening at the coloured frontispiece from which brazen miss random smiled bewitchingly out as if she had no doubt of captivating time and all his veterans on a fair field pah he shut her to with the energy he would have given to the office of publicly slapping her face from this day i diet him on bread and waterrescind his pocketmoneyhow he could have got hold of such a book how he and what ideas concealing them from me as he has done so cunningly he trifles with vice his mind is in a putrid state i might have believedi did believei might have gone on believingmy son ripton to be a moral young man the old lawyer interjected on the delusion of fathers and sat down in a lamentable abstraction the lad has come out said sir austin his adoption of the legal form is amusing he trifles with vice true people newly initiated are as hardy as its intimates and a young sinners amusements will resemble those of a confirmed debauchee the satiated and the insatiate appetite alike appeal to extremes you are astonished at this revelation of your sons condition i expected it though assuredly believe me not this sudden and indisputable proof of it but i knew that the seed was in him and therefore i have not latterly invited him to raynham school and the corruption there will bear its fruits sooner or later i could advise you thompson what to do with him it would be my plan mr thompson murmured like a true courtier that he should esteem it an honour to be favoured with sir austin feverels advice secretly resolute like a true briton to follow his own let him then continued the baronet see vice in its nakedness while he has yet some innocence nauseate him vice taken little by little usurps gradually the whole creature my counsel to you thompson would be to drag him through the sinks of town mr thompson began to blink again oh i shall punish him sir austin do not fear me sir i have no tenderness for vice that is not what is wanted thompson you mistake me he should be dealt with gently heavens do you hope to make him hate vice by making him a martyr for its sake you must descend from the pedestal of age to become his mentor cause him to see how certainly and pitilessly vice itself punishes accompany him into its haunts over town broke forth mr thompson over town said the baronet and depend upon it he added that until fathers act thoroughly up to their duty we shall see the sights we see in great cities and hear the tales we hear in little villages with death and calamity in our homes and a legacy of sorrow and shame to the generations to come i do aver he exclaimed becoming excited that if it were not for the duty to my son and the hope i cherish in him i seeing the accumulation of misery we are handing down to an innocent posterityto whom through our sin the fresh breath of life will be fouliyes i would hide my name for whither are we tending what home is pure absolutely what cannot our doctors and lawyers tell us mr thompson acquiesced significantly and what is to come of this sir austin continued when the sins of the fathers are multiplied by the sons is not perdition the final sum of things and is not life the boon of heaven growing to be the devils game utterly but for my son i would hide my name i would not bequeath it to be cursed by them that walk above my grave this was indeed a terrible view of existence mr thompson felt uneasy there was a dignity in his client an impressiveness in his speech that silenced remonstrating reason and the cry of long years of comfortable respectability mr thompson went to church regularly paid his rates and dues without overmuch or at least more than common grumbling on the surface he was a good citizen fond of his children faithful to his wife devoutly marching to a fair seat in heaven on a path paved by something better than a thousand a year but here was a man sighting him from below the surface and though it was an unfair unaccustomed not to say unenglish method of regarding ones fellowman mr thompson was troubled by it what though his client exaggerated facts were at the bottom of what he said and he was acutehe had unmasked ripton since riptons exposure he winced at a personal application in the text his client preached from possibly this was the secret source of part of his anger against that peccant youth mr thompson shook his head and with dolefully puckered visage and a pitiable contraction of his shoulders rose slowly up from his chair apparently he was about to speak but he straightway turned and went meditatively to a siderecess in the room whereof he opened a door drew forth a tray and a decanter labelled port filled a glass for his client deferentially invited him to partake of it filled another glass for himself and drank that was his reply sir austin never took wine before dinner thompson had looked as if he meant to speak he waited for thompsons words mr thompson saw that as his client did not join him in his glass the eloquence of that porty reply was lost on his client having slowly ingurgitated and meditated upon this precious draught and turned its flavour over and over with an aspect of potent judicial wisdom one might have thought that he was weighing mankind in the balance the old lawyer heaved and said sharpening his lips over the admirable vintage the world is in a very sad state i fear sir austin his client gazed at him queerly but that mr thompson added immediately illconcealing by his gaze the glowing intestinal congratulations going on within him that is i think you would say sir austinif i could but prevail upon youa tolerably good character wine theres virtue somewhere i see thompson sir austin murmured without disturbing his legal advisers dimples the old lawyer sat down to finish his glass saying that such a wine was not to be had everywhere they were then outwardly silent for a apace inwardly one of them was full of riot and jubilant uproar as if the solemn fields of law were suddenly to be invaded and possessed by troops of bacchanals and to preserve a decently wretched physiognomy over it and keep on terms with his companion he had to grimace like a melancholy clown in a pantomime mr thompson brushed back his hair the baronet was still expectant mr thompson sighed deeply and emptied his glass he combated the change that had come over him he tried not to see ruby he tried to feel miserable and it was not in him he spoke drawing what appropriate inspirations he could from his clients countenance to show that they had views in common degenerating sadly i fear the baronet nodded according to what my winemerchants say continued mr thompson there can be no doubt about it sir austin stared its the grape or the ground or something mr thompson went on all i can say is our youngsters will have a bad lookout in my opinion government should be compelled to send out a commission to inquire into the cause to englishmen it would be a public calamity it surprises mei hear men sit and talk despondently of this extraordinary disease of the vine and not one of them seems to think it incumbent on him to act and do his best to stop it he fronted his client like a man who accuses an enormous public delinquency nobody makes a stir the apathy of englishmen will become proverbial pray try it sir austin pray allow me such a wine cannot disagree at any hour do i am allowanced two glasses three hours before dinner stomachic i find it agree with me surprisingly quite a new man i suppose it will last our time it must what should we do theres no law possible without it not a lawyer of us could live ours is an occupation which dries the blood the scene with ripton had unnerved him the wine had renovated and gratitude to the wine inspired his tongue he thought that his client of the whimsical mind though undoubtedly correct moral views had need of a glass now that very winesir austini think i do not err in saying that very wine your respected father sir pylcher feverel used to taste whenever he came to consult my father when i was a boy and i remember one day being called in and sir pylcher himself poured me out a glass i wish i could call in ripton now and do the same no leniency in such a case as thatthe wine would not hurt himi doubt if there be much left for him to welcome his guests with ha ha now if i could persuade you sir austin as you do not take wine before dinner some day to favour me with your company at my little country cottage i have a wine therethe fellow to thati think you would i do think you wouldmr thompson meant to say he thought his client would arrive at something of a similar jocund contemplation of his fellows in their degeneracy that inspirited lawyers after potation but condensed the sensual promise into highly approve sir austin speculated on his legal adviser with a sour mouth comically compressed it stood clear to him that thompson before his port and thompson after were two different men to indoctrinate him now was too late it was perhaps the time to make the positive use of him he wanted he pencilled on a handy slip of paper two prongs of a fork the world stuck between themport and the palate tis one which fails firstdown goes world and again the hieroglyphportspectacles he said i shall gladly accompany you this evening thompson words that transfigured the delighted lawyer and ensigned the skeleton of a great aphorism to his pocket there to gather flesh and form with numberless others in a like condition i came to visit my lawyer he said to himself i think i have been dealing with the world in epitome chapter xviii the rumour circulated that sir austin feverel the recluse of raynham the rank misogynist the rich baronet was in town looking out a bride for his only son and uncorrupted heir doctor benjamin bairam was the excellent authority doctor bairam had safely delivered mrs deborah gossip of this interesting bantling which was forthwith dandled in dozens of feminine laps doctor bairam could boast the first interview with the famous recluse he had it from his own lips that the object of the baronet was to look out a bride for his only son and uncorrupted heir and added the doctor shell be lucky who gets him which was interpreted to mean that he would be a catch the doctor probably intending to allude to certain extraordinary difficulties in the way of a choice a demand was made on the publisher of the pilgrims scrip for all his outstanding copies conventionalities were defied a summershower of cards fell on the baronets table he had few male friends he shunned the clubs as nests of scandal the cards he contemplated were mostly those of the sex with the husband if there was a husband evidently dragged in for proprietys sake he perused the cards and smiled he knew their purpose what terrible light thompson and bairam had thrown on some of them heavens in what a state was the blood of this empire before commencing his campaign he called on two ancient intimates lord heddon and his distant cousin darley absworthy both members of parliament useful men though gouty who had sown in their time a fine crop of wild oats and advocated the advantage of doing so seeing that they did not fancy themselves the worse for it he found one with an imbecile son and the other with consumptive daughters so much he wrote in the notebook for the wild oats theory darley was proud of his daughters white and pink skins beautiful complexions he called them the eldest was in the market immensely admired sir austin was introduced to her she talked fluently and sweetly a youth not on his guard a simple schoolboy youth or even a man might have fallen in love with her she was so affable and fair there was something poetic about her and she was quite well she said the baronet frequently questioning her on that point she intimated that she was robust but towards the close of their conversation her hand would now and then travel to her side and she breathed painfully an instant saying isnt it odd dora adela and myself we all feel the same queer sensationabout the heart i think it isafter talking much sir austin nodded and blinked sadly exclaiming to his soul wild oats wild oats he did not ask permission to see dora and adela lord heddon vehemently preached wild oats its all nonsense feverel he said about bringing up a lad out of the common way hes all the better for a little racketing when hes greenfeels his bone and musclelearns to know the world hell never be a man if he hasnt played at the old game one time in his life and the earlier the better ive always found the best fellows were wildish once i dont care what he does when hes a greenhorn besides hes got an excuse for it then you cant expect to have a man if he doesnt take a mans food youll have a milksop and depend upon it when he does break out hell go to the devil and nobody pities him look what those fellows the grocers do when they get hold of a youngwhat dye call emapprentice they know the scoundrel was born with a sweet tooth well they give him the run of the shop and in a very short time he soberly deals out the goods a devilish deal too wise to abstract a morsel even for the pleasure of stealing i know you have contrary theories you hold that the young grocer should have a soul above sugar it wont do take my word for it feverel its a dangerous experiment that of bringing up flesh and blood in harness no colt will bear it or hes a tame beast and look you take it on medical grounds early excesses the frame will recover from late ones break the constitution theres the case in a nutshell hows your son sound and well replied sir austin and yours oh lipscombes always the same lord heddon sighed peevishly hes quietthats one good thing but theres no getting the country to take him so i must give up hopes of that lord lipscombe entering the room just then sir austin surveyed him and was not astonished at the refusal of the country to take him wild oats he thought as he contemplated the headless degenerate weedy issue and result both darley absworthy and lord heddon spoke of the marriage of their offspring as a matter of course and if i were not a coward sir austin confessed to himself i should stand forth and forbid the banns this universal ignorance of the inevitable consequence of sin is frightful the wild oats plea is a torpedo that seems to have struck the world and rendered it morally insensible however they silenced him he was obliged to spare their feelings on a subject to him so deeply sacred the healthful image of his noble boy rose before him a triumphant living rejoinder to any hostile argument he was content to remark to his doctor that he thought the third generation of wild oats would be a pretty thin crop families against whom neither thompson lawyer nor bairam physician could recollect a progenitorial blot either on the male or female side were not numerous only said the doctors you really must not be too exacting in these days my dear sir austin it is impossible to contest your principle and you are doing mankind incalculable service in calling its attention to this the gravest of its duties but as the stream of civilization progresses we must be a little taken in the lump as it were the world is i can assure youand i do not look only above the surface you can believethe world is awakening to the vital importance of the question doctor replied sir austin if you had a pureblood arab barb would you cross him with a screw decidedly not said the doctor then permit me to say i shall employ every care to match my son according to his merits sir austin returned i trust the world is awakening as you observe i have been to my publisher since my arrival in town with a manuscript proposal for a new system of education of our british youth which may come in opportunely i think i am entitled to speak on that subject certainly said the doctor you will admit sir austin that compared with continental nationsour neighbours for instancewe shine to advantage in morals as in everything else i hope you admit that i find no consolation in shining by comparison with a lower standard said the baronet if i compare the enlightenment of your viewsfor you admit my principlewith the obstinate incredulity of a country doctors who sees nothing of the world you are hardly flattered i presume doctor bairam would hardly be flattered at such a comparison assuredly he interjected besides added the baronet the french make no pretences and thereby escape one of the main penalties of hypocrisy whereas webut i am not their advocate credit me it is better perhaps to pay our homage to virtue at least it delays the spread of entire corruptness doctor bairam wished the baronet success and diligently endeavoured to assist his search for a mate worthy of the pureblood barb by putting several mamas whom he visited on the alert chapter xix away with systems away with a corrupt world let us breathe the air of the enchanted island golden lie the meadows golden run the streams red gold is on the pinestems the sun is coming down to earth and walks the fields and the waters the sun is coming down to earth and the fields and the waters shout to him golden shouts he comes and his heralds run before him and touch the leaves of oaks and planes and beeches lucid green and the pinestems redder gold leaving brightest footprints upon thicklyweeded banks where the foxgloves last upperbells incline and brambleshoots wander amid moist rich herbage the plumes of the woodland are alight and beyond them over the open tis a race with the longthrown shadows a race across the heaths and up the hills till at the farthest bourne of mounted eastern cloud the heralds of the sun lay rosy fingers and rest sweet are the shy recesses of the woodland the ray treads softly there a film athwart the pathway quivers manyhued against purple shade fragrant with warm pines deep mossbeds feathery ferns the little brown squirrel drops tail and leaps the inmost bird is startled to a chance tuneless note from silence into silence things move peeps of the revelling splendour above and around enliven the conscious full heart within the flaming west the crimson heights shower their glories through voluminous leafage but these are bowers where deep bliss dwells imperial joy

viceregal light that succeeds to you and all heavenly pageants are the ministers and the slaves of the throbbing content within for this is the home of the enchantment here secluded from vexed shores the prince and princess of the island meet here like darkling nightingales they sit and into eyes and ears and hands pour endless everfresh treasures of their souls roll on grinding wheels of the world cries of ships going down in a calm groans of a system which will not know its rightful hour of exultation complain to the universe you are not heard here he calls her by her name lucy and she blushing at her great boldness has called him by his richard those two names are the keynotes of the wonderful harmonies the angels sing aloft lucy my beloved o richard out in the world there on the skirts of the woodland a sheepboy pipes to meditative eye on a pennywhistle loves musical instrument is as old and as poor it has but two stops and yet you see the cunning musician does thus much with it other speech they have little light foam playing upon waves of feeling and of feeling compact that bursts only when the sweeping volume is too wild and is no more than their sigh of tenderness spoken perhaps love played his tune so well because their natures had unblunted edges and were keen for bliss confiding in it as natural food to gentlemen and ladies he finedraws upon the viol ravishingly or blows into the mellow bassoon or rouses the heroic ardours of the trumpet or it may be commands the whole orchestra for them and they are pleased he is still the cunning musician they languish and taste ecstasy but it is however sonorous an earthly concert for them the spheres move not to two notes they have lost or forfeited and never known the first supersensual spring of the ripe senses into passion when they carry the soul with them and have the privileges of spirits to walk disembodied boundlessly to feel or one has it and the other is a dead body ambrosia let them eat and drink the nectar here sit a couple to whom loves simple bread and water is a finer feast pipe happy sheepbop love irradiated angels unfold your wings and lift your voices they have outflown philosophy their instinct has shot beyond the ken of science they were made for their eden and this divine gift was in store for me so runs the internal outcry of each clasping each it is their recurring refrain to the harmonies how it illumined the years gone by and suffused the living future you for me i for you we are born for each other they believe that the angels have been busy about them from their cradles the celestial hosts have worthily striven to bring them together and o victory o wonder after toil and pain and difficulties exceeding the celestial hosts have succeeded here we two sit who are written above as one pipe happy love pipe on to these dear innocents the tide of colour has ebbed from the upper sky in the west the sea of sunken fire draws back and the stars leap forth and tremble and retire before the advancing moon who slips the silver train of cloud from her shoulders and with her foot upon the pinetops surveys heaven lucy did you never dream of meeting me o richard yes for i remembered you lucy and did you pray that we might meet i did young as when she looked upon the lovers in paradise the fair immortal journeys onward fronting her it is not night but veiled day full half the sky is flushed not darkness not day but the nuptials of the two my own my own for ever you are pledged to me whisper he hears the delicious music and you are mine a soft beam travels to the ferncovert under the pinewood where they sit and for answer he has her eyes turned to him an instant timidly fluttering over the depths of his and then downcast for through her eyes her soul is naked to him lucy my bride my life the nightjar spins his dark monotony on the branch of the pine the soft beam travels round them and listens to their hearts their lips are locked pipe no more love for a time pipe as you will you cannot express their first kiss nothing of its sweetness and of the sacredness of it nothing st cecilia up aloft before the silver organpipes of paradise pressing fingers upon all the notes of which love is but one from her you may hear it so love is silent out in the world there on the skirts of the woodland the selfsatisfied sheepboy delivers a last complacent squint down the length of his pennywhistle and with a flourish correspondingly awry he also marches into silence hailed by supper the woods are still there is heard but the nightjar spinning on the pinebranch circled by moonlight chapter xx enchanted islands have not yet rooted out their old brood of dragons wherever there is romance these monsters come by inimical attraction because the heavens are certainly propitious to true lovers the beasts of the abysses are banded to destroy them stimulated by innumerable sad victories and every lovetale is an epic par of the upper and lower powers i wish good fairies were a little more active they seem to be cajoled into security by the happiness of their favourites whereas the wicked are always alert and circumspect they let the little ones shut their eyes to fancy they are not seen and then commence these appointments and meetings involving a start from the dinnertable at the hour of contemplative digestion and prime claret the hour when the wise youth adrian delighted to talk at his easeto recline in dreamy consciousness that a work of good was going on inside him these abstractions from his studies excesses of gaiety and glumness heavings of the chest and other odd signs but mainly the disgusting behaviour of his pupil at the dinnertable taught adrian to understand though the young gentleman was clever in excuses that he had somehow learnt there was another half to the divided apple of creation and had embarked upon the great voyage of discovery of the difference between the two halves with his usual coolness adrian debated whether he might be in the observatory or the practical stage of the voyage for himself as a man and a philosopher adrian had no objection to its being either and he had only to consider which was temporarily most threatening to the ridiculous system he had to support richards absence annoyed him the youth was vivacious and his enthusiasm good fun and besides when he left table adrian had to sit alone with hippias and the eighteenth century from both of whom he had extracted all the amusement that could be got and he saw his digestion menaced by the society of two ruined stomachs who bored him just when he loved himself most poor hippias was now so reduced that he had profoundly to calculate whether a particular dish or an extraglass of wine would have a bitter effect on him and be felt through the remainder of his years he was in the habit of uttering his calculations half aloud wherein the prophetic doubts of experience and the succulent insinuations of appetite contended hotly it was horrible to hear him so let us pardon adrian for tempting him to a decision in favour of the moment happy to take wine with you adrian would say and hippias would regard the decanter with a pained forehead and put up the doctor drink nephew hippy and think of the doctor tomorrow the eighteenth century cheerily ruffles her cap at him and recommends her own practice its this literary work interjects hippias handling his glass of remorse i dont know what else it can be you have no idea how anxious i feel i have frightful dreams im perpetually anxious no wonder says adrian who enjoys the childish simplicity to which an absorbed study of his sensational existence has brought poor hippias no wonder ten years of fairy mythology could anyone hope to sleep in peace after that as to your digestion no one has a digestion who is in the doctors hands they prescribe from dogmas and dont count on the system they have cut you down from two bottles to two glasses its absurd you cant sleep because your system is crying out for what its accustomed to hippias sips his madeira with a niggardly confidence but assures adrian that he really should not like to venture on a bottle now it would be rank madness to venture on a bottle now he thinks last night only after partaking under protest of that rich french dish or was it the duckadrian advised him to throw the blame on that vulgar birdsay the duck then last night he was no sooner stretched in bed than he seemed to be of an enormous size all his limbshis nose his mouth his toeswere elephantine an elephant was a pigmy to him and his hugeousness seemed to increase the instant he shut his eyes he turned on this side he turned on that he lay on his back he tried putting his face to the pillow and he continued to swell he wondered the room could hold himhe thought he must burst itand absolutely lit a candle and went to the lookingglass to see whether he was bearable by this time adrian and richard were laughing uncontrollably he had however a genial auditor in the eighteenth century who declared it to be a new disease not known in her day and deserving investigation she was happy to compare sensations with him but hers were not of the complex order and a potion soon righted her in fact her system appeared to be a debatable ground for aliment and medicine on which the battle was fought and when over she was none the worse as she joyfully told hippias never looked ploughman on prince or village belle on court beauty with half the envy poor nineteenthcentury hippias expended in his gaze on the eighteenth he was too serious to note much the laughter of the young men this tragedy of a cookingapparatus as adrian designated the malady of hippias was repeated regularly ever evening it was natural for any youth to escape as quick as he could from such a table of stomachs adrian bore with his conduct considerately until a letter from the baronet describing the house and maternal system of a mrs caroline grandison and the rough grain of hopefulness in her youngest daughter spurred him to think of his duties and see what was going on he gave richard halfanhours start and then put on his hat to follow his own keen scent leaving hippias and the eighteenth century to piquet in the lane near belthorpe he met a maid of the farm not unknown to him one molly davenport by name a buxom lass who on seeing him invoked her good gracious the generic maids familiar and was instructed by reminiscences vivid if ancient to giggle are you looking for your young gentleman molly presently asked adrian glanced about the lane like a cool brigand to see if the coast was clear and replied to her i am miss i want you to tell me about him dear said the buxom lass was you coming for me tonight to know adrian rebuked her for her bad grammar apparently cause i cant stop out long tonight molly explained taking the rebuke to refer altogether to her bad grammar you may go in when you please miss is that any one coming come here in the shade now get along said miss molly adrian spoke with resolution listen to me molly davenport he put a coin in her hand which had a medical effect in calming her to attention i want to know whether you have seen him at all who your young gentleman i shd think i did i seen him tonight only aint he grooved handsome hes alays about beltharp now it aint to fire no more ricks hes afire unself aint you seen em together hes after the missis adrian requested miss davenport to be respectful and confine herself to particulars this buxom lass then told him that her young missis and adrians young gentleman were a pretty couple and met one another every night the girl swore for their innocence as for miss lucy she havent a bit of art in her nor have he theyre all nature i suppose said adrian how is it i dont see her at church shes catholic or some think said molly her father was and a leftenant sheve a cross in her bedroom she dont go to church i see you there last sunday alookin so solemn and molly stroked her hand down her chin to give it length adrian insisted on her keeping to facts it was dark and in the dark he was indifferent to the striking contrasts suggested by the lass but he wanted to hear facts and he again bribed her to impart nothing but facts upon which she told him further that her young lady was an innocent artless creature who had been to school upwards of three years with the nuns and had a little money of her own and was beautiful enough to be a lords lady and had been in love with master richard ever since she was a little girl molly had got from a friend of hers up at the abbey mary garner the housemaid who cleaned master richards room a bit of paper once with the young gentlemans handwriting and had given it to her miss lucy and miss lucy had given her a gold sovereign for itjust for his handwriting miss lucy did not seem happy at the farm because of that young tom who was always leering at her and to be sure she was quite a lady and could play and sing and dress with the best she looks like angels in her nightgown molly wound up the next moment she ran up close and speaking for the first time as if there were a distinction of position between them petitioned mr harley you wont go for doin any harm to em cause of what i said will you now do say you wont now mr harley she is good though shes a catholic she was kind to me when i was ill and i wouldnt have her crossedid rather be showed up myself i would the wise youth gave no positive promise to molly and she had to read his consent in a relaxation of his austerity the noise of a lumbering foot plodding down the lane caused her to be abruptly dismissed molly took to flight the lumbering foot accelerated its pace and the pastoral appeal to her flying skirts was heardmoll you theyre it be ibantam but the sprightly silvia would not stop to his wooing and adrian turned away laughing at these arcadians adrian was a lazy dragon all he did for the present was to hint and tease its the inevitable he said and asked himself why he should seek to arrest it he had no faith in the system heavy benson had benson of the slow thicklidded antediluvian eye and loosecrumpled skin benson the saurian the womanhater benson was wide awake a sort of rivalry existed between the wise youth and heavy benson the fidelity of the latter dependant had moved the baronet to commit to him a portion of the management of the raynham estate and this adrian did not like no one who aspires to the honourable office of leading another by the nose can tolerate a party in his ambition bensons surly instinct told him he was in the wise youths way and he resolved to give his master a striking proof of his superior faithfulness for some weeks the saurian eye had been on the two secret creatures heavy benson saw letters come and go in the day and now the young gentleman was off and out every night and seemed to be on wings benson knew whither he went and the object he went for it was a womanthat was enough the saurian eye had actually seen the sinful thing lure the hope of raynham into the shades he composed several epistles of warning to the baronet of the work that was going on but before sending one he wished to record a little of their guilty conversation and for this purpose the faithful fellow trotted over the dews to eavesdrop and thereby aroused the good fairy in the person of tom bakewell the sole confidant of richards state tom said to his young master do you know what sir you be watched richard in a fury bade him name the wretch and tom hung his arms and aped the respectable protrusion of the butlers head its he is it cried richard he shall rue it tom if i find him near me when were together he shall never forget it dont hit too hard sir tom suggested you hit mortal hard when youre in earnest you know richard averred he would forgive anything but that and told tom to be within hail tomorrow nighthe knew where by the hour of the appointment it was out of the lovers mind lady blandish dined that evening at raynham by adrians pointed invitation according to custom richard started up and off with few excuses the lady exhibited no surprise she and adrian likewise strolled forth to enjoy the air of the summer night they had no intention of spying still they may have thought by meeting richard and his inamorata there was a chance of laying a foundation of ridicule to sap the passion they may have thought sothey were on no spoken understanding i have seen the little girl said lady blandish she is prettyshe would be telling if she were well set up she speaks well how absurd it is of that class to educate their women above their station the child is really too good for a farmer i noticed her before i knew of this she has enviable hair i suppose she doesnt paint her eyelids just the sort of person to take a young man i thought there was something wrong i received the day before yesterday an impassioned poem evidently not intended for me my hair was gold my meeting him was foretold my eyes were homes of light fringed with night i sent it back correcting the colours which was death to the rhymes said adrian i saw her this morning the boy hasnt bad taste as you say she is too good for a farmer such a spark would explode any system she slightly affected mine the huron is stark mad about her but we must positively write and tell his father said lady blandish the wise youth did not see why they should exaggerate a trifle the lady said she would have an interview with richard and then write as it was her duty to do adrian shrugged and was for going into the scientific explanation of richards conduct in which the lady had to discourage him poor boy she sighed i am really sorry for him i hope he will not feel it too strongly they feel strongly father and son and select wisely adrian added thats another thing said lady blandish their talk was then of the dulness of neighbouring county people about whom it seemed there was little or no scandal afloat of the ladys loss of the season in town which she professed not to regret though she complained of her general weariness of whether mr morton of poer hall would propose to mrs doria and of the probable despair of the hapless curate of lobourne and other gossip partly in french they rounded the lake and got upon the road through the park to lobourne the moon had risen the atmosphere was warm and pleasant quite a lovers night said lady blandish and i who have none to lovepity me the wise youth attempted a sigh and never will have said lady blandish curtly you buy your loves adrian protested however he did not plead verbally against the impeachment though the ladys decisive insight astonished him he began to respect her relishing her exquisite contempt and he reflected that widows could be terrible creatures he had hoped to be a little sentimental with lady blandish knowing her romantic this mixture of the harshest common sense and an air of i know you men with romance and refined temperament subdued the wise youth more than a positive accusation supported by witnesses would have done he looked at the lady her face was raised to the moon she knew nothingshe had simply spoken from the fulness of her human knowledge and had forgotten her words perhaps after all her admiration or whatever feeling it was for the baronet was sincere and really the longing for a virtuous man perhaps she had tried the opposite set pretty much adrian shrugged whenever the wise youth encountered a mental difficulty he instinctively lifted his shoulders to equal altitudes to show that he had no doubt there was a balance in the caseplenty to be said on both sides which was the same to him as a definite solution at their tryst in the wood abutting on raynham park wrapped in themselves piped to by tireless love richard and lucy sat toying with eternal moments how they seem as if they would never end what mere sparks they are when they have died out and how in the distance of time they revive and extend and glow and make us think them full the half and the best of the fire of our lives with the onward flow of intimacy the two happy lovers ceased to be so shy of common themes and their speech did not reject all as dross that was not pure gold of emotion lucy was very inquisitive about everything and everybody at raynham whoever had been about richard since his birth she must know the history of and he for a kiss will do her bidding thus goes the tender duet you should know my cousin austin lucydarling beloved my own richard you should know my cousin austin you shall know him he would take to you best of them all and you to him he is in

them heavenward to thank her god the light of heaven strikes on them and she is so radiant in her pure beauty that the limbs of the young man tremble lucy o heavenly spirit lucy tenderly her lips parti do not weep for sorrow the big bright drops lighten and roll down imaged in his soul they lean togethershadows of ineffable tenderness playing on their thrilled cheeks and brows he lifts her hand and presses his mouth to it she has seen little of mankind but her soul tells her this one is different from others and at the thought in her great joy tears must come fast or her heart will breaktears of boundless thanksgiving and he gazing on those soft rayillumined darkedged eyes and the grace of her loose falling tresses feels a scarcesufferable holy fire streaming through his members it is long ere they speak in open tones o happy day when we met what says the voice of one the soul of the other echoes o glorious heaven looking down on us their souls are joined are made one for evermore beneath that bending benediction o eternity of bliss then the diviner mood passes and they drop to earth lucy come with me tonight and look at the place where you are some day to live come and i will row you on the lake you remember what you said in your letter that you dreamtthat we were floating over the shadow of the abbey to the nuns at work by torchlight felling the cypress and they handed us each a sprig why darling it was the best omen in the world their felling the old trees and you write such lovely letters so pure and sweet they are i love the nuns for having taught you ah richard see we forget ah she lifts up her face pleadingly as to plead against herself even if your father forgives my birth he will not my religion and dearest though i would die for you i cannot change it it would seem that i was denying god andoh it would make me ashamed of my love fear nothing he winds her about with his arm come he will love us both and love you the more for being faithful to your fathers creed you dont know him lucy he seems harsh and sternhe is full of kindness and love he isnt at all a bigot and besides when he hears what the nuns have done for you wont he thank them as i do andoh i must speak to him soon and you must be prepared to see him soon for i cannot bear your remaining at belthorpe like a jewel in a sty mind im not saying a word against your uncle i

colonel desboroughnever mind come she dreads to she begs not to she is drawn away the woods are silent and then what think you of that for a pretty pastoral says a very different voice adrian reclined against a pine overlooking the ferncovert lady blandish was recumbent upon the brown pinedroppings gazing through a vista of the lower greenwood which opened out upon the moonlighted valley her hands clasped round one knee her features almost stern in their set hard expression they had heard by involuntarily overhearing about as much as may be heard in such positions a luminous word or two the lady did not answer a movement among the ferns attracted adrian and he stepped down the decline across the pineroots to behold heavy benson below shaking fernseed and spidery substances off his crumpled skin is that you mr hadrian called benson starting as he puffed and exercised his handkerchief is it you benson who have had the audacity to spy upon these mysteries adrian called back and coming close to him added you look as if you had just been well thrashed isnt it dreadful sir snuffled benson and his father in ignorance mr hadrian he shall know benson he shall know how you have endangered your valuable skin in his service if mr richard had found you there just now i wouldnt answer for the consequences ha benson spitefully retorted this wont go on mr hadrian it shant sir it will be put a stop to tomorrow sir i call it corruption of a young gentleman like him and harlotry sir i call it id have every jade flogged that made a young innocent gentleman go on like that sir then why didnt you stop it yourself benson ah i see you waitedwhat this is not the first time you have been attendant on apollo and miss dryope you have written to headquarters i did my duty mr hadrian the wise youth returned to lady blandish and informed her of bensons zeal the ladys eyes flashed i hope richard will treat him as he deserves she said shall we home adrian inquired do me a favour the lady replied get my carriage sent round to meet me at the parkgates wont you i want to be alone adrian bowed and left her she was still sitting with her hands clasped round one knee gazing towards the dim raystrewn valley an odd creature muttered the wise youth shes as odd as any of them she ought to be a feverel i suppose shes graduating for it hang that confounded old ass of a benson he has had the impudence to steal a march on me the shadow of the cypress was lessening on the lake the moon was climbing high as richard rowed the boat lucy sang to him softly she sang first a fresh little french song reminding him of a day when she had been asked to sing to him before and he did not care to hear did i live he thinks then she sang to him a bit of one of those majestic old gregorian chants that wherever you may hear them seem to build up cathedral walls about you the young man dropped the sculls the strange solemn notes gave a religious tone to his love and wafted him into the knightly ages and the reverential heart of chivalry hanging between two heavens on the lake floating to her voice the moon stepping over and through white shoals of soft high clouds above and below floating to her voidno other breath abroad his soul went out of his body as he listened they must part he rows her gently shoreward i never was so happy as tonight she murmurs look my lucy the lights of the old place are on the lake look where you are to live which is your room richard he points it out to her o richard that i were one of the women who wait on you i should ask nothing more how happy she must be my darling angellove you shall be happy but all shall wait on you and i foremost lucy dearest may i hope for a letter by eleven tomorrow and i oh you will have mine richard tom shall wait for it a long one mind did you like my last song she pats her hand quietly against her bosom and he knows where it rests o love o heaven they are aroused by the harsh grating of the bow of the boat against the shingle he jumps out and lifts her ashore see she says as the blush of his embrace subsidessee and prettily she mimics awe and feels it a little the cypress does point towards us o richard it does and he looking at her rather than at the cypress delighting in her arch grave ways why theres hardly any shadow at all lucy she mustnt dream my darling or dream only of me dearest but i do tomorrow lucy the letter in the morning and you at night o happy tomorrow you will be sure to be there richard if i am not dead lucy o richard pray pray do not speak of that i shall not survive you let us pray lucy to die together when we are to die death or life with you who is it yonder i see some oneis it tom its adrian is it mr harley the fair girl shivered how dares he come here cried richard the figure of adrian instead of advancing discreetly circled the lake they were stealing away when he called his call was repeated lucy entreated richard to go to him but the young man preferred to summon his attendant tom from within hail and send him to know what was wanted will he have seen me will he have known me whispered lucy tremulously and if he does love said richard oh if he does dearesti dont know but i feel such a presentiment you have not spoken of him tonight richard is he good good richard clutched her hand for the innocent maiden phrase hes very fond of eating thats all i know of adrian her hand was at his lips when tom returned well tom mr adrian wishes particular to speak to you sir said tom do go to him dearest do go lucy begs him oh how i hate adrian the young man grinds his teeth do go lucy urges him tomgood tomwill see me home tomorrow dear love tomorrow you wish to part from me oh unkind but you must not come with me now it may be news of importance dearest think richard tom go back at the imperious command the welldrilled tom strides off a dozen paces and sees nothing then the precious charge is confided to him a heart is cut in twain richard made his way to adrian what is it you want with me adrian are we seconds or principals o fiery one was adrians answer i want nothing with you except to know whether you have seen benson where should i see benson what do i know of bensons doings of course notsuch a secret old fist as he is i want some one to tell him to order lady blandishs carriage to be sent round to the parkgates i thought he might be round your way over therei came upon him accidentally just now in abbeywood whats the matter boy you saw him there hunting diana i suppose he thinks shes not so chaste as they say continued adrian are you going to knock down that tree richard had turned to the cypress and was tugging at the tough wood he left it and went to an ash youll spoil that weeper adrian cried down she comes but goodnight ricky if you see benson mind you tell him doomed benson following his burly shadow hove in sight on the white road while adrian spoke the wise youth chuckled and strolled round the lake glancing over his shoulder every now and then it was not long before he heard a bellow for helpthe roar of a dragon in his throes adrian placidly sat down on the grass and fixed his eyes on the water there as the roar was being repeated amid horrid resounding echoes the wise youth mused in this wise the fates are jews with us when they delay a punishment says the pilgrims scrip or words to that effect the heavens evidently love benson seeing that he gets his punishment on the spot master ricky is a peppery young man he gets it from the apt gruffudh i rather believe in race what a noise that old ruffian makes hell require poulticing with the pilgrims scrip we shall have a message tomorrow and a hubbub and perhaps all go to town which wont be bad for one whos been a prey to all the desires born of dulness benson howls theres life in the old dog yet he bays the moon look at her she doesnt care its the same to her whether we coo like turtledoves or roar like twenty lions how complacent she looks and yet she has just as much sympathy for benson as for cupid she would smile on if both were being birched was that a raven or benson he howls no more it sounds guttural froglikesomething between the brekkekkek and the hoarse ravens croak the fellowll be killing him its time to go to the rescue a deliverer gets more honour by coming in at the last gasp than if he forestalled catastropheho there whats the matter so saying the wise youth rose and leisurely trotted to the scene of battle where stood st george puffing over the prostrate dragon holloa ricky is it you said adrian whats this whom have we herebenson as i live make this beast get up richard returned breathing hard and shaking his great ashbranch he seems incapable my dear boy what have you been up tobenson bensoni say ricky this looks bad hes shamming richard clamoured like a savage spy upon me will he i tell you hes shamming he hasnt had half enough nothings too bad for a spy let him getup insatiate youth do throw away that enormous weapon he has written to my father richard shouted the miserable spy let him get up ooogh i wont huskily groaned benson mr hadrian youre a witnesshes my backcavernous noises took up the tale of his maltreatment i daresay you love your back better than any part of your body now adrian muttered come benson be a man mr richard has thrown away the stick come and get off home and lets see the extent of the damage ooogh hes a devil mr hadrian sir hes a devil groaned benson turning half over in the road to ease his aches adrian caught hold of bensons collar and lifted him to a sitting posture he then had a glimpse of what his hopeful pupils hand could do in wrath the wretched butlers coat was slit and welted his hat knocked in his flabby spirit so broken that he started and trembled if his pitiless executioner stirred a foot richard stood over him grasping his great stick no dawn of mercy for benson in any corner of his features benson screwed his neck round to look up at him and immediately gasped i wont get up i wont hes ready to murder me againmr hadrian if you stand by and see it youre liable to the law siri wont get up while hes near no persuasion could induce benson to try his legs while his executioner stood by adrian took richard aside youve almost killed the poor devil ricky you must be satisfied with that look at his face the coward bobbed while i struck said richard i marked his back he ducked i told him he was getting it worse at so civilized piece of savagery adrian opened his mouth wide did you really i admire that you told him he was getting it worse adrian opened his mouth again to shake another roll of laughter out come he said excalibur has done his word pitch him into the lake and seehere comes the blandish you cant be at it again before a woman go and meet her and tell her the noise was an ox being slaughtered or say argus with a whirr that made all bensons bruises moan and quiver the great ashbranch shot aloft and richard swung off to intercept lady blandish adrian got benson on his feet the heavy butler was disposed to summon all the commiseration he could feel for his bruised flesh every halfstep he attempted was like a dislocation his groans and grunts were frightful how much did that hat cost benson said adrian as he put it on his head a fiveandtwenty shilling beaver mr hadrian benson caressed its injuries the cheapest policy of insurance i remember to have heard of said adrian benson staggered moaning at intervals to his cruel comforter hes a devil mr hadrian hes a devil sir i do believe sir ooogh hes a devili cant move mr hadrian i must be fetched and dr clifford must be sent for sir i shall never be fit for work again i havent a sound bone in my body mr hadrian you see benson this comes of your declaring war upon venus i hope the maids will nurse you properly let me see you are friends with the housekeeper arent you all depends upon that im only a faithful servant mr hadrian the miserable butler snarled then youve got no friend but your bed get to it as quick as possible benson i cant move benson made a resolute halt i must be fetched he whinnied its a shame to ask me to move mr hadrian you will admit that you are heavy benson said adrian so i cant carry you however i see mr richard is very kindly returning to help me at these words heavy benson instantly found his legs and shambled on lady blandish met richard in dismay i have been horribly frightened she said tell me what was the meaning of those cries i heard only some one doing justice on a spy said richard and the lady smiled and looked on him fondly and put her hand through his hair was that all i should have done it myself if i had been a man kiss me chapter xxi by twelve oclock at noon next day the inhabitants of raynham abbey knew that berry the baronets man had arrived posthaste from town with orders to conduct mr richard thither and that mr richard had refused to go had sworn he would not defied his father and despatched berry to the shades berry was all that benson was not whereas benson hated woman berry admired her warmly second to his own stately person woman occupied his reflections and commanded his homage berry was of majestic port and used dictionary words among the maids of raynham his conscious calves produced all the discord and the frenzy those adornments seem destined to create in tender bosoms he had moreover the reputation of having suffered for the sex which assisted his object in inducing the sex to suffer for him what with his calves and his dictionary words and the attractive halo of the mysterious vindictiveness of venus surrounding him this adonis of the lower household was a mighty man below and he moved as one on hearing the tumult that followed berrys arrival adrian sent for him and was informed of the nature of his mission and its result you should come to me first said adrian i should have imagined you were shrewd enough for that berry pardon me mr adrian berry doubled his elbow to explain pardon me sir acting recipient of special injunctions i was not a free agent go to mr richard again berry there will be a little confusion if he holds back perhaps you had better throw out a hint or so of apoplexy a slight hint will do and hereberry when you return to town you had better not mention anythingto quote johnsonof bensons spiflication certainly not sir the wise youths hint had the desired effect on richard he dashed off a hasty letter by tom to belthorpe and mounting his horse galloped to the bellingham station sir austin was sitting down to a quiet early dinner at his hotel when the hope of raynham burst into his room the baronet was not angry with his son on the contrary for he was singularly just and selfaccusing while pride was not up in arms he had been thinking all day after the receipt of bensons letter that he was deficient in cordiality and did not by reason of his excessive anxiety make himself sufficiently his sons companion was not enough as he strove to be mother and father to him preceptor and friend previsor and associate he had not to ask his conscience where he had lately been to blame towards the system he had slunk away from raynham in the very crisis of the magnetic age and this young woman of the parish as benson had termed sweet lucy in his letter was the consequence yes pride and sensitiveness were his chief foes and he would trample on them to begin he embraced his son hard upon an englishman at any timedoubly so to one so shamefaced at emotion in cool blood as it were it gave him a strange pleasure nevertheless and the youth seemed to answer to it he was excited was his love then beginning to correspond with his fathers as in those intimate days before the blossoming season but when richard inarticulate at first in his haste cried out my dear dear father you are safe i fearedyou are better sir thank god sir austin stood away from him safe he said what has alarmed you instead of replying richard dropped into a chair and seized his hand and kissed it sir austin took a seat and waited for his son to explain those doctors are such fools richard broke out i was sure they were wrong they dont know headache from apoplexy its worth the ride sir to see you you left raynham so suddenlybut you are well it was not an attack of real apoplexy his fathers brows contorted and he said no it was not richard pursued if you were ill i couldnt come too soon though if coroners inquests sat on horses those doctors would be found guilty of mareslaughter cassandrall be knocked up i was too early for the train at bellingham and i wouldnt wait she did the distance in four hours and threequarters pretty good sir wasnt it it has given you appetite for dinner i hope said the baronet not so well pleased to find that it was not simple obedience that had brought the youth to him in such haste im ready replied richard i shall be in time to return by the last train tonight i will leave cassandra in your charge for a rest his father quietly helped him to soup which he commenced gobbling with an eagerness that might pass for appetite all well at raynham said the baronet quite sir nothing new nothing sir the same as when i left no change whatever i shall be glad to get back to the old place said the baronet my stay in town has certainly been profitable i have made some pleasant acquaintances who may probably favour us with a visit there in the late autumnpeople you may be pleased to know they are very anxious to see raynham i love the old place cried richard i never wish to leave it why boy before i left you were constantly begging to see town was i sir how odd well i dont want to remain here ive seen enough of it how did you find your way to me richard laughed and related his bewilderment at the miles of brick and the noise and the troops of people concluding theres no place like home the baronet watched his symptomatic brilliant eyes and favoured him with a doubledealing sentence to anchor the heart by any object ere we have half traversed the world is youths foolishness my son reverence time a better maxim that than your horatian he knows all thought richard and instantly drew away leagues from his father and threw up fortifications round his love and himself dinner over richard looked hurriedly at his watch and said with much briskness i shall just be in time sir if we walk will you come with me to the station the baronet did not answer richard was going to repeat the question but found his fathers eyes fixed on him so meaningly that he wavered and played with his empty glass i think we will have a little more claret said the baronet claret was brought and they were left alone the baronet then drew within armsreach of his son and began i am not aware what you may have thought of me richard during the years we have lived together and indeed i have never been in a hurry to be known to you and if i had died before my work was done i should not have complained at losing half my reward in hearing you thank me perhaps as it is i never may everything save selfishness has its recompense i shall be content if you prosper he fetched a breath and continued you had in your infancy a great loss father and son coloured simultaneously to make that good to you i chose to isolate myself from the world and devote myself entirely to your welfare and i think it is not vanity that tells me now that the son i have reared is one of the most hopeful of gods creatures but for that very reason you are open to be tempted the most and to sink the deepest it was the first of the angels who made the road to hell he paused again richard fingered at his watch in our house my son there is peculiar blood we go to wreck very easily it sounds like superstition i cannot but think we are tried as most men are not i see it in us all and you my son are compounded of two races your passions are violent you have had a taste of revenge you have seen in a small way that the pound of flesh draws rivers of blood but there is now in you another power you are mounting to the tableland of life where mimic battles are changed to real ones and you come upon it laden equally with force to create and to destroy he deliberated to announce the intelligence with deep meaning there are women in the world my son the young mans heart galloped back to raynham it is when you encounter them that you are thoroughly on trial it is when you know them that life is either a mockery to you or as some find it a gift of blessedness they are our ordeal love of any human object is the souls ordeal and they are ours loving them or not the young man heard the whistle of the train he saw the moonlighted wood and the vision of his beloved he could barely hold himself down and listen i believe the baronet spoke with little of the cheerfulness of belief good women exist oh if he knew lucy but and he gazed on richard intently it is given to very few to meet them on the thresholdi may say to none we find them after hard buffeting and usually when we find the one fitted for us our madness has misshaped our destiny our lot is cast for women are not the end but the means of life in youth we think them the former and thousands who have not even the excuse of youth select a mateor worsewith that sole view i believe women punish us for so perverting their uses they punish society the baronet put his hand to his brow as his mind travelled into consequences our most diligent pupil learns not so much as an earnest teacher says the pilgrims scrip and sir austin in schooling himself to speak with moderation of women was beginning to get a glimpse of their side of the case cold blood now touched on love to hot blood cold blood said it is a passion coming in the order of nature the ripe fruit of our animal being hot blood felt it is a divinity all that is worth living for in the world cold blood said it is a fever which tests our strength and too often leads to perdition hot blood felt lead whither it will i follow it cold blood said it is a name men and women are much in the habit of employing to sanctify their appetites hot blood felt it is worship religion life and so the two parallel lines ran on the baronet became more personal you know my love for you my son the extent of it you cannot know but you must know that it is something very deep andi do not wish to speak of itbut a father must sometimes petition for gratitude since the only true expression of it is his sons moral good if you care for my love or love me in return aid me with all your energies to keep you what i have made you and guard you from the snares besetting you it was in my hands once it is ceasing to be so remember my son what my love is it is different i fear with most fathers but i am bound up in your welfare what you do affects me vitally you will take no step that is not intimate with my happiness or my misery and i have had great disappointments my son so far it was well richard loved his father and even in his frenzied state he could not without emotion hear him thus speak unhappily the baronet who by some fatality never could see when he was winning the battle thought proper in his wisdom to water the dryness of his sermon with a little jocoseness on the subject of young men fancying themselves in love and when they were raw and green absolutely wanting to bethat most awful thing which the wisest and strongest of men undertake in hesitation and after selfmortification and penancemarried he sketched the foolish young fellowthe object of general ridicule and covert contempt he sketched the womanthe strange thing made in our image and with all our facultiespassing to the rule of one who in taking her proved that he could not rule himself and had no knowledge of her save as a choice morsel which he would burn the whole world and himself in the bargain to possess he harped upon the foolish young fellow till the foolish young fellow felt his skin tingle and was half suffocated with shame and rage after this the baronet might be as wise as he pleased he had quite undone his work he might analyze love and anatomize woman he might accord to her her due position and paint her fair he might be shrewd jocose gentle pathetic wonderfully wise he spoke to deaf ears closing his sermon with the question softly uttered have you anything to tell me richard and hoping for a confession and a thorough reestablishment of confidence the callous answer struck him cold i have not the baronet relapsed in his chair and made diagrams of his fingers richard turned his back on further dialogue by going to the window in the section of sky over the street twinkled two or three stars shining faintly feeling the moon the moon was rising the woods were lifting up to her his star of the woods would be there a bed of moss set about flowers in a basket under him breathed to his nostril of the woodland keenly and filled him with delirious longing a succession of hard sighs brought his fathers hand on his shoulder you have nothing you could say to me my son tell me richard remember there is no home for the soul where dwells a shadow of untruth nothing at all sir the young man replied meeting him with the full orbs of his eyes the baronet withdrew his hand and paced the room at last it grew impossible for richard to control his impatience and he said do you intend me to stay here sir am i not to return to raynham at all tonight his father was again falsely jocular what and catch the train after giving it ten minutes start cassandra will take me said the young man earnestly i neednt ride her hard sir or perhaps you would lend me your winkelried i should be down with him in little better than three hours even then you know the parkgates would be locked well i could stable him in the village dowling knows the horse and would treat him properly may i have him sir the cloud cleared off richards face as he asked at least if he missed his love that night he would be near her breathing the same air marking what star was above her bedchamber hearing the hushed nighttalk of the trees about her dwelling looking on the distances that were like hope half fulfilled and a bodily presence bright as hesper since he knew her there were two swallows under the eaves shadowing lucys chamberwindows two swallows mates in one nest blissful birds who twittered and cheepcheeped to the solelying beauty in her bed around these birds the lovers heart revolved he knew not why he associated them with all his closeveiled dreams of happiness seldom a morning passed when he did not watch them leave the nest on their breakfastflight busy in the happy stillness of dawn it seemed to him now that if he could be at raynham to see them in tomorrows dawn he would be compensated for his incalculable loss of tonight he would forgive and love his father london the life the world just to see those purple backs and white breasts flash out into the quiet morning air he wanted no more the baronets trifling had placed this enormous boon within the young mans visionary grasp he still went on trying the boys temper you know there would be nobody ready for you at raynham it is unfair to disturb the maids richard overrode every objection well then my son said the baronet preserving his halfjocular air i must tell you that it is my wish to have you in town then you have not been ill at all sir cried richard as in his despair he seized the whole plot i have been as well as you could have desired me to be said his father why did they lie to me the young man wrathfully exclaimed i think richard you can best answer that rejoined sir austin kindly severe dread of being signalized as the foolish young fellow prevented richard from expostulating further sir austin saw him grinding his passion into powder for future explosion and thought it best to leave him for awhile chapter xxii for three weeks richard had to remain in town and endure the teachings of the system in a new atmosphere he had to sit and listen to men of science who came to renew their intimacy with his father and whom of all men his father wished him to respect and study practically scientific men being in the baronets estimation the only minds thoroughly mated and enviable he had to endure an introduction to the grandisons and meet the eyes of his kind haunted as he was by the foolish young fellow the idea that he might by any chance be identified with him held the poor youth in silent subjection and it was horrible for it was a continued outrage on the fair image he had in his heart the notion of the world laughing at him because he loved sweet lucy stung him to momentary frenzies and developed premature misanthropy in his spirit also the system desired to show him whither young women of the parish lead us and he was dragged about at nighttime to see the sons and daughters of darkness after the fashion prescribed to mr thompson how they danced and ogled down the high road to perdition but from this sight possibly the teacher learnt more than his pupil since we find him seriously asking his meditative hours in the notebook wherefore wild oats are only of one gender a question certainly not suggested to him at raynham and againwhether men might not be attaching too rigid an importanceto a subject with a dotted tail apparently for he gives it no other in the notebook but as i apprehend he had come to plead in behalf of women here and had deduced something from positive observation to richard the scenes he witnessed were strange wild pictures likely if anything to have increased his misanthropy but for his love certain sweet little notes from lucy sustained the lover during the first two weeks of exile they ceased and now richard fell into such despondency that his father in alarm had to take measures to hasten their return to raynham at the close of the third week berry laid a pair of letters bearing the raynham postmark on the breakfasttable and after reading one attentively the baronet asked his son if he was inclined to quit the metropolis for raynham air cried richard and relapsed saying as you will aware that he had given a glimpse of the foolish young fellow berry accordingly received orders to make arrangements for their instant return to raynham the letter sir austin lifted his head from to bespeak his sons wishes was a composition of the wise youth adrians and ran thus benson is doggedly recovering he requires great indemnities happy when a faithful fool is the main sufferer in a household i quite agree with you that our faithful fool is the best servant of great schemes benson is now a piece of history i tell him that this is indemnity enough and that the sweet muse usually insists upon gentlemen being halfflayed before she will condescend to notice them but benson i regret to say rejects the comfort so fine a reflection should offer and had rather keep his skin and live opaque heroism seems partly a matter of training faithful folly is bensons nature the rest has been thrust upon the young person has resigned the neighbourhood i had an interview with the fair papist myself and also with the man blaize they were both sensible though one swore and the other sighed she is pretty i hope she does not paint i can affirm that her legs are strong for she walks to bellingham twice a week to take her scarlet bath when having confessed and been made clean by the romish unction she walks back the brisker of which my protestant muscular system is yet aware it was on the road to bellingham i engaged her she is well in the matter of hair madam godiva might challenge her it would be a fair match has it never struck you that woman is nearer the vegetable than manmr blaize intends her for his son a junction that every lover of fairy mythology must desire to see consummated young tom is heir to all the agremens of the beast the maids of lobourne say i hear that he is a very proculus among them possibly the envious men say it for the maids beauty does not speak bad grammarand altogether she is better out of the way the other letter was from lady blandish a ladys letter and said i have fulfilled your commission to the best of my ability and heartily sad it has made me she is indeed very much above her stationpity that it is so she is almost beautifulquite beautiful at times and not in any way what you have been led to fancy the poor child had no story to tell i have again seen her and talked with her for an hour as kindly as i could i could gather nothing more than we know it is just a womans history as it invariably commences richard is the god of her idolatry she will renounce him and sacrifice herself for his sake are we so bad she asked me what she was to do she would do whatever was imposed upon herall but pretend to love another and that she never would and i believe never will you know i am sentimental and i confess we dropped a few tears together her uncle has sent her for the winter to the institution where it appears she was educated and where they are very fond of her and want to keep her which it would be a good thing if they were to do the man is a good sort of man she was entrusted to him by her father and he never interferes with her religion and is very scrupulous about all that pertains to it though as he says he is a christian himself in the spring but the poor child does not know this she is to come back and be married to his lout of a son i am determined to prevent that may i not reckon on your promise to aid me when you see her i am sure you will it would be sacrilege to look on and permit such a thing you know they are cousins she asked me where in the world there was one like richard what could i answer they were your own words and spoken with a depth of conviction i hope he is really calm i shudder to think of him when he comes and discovers what i have been doing i hope i have been really doing right a good deed you say never dies but we cannot always knowi must rely on you yes it is i should think easy to suffer martyrdom when one is sure of ones cause but then one must be sure of it i have done nothing lately but to repeat to myself that saying of yours no c ps and it has consoled me i cannot say why except that all wisdom consoles whether it applies directly or not for this reason so many fall from god who have attained to him that they cling to him with their weakness not with their strength i like to know of what you are thinking when you composed this or that sayingwhat suggested it may not one be admitted to inspect the machinery of wisdom i feel curious to know how thoughtsreal thoughtsare born not that i hope to win the secret here is the beginning of one but we poor women can never put together even two of the three ideas which you say go to form a thought when a wise man makes a false step will he not go farther than a fool it has just flitted through me i cannot get on with gibbon so wait your return to recommence the readings i dislike the sneering essence of his writings i keep referring to his face until the dislike seems to become personal how different is it with wordsworth and yet i cannot escape from the thought that he is always solemnly thinking of himself but i do reverence him but this is curious byron was a greater egoist and yet i do not feel the same with him he reminds me of a beast of the desert savage and beautiful and the former is what one would imagine a superior donkey reclaimed from the heathen to bea very superior donkey i mean with great power of speech and great natural complacency and whose stubbornness you must admire as part of his mission the worst is that no one will imagine anything sublime in a superior donkey so my simile is unfair and false is it not strange i love wordsworth best and yet byron has the greater power over me how is that because sir austin wrote beside the query in pencil women are cowards and succumb to irony and passion rather than yield their hearts to excellence and natures inspiration the letter pursued i have finished boiardo and have taken up berni the latter offends me i suppose we women do not really care for humour you are right in saying we have none ourselves and cackle instead of laugh it is true of me at least that falstaff is only to us an incorrigible fat man i want to know what he illustrates and don quixotewhat end can be served in making a noble mind ridiculousi hear you saypractical so it is we are very narrow i know but we like witpractical again or in your words when i really think they generally come to my aidperhaps it is that it is often all your thought we prefer the rapier thrust to the broad embrace of intelligence he trifled with the letter for some time rereading chosen passages as he walked about the room and considering he scarce knew what there are ideas language is too gross for and shape too arbitrary which come to us and have a definite influence upon us and yet we cannot fasten on the filmy things and make them visible and distinct to ourselves much less to others why did he twice throw a look into the glass in the act of passing it he stood for a moment with head erect facing it his eyes for the nonce seemed little to peruse his outer features the grey gathered brows and the wrinkles much action of them had traced over the circles half up his high straight forehead the irongrey hair that rose over his forehead and fell away in the fashion of richards plume his general appearance showed the tints of years but none of their weight and nothing of the dignity of his youth was gone it was so far satisfactory but his eyes were wide as one who looks at his essential self through the mask we wear perhaps he was speculating as he looked on the sort of aspect he presented to the ladys discriminative regard of her feelings he had not a suspicion but he knew with what extraordinary lucidity women can when it pleases them and when their feelings are not quite boiling under the noonday sun seize all the sides of a character and put their fingers on its weak point he was cognizant of the total absence of the humorous in himself the want that most shut him out from his fellows and perhaps the clearthoughted intensely selfexamining gentleman filmily conceived me also in common with the poet she gazes on as one of the superiorgrey beasts he may have so conceived the case he was capable of that greatmindedness and could snatch at times very luminous glances at the broad reflector which the world of fact lying outside our narrow compass holds up for us to see ourselves in when we will unhappily the faculty of laughter which is due to this gift was denied him and having seen he like the companion of friend balsam could go no farther for a good wind of laughter had relieved him of much of the blight of selfdeception and oddness and extravagance had given a healthier view of our atmosphere of life but he had it not journeying back to bellingham in the train with the heated brain and brilliant eye of his son beside him sir austin tried hard to feel infallible as a man with a system should feel and because he could not do so after much mental conflict he descended to entertain a personal antagonism to the young woman who had stepped in between his experiment and success he did not think kindly of her lady blandishs encomiums of her behaviour and her beauty annoyed him forgetful that he had in a measure forfeited his rights to it he took the common ground of fathers and demanded why he was not justified in doing all that lay in his power to prevent his son from casting himself away upon the first creature with a pretty face he encountered deliberating thus he lost the tenderness he should have had for his experimentthe living burning youth at his elbow and his excessive love for him took a rigorous tone it appeared to him politic reasonable and just that the uncle of this young woman who had so long nursed the prudent scheme of marrying her to his son should not only not be thwarted in his object but encouraged and even assisted at least not thwarted sir austin had no glass before him while these ideas hardened in his mind and he had rather forgotten the letter of lady blandish father and son were alone in the railway carriage both were too preoccupied to speak as they neared bellingham the dark was filling the hollows of the country over the pinehills beyond the station a last rosy streak lingered across a green sky richard eyed it while they flew along it caught him forward it seemed full of the spirit of his love and brought tears of mournful longing to his eyelids the sad beauty of that one spot in the heavens seemed to call out to his soul to swear to his lucys truth to him was like the sorrowful visage of his fleurdeluce as he called her appealing to him for faith that tremulous tender way she had of halfclosing and catching light on the netherlids when sometimes she looked up in her lovers facea look so mysticsweet that it had grown to be the fountain of his dreams he saw it yonder and his blood thrilled know you those wandlike touches of i know not what before which our grosser being melts and we much as we hope to be in the awaking stand etherealized trembling with new joy they come but rarely rarely even in love when we fondly think them revelations mere sensations they are doubtless and we rank for them no higher in the spiritual scale than so many translucent glorious polypi that quiver on the shores the hues of heaven running through them yet in the harvest of our days it is something for the animal to have had such mere fleshly polypian experiences to look back upon and they give him an horizonpale seas of luring splendour one who has had them when they do not bound him may find the isles of bliss sooner than another sensual faith in the upper glories is something let us remember says the pilgrims scrip that nature though heathenish reaches at her best to the footstool of the highest she is not all dust but a living portion of the spheres in aspiration it is our error to despise her forgetting that through nature only can we ascend cherished trained and purified she is then partly worthy the divine mate who is to make her wholly so st simeon saw the hog in nature and took nature for the hog it was one of these strange bodily exaltations which thrilled the young man he knew not how it was for sadness and his forebodings vanished the soft wand touched him at that moment had sir austin spoken openly richard might have fallen upon his heart he could not he chose to feel injured on the common ground of fathers and to pursue his system by plotting lady blandish had revived his jealousy of the creature who menaced it and jealousy of a system is unreflecting and vindictive as jealousy of woman heathroots and pines breathed sharp in the cool autumn evening about the bellingham station richard stood a moment as he stepped from the train and drew the country air into his lungs with large heaves of the chest leaving his father to the felicitations of the stationmaster he went into the lobourne road to look for his faithful tom who had received private orders through berry to be in attendance with his young masters mare cassandra and was lurking in a plantation of firs unenclosed on the borders of the road where richard knowing his retainers zest for conspiracy too well to seek him anywhere but in the part most favoured with shelter and concealment found him furtively whiffing tobacco what news tom is there an illness tom sent his undress cap on one side to scratch at dilemma an old agricultural habit to which he was still a slave in moments of abstract thought or sudden difficulty no i dont want the rake mr richard he whinnied with a false grin as he beheld his masters eye vacantly following the action speak out he was commanded i havent had a letter for a week richard learnt the news he took it with surprising outward calm only getting a little closer to cassandras neck and looking very hard at tom without seeing a speck of him which had the effect on tom of making him sincerely wish his master would punch his head at once rather than fix him in that owllike way go on said richard huskily yes shes gone well tom was brought to understand he must make the most of trifles and recited how he had heard from a female domestic at belthorpe of the name of davenport formerly known to him that the young lady never slept a wink from the hour she knew she was going but sat up in her bed till morning crying most pitifully though she never complained hereat the tears unconsciously streamed down richards cheeks tom said he had tried to see her but mr adrian kept him at work ciphering at a terrible sumthat and nothing else all day saying it was to please his young master on his return likewise something in latn added tom nomtive mousernough to make ye mad sir he exclaimed with pathos the wretch had been put to acquire a latin declension tom saw her on the morning she went away he said she was very sorrowfullooking and nodded kindly to him as she passed in the fly along with young tom blaize she have got uncommon kind eyes sir said tom and cryin dont spoil them for which his hand was wrenched tom had no more to tell save that in rounding the road the young lady had hung out her hand and seemed to move it forward and back as much as to say goodbye tom and though she couldnt see me said tom i took off my hat i did take it so kind of her to think of a chap like me he was at highpressure sentimentwhat with his education for a hero and his masters lovestricken state you saw no more of her tom no sir that was the last that was the last you saw of her tom well sir i saw nothin more and so she went out of sight clean gone that she were sir why did they take her away what have they done with her where have they taken her to these redhot questionings were addressed to the universal heaven rather than to tom why didnt she write they were resumed why did she leave shes mine she belongs to me who dared take her away why did she leave without writingtom yes sir said the welldrilled recruit dressing himself up to the word of command he expected a variation of the theme from the change of tone with which his name had been pronounced but it was again where have they taken her to and this was even more perplexing to tom than his hard sum in arithmetic had been he could only draw down the corners of his mouth hard and glance up queerly she had been cryingyou saw that tom no mistake about that mr richard cryin all night and all day i shd say and she was crying when you saw her she lookd as if shed just done for a moment sir but her face was white white as a sheet richard paused to discover whether his instinct had caught a new view from these facts he was in a cage always knocking against the same bars fly as he might her tears were the stars in his black night he clung to them as golden orbs inexplicable as they were they were at least pledges of love the hues of sunset had left the west no light was there but the steadfast pale eye of twilight thither he was drawn he mounted cassandra saying tell them something tom i shant be home to dinner and rode off toward the forsaken home of light over belthorpe whereat he saw the wan hand of his lucy waving farewell receding as he advanced his jewel was stolenhe must gaze upon the empty box chapter xxiii night had come on as richard entered the old elmshaded grassbordered lane leading down from raynham to belthorpe the pale eye of twilight was shut the wind had tossed up the bank of western cloud which was now flying broad and unlighted across the sky broad and balmythe charioted southwest at full charge behind his panting coursers as he neared the farm his heart fluttered and leapt up he was sure she must be there she must have returned why should she have left for good without writing he caught suspicion by the throat making it voiceless if it lived he silenced reason her not writing was now a proof that she had returned he listened to nothing but his imperious passion and murmured sweet words for her as if she were by tender cherishing epithets of love in the nest she was thereshe moved somewhere about like a silver flame in the dear old house doing her sweet household duties his blood began to sing o happy those within to see her and be about her by some extraordinary process he contrived to cast a sort of glory round the burly person of farmer blaize himself and oh to have companionship with a seraph one must know a seraphs bliss and was not young tom to be envied the smell of late clematis brought on the wind enwrapped him and went to his brain and threw a light over the old redbrick house for he remembered where it grew and the winter rosetree and the jessamine and the passionflower the garden in front with the standard roses tended by her hands the long wall to the left striped by the branches of the cherry the peep of a further garden through the wall and then the orchard and the fields beyondthe happy circle of her dwelling it flashed before his eyes while he looked on the darkness and yet it was the reverse of hope which kindled this light and inspired the momentary calm he experienced it was despair exaggerating delusion wilfully building up on a groundless basis for the tenacity of true passion is terrible says the pilgrims scrip it will stand against the hosts of heaven gods great array of facts rather than surrender its aim and must be crushed before it will succumbsent to the lowest pit he knew she was not there she was gone but the power of a will strained to madness fought at it kept it down conjured forth her ghost and would have it as he dictated poor youth the great array of facts was in due order of march he had breathed her name many times and once overloud almost a cry for her escaped him he had not noticed the opening of a door and the noise of a foot along the gravel walk he was leaning over cassandras uneasy neck watching the one window intently when a voice addressed him out of the darkness be that you young gentlemanmr fevrel richards trance was broken mr blaize he said recognizing the farmers voice good evenn t you sir returned the farmer i knew the mare though i didnt know you rather bluff tonight it be will ye step in mr fevrel its beginning to spitgoing to be a wildish night i reckon richard dismounted the farmer called one of his men to hold the mare and ushered the young man in once there richards conjurations ceased there was a deadness about the rooms and passages that told of her absence the walls he touchedthese were the vacant shells of her he had never been in the house since he knew her and now what strange sweetness and what pangs young tom blaize was in the parlour squared over the table in openmouthed examination of an ancient book of the fashions for a summer month which had elapsed during his mothers minority young tom was respectfully studying the aspects of the radiant beauties of the polite work he also was a thrall of woman newly enrolled and full of wonder what tom the farmer sang out as soon as he had opened the door there ye be at yer folly agin are ye what goodll them fashens do to you id like tknow come shut up and go and see to mr fevrels mare hes alays at that ther folly now i say there never were a better name for a book than that ther folly talk about attitudes the farmer laughed his fat sides into a chair and motioned his visitor to do likewise its a comfort theyre most on em females he pursued sounding a thwack on his knee as he settled himself agreeably in his seat it dont matter much what they does except pinchin inwaspin it at the waist give me nature i saywoman as shes made eh young gentleman you seem very lonely here said richard glancing round and at the ceiling lonely quoth the farmer well for the matter o that we bejest now sot happens ive got my pipe and tomve got his folly hes on one side the table and im on tother he gapes and i gazes we are a bit lonesome but thereits for the best richard resumed i hardly expected to see you tonight mr blaize yacted like a man in coming young gentleman and i does ye honour for it said farmer blaize with sudden energy and directness the thing implied by the farmers words caused richard to take a quick breath they looked at each other and looked away the farmer thrumming on the arm of his chair above the mantelpiece surrounded by tarnished indifferent miniatures of highcollared welltodo yeomen of the anterior generation trying their best not to grin and highwaisted old ladies smiling an encouraging smile through plentiful cappuckers there hung a passably executed halffigure of a naval officer in uniform grasping a telescope under his left arm who stood forth clearly as not of their kith and kin his eyes were blue his hair light his bearing that of a man who knows how to carry his head and shoulders the artist while giving him an epaulette to indicate his rank had also recorded the juvenility which a lieutenant in the naval service can retain after arriving at that position by painting him with smooth cheeks and fresh ruddy lips to this portrait richards eyes were directed farmer blaize observed it and said her father sir richard moderated his voice to praise the likeness yes said the farmer pretty well next best to havin her though its a long way off that an old family mr blaizeis it not richard asked in as careless a tone as he could assume gentlefolkswhats left of em replied the farmer with an equally affected indifference and thats her father said richard growing bolder to speak of her thats her father young gentleman mr blaize richard turned to face him and burst out where is she gone sir packed offcant have her here now the farmer thrummed a step brisker and eyed the young mans wild face resolutely mr blaize richard leaned forward to get closer to him he was stunned and hardly aware of what he was saying or doing where has she gone why did she leave you neednt to ask sirye know said the farmer with a side shot of his head but she did notit was not her wish to go no i think she likes the place mayhap she likest too well why did you send her away to make her unhappy mr blaize the farmer bluntly denied it was he was the party who made her unhappy nobody cant accuse me tell ye what sir i wunt have the busybodies set to work about her and theres all the matter so let you and i come to an understandin a blind inclination to take offence made richard sit upright he forgot it the next minute and said humbly am i the cause of her going well returned the farmer to speak straightye be what can i do mr blaize that she may come back again the young hypocrite asked now said the farmer youre coming to business glad to hear ye talk in that sensible way mr feverel you may guess i wants her bad enough the house aint itself now shes away and i aint myself well sir this ye can do if you gives me your promise not to meddle with her at alli cant mak out how you come to be acquainted not to try to get her to be meetin youand if youd a seen her when she left you wouldwhen did

her up the young man checked the annihilation of time that was on his mouth you sent her away to protect her from me then he said savagely thats not quite it but thatll do rejoined the farmer do you think i shall harm her sir people seem to think shell harm you young gentleman the farmer said with some irony harm meshe what people people pretty intimate with you sir what people who spoke of us richard began to scent a plot and would not be balked well sir look here said the farmer it aint no secret and if it be i dont see why im to keep it it appears your educations peculiar the farmer drawled out the word as if he were describing the figure of a snake you aint to be as other young gentlemen all the better youre a fine bold young gentleman and your fathers a right to be proud of ye well sirim sure i thank him fort he comes to hear of you and luce and of course he dont want nothin o thatmore do i i meets him there whats more i wont have nothin of it she be my gal she were left to

says shell dotrue blue she be my luce so now sir you do the same and ill thank ye any one who has tossed a sheet of paper into the fire and seen it gradually brown with heat and strike to flame may conceive the mind of the lover as he listened to this speech his anger did not evaporate in words but condensed and sank deep mr blaize he said this is very kind of the people you allude to but i am of an age now to think and act for myselfi love her sir his whole countenance changed and the muscles of his face quivered well said the farmer appeasingly we all do at your agesomebody or other its natural i love her the young man thundered afresh too much possessed by his passion to have a sense of shame in the confession farmer his voice fell to supplication will you bring her back farmer blaize made a queer face he askedwhat for and where was the promise requiredbut was not the lovers argument conclusive he said he loved her and he could not see why her uncle should not in consequence immediately send for her that they might be together all very well quoth the farmer but whats to come of itwhat was to come of it why love and more love and a bit too much the farmer added grimly then you refuse me farmer said richard i must look to you for keeping her away from me not totothese people you will not have her back though i tell you i love her better than my life farmer blaize now had to answer him plainly he had a reason and an objection of his own and it was that her character was at stake and god knew whether she herself might not be in danger he spoke with a kindly candour not without dignity he complimented richard personally but young people were young people baronets sons were not in the habit of marrying farmers nieces at first the son of a system did not comprehend him when he did he said farmer if i give you my word of honour as i hope for heaven to marry her when i am of age will you have her back he was so fervid that to quiet him the farmer only shook his head doubtfully at the bars of the grate and let his chest fall slowly richard caught what seemed to him a glimpse of encouragement in these signs and observed its not because you object to me mr blaize the farmer signified it was not that its because my father is against me richard went on and undertook to show that love was so sacred a matter that no father could entirely and for ever resist his sons inclinations argument being a cool field where the farmer could meet and match him the young man got on the tramroad of his passion and went ahead he drew pictures of lucy of her truth and his own he took leaps from life to death from death to life mixing imprecations and prayers in a torrent perhaps he did move the stolid old englishman a little he was so vehement and made so visible a sacrifice of his pride farmer blaize tried to pacify him but it was useless his jewel he must have the farmer stretched out his hand for the pipe that allayeth botheration may smoke heer now he said not whensomebodys present smoke in the kitchen then dont mind smell richard nodded and watched the operations while the farmer filled and lighted and began to puff as if his fate hung on them whod a thought when you sat over there once of its comin to this ejaculated the farmer drawing ease and reflection from tobacco you didnt think much of her that day young gentleman i introduced ye well things comes about cant you wait till she returns in due course now this suggestion the work of the pipe did but bring on him another torrent its queer said the farmer putting the mouth of the pipe to his wrinkledup temples richard waited for him and then he laid down the pipe altogether as no aid in perplexity and said after leaning his arm on the table and staring at richard an instant look young gentleman my words gone ive spoke it ive given em the surance she shant be back till the spring and then ill have her and thenwell i do hope for more reasons than one yell both be wiserive got my own notions about her but i ant the man to force a gal to marry gainst her inclines depend upon it im not your enemy mr fevrel youre jest the one to mak a young gal proud so waitand see thats my dvice jest tak and wait ive no more to say richards impetuosity had made him really afraid of speaking his notions concerning the projected felicity of young tom if indeed they were serious the farmer repeated that he had no more to say and richard with wait till the spring wait till the spring dinning despair in his ears stood up to depart farmer blaize shook his slack hand in a friendly way and called out at the door for young tom who dreading allusions to his folly did not appear a maid rushed by richard in the passage and slipped something into his grasp which fixed on it without further consciousness than that of touch the mare was led forth by the bantam a light rain was falling down strong warm gusts and the trees were noisy in the night farmer blaize requested richard at the gate to give him his hand and say all was well he liked the young man for his earnestness and honest outspeaking richard could not say all was well but he gave his hand and knitted it to the farmers in a sharp squeeze when he got upon cassandra and rode into the tumult a calm clear dawn succeeded the roaring west and threw its glowing grey image on the waters of the abbeylake before sunrise tom bakewell was abroad and met the missing youth his master jogging cassandra leisurely along the lobourne parkroad a sorry couple to look at cassandras flanks were caked with mud her head drooped all that was in her had been taken out by that wild night on what heaths and heavy fallows had she not spent her noble strength recklessly fretting through the darkness take the mare said richard dismounting and patting her between the eyes shes done up poor old gal look to her tom and then come to me in my room tom asked no questions three days would bring the anniversary of richards birth and though tom was close the condition of the mare and the young gentlemans strange freak in riding her out all night becoming known prepared everybody at raynham for the usual badluck birthday the prophets of which were full of sad gratification sir austin had an unpleasant office to require of his son no other than that of humbly begging bensons pardon and washing out the undue blood he had spilt in taking his pound of flesh heavy benson was told to anticipate the demand for pardon and practised in his mind the most melancholy christian deportment he could assume on the occasion but while his son was in this state sir austin considered that he would hardly be brought to see the virtues of the act and did not make the requisition of him and heavy benson remained drawn up solemnly expectant at doorways and at the foot of the staircase a saurian caryatid wherever he could get a step in advance of the young man while richard heedlessly passed him as he passed everybody else his head bent to the ground and his legs bearing him like random instruments of whose service he was unconscious it was a shock to bensons implicit belief in his patron and he was not consoled by the philosophic explanation that good in a strong manycompounded nature is of slower growth than any other mortal thing and must not be forced damnatory doctrines best pleased benson he was ready to pardon as a christian should but he did want his enemy before him on his knees and now though the saurian eye saw more than all the other eyes in the house and saw that there was matter in hand between tom and his master to breed exceeding discomposure to the system benson as he had not received his indemnity and did not wish to encounter fresh perils for nothing held his peace sir austin partly divined what was going on in the breast of his son without conceiving the depths of distrust his son cherished or quite measuring the intensity of the passion that consumed him he was very kind and tender with him like a cunning physician who has nevertheless overlooked the change in the disease superinduced by one false dose he meditated his prescriptions carefully and confidently sure that he knew the case and was a match for it he decreed that richards erratic behaviour should pass unnoticed two days before the birthday he asked him whether he would object to having company to which richard said have whom you will sir the preparation for festivity commenced accordingly on the birthday eve he dined with the rest lady blandish was there and sat penitently at his right hippias prognosticated certain indigestion for himself on the morrow the eighteenth century wondered whether she should live to see another birthday adrian drank the twoyears distant term of his tutorship and algernon went over the list of the lobourne men who would cope with bursley on the morrow sir austin gave ear and a word to all keeping his mental eye for his son to please lady blandish also adrian ventured to make trifling jokes about londons mrs grandison jokes delicately not decent but so delicately so that it was not decent to perceive it after dinner richard left them nothing more than commonly peculiar was observed about him beyond the excessive glitter of his eyes but the baronet said yes yes that will pass he and adrian and lady blandish took tea in the library and sat till a late hour discussing casuistries relating mostly to the appledisease converse very amusing to the wise youth who could suggest to the two chaste minds situations of the shadiest character with the air of a seeker after truth and lead them unsuspecting where they dared not look about them the aphorist had elated the heart of his constant fair worshipper with a newly rounded if not newly conceived sentence when they became aware that they were four heavy benson stood among them he said he had knocked but received no answer there was however a vestige of surprise and dissatisfaction on his face beholding adrian of the company which had not quite worn away and gave place when it did vanish to an aspect of flabby severity well benson well said the baronet the unmoving man replied if you please sir austinmr richard well hes out well with bakewell well and a carpetbag the carpetbag might be supposed to contain that funny thing called a young heros romance in the making out richard was and with a carpetbag which tom bakewell carried he was on the road to bellingham under heavy rain hasting like an escaped captive wild with joy while tom shook his skin and grunted at his discomforts the mail train was to be caught at bellingham he knew where to find her now through the intervention of miss davenport and thither he was flying an arrow loosed from the bow thither in spite of fathers and friends and plotters to claim her and take her and stand with her against the world they were both thoroughly wet when they entered bellingham and toms visions were of hot drinks he hinted the necessity for inward consolation to his master who could answer nothing but tom tom i shall see her tomorrow it was badtravelling in the wet tom hinted again to provoke the same insane outcry and have his arm seized and furiously shaken into the bargain passing the principal inn of the place tom spoke plainly for brandy no cried richard theres not a moment to be lost and as he said it he reeled and fell against tom muttering indistinctly of faintness and that there was no time to lose tom lifted him in his arms and got admission to the inn brandy the countrys specific was advised by host and hostess and forced into his mouth reviving him sufficiently to cry out tom the bells ringing we shall be late after which he fell back insensible on the sofa where they had stretched him excitement of blood and brain had done its work upon him the youth suffered them to undress him and put him to bed and there he lay forgetful even of love a drowned weed borne onward by the tide of the hours there his father found him was the scientific humanist remorseful he had looked forward to such a crisis as that point in the disease his son was the victim of when the body would fail and give the spirit calm to conquer the malady knowing very well that the seeds of the evil were not of the spirit moreover to see him and have him was a repose after the alarm benson had sounded mark he said to lady blandish when he recovers he will not care for her the lady had accompanied him to the bellingham inn on first hearing of richards seizure what an iron man you can be she exclaimed smothering her intuitions she was for giving the boy his bauble promising it him at least if he would only get well and be the bright flower of promise he once was can you look on him she pleaded can you look on him and persevere it was a hard sight for this man who loved his son so deeply the youth lay in his strange bed straight and motionless with fever on his cheeks and altered eyes old dr clifford of lobourne was the medical attendant who with headshaking and gathering of lips and reminiscences of ancient arguments guaranteed to do all that leech could do in the matter the old doctor did admit that richards constitution was admirable and answered to his prescriptions like a piano to the musician but he said at a family consultation for sir austin had told him how it stood with the young man drugs are not much in cases of this sort change thats whats wanted and as soon as may be distraction he ought to see the world and know what he is made of its no use my talking i know added the doctor on the contrary said sir austin i am quite of your persuasion and the world he shall seenow we have dipped him in styx you know doctor adrian remarked but doctor said lady blandish have you known a case of this sort before never my lady said the doctor theyre not common in these parts country people are tolerably healthyminded but peopleand country peoplehave died for love doctor the doctor had not met any of them men or women inquired the baronet lady blandish believed mostly women ask the doctor whether they were healthyminded women said the baronet no you are both looking at the wrong end between a highlycultured being and an emotionless animal there is all the difference in the world but of the two the doctor is nearer the truth the healthy nature is pretty safe if he allowed for organization he would be right altogether to feel but not to feel to excess that is the problem if i cant have the one i chose to some fresh maid i will propose adrian hummed a country ballad chapter xxiv when the young experiment again knew the hours that rolled him onward he was in his own room at raynham nothing had changed only a strong fist had knocked him down and stunned him and he opened his eyes to a grey world he had forgotten what he lived for he was weak and thin and with a pale memory of things his functions were the same everything surrounding him was the same he looked upon the old blue hills the farlying fallows the river and the woods he knew them they seemed to have lost recollection of him nor could he find in familiar human faces the secret of intimacy of heretofore they were the same faces they nodded and smiled to him what was lost he could not tell something had been knocked out of him he was sensible of his fathers sweetness of manner and he was grieved that he could not reply to it for every sense of shame and reproach had strangely gone he felt very useless in place of the fiery love for one he now bore about a cold charity to all thus in the heart of the young man died the spring primrose and while it died another heart was pushing forth the primrose of autumn the wonderful change in richard and the wisdom of her admirer now positively proved were exciting matters to lady blandish she was rebuked for certain little rebellious fancies concerning him that had come across her enslaved mind from time to time for was he not almost a prophet it distressed the sentimental lady that a love like richards could pass off in mere smoke and words such as she had heard him speak in abbeywood resolve to emptiness nay it humiliated her personally and the baronets shrewd prognostication humiliated her for how should he know and dare to say that love was a thing of the dust that could be trodden out under the heel of science but he had said so and he had proved himself right she heard with wonderment that richard of his own accord had spoken to his father of the folly he had been guilty of and had begged his pardon the baronet told her this adding that the youth had done it in a cold unwavering way without a movement of his features had evidently done it to throw off the burden of the duty he had conceived he had thought himself bound to acknowledge that he had been the foolish young fellow wishing possibly to abjure the fact by an set of penance he had also given satisfaction to benson and was become a renovated peaceful spirit whose main object appeared to be to get up his physical strength by exercise and no expenditure of speech in her company he was composed and courteous even when they were alone together he did not exhibit a trace of melancholy sober he seemed as one who has recovered from a drunkenness and has determined to drink no more the idea struck her that he might be playing a part but tom bakewell in a private conversation they had informed her that he had received an order from his young master one day while boxing with him not to mention the young ladys name to him as long as he lived and tom could only suppose that she had offended him theoretically wise lady blandish had always thought the baronet she was unprepared to find him thus practically sagacious she fell many degrees she wanted something to cling to so she clung to the man who struck her low love then was earthly its depth could be probed by science a man lived who could measure it from end to end foretell its term handle the young cherub as were he a shot owl we who have flown into cousinship with the empyrean and disported among immortal hosts our base birth as a child of time is made bare to usour wings are cut oh then if science is this victorious enemy of love let us love science was the logic of the ladys heart and secretly cherishing the assurance that she should confute him yet and prove him utterly wrong she gave him the fruits of present success as it is a habit of women to do involuntarily partly the fires took hold of her she felt soft emotions such as a girl feels and they flattered her it was like youth coming back pure women have a second youth the autumn primrose flourished we are advised by the pilgrims scrip that the ways of women which are involution and their practices which are opposition are generally best hit upon by guess work and a bold wordit being impossible to track them and hunt them down in the ordinary style so that we may not ourselves become involved and opposed let us each of us venture a guess and say a bold word as to how it came that the lady who trusted love to be eternal grovelled to him that shattered her tender faith and loved him hitherto it had been simply a sentimental dalliance and gossips had maligned the lady just when the gossips grew tired of their slander and inclined to look upon her charitably she set about to deserve every word they had said of her which may instruct us if you please that gossips have only to persist in lying to be crowned with verity or that one has only to endure evil mouths for a period to gain impunity she was always at the abbey now she was much closeted with the baronet it seemed to be understood that she had taken mrs dorias place benson in his misogynic soul perceived that she was taking lady feverels but any report circulated by benson was sure to meet discredit and drew the gossips upon himself which made his meditations tragic no sooner was one woman defeated than another took the field the object of the system was no sooner safe than its great author was in danger i cant think what has come to benson he said to adrian he seems to have received a fresh legacy of several pounds of lead returned the wise youth and imitating dr cliffords manner change is what he wants distraction send him to wales for a month sir and let richard go with him the two victims of woman may do each other good unfortunately i cant do without him said the baronet then we must continue to have him on our shoulders all day and on our chests all night adrian ejaculated i think while he preserves this aspect we wont have him at the dinnertable said the baronet adrian thought that would be a relief to their digestions and added you know sir what he says receiving a negative adrian delicately explained to him that bensons excessive ponderosity of demeanour was caused by anxiety for the safety of his master you must pardon a faithful fool sir he continued for the baronet became red and exclaimed his stupidity is past belief i have absolutely to bolt my studydoor against him adrian at once beheld a charming scene in the interior of the study not unlike one that benson had visually witnessed for like a wary prophet benson that he might have warrant for what he foretold of the future had a care to spy upon the present warned haply by the pilgrims scrip of which he was a diligent reader and which says rather emphatically could we see times full face we were wise of him now to see times full face it is sometimes necessary to look through keyholes the veteran having a trick of smiling peace to you on one cheek and grimacing confusion on the other behind the curtain decency and a sense of honour restrain most of us from being thus wise and miserable for ever bensons excuse was that he believed in his master who was menaced and moreover notwithstanding his previous tribulation to spy upon cupid was sweet to him so he peeped and he saw a sight he saw times full face or in other words he saw the wiles of woman and the weakness of man which is our history as benson would have written it and a great many poets and philosophers have written it yet it was but the plucking of the autumn primrose that benson had seen a somewhat different operation from the plucking of the spring one very innocent our staid elderly sister has paler blood and has or thinks she has a reason or two about the roots she is not all instinct for this high cause and for that i know men and know him to be the flower of men i give myself to him she makes that lofty inward exclamation while the hand is detaching her from the roots even so strong a selfjustification she requires she has not that blind glory in excess which her younger sister can gild the longest leap with and if mothlike she desires the star she is nervously cautious of candles hence her circles about the dangerous human flame are wide and shy she must be drawn nearer and nearer by a fresh reason she loves to sentimentalize lady blandish had been sentimentalizing for ten years she would have preferred to pursue the game the darkeyed dame was pleased with her smooth life and the soft excitement that did not ruffle it not willingly did she let herself be won sentimentalists says the pilgrims scrip are they who seek to enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done it is the writer says of sentimentalism elsewhere a happy pastime and an important science to the timid the idle and the heartless but a damning one to them who have anything to forfeit however one who could set down the dying for love as a sentimentalism can hardly be accepted as a clear authority assuredly he was not one to avoid the incurring of the immense debtorship in any way but he was a bondsman still to the woman who had forsaken him and a spoken word would have made it seem his duty to face that public scandal which was the last evil to him what had so horrified the virtuous benson richard had already beheld in daphnes bower a simple kissing of the fair white hand doubtless the keyhole somehow added to bensons horror the two similar performances so very innocent had wondrous opposite consequences the first kindled richard to adore woman the second destroyed bensons faith in man but lady blandish knew the difference between the two she understood why the baronet did not speak excused and respected him for it she was content since she must love to love humbly and she had besides her pity for his sorrows to comfort her a hundred fresh reasons for loving him arose and multiplied every day he read to her the secret book in his own handwriting composed for richards marriage guide containing advice and directions to a young husband full of the most tender wisdom and delicacy so she thought nay not wanting in poetry though neither rhymed nor measured he expounded to her the distinctive character of the divers ages of love giving the palm to the flower she put forth over that of spring or the summer rose and while they sat and talked my wound has healed he said how she asked at the fountain of your eyes he replied and drew the joy of new life from her blushes without incurring further debtorship for a thing done chapter xxv let it be some apology for the damage caused by the careering hero and a consolation to the quiet wretches dragged along with him at his chariotwheels that he is generally the last to know when he has made an actual start such a mere creature is he like the rest of us albeit the head of our fates by this you perceive the true hero whether he be a prince or a potboy that he does not plot fortune does all for him he may be compared to one to whom in an electric circle it is given to carry the battery we caper and grimace at his will yet not his the will not his the power tis all fortunes whose puppet he is she deals her dispensations through him yea though our capers be never so comical he laughs not intent upon his own business the true hero asks little services of us here and there thinks it quite natural that they should be acceded to and sees nothing ridiculous in the lamentable contortions we must go through to fulfil them probably he is the elect of fortune because of that notable faculty of being intent upon his own business which is says the pilgrims scrip with men to be valued equal to that force which in water makes a stream this prelude was necessary to the present chapter of richards history it happened that in the turn of the year and while old earth was busy with her flowers the fresh wind blew the little bird sang and hippias feverel the dyspepsy amazed felt the spring move within him he communicated his delightful new sensations to the baronet his brother whose constant exclamation with regard to him was poor hippias all his machinery is bare and had no hope that he would ever be in a condition to defend it from view nevertheless hippias had that hope and so he told his brother making great exposure of his machinery to effect the explanation he spoke of all his physical experiences exultingly and with wonder the achievement of common efforts not usually blazoned he celebrated as triumphs and of course had adrian on his back very quickly but he could bear him or anything now it was such ineffable relief to find himself looking out upon the world of mortals instead of into the black phantasmal abysses of his own complicated frightful structure my mind doesnt so much seem to haunt itself now said hippias nodding shortly and peering out of intense puckers to convey a glimpse of what hellish sufferings his had been i feel as if i had come aboveground a poor dyspepsy may talk as he will but he is the one who never gets sympathy or experiences compassion and it is he whose groaning petitions for charity do at last rout that christian virtue lady blandish a charitable soul could not listen to hippias though she had a heart for little mice and flies and sir austin had also small patience with his brothers gleam of health which was just enough to make his disease visible he remembered his early follies and excesses and bent his ear to him as one man does to another who complains of having to pay a debt legally incurred i think said adrian seeing how the communications of hippias were received that when our nemesis takes lodgings in the stomach its best to act the spartan smile hard and be silent richard alone was decently kind to hippias whether from opposition or real affection could not be said as the young man was mysterious he advised his uncle to take exercise walked with him cultivated cheerful impressions in him and pointed out innocent pursuits he made hippias visit with him some of the poor old folk of the village who bewailed the loss of his cousin austin wentworth and did his best to waken him up and give the outer world a stronger hold on him he succeeded in nothing but in winning his uncles gratitude the season bloomed scarce longer than a week for hippias and then began to languish the poor dyspepsys eager grasp at beatification relaxed he went underground again he announced that he felt spongy thingsone of the more constant throes of his malady his bitter face recurred he chewed the cud of horrid hallucinations he told richard he must give up going about with him people telling of their ailments made him so uncomfortablethe birds were so noisy pairingthe rude bare soil sickened him richard treated him with a gravity equal to his fathers he asked what the doctors said oh the doctors cried hippias with vehement scepticism no man of sense believes in medicine for chronic disorder do you happen to have heard of any new remedy then richard no they advertise a great many cures for indigestion i assure you my dear boy i wonder whether one can rely upon the authenticity of those signatures i see no reason why there should be no cure for such a diseaseeh and its just one of the things a quack as they call them would hit upon sooner than one who is in the beaten track do you know richard my dear boy ive often thought that if we could by any means appropriate to our use some of the extraordinary digestive power that a boa constrictor has in his gastric juices there is really no manner of reason why we should not comfortably dispose of as much of an ox as our stomachs will hold and one might eat french dishes without the wretchedness of thinking whats to follow and this makes me think that those fellows may after all have got some truth in them some secret that of course they require to be paid for we distrust each other in this world too much richard ive felt inclined once or twicebut its absurdif it only alleviated a few of my sufferings i should be satisfied ive no hesitation in saying that i should be quite satisfied if it only did away with one or two and left me free to eat and drink as other people do not that i mean to try them its only a fancyeh what a thing health is my dear boy ah if i were like you i was in love once were you said richard coolly regarding him ive forgotten what i felt hippias sighed youve very much improved my dear boy so people say quoth richard hippias looked at him anxiously if i go to town and get the doctors opinion about trying a new courseeh richard will you come with me i should like your company we could see london together you know enjoy ourselves and hippias rubbed his hands richard smiled at the feeble glimmer of enjoyment promised by his uncles eyes and said he thought it better they should stay where they werean answer that might mean anything hippias immediately became possessed by the beguiling project he went to the baronet and put the matter before him instancing doctors as the object of his journey not quacks of course and requesting leave to take richard sir austin was getting uneasy about his sons manner it was not natural his heart seemed to be frozen he had no confidences he appeared to have no ambitionto have lost the virtues of youth with the poison that had passed out of him he was disposed to try what effect a little travelling might have on him and had himself once or twice hinted to richard that it would be good for him to move about the young man quietly replying that he did not wish to quit raynham at all which was too strict a fulfilment of his fathers original views in educating him there entirely on the day that hippias made his proposal adrian seconded by lady blandish also made one the sweet spring season stirred in adrian as well as in others not to pastoral measures to the joys of the operatic world and bravura glories he also suggested that it would be advisable to carry richard to town for a term and let him know his position and some freedom sir austin weighed the two proposals he was pretty certain that richards passion was consumed and that the youth was now only under the burden of its ashes he had found against his heart at the bellingham inn a great lock of golden hair he had taken it and the lover after feeling about for it with faint hands never asked for it this precious lock miss davenport had thrust it into his hand at belthorpe as lucys last gift what sighs and tears it had weathered the baronet laid it in richards sight one day and beheld him take it up turn it over and drop it down again calmly as if he were handling any common curiosity it pacified him on that score the young mans love was dead dr clifford said rightly he wanted distractions the baronet determined that richard should go hippias and adrian then pressed their several suits as to which should have him hippias when he could forget himself did not lack sense he observed that adrian was not at present a proper companion for richard and would teach him to look on life from the false point you dont understand a young philosopher said the baronet a young philosophers an old fool returned hippias not thinking that his growl had begotten a phrase his brother smiled with gratification and applauded him loudly excellent worthy of your best days youre wrong though in applying it to adrian he has never been precocious all he has done has been to bring sound common sense to bear upon what he hears and sees i think however the baronet added he may want faith in the better qualities of men and this reflection inclined him not to let his son be alone with adrian he gave richard his choice who saw which way his fathers wishes tended and decided so to please him naturally it annoyed adrian extremely he said to his chief i suppose you know what you are doing sir i dont see that we derive any advantage from the family name being made notorious for twenty years of obscene suffering and becoming a byword for our constitutional tendency to stomachic distension before we fortunately encountered quackems pill my uncles tortures have been huge but i would rather society were not intimate with them under their several headings adrian enumerated some of the most abhorrent you know him sir if he conceives a duty he will do it in the face of every decencyall the more obstinate because the conception is rare if he feels a little brisk the morning after the pill he sends the letter that makes us famous we go down to posterity with heightened characteristics to say nothing of a contemporary celebrity nothing less than our being turned insideout to the rabble i confess i dont desire to have my machinery made bare to them sir austin assured the wise youth that hippias had arranged to go to dr bairam he softened adrians chagrin by telling him that in about two weeks they would follow to london hinting also at a prospective summer campaign the day was fixed for richard to depart and the day came madame the eighteenth century called him to her chamber and put into his hand a fiftypound note as her contribution toward his pocketexpenses he did not want it he said but she told him he was a young man and would soon make that fly when he stood on his own feet the old lady did not at all approve of the system in her heart and she gave her grandnephew to understand that should he require more he knew where to apply and secrets would be kept his father presented him with a hundred poundswhich also richard said he did not wanthe did not care for money spend it or not said the baronet perfectly secure in him hippias had few injunctions to observe they were to take up quarters at the hotel algernons general run of company at the house not being altogether wholesome the baronet particularly forewarned hippias of the imprudence of attempting to restrict the young mans movements and letting him imagine he was under surveillance richard having been as it were pollarded by despotism was now to grow up straight and bloom again in complete independence as far as he could feel so did the sage decree and we may pause a moment to reflect how wise were his previsions and how successful they must have been had not fortune the great foe to human cleverness turned against him or he against himself the departure took place on a fine march morning the bird of winter sang from the budding tree in the blue sky sang the bird of summer adrian rode between richard and hippias to the bellingham station and vented his disgust on them after his own humorous fashion because it did not rain and damp their ardour in the rear came lady blandish and the baronet conversing on the calm summit of success you have shaped him exactly to resemble yourself she said pointing with her ridingwhip to the grave stately figure of the young man outwardly perhaps he answered and led to a discussion on purity and strength the lady saying that she preferred purity but you do not said the baronet and there i admire the always true instinct of women that they all worship strength in whatever form and seem to know it to be the child of heaven whereas purity is but a characteristic a garment and can be spottedhow soon for there are questions in this life with which we must grapple or be lost and when hunted by that cold eye of intense innerconsciousness the clearest soul becomes a cunning fox if it have not courage to stand and do battle strength indicates a boundless naturelike the maker strength is a god to youpurity a toy a pretty one and you seem to be fond of playing with it he added with unaccustomed slyness the lady listened pleased at the sportive malice which showed that the constraint on his mind had left him it was for women to fight their fight now she only took part in it for amusement this is how the ranks of our enemies are thinned no sooner do poor women put up a champion in their midst than she betrays them i see she said archly we are the lovelier vessels you claim the more direct descent men are seedlings womenslips nay you have said so she cried out at his gestured protestation laughing but i never printed it oh what you speak answers for print with me exquisite blandish he could not choose but love her tell me what are your plans she asked may a woman know he replied i have none or you would share them i shall study him in the world this indifference must wear off i shall mark his inclinations now and he shall be what he inclines to occupation will be his prime safety his cousin austins plan of life appears most to his taste and he can serve the people that way as well as in parliament should he have no stronger ambition the clear duty of a man of any wealth is to serve the people as he best can he shall go among austins set if he wishes it though personally i find no pleasure in rash imaginations and undigested schemes built upon the mere instinct of principles look at him now said the lady he seems to care for nothing not even for the beauty of the day or adrians jokes added the baronet adrian could be seen to be trying zealously to torment a laugh or a confession of irritation out of his hearers stretching out his chin to one and to the other with audible asides richard he treated as a new instrument of destruction about to be let loose on the slumbering metropolis hippias as one in an interesting condition and he got so much fun out of the notion of these two journeying together and the mishaps that might occur to them that he esteemed it almost a personal insult for his hearers not to laugh the wise youths dull life at raynham had afflicted him with many peculiarities of the professional joker oh the spring the spring he cried as in scorn of his sallies they exchanged their unmeaning remarks on the sweet weather across him you seem both to be uncommonly excited by the operations of turtles rooks and daws why cant you let them alone wind bloweth cock croweth doodledoo hippy verteth ricky sterteth sing cuckoo theres an old native pastoralwhy dont you write a spring sonnet ricky the asparagusbeds are full of promise i hear and eke the strawberry berries i fancy your pegasus has a taste for what kind of berry was that i saw some verses of yours about onceamatory verses to some kind of berryyewberry blueberry glueberry pretty verses decidedly warm lips eyes bosom legslegs i dont think you gave her any legs no legs and no nose that appears to be the poetic taste of the day it shall be admitted that you create the very beauties for a chaste people o might i lie where leans her lute and offend no moral community thats not a bad image of yours my dear boy her shape is like an antelope upon the eastern hills but as a candid critic i would ask you if the likeness can be considered correct when you give her no legs you will see at the ballet that you are in error about women at present richard that admirable institution which our venerable elders have imported from gallia for the instruction of our gaping youth will edify and astonish you i assure you i used from reading the pilgrims scrip to imagine all sorts of things about them till i was taken there and learnt that they are very like us after all and then they ceased to trouble me mystery is the great danger to youth my son mystery is womans redoubtable weapon o richard of the ordeal im aware that youve had your lessons in anatomy but nothing will persuade you that an anatomical figure means flesh and blood you cant realize the fact do you intend to publish when youre in town itll be better not to put your name having ones name to a volume of poems is as bad as to an advertising pill i will send you an early copy adrian when i publish quoth richard hark at that old blackbird uncle yes hippias quavered looking up from the usual subject of his contemplation and trying to take an interest in him fine old fellow what a chuckle he gives out before he flies not unlike july nightingales you know that bird i told you ofthe blackbird that had its mate shot and used to come to sing to old dame bakewells bird from the tree opposite a rascal knocked it over the day before yesterday and the dame says her bird hasnt sung a note since extraordinary hippias muttered abstractedly i remember the verses but wheres your moral interposed the wrathful adrian wheres constancy rewarded the ouzelcock so black of hue with orangetawny bill the rascal with his aim so true the poets little quill wheres the moral of that except that alls game to the poet certainly we have a noble example of the devotedness of the female who for three entire days refuses to make herself heard on account of a defunct male i suppose thats what ricky dwells on as you please my dear adrian says richard and points out larchbuds to his uncle as they ride by the young green wood the wise youth was driven to extremity such a lapse from his pupils heroics to this last verge of arcadian coolness adrian could not believe in hark at this old blackbird he cried in his turn and pretending to interpret his fits of song oh what a pretty comedydont we wear the mask well my fiescogenoa will be our own tomorrowonly wait until the train has startedjolly jolly jolly well be winners yet not a bad verseeh ricky my lucius junius you do the blackbird well said richard and looked at him in a manner mildly affable adrian shrugged youre a young man of wonderful powers he emphatically observed meaning to say that richard quite beat him for which opinion richard gravely thanked him and with this they rode into bellingham there was young tom blaize at the station in his sunday beaver and gala waistcoat and neckcloth coming the lord over tom bakewell who had preceded his master in charge of the baggage he likewise was bound for london richard as he was dismounting heard adrian say to the baronet the beast sir appears to be going to fetch beauty but he paid no heed to the words whether young tom heard them or not adrians look took the lord out of him and he shrunk away into obscurity where the nearest approach to the fashions which the tailors of bellingham could supply to him sat upon him more easily and he was not stiffened by the eyes of the superiors whom he sought to rival the baronet lady blandish and adrian remained on horseback and received richards adieux across the palings he shook hands with each of them in the same kindly cold way elicitating from adrian a marked encomium on his style of doing it the train came up and richard stepped after his uncle into one of the carriages now surely there will come an age when the presentation of science at war with fortune and the fates will be deemed the true epic of modern life and the aspect of a scientific humanist who by dint of incessant watchfulness has maintained a system against those active forties cannot be reckoned less than sublime even though at the moment he but sit upon his horse on a fine march morning such as this and smile wistfully to behold the son of his heart his system incarnate wave a serene adieu to tutelage neither too eager nor morbidly unwilling to try his luck alone for a term of two weeks at present i am aware an audience impatient for blood and glory scorns the stress i am putting on incidents so minute a picture so little imposing an audience will come to whom it will be given to see the elementary machinery at work who as it were from some slight hint of the straws will feel the winds of march when they do not blow to them will nothing be trivial seeing that they will have in their eyes the invisible conflict going on around us whose features a nod a smile a laugh of ours perpetually changes and they will perceive moreover that in real life all hangs together the train is laid in the lifting of an eyebrow that bursts upon the field of thousands they will see the links of things as they pass and wonder not as foolish people now do that this great matter came out of that small one such an audience then will participate in the baronets gratification at his sons demeanour wherein he noted the calm bearing of experience not gained in the usual wanton way and will not be without some excited apprehension at his twinge of astonishment when just as the train went sliding into swiftness he beheld the grave cold selfpossessed young man throw himself back in the carriage violently laughing science was at a loss to account for that sir austin checked his mind from inquiring that he might keep suspicion at a distance but he thought it odd and the jarring sensation that ran along his nerves at the sight remained with him as he rode home lady blandishs tender womanly intuition bade her say you see it was the very thing he wanted he has got his natural spirits already it was adrian put in his word the exact thing he wanted his spirits have returned miraculously something amused him said the baronet with an eye on the puffing train probably something his uncle said or did lady blandish suggested and led off at a gallop her conjecture chanced to be quite correct the cause for richards laughter was simple enough hippias on finding the carriagedoor closed on him became all at once aware of the brighthaired hope which dwells in change for one who does not woo her too frequently and to express his sudden relief from mental despondency at the amorous prospect the dyspepsy bent and gave his hands a sharp rub between his legs which unlucky action brought adrians pastoral hippy verteth sing cuckoo in such comic colours before richard that a demon of laughter seized him hippy verteth every time he glanced at his uncle the song sprang up and he laughed so immoderately that it looked like madness come upon him why why why what are you laughing at my dear boy said hippias and was provoked by the contagious exercise to a modest ha ha why what are you laughing at uncle cried richard i really dont know hippias chuckled nor i uncle sing cuckoo they laughed themselves into the pleasantest mood imaginable hippias not only came aboveground he flew about in the very skies verting like any blithe creature of the season he remembered old legal jokes and anecdotes of circuit and richard laughed at them all but more at himhe was so genial and childishly fresh and innocently joyful at his own transformation while a lurking doubt in the bottom of his eyes now and then that it might not last and that he must go underground again lent him a look of pathos and humour which tickled his youthful companion irresistibly and made his heart warm to him i tell you what uncle said richard i think travellings a capital thing the best thing in the world my dear boy hippias returned it makes me wish i had given up that work of mine and tried it before instead of chaining myself to a task were quite different beings in a minute i am hem what shall we have for dinner leave that to me uncle i shall order for you you know i intend to make you well how gloriously we go along i should like to ride on a railway every day hippias remarked they say it rather injures the digestion nonsense see how youll digest tonight and tomorrow perhaps i shall do something yet sighed hippias alluding to the vast literary fame he had aforetime dreamed of i hope i shall have a good night tonight of course you will what after laughing like that ugh hippias grunted i daresay richard you sleep the moment you get into bed the instant my heads on my pillow and up the moment i wake healths everything healths everything echoed hippias from his immense distance and if youll put yourself in my hands richard continued you shall do just as i do you shall be well and strong and sing jolly like adrians blackbird you shall upon my honour uncle he specified the hours of devotion to his uncles recoveryno less than twelve a daythat he intended to expend and his cheery robustness almost won his uncle to leap up recklessly and clutch health as his own mind quoth hippias with a halfseduced smile mind your dishes are not too savoury light food and claret regular meals and amusement lend your heart to all but give it to none exclaims young wisdom and hippias mutters yes yes and intimates that the origin of his malady lay in his not following that maxim earlier love ruins us my dear boy he said thinking to preach richard a lesson and richard boisterously broke out the love of monsieur francatelli it was the ruin ofet coetera hippias blinked exclaiming really my dear boy i never saw you so excited its the railway its the fun uncle ah hippias wagged a melancholy head youve got the golden bride keep her if you can thats a pretty fable of your fathers i gave him the idea though austin filches a great many of my ideas heres the idea in verse uncle o sunless walkers by the tide o have you seen the golden bride they say that she is fair beyond all women faithful and more fond you know the young inquirer comes to a group of penitent sinners by the brink of a stream they howl and answer faithful she is but she forsakes and fond yet endless woe she makes and fair but with this curse shes crossd to know her not till she is lost then the doleful party march off in single file solemnly and the fabulist pursues she hath a palace in the west bright hesper lights her to her rest and him the morning star awakes whom to her charmed arms she takes so lives he till he sees alas the maids of baser metal pass and prodigal of the happiness she lends him he asks to share it with one of them there is the silver maid and the copper and the brassy maid and others of them first you know he tries argentine and finds her only twenty to the pound and has a worse experience with copperina till he descends to the scullery and the lower he goes the less obscure become the features of his bride of gold and all her radiance shines forth my uncle verse rather blunts the point well keep to her now youve got her says hippias we will unclelook how the farms fly past look at the cattle in the fields and how the lines duck and swim up she claims the whole and not the part the coin of an unused heart to gain his golden bride again he hunts with melancholy men and is waked no longer by the morning star not if he doesnt sleep till an hour before it rises hippias interjected you dont rhyme badly but stick to prose poetrys a basemetal maid im not sure that any writings good for the digestion im afraid it has spoilt mine fear nothing uncle laughed richard you shall ride in the park with me every day to get an appetite you and i and the golden bride you know that little poem of sandoes she rides in the park on a prancing bay she and her squires together her dark locks gleam from a bonnet of grey and toss with the tossing feather too calmly proud for a glance of pride is the beautiful face as it passes the cockneys nod to each other aside the coxcombs lift their glasses and throng to her sigh to her you that can breach the icewall that guards her securely you have not such bliss though she smile on you each as the heart that can image her purely wasnt sandoe once a friend of my fathers i suppose they quarrelled he understands the heart what does he make his humble lover say true madam you may think to part conditions by a glacierridge but beautys for the largest heart and all abysses love can bridge hippias now laughed grimly as men laugh at the emptiness of words largest heart he sneered whats a glacierridge ive never seen one i cant deny it rhymes with bridge but dont go parading your admiration of that person richard your father will speak to you on the subject when he thinks fit i thought they had quarrelled said richard what a pity and he murmured to a pleased ear beautys for the largest heart the flow of their conversation was interrupted by the entrance of passengers at a station richard examined their faces with pleasure all faces pleased him human nature sat tributary at the feet of him and his golden bride as he could not well talk his thoughts before them he looked out at the windows and enjoyed the changing landscape projecting all sorts of delights for his old friend ripton and musing hazily on the wondrous things he was to do in the world of the great service he was to be to his fellowcreatures in the midst of his reveries he was landed in london tom bakewell stood at the carriage door a glance told richard that his squire had something curious on his mind and he gave tom the word to speak out tom edged his master out of hearing and began sputtering a laugh dashd if i can help it sir he said that young tom heve come to town dressed that spicy and he dont know his way about no more than a stag hes come to fetch somebody from another rail and he dont know how to get there and he aint sure about which rail tis look at him mr richard there he goes young tom appeared to have the weight of all london on his beaver who has he come for richard asked dont you know sir you dont like me to mention the name mumbled tom bursting to be perfectly intelligible is it for her tom miss lucy sir richard turned away and was seized by hippias who begged him to get out of the noise and pother and caught hold of his slack arm to bear him into a conveyance but richard by wheeling half to the right or left always got his face round to the point where young tom was manoeuvring to appear at his ease even when they were seated in the conveyance hippias could not persuade him to drive off he made the excuse that he did not wish to start till there was a clear road at last young tom cast anchor by a policeman and doubtless at the officials suggestion bashfully took seat in a cab and was shot into the whirlpool of london richard then angrily asked his driver what he was waiting for are you ill my boy said hippias wheres your colour he laughed oddly and made a random answer that he hoped the fellow would drive fast i hate slow motion after being in the railway he said hippias assured him there was something the matter with him nothing uncle nothing said richard looking fiercely candid they say that when the skill and care of men rescue a drowned wretch from extinction and warm the flickering spirit into steady flame such pain it is the blood forcing its way along the dry channels and the heavilyticking nerves and the sullen heartthe struggle of life and death in himgrim death relaxing his gripe such pain it is he cries out no thanks to them that pull him by inches from the depths of the dead river and he who has thought a love extinct and is surprised by the old fires and the old tyranny he rebels and strives to fight clear of the cloud of forgotten sensations that settle on him such pain it is the old sweet music reviving through his frame and the charm of his passion filing him afresh still was fair lucy the one woman to richard he had forbidden her name but from an instinct of selfdefence must the maids of baser metal dominate him anew it is in lucys shape thinking of her now so near himhis darling all her graces her sweetness her truth for despite his bitter blame of her he knew her trueswam in a thousand visions before his eyes visions pathetic and full of glory that now wrung his heart and now elated it as well might a ship attempt to calm the sea as this young man the violent emotion that began to rage in his breast i shall not see her he said to himself exultingly and at the same instant thought how black was every corner of the earth but that one spot where lucy stood how utterly cheerless the place he was going to then he determined to bear it to live in darkness there was a refuge in the idea of a voluntary martyrdom for if i chose i could see herthis day within an houri could see her and touch her hand and oh heavenbut i do not choose and a great wave swelled through him and was crushed down only to swell again more stormily then tom bakewells words recurred to him that young tom blaize was uncertain where to go for her and that she might be thrown on this babylon alone and flying from point to point it struck him that they had known at raynham of her return and had sent him to town to be out of the waythey had been miserably plotting against him once more they shall see what right they have to fear me ill shame them was the first turn taken by his wrathful feelings as he resolved to go and see her safe and calmly return to his uncle whom he sincerely believed not to be one of the conspirators nevertheless after forming that resolve he sat still as if there were something fatal in the wheels that bore him away from itperhaps because he knew as some do when passion is lord that his intelligence juggled with him though none the less keenly did he feel his wrongs and suspicions his golden bride was waning fast but when hippias ejaculated to cheer him we shall soon be there the spell broke richard stopped the cab saying he wanted to speak to tom and would ride with him the rest of the journey he knew well enough which line of railway his lucy must come by he had studied every town and station on the line before his uncle could express more than a mute remonstrance he jumped out and hailed tom bakewell who came behind with the boxes and baggage in a companion cab his head a yard beyond the window to make sure of his ark of safety the vehicle preceding what an extraordinary impetuous boy it is said hippias were in the very street within a minute the stalwart berry despatched by the baronet to arrange everything for their comfort had opened the door and made his bow mr richard sirevaporated was berrys modulated inquiry behindamong the boxes fool hippias growled as he received berrys muscular assistance to alight lunch readyeh luncheon was ordered precise at two oclock sirbeen in attendance one quarter of an hour heah berry sang out to the second cab which with its pyramid of luggage remained stationary some thirty paces distant at his voice the majestic pile deliberately turned its back on them and went off in a contrary direction chapter xxvi on the stroke of the hour when ripton thompson was accustomed to consult his gold watch for practical purposes and sniff freedom and the forthcoming dinner a burglarious foot entered the clerks office where he sat and a man of a scowling countenance who looked a villain and whom he was afraid he knew slid a letter into his hands nodding that it would be prudent for him to read and be silent ripton obeyed in alarm apparently the contents of the letter relieved his conscience for he reached down his hat and told mr beazley to inform his father that he had business of pressing importance in the west and should meet him at the station mr beazley zealously waited upon the paternal thompson without delay and together making their observations from the window they beheld a cab of many boxes into which ripton darted and was followed by one in grooms dress it was saturday the day when ripton gave up his lawreadings magnanimously to bestow himself upon his family and mr thompson liked to have his sons arm as he walked down to the station but that third glass of port which always stood for his second and the grooms suggestion of aristocratic acquaintances prevented mr thompson from interfering so ripton was permitted to depart in the cab ripton made a study of the letter he held it had the preciseness of an imperial mandate dear riptonyou are to get lodgings for a lady immediately not a word to a soul then come along with tom rdf lodgings for a lady ripton meditated aloud what sort of lodgings where am i to get lodgings whos the ladyi say he addressed the mysterious messenger so youre tom bakewell are you tom tom grinned his identity do you remember the rick tom ha ha we got out of that neatly we might all have been transported though i could have convicted you tom safe its no use coming across a practised lawyer now tell me ripton having flourished his powers commenced his examination whos this lady better wait till you see mr richard sir tom resumed his scowl to reply ah ripton acquiesced is she young tom tom said she was not old handsome tom some might think one thing some another tom said and where does she come from now asked ripton with the friendly cheerfulness of a baffled counsellor comes from the country sir a friend of the family i suppose a relation ripton left this insinuating query to be answered by a look toms face was a dead blank ah ripton took a breath and eyed the mask opposite him why youre quite a scholar tom mr richard is well all right at home come to town this mornin with his uncle said tom all well thank ye sir ha cried ripton more than ever puzzled now i see you all came to town today and these are your boxes outside so so but mr richard writes for me to get lodgings for a lady there must be some mistakehe wrote in a hurry he wants lodgings for you alleh m sure i dn know what he wants said tom youd better go by the letter sir ripton reconsulted that document lodgings for a lady and then come along with tom not a word to a soul i say that looks likebut he never cared for them you dont mean to say tom hes been running away with anybody tom fell back upon his first reply better wait till ye see mr richard sir and ripton exclaimed hanged if you aint the tightest witness i ever saw i shouldnt like to have you in a box some of you country fellows beat any number of cockneys you do tom received the compliment stubbornly on his guard and ripton as nothing was to be got out of him set about considering how to perform his friends injunctions deciding firstly that a lady fresh from the country ought to lodge near the parks in which direction he told the cabman to drive thus unaware of his high destiny ripton joined the hero and accepted his character in the new comedy it is nevertheless true that certain favoured people do have beneficent omens to prepare them for their parts when the hero is in full career so that they really may be nerved to meet him ay and to check him in his course had they that signal courage for instance mrs elizabeth berry a ripe and wholesome landlady of advertised lodgings on the borders of kensington noted as she sat rocking her contemplative person before the parlour fire this very march afternoon a supernatural tendency in that fire to burn all on one side which signifies that a wedding approaches the house whywho shall say omens are as impassable as heroes it may be because in these affairs the fire is thought to be all on one side enough that the omen exists and spoke its solemn warning to the devout woman mrs berry in her circle was known as a certificated lecturer against the snares of matrimony still that was no reason why she should not like a wedding expectant therefore she watched the one glowing cheek of hymen and with pleasing tremours beheld a cab of many boxes draw up by her bit of garden and a gentleman emerge from it in the set of consulting an advertisement paper the gentleman required lodgings for a lady lodgings for a lady mrs berry could produce and a very roseate smile for a gentleman so much so that ripton forgot to ask about the terms which made the landlady in mrs berry leap up to embrace him as the happy man but her experienced womans eye checked her enthusiasm he had not the air of a bridegroom he did not seem to have a weight on his chest or an itch to twiddle everything with his fingers at any rate he was not the bridegroom for whom omens fly abroad promising to have all ready for the lady within an hour mrs berry fortified him with her card curtsied him back to his cab and floated him off on her smiles the remarkable vehicle which had woven this thread of intrigue through london streets now proceeded sedately to finish its operations ripton was landed at a hotel in westminster ere he was halfway up the stairs a door opened and his old comrade in adventure rushed down richard allowed no time for salutations have you done it was all he asked for answer ripton handed him mrs berrys card richard took it and left him standing there five minutes elapsed and then ripton heard the gracious rustle of feminine garments above richard came a little in advance leading and halfsupporting a figure in a blacksilk mantle and small black straw bonnet youngthat was certain though she held her veil so close he could hardly catch the outlines of her face girlishly slender and sweet and simple in appearance the hush that came with her and her soft manner of moving stirred the silly youth to some of those ardours that awaken the knight of dames in our bosoms he felt that he would have given considerable sums for her to lift her veil he could see that she was tremblingperhaps weeping it was the master of her fate she clung to they passed him without speaking as she went by her head passively bent ripton had a glimpse of noble tresses and a lovely neck great golden curls hung loosely behind pouring from under her bonnet she looked a captive borne to the sacrifice what ripton after a sight of those curls would have given for her just to lift her veil an instant and strike him blind with beauty was fortunately for his exchequer never demanded of him and he had absolutely been composing speeches as he came along in the cab gallant speeches for the lady and sly congratulatory ones for his friend to be delivered as occasion should serve that both might know him a man of the world and be at their ease he forgot the smirking immoralities he had revelled in this was clearly serious ripton did not require to be told that his friend was in love and meant that life and death business called marriage parents and guardians consenting or not presently richard returned to him and said hurriedly i want you now to go to my uncle at our hotel keep him quiet till i come say i had to see yousay anything i shall be there by the dinner hour rip i must talk to you alone after dinner ripton feebly attempted to reply that he was due at home he was very curious to hear the plot of the new comedy and besides there was richards face questioning him sternly and confidently for signs of unhesitating obedience he finished his grimaces by asking the name and direction of the hotel richard pressed his hand it is much to obtain even that recognition of our devotion from the hero tom bakewell also received his priming and to judge by his chuckles and grins rather appeared to enjoy the work cut out for him in a few minutes they had driven to their separate destinations ripton was left to the unusual exercise of his fancy such is the nature of youth and its thirst for romance that only to act as a subordinate is pleasant when one unfurls the standard of defiance to parents and guardians he may be sure of raising a lawless troop of adolescent ruffians born rebels to any amount the beardless crew know that they have not a chance of pay but what of that when the rosy prospect of thwarting their elders is in view though it is to see another eat the forbidden fruit they will run all his risks with him gaily ripton took rank as lieutenant in the enterprise and the moment his heart had sworn the oaths he was rewarded by an exquisite sense of the charms of existence london streets wore a sly laugh to him he walked with a dandified heel the generous youth ogled aristocratic carriages and glanced intimately at the ladies overflowingly happy the crossingsweepers blessed him he hummed lively tunes he turned over old jokes in his mouth unctuously he hugged himself he had a mind to dance down piccadilly and all because a friend of his was running away with a pretty girl and he was in the secret it was only when he stood on the doorstep of richards hotel that his jocund mood was a little dashed by remembering that he had then to commence the duties of his office and must fabricate a plausible story to account for what he knew nothing abouta part that the greatest of sages would find it difficult to perform the young however whom sages well may envy seldom fail in lifting their inventive faculties to the level of their spirits and two minutes of hippiass angry complaints against the friend he serenely inquired for gave ripton his cue were in the very streetwithin a stonesthrow of the house and he jumps like a harlequin out of my cab into another he must be madthat boys got madness in himand carries off all the boxesmy dinnerpills too and keeps away the whole of the day though he promised to go to the doctor and had a dozen engagements with me said hippias venting an enraged snarl to sum up his grievances ripton at once told him that the doctor was not at home why you dont mean to say hes been to the doctor hippias cried out he has called on him twice sir said ripton expressively on leaving me he was going a third time i shouldnt wonder thats what detains himhes so determined by fine degrees ripton ventured to grow circumstantial saying that richards case was urgent and required immediate medical advice and that both he and his father were of opinion richard should not lose an hour in obtaining it hes alarmed about himself said ripton and tapped his chest hippias protested he had never heard a word from his nephew of any physical affliction he was afraid of making you anxious i think sir algernon feverel and richard came in while he was hammering at the alphabet to recollect the first letter of the doctors name they had met in the hall below and were laughing heartily as they entered the room ripton jumped up to get the initiative have you seen the doctor he asked significantly plucking at richards fingers richard was all abroad at the question algernon clapped him on the back what the deuce do you want with doctor boy the solid thump awakened him to see matters as they were oh ay the doctor he said smiling frankly at his lieutenant why he tells me hed back me to do milos trick in a week from the present dayuncle he came forward to hippias i hope youll excuse me for running off as i did i was in a hurry i left something at the railway this stupid rip thinks i went to the doctor about myself the fact was i wanted to fetch the doctor to see you hereso that you might have no trouble you know you cant bear the sight of his instruments and skeletonsive heard you say so you said it set all your marrow in revoltfried your marrow i think were the words and made you see twenty thousand different ways of sliding down to the chambers of the grim king dont you remember hippias emphatically did not remember and he did not believe the story irritation at the mad ravishment of his pillbox rendered him incredulous as he had no means of confuting his nephew all he could do safely to express his disbelief in him was to utter petulant remarks on his powerlessness to appear at the dinnertable that day upon whichberry just then trumpeting dinneralgernon seized one arm of the dyspepsy and richard another and the laughing couple bore him into the room where dinner was laid ripton sniggering in the rear the really happy man of the party they had fun at the dinnertable richard would have it and his gaiety his byplay his princely superiority to truth and heroic promise of overriding all our laws his handsome face the lord and possessor of beauty that he looked as it were a star shining on his forehead gained the old complete mastery over ripton who had been mentally at least half patronizing him till then because he knew more of london and life and was aware that his friend now depended upon him almost entirely after a second circle of the claret the hero caught his lieutenants eye across the table and said we must go out and talk over that lawbusiness rip before you go do you think the old lady has any chance not a bit said ripton authoritatively but its worth fightingeh rip oh certainly was riptons mature opinion richard observed that riptons father seemed doubtful ripton cited his fathers habitual caution richard made a playful remark on the necessity of sometimes acting in opposition to fathers ripton agreed to itin certain cases yes yes in certain cases said richard pretty legal morality gentlemen algernon interjected hippias adding and lay too the pair of uncles listened further to the fictitious dialogue well kept up on both sides and in the end desired a statement of the old ladys garrulous case hippias offering to decide what her chances were in law and algernon to give a commonsense judgment rip will tell you said richard deferentially signalling the lawyer im a bad hand at these matters tell them how it stands rip ripton disguised his excessive uneasiness under endeavours to right his position on his chair and inwardly praying speed to the claret jug to come and strengthen his wits began with a careless aspect oh nothing shevery curious old character sheawears a wig sheavery curious old character indeed sheaquite the old style theres no doing anything with her and ripton took a long breath to relieve himself after his elaborate fiction so it appears hippias commented and algernon asked well and about her wig somebody stole it while richard whose features were grim with suppressed laughter bade the narrator continue ripton lunged for the claret jug he had got an old lady like an oppressive bundle on his brain and he was as helpless as she was in the pangs of ineffectual authorship his ideas shot at her wig and then at her one characteristic of extreme obstinacy and tore back again at her wig but she would not be animated the obstinate old thing would remain a bundle law studies seemed light in comparison with this tremendous task of changing an old lady from a doll to a human creature he flung off some claret perspired freely and with a mental tribute to the cleverness of those author fellows recommenced oh nothing sherichard knows her better than i doan old ladysomewhere down in suffolk i think we had better advise her not to proceed the expenses of litigation are enormous shei think we had better advise her to stop short and not make any scandal and not make any scandal algernon took him up come come theres something more than a wig then ripton was commanded to proceed whether she did or no the luckless fictionist looked straight at his pitiless leader and blurted out dubiously shetheres a daughter born with effort ejaculated hippias must give her pause after that and ill take the opportunity to stretch my length on the sofa heigho thats true what austin says the general prayer should be for a full stomach and the individual for one that works well for on that basis only are we a match for temporal matters and able to contemplate eternal sententious but true i gave him the idea though take care of your stomachs boys and if ever you hear of a monument proposed to a scientific cook or gastronomic doctor send in your subscriptions or say to him while he lives go forth and be a knight ha they have a good cook at this house he suits me better than ours at raynham i almost wish i had brought my manuscript to town i feel so much better aha i didnt expect to digest at all without my regular incentive i think i shall give it upwhat do you say to the theatre tonight boys richard shouted bravo uncle let mr thompson finish first said algernon i want to hear the conclusion of the story the old girl has a wig and a daughter ill swear somebody runs away with one of the two fill your glass mr thompson and forward so somebody does ripton received his impetus and theyre found in town together he made a fresh jerk sheathat is the old ladyfound them in company she finds him with her wig on in company said algernon capital heres matter for the lawyers and you advise her not to proceed under such circumstances of aggravation hippias observed humorously twinkling with his stomachic contentment its the daughter ripton sighed and surrendering to pressure hurried on recklessly a runaway matchbeautiful girlthe only son of a baronetmarried by special licence athe point is he now brightened and spoke from his own element the point is whether the marriage can be annulled as shes of the catholic persuasion and hes a protestant and theyre both married under age thats the point having come to the point he breathed extreme relief and saw things more distinctly not a little amazed at his leaders horrified face the two elders were making various absurd inquiries when richard sent his chair to the floor crying what a muddle youre in rip youre mixing halfadozen stories together the old lady i told you about was old dame bakewell and the dispute was concerning a neighbour of hers who encroached on her garden and i said id pay the money to see her righted ah said ripton humbly i was thinking of the other her garden cabbages dont interest me here come along richard beckoned to him savagely ill be back in five minutes uncle he nodded coolly to either the young men left the room in the hallpassage they met berry dressed to return to raynham richard dropped a helper to the intelligence into his hand and warned him not to gossip much of london berry bowed perfect discreetness what on earth induced you to talk about protestants and catholics marrying rip said richard as soon as they were in the street why ripton answered i was so hard pushed for it pon my honour i didnt know what to say i aint an author you know i cant make a story i was trying to invent a point and i couldnt think of any other and i thought that was just the point likely to make a jolly good dispute capital dinners they give at those crack hotels why did you throw it all upon me i didnt begin on the old lady the hero mused its odd its impossible you could have known ill tell you why rip i wanted to try you you fib well at long range but you dont do at close quarters and single combat youre good behind walls but not worth a shot in the open i just see what youre fit for youre staunchthat i am certain of you always were lead the way to one of the parksdown in that direction you knowwhere she is ripton led the way his dinner had prepared this young englishman to defy the whole artillery of established morals with the muffled roar of london around them alone in a dark slope of green the hero leaning on his henchman and speaking in a harsh clear undertone delivered his explanations doubtless the true heroic insignia and point of view will be discerned albeit in common privates uniform theyve been plotting against me for a year rip when you see her youll know what it was to have such a creature taken away from you it nearly killed me never mind what she is shes the most perfect and noble creature god ever made its not only her beautyi dont care so much about thatbut when youve once seen her she seems to draw music from all the nerves of your body but shes such an angel i worship her and her minds like her face shes pure gold there youll see her tonight well he pursued after inflating ripton with this rapturous prospect they got her away and i recovered it was mister adrians work whats my fathers objection to her because of her birth shes educated her manners are beautifulfull of refinementquick and soft can they show me one of their ladies like hershes the daughter of a naval lieutenant because shes a catholic what has religion to do withhe pronounced love a little modestlyas it were a blush in his voice well when i recovered i thought i did not care for her it shows how we know ourselves and i cared for nothing i felt as if i had no blood i tried to imitate my dear austin i wish to god he were here i love austin he would understand her hes coming back this year and thenbut itll be too late thenwell my fathers always scheming to make me perfecthe has never spoken to me a word about her but i can see her in his eyeshe wanted to give me a change he said and asked me to come to town with my uncle hippy and i consented it was another plot to get me out of the way as i live i had no more idea of meeting her than of flying to heaven he lifted his face look at those old elm branches how they seem to mix among the starsglittering fruits of winter ripton tipped his comical nose upward and was in duty bound to say yes though he observed no connection between them and the narrative well the hero went on i came to town there i heard she was coming toocoming home it must have been fate ripton heaven forgive me i was angry with her and i thought i should like to see her onceonly onceand reproach her for being falsefor she never wrote to me and oh the dear angel what she must have sufferedi gave my uncle the slip and got to the railway she was coming by there was a fellow going to meet hera farmers sonand good god they were going to try and make her marry him i remembered it all then a servant of the farm had told me that fellow went to the wrong station i suppose for we saw nothing of him there she wasnot changed a bitlooking lovelier than ever and when she saw me i knew in a minute that she must love me till deathyou dont know what it is yet ripwill you believe itthough i was as sure she loved me and had been true as steel as that i shall see her tonight i spoke bitterly to her and she bore it meeklyshe looked like a saint i told her there was but one hope of life for meshe must prove she was true and as i give up all so must she i dont know what i said the thought of losing her made me mad she tried to plead with me to waitit was for my sake i know i pretended like a miserable hypocrite that she did not love me at all i think i said shameful things oh what noble creatures women are she hardly had strength to move i took her to that place where you found us rip she went down on her knees to me i never dreamed of anything in life so lovely as she looked then her eyes were thrown up bright with a crowd of tearsher dark brows bent together like pain and beauty meeting in one and her glorious golden hair swept off her shoulders as she hung forward to my handscould i lose such a prizeif anything could have persuaded me would not thati thought of dantes madonnaguidos magdalenis there sin in it i see none and if there is its all mine i swear shes spotless of a thought of sin i see her very soul cease to love her who dares ask me cease to love her why i live on herto see her little chin straining up from her throat as she knelt to methere was one curl that fell across her throat ripton listened for more richard had gone off in a muse at the picture well said ripton and how about that young farmer fellow the heros head was again contemplating the starry branches his lieutenants question came to him after an interval young tom why its young tom blaizeson of our old enemy rip i like the old man now oh i saw nothing of the fellow lord cried ripton are we going to get into a mess with blaizes again i dont like that his commander quietly passed his likes or dislikes but when he goes to the train and finds shes not there ripton suggested ive provided for that the fool went to the southeast instead of the southwest all warmth all sweetness comes with the southwestive provided for that friend rip my trusty tom awaits him there as if by accident he tells him he has not seen her and advises him to remain in town and go for her there tomorrow and the day following tom has money for the work young tom ought to see london you know riplike you we shall gain some good clear days and when old blaize hears of itwhat then i have her shes minebesides he wont hear for a week this tom beats that tom in cunning ill wager ha ha the hero burst out at a recollection what do you think rip my father has some sort of system with me it appears and when i came to town the time before he took me to some peoplethe grandisonsand what do you think one of the daughters is a little girla nice little thing enough very funnyand he wants me to wait for her he hasnt said so but i know it i know what he means nobody understands him but me i know he loves me and is one of the best of menbut just considera little girl who just comes up to my elbow isnt it ridiculous did you ever hear such nonsense ripton emphasized his opinion that it certainly was foolish no no the dies cast said richard theyve been plotting for a year up to this day and this is what comes of it if my father loves me he will love her and if he loves me hell forgive my acting against his wishes and see it was the only thing to be done come step out what a time weve been and away he went compelling ripton to the sort of strides a drummerboy has to take beside a column of grenadiers ripton began to wish himself in love seeing that it endowed a man with wind so that he could breathe great sighs while going at a tremendous pace and experience no sensation of fatigue the hero was communing with the elements his familiars and allowed him to pant as he pleased some keeneyed kensington urchins noticing the discrepancy between the pedestrian powers of the two aimed their wit at mr thompson juniors expense the pace and nothing but the pace induced ripton to proclaim that they had gone too far when they discovered that they had over shot the mark by half a mile in the street over which stood loves star the hero thundered his presence at a door and evoked a flying housemaid who knew not mrs berry the hero attached significance to the fact that his instincts should have betrayed him for he could have sworn to that house the door being shut he stood in dead silence havent you got her card ripton inquired and heard that it was in the custody of the cabman neither of them could positively bring to mind the number of the house you ought to have chalked it like that fellow in the forty thieves ripton hazarded a pleasantry which met with no response betrayed by his instincts the magic slaves of love the hero heavily descended the steps ripton murmured that they were done for his commander turned on him and said take all the houses on the opposite side one after another ill take these with a wry face ripton crossed the road altogether subdued by richards native superiority to adverse circumstances then were families aroused then did mortals dimly guess that something portentous was abroad then were labourers all day in the vineyard harshly wakened from their evenings nap hope and fear stalked the street as again and again the loud companion summonses resounded finally ripton sang out cheerfully he had mrs berry before him profuse of mellow curtsies richard ran to her and caught her hands shes wellupstairs oh quite well only a trifle tired with her journey and flutteringlike mrs berry replied to ripton alone the lover had flown aloft the wise woman sagely ushered ripton into her own private parlour there to wait till he was wanted chapter xxvii in all cases where two have joined to commit an offence punish one of the two lightly is the dictum of the pilgrimss scrip it is possible for young heads to conceive proper plans of action and occasionally by sheer force of will to check the wild horses that are ever fretting to gallop off with them but when they have given the reins and the whip to another what are they to do they may go down on their knees and beg and pray the furious charioteer to stop or moderate his pace alas each fresh thing they do redoubles his ardour there is a power in their troubled beauty women learn the use of and what wonder they have seen it kindle ilium to flames so often but ere they grow matronly in the house of menelaus they weep and implore and do not in truth know how terribly twoedged is their gift of loveliness they resign themselves to an incomprehensible frenzy pleasant to them because they attribute it to excessive love and so the very sensible things which they can and do say are vain i reckon it absurd to ask them to be quite in earnest are not those their own horses in yonder team certainly if they were quite in earnest they might soon have my gentleman as sober as a carter a hundred different ways of disenchanting him exist and adrian will point you out one or two that shall be instantly efficacious for love the charioteer is easily tripped while honest jogtrot love keeps his legs to the end granted dear women are not quite in earnest still the mere words they utter should be put to their good account they do mean them though their hearts are set the wrong way tis a despairing pathetic homage to the judgment of the majority in whose faces they are flying punish helen very young lightly after a certain age you may select her for special chastisement an innocent with theseus with paris she is an advanced incendiary the fair young girl was sitting as her lover had left her trying to recall her stunned senses her bonnet was unremoved her hands clasped on her knees dry tears in her eyes like a dutiful slave she rose to him and first he claimed her mouth there was a speech made up of all the pretty wisdom her wild situation and true love could gather awaiting him there but his kiss scattered it to fragments she dropped to her seat weeping and hiding her shamed cheeks by his silence she divined his thoughts and took his hand and drew it to her lips he bent beside her bidding her look at him keep your eyes so she could not do you fear me lucy a throbbing pressure answered him do you love me darling she trembled from head to foot then why do you turn from me she wept o richard take me home take me home look at me lucy her head shrank timidly round keep your eyes on me darling now speak but she could not look and speak too the lover knew his mastery when he had her eyes you wish me to take you home she faltered o richard it is not too late you regret what you have done for me dearest it is ruin you weep because you have consented to be mine not for me o richard for me you weep look at me for me how will it end o richard you weep for me dearest i would die for you would you see me indifferent to everything in the world would you have me lost do you think i will live another day in england without you i have staked all i have on you lucy you have nearly killed me once a second time and the earth will not be troubled by me you ask me to wait when they are plotting against us on all sides darling lucy look on me fixyour fond eyes on me you ask me to wait when here you are given to me when you have proved my faithwhen we know we love as none have loved give me your eyes let them tell me i have your heart where was her wise little speech how could she match such mighty eloquence she sought to collect a few more of the scattered fragments dearest your father may be brought to consent by and by and thenoh if you take me home now the lover stood up he who has been arranging that fine scheme to disgrace and martyrize you true as i live thats the reason of their having you back your old servant heard him and your uncle discussing it helucy hes a good man but he must not step in between you and me i say god has given you to me he was down by her side again his arms enfolding her she had hoped to fight a better battle than in the morning and she was weaker and softer ah why should she doubt that his great love was the first law to her why should she not believe that she would wreck him by resisting and if she suffered oh sweet to think it was for his sake sweet to shut out wisdom accept total blindness and be led by him the hag wisdom annoyed them little further she rustled her garments ominously and vanished oh my own richard the fair girl just breathed he whispered call me that name she blushed deeply call me that name he repeated you said it once today dearest not that o darling not that husband she was won the rosy gate from which the word had issued was closed with a seal ripton did not enjoy his introduction to the caged bird of beauty that night he received a lesson in the art of pumping from the worthy landlady below up to an hour when she yawned and he blinked and their common candle wore with dignity the brigands hat of midnight and cocked a drunken eye at them from under it chapter xxviii beauty of course is for the hero nevertheless it is not always he on whom beauty works its most conquering influence it is the dull commonplace man into whose slow brain she drops like a celestial light and burns lastingly the poet for instance is a connoisseur of beauty to the artist she is a model these gentlemen by much contemplation of her charms wax critical the days when they had hearts being gone they are haply divided between the blonde and the brunette the aquiline nose and the proserpine this shaped eye and that but go about among simple unprofessional fellows boors dunderheads and here and there you shall find some barbarous intelligence which has had just strength enough to conceive and has taken beauty as its goddess and knows but one form to worship in its poor stupid fashion and would perish for her nay more the man would devote all his days to her though he is dumb as a dog and indeed he is beautys dog almost every beauty has her dog the hero possesses her the poet proclaims her the painter puts her upon canvas and the faithful old dog follows her and the end of it all is that the faithful old dog is her single attendant sir hero is revelling in the wars or in armidas bowers mr poet has spied a wrinkle the brush is for the rose in its season she turns to her old dog then she hugs him and he who has subsisted on a bone and a pat till there he squats decrepit he turns his grateful old eyes up to her and has not a notion that she is hugging sad memories in him hero poet painter in one scrubby one then is she buried and the village hears languid howls and there is a paragraph in the newspapers concerning the extraordinary fidelity of an old dog excited by suggestive recollections of nooredeen and the fair persian and the change in the obscure monotony of his life by his having quarters in a crack hotel and living familiarly with westend peopleliving on the fat of the land which forms a stout portion of an honest youths romance ripton thompson breakfasted next morning with his chief at halfpast eight the meal had been fixed overnight for seven but ripton slept a great deal more than the nightingale and to chronicle his exact state even halfpast eight rather afflicted his new aristocratic senses and reminded him too keenly of law and bondage he had preferred to breakfast at algernons hour who had left word for eleven him however it was richards object to avoid so they fell to and ripton no longer envied hippias in bed breakfast done they bequeathed the consoling information for algernon that they were off to hear a popular preacher and departed how happy everybody looks said richard in the quiet sunday streets yesjolly said ripton when imwhen this is over ill see that they are tooas many as i can make happy said the hero adding softly her blind was down at a quarter to six i think she slept well youve been there this morning ripton exclaimed and an idea of what love was dawned upon his dull brain will she see me ricky yes shell see you today she was tired last night positively richard assured him that the privilege would be his here he said coming under some trees in the park heres where i talked to you last night what a time it seems how i hate the night on the way that richard might have an exalted opinion of him ripton hinted decorously at a somewhat intimate and mysterious acquaintance with the sex headings of certain random adventures he gave well said his chief why not marry her then was ripton shocked and cried oh and had a taste of the feeling of superiority destined that day to be crushed utterly he was again deposited in mrs berrys charge for a term that caused him dismal fears that the fair persian still refused to show her face but richard called out to him and up ripton went unaware of the transformation he was to undergo hero and beauty stood together to receive him from the bottom of the stairs he had his vivaciously agreeable smile ready for them and by the time he entered the room his cheeks were painfully stiff and his eyes had strained beyond their exact meaning lucy with one hand anchored to her lover welcomed him kindly he relieved her shyness by looking so extremely silly they sat down and tried to commence a conversation but ripton was as little master of his tongue as he was of his eyes after an interval the fair persian having done duty by showing herself was glad to quit the room her lord and possessor then turned inquiringly to ripton you dont wonder now rip he said no richard ripton waited to reply with sufficient solemnity indeed i dont he spoke differently he looked differently he had the old dogs eyes in his head they watched the door she had passed through they listened for her as dogs eyes do when she came in bonneted for a walk his agitation was doglike when she hung on her lover timidly and went forth he followed without an idea of envy or anything save the secret raptures the sight of her gave him which are the old dogs own for beneficent nature requites him his sensations cannot be heroic but they have a fulness and a wagging delight as good in their way and this capacity for humble unaspiring worship has its peculiar guerdon when ripton comes to think of miss random now what will he think of himself let no one despise the old dog through him doth beauty vindicate her sex it did not please ripton that others should have the bliss of beholding her and as to his perceptions everybody did and observed her offensively and stared and turned their heads back and interchanged comments on her and became in a minute madly in love with her he had to smother low growls they strolled about the pleasant gardens of kensington all the morning under the young chestnut buds and round the windless waters talking and soothing the wild excitement of their hearts if lucy spoke ripton pricked up his ears she too made the remark that everybody seemed to look happy and he heard it with thrills of joy so everybody is where you are he would have wished to say if he dared but was restrained by fears that his burning eloquence would commit him ripton knew the people he met twice it would have been difficult to persuade him they were the creatures of accident from the gardens in contempt of riptons frowned protest richard boldly struck into the park where solitary carriages were beginning to perform the circuit here ripton had some justification for his jealous pangs the young girls golden locks of hair her sweet now dreamily sad face her gentle graceful figure in the black straight dress she wore a sort of halfconventual air she hada mark of something not of class that was partly beautys partly maiden innocence growing conscious partly remorse at her weakness and dim fear of the future it was sowingdid attract the eyeglasses ripton had to learn that eyes are bearable but eyeglasses an abomination they fixed a spell upon his courage for somehow the youth had always ranked them as emblems of our nobility and hearing two exquisite eyeglasses who had been to front and rear several times drawl in gibberish generally imputed to lords that his heroine was a charming little creature just the size but had no stylehe was abashed he did not fly at them and tear them he became dejected beautys dog is affected by the eyeglass in a manner not unlike the common animals terror of the human eye richard appeared to hear nothing or it was homage that he heard he repeated to lucy diaper sandoes verses the cockneys nod to each other aside the coxcombs lift their glasses and projected hiring a horse for her to ride every day in the park and shine among the highest they had turned to the west against the sky glittering through the bare trees across the water and the brightedged rack the lover his imagination just then occupied in clothing earthly glories in celestial felt where his senses were sharpest the hand of his darling falter and instinctively looked ahead his uncle algernon was leisurely jolting towards them on his one sound leg the dismembered guardsman talked to a friend whose arm supported him and speculated from time to time on the fair ladies driving by the two white faces passed him unobserved unfortunately ripton coming behind went plump upon the captains live toeor so he pretended crying confound it mr thompson you might have chosen the other the horrible apparition did confound ripton who stammered that it was extraordinary not at all said algernon everybody makes up to that fellow instinct i suppose he had not to ask for his nephew richard turned to face the matter sorry i couldnt wait for you this morning uncle he said with the coolness of relationship i thought you never walked so far his voice was in perfect tonethe heroic mask admirable algernon examined the downcast visage at his side and contrived to allude to the popular preacher he was instantly introduced to riptons sister miss thompson the captain bowed smiling melancholy approval of his nephews choice of a minister after a few stray remarks and an affable salute to miss thompson he hobbled away and then the three sealed volcanoes breathed and lucys arm ceased to be squeezed quite so much up to the heroic pitch this incident quickened their steps homeward to the sheltering wings of mrs berry all that passed between them on the subject comprised a stammered excuse from ripton for his conduct and a goodhumoured rejoinder from richard that he had gained a sister by it at which ripton ventured to wish aloud miss desborough would only think so and a faint smile twitched poor lucys lips to please him she hardly had strength to reach her cage she had none to eat of mrs berrys nice little dinner to be alone that she might cry and ease her heart of its accusing weight of tears was all she prayed for kind mrs berry slipping into her bedroom to take off her things found the fair body in a fevered shudder and finished by undressing her completely and putting her to bed just an hours sleep or so the mellifluous woman explained the case to the two anxious gentlemen a quiet sleep and a cup of warm tea goes for more than twenty doctors it dowhen theres the flutters she pursued i know it by myself and a good cry beforehands better than the best of medicine she nursed them into a makebelieve of eating and retired to her softer charge and sweeter babe reflecting lord lord the three of em dont make fifty im as old as two and a half of em to say the least mrs berry used her apron and by virtue of their tender years took them all three into her heart left alone neither of the young men could swallow a morsel did you see the change come over her richard whispered ripton fiercely accused his prodigious stupidity the lover flung down his knife and fork what could i do if i had said nothing we should have been suspected i was obliged to speak and she hates a lie see it has struck her down god forgive me ripton affected a serene mind it was a fright richard he said thats what mrs berry means by flutters those old women talk in that way you heard what she said and these old women know ill tell you what it is its this richardits because youve got a fool for your friend she regrets it muttered the lover good god i think she fears me he dropped his face in his hands ripton went to the window repeating energetically for his comfort its because youve got a fool for your friend sombre grew the street they had last night aroused the sun was buried alive in cloud ripton saw himself no more in the opposite window he watched the deplorable objects passing on the pavement his aristocratic visions had gone like his breakfast beauty had been struck down by his egregious folly and there he stooda wretch richard came to him dont mumble on like that rip he said nobody blames you ah youre very kind richard interposed the wretch moved at the face of misery he beheld listen to me rip i shall take her home tonight yes if shes happier away from medo you think me a brute ripton rather than have her shed a tear idill take her home tonight ripton suggested that it was sudden adding from his larger experience people perhaps might talk the lover could not understand what they should talk about but he said if i give him who came for her yesterday the clue if no one sees or hears of me what can they say o rip ill give her up im wrecked for ever what of that yeslet them take her the world in arms should never have torn her from me but when she criesyes alls over ill find him at once he searched in outoftheway corners for the hat of resolve ripton looked on wretcheder than ever the idea struck himsuppose richard she doesnt want to go it was a moment when perhaps one who sided with parents and guardians and the old wise world might have inclined them to pursue their righteous wretched course and have given small cupid a smack and sent him home to his naughty mother alas it is the pilgrims scrip interjecting women are the born accomplices of mischief in bustles mrs berry to clear away the refection and finds the two knights helmed and sees though tis dusk that they wear doubtful brows and guesses bad things for her dear god hymen in a twinkling dear dear she exclaimed and neither of you eaten a scrap and theres my dear young lady off into the prettiest sleep you ever see ha cried the lover illuminated soft as a baby mrs berry averred i went to look at her this very moment and theres not a bit of trouble in her breath it come and it go like the sweetest regular instrument ever made the black ox havent trod on her foot yet most like it was the air of london but only fancy if you had called in a doctor why i shouldnt have let her take any of his quackery now there ripton attentively observed his chief and saw him doff his hat with a curious caution and peer into its recess from which during mrs berrys speech he drew forth a little glovedropped there by some freak of chance keep me keep me now you have me sang the little glove and amused the lover with a thousand conceits when will she wake do you think mrs berry he asked oh we mustnt go for disturbing her said the guileful good creature bless ye let her sleep it out and if you young gentlemen was to take my advice and go and take a walk for to get a appetiteeverybody should eat its their sacred duty no matter what their feelings be and i say it whom no chickenill frickashee thiswhich is a chickenagainst your return im a cook i can assure ye the lover seized her two hands youre the best old soul in the world he cried mrs berry appeared willing to kiss him we wont disturb her let her sleep keep her in bed mrs berry will you and well call to inquire after her this evening and come and see her tomorrow im sure youll be kind to her there there mrs berry was preparing to whimper i trust her to you you see goodbye you dear old soul he smuggled a handful of gold into her keeping and went to dine with his uncles happy and hungry before they reached the hotel they had agreed to draw mrs berry into their confidence telling her with embellishments all save their names so that they might enjoy the counsel and assistance of that trump of a woman and yet have nothing to fear from her lucy was to receive the name of letitia riptons youngest and bestlooking sister the heartless fellow proposed it in cruel mockery of an old weakness of hers letitia mused richard i like the name both begin with l theres something softwomanlikein the ls material ripton remarked that they looked like pounds on paper the lover roamed through his golden groves lucy feverel that sounds better i wonder where ralph is i should like to help him hes in love with my cousin clare hell never do anything till he marries no man can im going to do a hundred things when its over we shall travel first i want to see the alps one doesnt know what the earth is till one has seen the alps what a delight it

soul a tear hangs there in trance and fills but does not fall softly i hear it call at heavens gate till sister seraphs press to look on you their old love from the skies those are the eyes of seraphs bright on your blue eyes beautiful these lines rip were written by a man who was once a friend of my fathers i intend to find him and make them friends again you dont care for poetry its no use your trying to swallow it rip it sounds very nice said ripton modestly shutting his mouth the alps italy rome and then i shall go to the east the hero continued shes ready to go anywhere with me the dear brave heart oh the glorious golden east i dream of the desert i dream im chief of an arab tribe and we fly all white in the moonlight on our mares and hurry to the rescue of my darling and we push the spears and we scatter them and i come to the tent where she crouches and catch her to my saddle and awayrip what a life ripton strove to imagine he could enjoy it and then we shall come home and i shall lead austins life with her to help me first be virtuous rip and then serve your country heart and soul a wise man told me that i think i shall do something sunshine and cloud cloud and sunshine passed over the lover now life was a narrow ring now the distances extended were winged flew illimitably an hour ago and food was hateful now he manfully refreshed his nature and joined in algernons encomiums on miss letitia thompson meantime beauty slept watched by the veteran volunteer of the heros band lucy awoke from dreams which seemed reality to the reality which was a dream she awoke calling for some friend margaret and heard one say my name is bessy berry my love not margaret then she asked piteously where she was and where was margaret her dear friend and mrs berry whispered sure youve got a dearer ah sighed lucy sinking on her pillow overwhelmed by the strangeness of her state mrs berry closed the frill of her nightgown and adjusted the bedclothes quietly her name was breathed yes my love she said is he here hes gone my dear goneoh where the young girl started up in disorder gone to be back my love ah that young gentleman mrs berry chanted not a morsel have he eat not a drop have he drunk o mrs berry why did you not make him lucy wept for the faminestruck hero who was just then feeding mightily mrs berry explained that to make one eat who thought the darling of his heart like to die was a sheer impossibility for the cleverest of women and on this deep truth lucy reflected with her eyes wide at the candle she wanted one to pour her feelings out to she slid her hand from under the bedclothes and took mrs berrys and kissed it the good creature required no further avowal of her secret but forthwith leaned her consummate bosom to the pillow and petitioned heaven to bless them boththen the little bride was alarmed and wondered how mrs berry could have guessed it why said mrs berry your love is out of your eyes and out of everything ye do and the little bride wondered more she thought she had been so very cautious not to betray it the common woman in them made cheer together after their own april fashion following which mrs berry probed for the sweet particulars of this beautiful lovematch but the little brides lips were locked she only said her lover was above her in station and youre a catholic my dear yes mrs berry and him a protestant yes mrs berry dear dearand why shouldnt ye be she ejaculated seeing sadness return to the bridal babe so as you was born so shall ye be but youll have to make your arrangements about the children the girls to worship with you the boys with him its the same god my dear you mustnt blush at it though you do look so pretty if my young gentleman could see you now please mrs berry lucy murmured why he will you know my dear oh please mrs berry and you that cant bear the thoughts of it well i do wish there was fathers and mothers on both sides and dockments signed and bridesmaids and a breakfast but love is love and ever will be in spite of them she made other and deeper dives into the little heart but though she drew up pearls they were not of the kind she searched for the one fact that hung as a fruit upon her tree of love lucy had given her she would not in fealty to her lover reveal its growth and history however sadly she yearned to pour out all to this dear old mother confessor her conduct drove mrs berry from the rosy to the autumnal view of matrimony generally heralded by the announcement that it is a lottery and when you see your ticket said mrs berry you shant know whether its a prize or a blank and lord knows some go on thinking its a prize when it turns on em and tears em im one of the blanks my dear i drew a blank in berry he was a black berry to me my dear smile away he truly was and i aprizin him as proud as you can conceive my dear mrs berry pressed her hands flat on her apron we hadnt been a three months man and wife when that manit wasnt the honeymoon which some cant saythat manyes he kicked me his wedded wife he kicked ah she sighed to lucys large eyes i could have borne that a blow dont touch the heart the poor creature tapped her sensitive side i went on loving of him for im a soft one tall as a grenadier he is and when out of service grows his moustache i used to call him my bodyguardsman like a queen i flattered him like the fools we women are for take my word for it my dear theres nothing here below so vain as a man that i know but i didnt deserve it im a superior cook i did not deserve that noways mrs berry thumped her knee and accentuated up her climax i mended his linen i saw to his adornmentshe called his clothes the bad man i was a servant to him my dear and thereit was nine monthsnine months from the day he swear to protect and cherish and thatnine calendar months and my gentleman is off with another woman bone of his bonepish exclaimed mrs berry reckoning her wrongs over vividly heres my ring a pretty ornament what do it mean im for tearin it off my finger a dozen times in the day its a symbol i call it a tomfoolery for the deadalive to wear it thats a widow and not a widow and havent got a name for what she is in any dixonary ive looked my dear andshe spread out her armsjohnson havent got a name for me at this impressive woe mrs berrys voice quavered into sobs lucy spoke gentle words to the poor outcast from johnson the sorrows of autumn have no warning for april the little bride for all her tender pity felt happier when she had heard her landladys moving tale of the wickedness of man which cast in bright relief the glory of that one hero who was hers then from a short flight of inconceivable bliss she fell shot by one of her hundred arguseyed fears o mrs berry im so young think of meonly just seventeen mrs berry immediately dried her eyes to radiance young my dear nonsense theres no so much harm in being young here and there i knew an irish lady was married at fourteen her daughter married close over fourteen she was a grandmother by thirty when any strange man began she used to ask him what pattern caps grandmothers wore theyd stare bless you the grandmother could have married over and over again it was her daughters fault not hers you know she was three years younger mused lucy she married beneath her my dear ran off with her fathers bailiffs son ah berry shed say if i hadnt been foolish i should be my lady nownot granny her father never forgave herleft all his estates out of the family did her husband always love her lucy preferred to know in his way my dear he did said mrs berry coming upon her matrimonial wisdom he couldnt help himself if he left off he began again she was so clever and did make him so comfortable cook there wasnt such another cook out of a aldermans kitchen no indeed and she a born lady that tells ye its the duty of all women she had her saying when the parlour fire gets low put coals on the ketchen fire and a good saying it is to treasure such is man no use in havin their hearts if ye dont have their stomachs perceiving that she grew abstruse mrs berry added briskly you know nothing about that yet my dear only mind me and mark me dont neglect your cookery kissing dont last cookery do here with an aphorism worthy a place in the pilgrims scrip she broke off to go posseting for her dear invalid lucy was quite well very eager to be allowed to rise and be ready when the knock should come mrs berry in her loving considerateness for the little bride positively commanded her to lie down and be quiet and submit to be nursed and cherished for mrs berry well knew that ten minutes alone with the hero could only be had while the little bride was in that unattainable position thanks to her strategy as she thought her object was gained the night did not pass before she learnt from the heros own mouth that mr richards the father of the hero and a stern lawyer was adverse to his union with this young lady he loved because of a ward of his heiress to an immense property whom he desired his son to espouse and because his darling letitia was a catholicletitia the sole daughter of a brave naval officer deceased and in the hands of a savage uncle who wanted to sacrifice this beauty to a brute of a son mrs berry listened credulously to the emphatic narrative and spoke to the effect that the wickedness of old people formed the excuse for the wildness of young ones the ceremonious administration of oaths of secrecy and devotion over she was enrolled in the heros band which now numbered three and entered upon the duties with feminine energy for there are no conspirators like women riptons lieutenancy became a sinecure his rank merely titular he had never been marriedhe knew nothing about licences except that they must be obtained and were not difficulthe had not an idea that so many days warning must be given to the clergyman of the parish where one of the parties was resident how should he all his forethought was comprised in the ring and whenever the discussion of arrangements for the great event grew particularly hot and important he would say with a shrewd nod we mustnt forget the ring you know mrs berry and the new member was only prevented by natural complacence from shouting oh drat ye and your ring too mrs berry had acted conspicuously in fifteen marriages by banns and by licence and to have such an obvious requisite dinned in her ears was exasperating they could not have contracted alliance with an auxiliary more invaluable an authority so profound and they acknowledged it to themselves the hero marched like an automaton at her bidding lieutenant thompson was rejoiced to perform services as errandboy in the enterprise its in hopes youll be happier than me i do it said the devout and charitable berry marriages is made in heaven they say and if thats the case i say they dont take much account of us below her own woeful experiences had been given to the hero in exchange for his story of cruel parents richard vowed to her that he would henceforth hold it a duty to hunt out the wanderer from wedded bonds and bring him back bound and suppliant oh hell come said mrs berry pursing prophetic wrinkles hell come of his own accord never anywhere will he meet such a cook as bessy berry and he know her value in his heart of hearts and i do believe when he do come i shall be opening these arms to him again and not slapping his impidence in the faceim that soft i always wasin matrimony mr richards as when nations are secretly preparing for war the docks and arsenals hammer night and day and busy contractors measure time by inches and the air hums around for leagues as it were myriads of bees so the house and neighbourhood of the matrimonial soft one resounded in the heroic style and knew little of the changes of light decreed by creation mrs berry was the general of the hour down to doctors commons she expedited the hero instructing him how boldly to face the law and fib for that the law never could mist a fib and a bold face down the hero went and proclaimed his presence and lo the law danced to him its sedatest lovely bearsdance think ye the law less susceptible to him than flesh and blood with a beautiful confidence it put the few familiar questions to him and nodded to his replies then stamped the bond and took the fee it must be an old vagabond at heart that can permit the irrevocable to go so cheap even to a hero for only mark him when he is petitioned by heroes and heroines to undo what he does so easily that small archway of doctors commons seems the eye of a needle through which the lean purse has a way somehow of slipping more readily than the portly but once through all are camels alike the lean purse an especially big camel dispensing tremendous marriage as it does the law can have no conscience i hadnt the slightest difficulty said the exulting hero of course not returns mrs berry its as easy if yere in earnest as buying a plum bun likewise the ambassador of the hero went to claim the promise of the church to be in attendance on a certain spot on a certain day and there hear oath of eternal fealty and gird him about with all its forces which the church receiving a wink from the law obsequiously engaged to do for less than the price of a plumcake meantime while craftsmen and skilled women directed by mrs berry were toiling to deck the day at hand raynham and belthorpe sleptthe former soundly and one day was as another to them regularly every morning a letter arrived from richard to his father containing observations on the phenomena of london remarks mainly cynical on the speeches and acts of parliament and reasons for not having yet been able to call on the grandisons they were certainly rather monotonous and spiritless the baronet did not complain that cold dutiful tone assured him there was no internal trouble or distraction the letters of a healthful physique he said to lady blandish with sure insight complacently he sat and smiled little witting that his sons ordeal was imminent and that his sons ordeal was to be his own hippias wrote that his nephew was killing him by making appointments which he never kept and altogether neglecting him in the most shameless way so that his ganglionic centre was in a ten times worse state than when he left raynham he wrote very bitterly but it was hard to feel compassion for his offended stomach on the other hand young tom blaize was not forthcoming and had despatched no tidings whatever farmer blaize smoked his pipe evening after evening vastly disturbed london was a large placeyoung tom might be lost in it he thought and young tom had his weaknesses a wolf at belthorpe he was likely to be a sheep in london as yokels have proved but what had become of lucy this consideration almost sent farmer blaize off to london direct and he would have gone had not his pipe enlightened him a young fellow might play truant and get into a scrape but a young man and a young woman were sure to be heard of unless they were acting in complicity why of course young tom had behaved like a man the rascal and married her outright there while he had the chance it was a long guess still it was the only reasonable way of accounting for his extraordinary silence and therefore the farmer held to it that he had done the deed he argued as modern men do who think the hero the upsetter of ordinary calculations is gone from us so after despatching a letter to a friend in town to be on the outlook for son tom he continued awhile to smoke his pipe rather elated than not and mused on the shrewd manner he should adopt when master honeymoon did appear toward the middle of the second week of richards absence tom bakewell came to raynham for cassandra and privately handed a letter to the eighteenth century containing a request for money and a round sum the eighteenth century was as good as her word and gave tom a letter in return enclosing a cheque on her bankers amply providing to keep the heroic engine in motion at a moderate pace tom went back and raynham and lobourne slept and dreamed not of the morrow the system wedded to time slept and knew not how he had been outragedanticipated by seven pregnant seasons for time had heard the hero swear to that legalizing instrument and had also registered an oath ah me venerable hebrew time he is unforgiving half the confusion and fever of the world comes of this vendetta he declares against the hapless innocents who have once done him a wrong they cannot escape him they will never outlive it the father of jokes he is himself no joke which it seems the business of men to discover the days roll round he is their servant now mrs berry has a new satin gown a beautiful bonnet a gold brooch and sweet gloves presented to her by the hero wherein to stand by his bride at the altar tomorrow and instead of being an old wary hen she is as much a chicken as any of the party such has been the magic of these articles fathers she sees accepting the facts produced for them by their children a world content to be carved out as it pleases the hero at last time brings the bridal eve and is blest as a benefactor the final arrangements are made the bridegroom does depart and mrs berry lights the little bride to her bed lucy stops on the landing where there is an old clock eccentrically correct that night tis the palpitating pause before the gates of her transfiguration mrs berry sees her put her rosy finger on the one about to strike and touch all the hours successively till she comes to the twelve that shall sound wife in her ears on the morrow moving her lips the while and looking round archly solemn when she has done and that sight so catches at mrs berrys heart that not guessing time to be the poor childs enemy she endangers her candle by folding lucy warmly in her arms whimpering bless you for a darling you innocent lamb you shall be happy you shall old time gazes grimly ahead chapter xxix although it blew hard when caesar crossed the rubicon the passage of that river is commonly calm calm as acheron so long as he gets his fare the ferryman does not need to be told whom he carries he pulls with a will and heroes may be over in halfanhour only when they stand on the opposite bank do they see what a leap they have taken the shores they have relinquished shrink to an infinite remoteness there they have dreamed here they must act there lie youth and irresolution here manhood and purpose they are veritably in another land a moral acheron divides their life their memories scarce seem their own the philosophical geography about to be published observes that each man has one time or other a little rubicona clear or a foul water to cross it is asked him wilt thou wed this fate and give up all behind thee and i will firmly pronounced speeds him over the abovenamed manuscript authority informs us that by far the greater number of carcasses rolled by this heroic flood to its sister stream below are those of fellows who have repented their pledge and have tried to swim back to the bank they have blotted out for though every man of us may be a hero for one fatal minute very few remain so after a days march even and who wonders that madam fate is indignant and wears the features of the terrible universal fate to him fail before her either in heart or in act and lo how the alluring loves in her visage wither and sicken to what it is modelled on be your rubicon big or small clear or foul it is the same you shall not return onor to acheroni subscribe to that saying of the pilgrims scrip the danger of a little knowledge of things is disputable but beware the little knowledge of ones self richard feverel was now crossing the river of his ordeal already the mists were stealing over the land he had left his life was cut in two and he breathed but the air that met his nostrils his father his fathers love his boyhood and ambition were shadowy his poetic dreams had taken a living attainable shape he had a distincter impression of the autumnal berry and her household than of anything at raynham and yet the young man loved his father loved his home and i daresay caesar loved rome but whether he did or no caesar when he killed the republic was quite bald and the hero we are dealing with is scarce beginning to feel his despotic moustache did he know what he was made of doubtless nothing at all but honest passion has an instinct that can be safer than conscious wisdom he was an arrow drawn to the head flying from the bow his audacious mendacities and subterfuges did not strike him as in any way criminal for he was perfectly sure that the winning and securing of lucy would in the end be boisterously approved of and in that case were not the means justified not that he took trouble to argue thus as older heroes and selfconvicting villains are in the habit of doing to deduce a clear conscience conscience and lucy went together it was a soft fair day the rubicon sparkled in the morning sun one of those days when london embraces the prospect of summer and troops forth all its babies the pavement the squares the parks were early alive with the cries of young britain violet and primrose girls and organ boys with military monkeys and systematic bands very determined in tone if not in tune filled the atmosphere and crowned the blazing procession of omnibuses freighted with business men cityward where a column of reddish brown smokeblown aloft by the southwest marked the scene of conflict to which these persistent warriors repaired richard had seen much of early london that morning his plans were laid he had taken care to ensure his personal liberty against accidents by leaving his hotel and his injured uncle hippias at sunrise today or tomorrow his father was to arrive farmer blaize tom bakewell reported to him was raging in town another day and she might be torn from him but today this miracle of creation would be his and then from those glittering banks yonder let them summon him to surrender her who dared the position of things looked so propitious that he naturally thought the powers waiting on love conspired in his behalf and she toosince she must cross this river she had sworn to him to be brave and do him honour and wear the true gladness of her heart in her face without a suspicion of folly in his acts or fear of results richard strolled into kensington gardens breakfasting on the foreshadow of his great joy now with a vision of his bride now of the new life opening to him mountain masses of clouds rounded in sunlight swung up the blue the flowering chestnut pavilions overhead rustled and hummed a sound in his ears as of a banner unfolding in the joyful distance lulled him he was to meet his bride at the church at a quarter past eleven his watch said a quarter to ten he strolled on beneath the longstemmed trees toward the well dedicated to a saint obscure some people were drinking at the well a florid lady stood by a younger one who had a little silver mug halfway to her mouth and evinced undisguised dislike to the liquor of the salutary saint drink child said the maturer lady that is only your second mug i insist upon your drinking three full ones every morning were in town your constitution positively requires iron but mama the other expostulated its so nasty i shall be sick drink was the harsh injunction nothing to the german waters my dear here let me taste she took the mug and gave it a flying kiss i declare i think it almost nicenot at all objectionable pray taste it she said to a gentleman standing below them to act as cupbearer an unmistakable cisrubicon voice replied certainly if its good fellowship though i confess i dont think mutual sickness a very engaging ceremony can one never escape from ones relatives richard ejaculated inwardly without a doubt those people were mrs doria clare and adrian he had them under his eyes clare peeping up from her constitutional dose to make sure no man was near to see the possible consequence of it was the first to perceive him her hand dropped now pray drink and do not fuss said mrs doria mama clare gasped richard came forward and capitulated honourably since retreat was out of the question mrs doria swam to meet him my own boy my dear richard profuse of exclamations clare shyly greeted him adrian kept in the background why we were coming for you today richard said mrs doria smiling effusion and rattled on we want another cavalier this is delightful my dear nephew you have grown from a boy to a man and theres down on his lip and what brings you here at such an hour in the morning poetry i suppose here take my arm childclare finish that mug and thank your cousin for sparing you the third i always bring her when we are by a chalybeate to take the waters before breakfast we have to get up at unearthly hours think my dear boy mothers are sacrifices and so youve been alone a fortnight with your agreeable uncle a charming time of it you must have had poor hippias what may be his last nostrum nephew adrian stretched his head round to the couple doses of nephew taken morning and night fourteen days and he guarantees that it shall destroy an iron constitution in a month richard mechanically shook adrians hand as he spoke quite well ricky yes well enough richard answered well resumed his vigorous aunt walking on with him while clare and adrian followed i really never saw you looking so handsome theres something about your facelook at meyou neednt blush youve grown to an apollo that blue buttonedup frock coat becomes you admirablyand those gloves and that easy necktie your style is irreproachable quite a style of your own and nothing eccentric you have the instinct of dress dress shows blood my dear boy as much as anything else boyyou see i cant forget old habits you were a boy when i left and nowdo you see any change in him clare she turned half round to her daughter richard is looking very well mama said clare glancing at him under her eyelids i wish i could say the same of you my deartake my arm richard are you afraid of your aunt i want to get used to you wont it be pleasant our being all in town together in the season how fresh the opera will be to you austin i hear takes stalls you can come to the foreys box when you like we are staying with the foreys close by here i think its a little too far out you know but they like the neighbourhood this is what i have always said give him more liberty austin has seen it at last how do you think clare looking the question had to be repeated richard surveyed his cousin hastily and praised her looks pale mrs doria sighed rather pale aunt grown very muchdont you think richard very tall girl indeed aunt if she had but a little more colour my dear richard im sure i give her all the iron she can swallow but that pallor still continues i think she does not prosper away from her old companion she was accustomed to look up to you richard did you get ralphs letter aunt richard interrupted her absurd mrs doria pressed his arm the nonsense of a boy why did you undertake to forward such stuff im certain he loves her said richard in a serious way the maternal eyes narrowed on him life my dear richard is a game of crosspurposes she observed dropping her fluency and was rather angered to hear him laugh he excused himself by saying that she spoke so like his father you breakfast with us she freshened off again the foreys wish to see you the girls are dying to know you do you know you have a reputation on account of thatshe crushed an intruding adjectivesystem you were brought up on you mustnt mind it for my part i think you look a credit to it dont be bashful with young women mind as much as you please with the old ones you know how to behave among men there you have your drawingroom guide im sure i shall be proud of you am i not mrs doria addressed his eyes coaxingly a benevolent idea struck richard that he might employ the minutes to spare in pleading the case of poor ralph and as he was drawn along he pulled out his watch to note the precise number of minutes he could dedicate to this charitable office pardon me said mrs doria you want manners my dear boy i think it never happened to me before that a man consulted his watch in my presence richard mildly replied that he had an engagement at a particular hour up to which he was her servant fiddlededee the vivacious lady sang now ive got you i mean to keep you oh ive heard all about you this ridiculous indifference that your father makes so much of why of course you wanted to see the world a strong healthy young man shut up all his life in a lonely houseno friends no society no amusements but those of rustics of course you were indifferent your intelligence and superior mind alone saved you from becoming a dissipated country boorwhere are the others clare and adrian came up at a quick pace my damozel dropped something adrian explained her mother asked what it was nothing mama said clare demurely and they proceeded as before overborne by his aunts fluency of tongue and occupied in acute calculation of the flying minutes richard let many pass before he edged in a word for ralph when he did mrs doria stopped him immediately i must tell you child that i refuse to listen to such rank idiotcy its nothing of the kind aunt the fancy of a boy hes not a boy hes halfayear older than i am you silly child the moment you fall in love you all think yourselves men on my honour aunt i believe he loves her thoroughly did he tell you so child men dont speak openly of those things said richard boys do said mrs doria but listen to me in earnest aunt i want you to be kind to ralph dont drive him toyou maybe sorry for it let himdo let him write to her and see her i believe women are as cruel as men in these things i never encourage absurdity richard what objection have you to ralph aunt oh theyre both good families its not that absurdity richard it will be to his credit to remember that his first fancy wasnt a dairymaid mrs doria pitched her accent tellingly it did not touch her nephew dont you want clare ever to marry he put the last point of reason to her mrs doria laughed i hope so child we must find some comfortable old gentleman for her what infamy mutters richard and i engage ralph shall be ready to dance at her wedding or eat a hearty breakfastwe dont dance at weddings now and very properly its a horrid sad business not to be treated with levityis that his regiment she said as they passed out of the hussarsentinelled gardens tush tush child master ralph will recover ashem others have done a little headacheyou call it heartacheand up you rise again looking better than ever no doubt to have a grain of sense forced into your brains you poor dear children must be painful girls suffer as much as boys i assure you more for their heads are weaker and their appetites less constant do i talk like your father now whatever makes the boy fidget at his watch so richard stopped short time spoke urgently i must go he said his face did not seem good for trifling mrs doria would trifle in spite listen clare richard is going he says he has an engagement what possible engagement can a young man have at eleven oclock in the morningunless its to be married mrs doria laughed at the ingenuity of her suggestion is the church handy ricky said adrian you can still give us halfanhour if it is the celibate hours strike at twelve and he also laughed in his fashion wont you stay with us richard clare asked she blushed timidly and her voice shook something indefinitea sharpedged thrill in the tones made the burning bridegroom speak gently to her indeed i would clare i should like to please you but i have a most imperative appointmentthat is i promisedi must go i shall see you again mrs doria took forcible possession of him now do come and dont waste words i insist upon your having some breakfast first and then if you really must go you shall look theres the house at least you will accompany your aunt to the door richard conceded this she little imagined what she required of him two of his golden minutes melted into nothingness they were growing to be jewels of price one by one more and more precious as they ran and now so costlyrarerich as his blood not to kindest relations dearest friends could he give another the die is cast ferryman push off goodbye he cried nodding bluffly at the three as one and fled they watched his abrupt muscular stride through the grounds of the house he looked like resolution on the march mrs doria as usual with her out of her brothers hearing began rating the system see what becomes of that nonsensical education the boy really does not know how to behave like a common mortal he has some paltry appointment or is mad after some ridiculous idea of his own and everything must be sacrificed to it thats what austin calls concentration of the faculties i think its more likely to lead to downright insanity than to greatness of any kind and so i shall tell austin its time he should be spoken to seriously about him hes an engine my dear aunt said adrian he isnt a boy or a man but an engine and he appears to have been at high pressure since he came to townout all day and half the night hes mad mrs doria interjected not at all extremely shrewd is master ricky and carries as open an eye ahead of him as the ships before troy hes more than a match for any of us he is for me i confess then said mrs doria he does astonish me adrian begged her to retain her astonishment till the right season which would not be long arriving their common wisdom counselled them not to tell the foreys of their hopeful relatives ungracious behaviour clare had left them when mrs doria went to her room her daughter was there gazing down at something in her hand which she guiltily closed in answer to an inquiry why she had not gone to take off her things clare said she was not hungry mrs doria lamented the obstinacy of a constitution that no quantity of iron could affect and eclipsed the lookingglass saying take them off here child and learn to assist yourself she disentangled her bonnet from the array of her spreading hair talking of richard and his handsome appearance and extraordinary conduct clare kept opening and shutting her hand in an attitude halfpensive halflistless she did not stir to undress a joyless dimple hung in one pale cheek and she drew long even breaths mrs doria assured by the glass that she was ready to show came to her daughter now really she said you are too helpless my dear you cannot do a thing without a dozen women at your elbow what will become of you you will have to marry a millionairewhats the matter with you child clare undid her tightshut fingers as if to some attraction of her eyes and displayed a small gold hoop on the palm of a green glove a weddingring exclaimed mrs doria inspecting the curiosity most daintily there on clares pale green glove lay a weddingring rapid questions as to where when how it was found beset clare who replied in the gardens mama this morning when i was walking behind richard are you sure he did not give it you clare oh no mama he did not give it me of course not only he does such absurd things i thought perhapsthese boys are so exceedingly ridiculous mrs doria had an idea that it might have been concerted between the two young gentlemen richard and ralph that the former should present this token of hymeneal devotion from the latter to the young lady of his love but a moments reflection exonerated boys even from such preposterous behaviour now i wonder she speculated on clares cold face i do wonder whether its lucky to find a weddingring what very quick eyes you have my darling mrs doria kissed her she thought it must be lucky and the circumstance made her feel tender to her child her child did not move to the kiss lets see whether it fits said mrs doria almost infantine with surprise and pleasure clare suffered her glove to be drawn off the ring slid down her long thin finger and settled comfortably it does mrs doria whispered to find a wedding ring is open to any woman but to find a weddingring that fits may well cause a superstitious emotion moreover that it should be found while walking in the neighbourhood of the identical youth whom a mother has destined for her daughter gives significance to the gentle perturbation of ideas consequent on such a hint from fortune it really fits she pursued now i never pay any attention to the nonsense of omens and that kind of thing had the ring been a horseshoe mrs doria would have pinked it up and dragged it obediently home but this i must say is oddto find a ring that fitssingular it never happened to me sixpence is the most i ever discovered and i have it now mind you keep it clarethis ring and she laughed offer it to richard when he comes say you think he must have dropped it the dimple in clares cheek quivered mother and daughter had never spoken explicitly of richard mrs doria by exquisite management had contrived to be sure that on one side there would be no obstacle to her project of general happiness without as she thought compromising her daughters feelings unnecessarily it could do no harm to an obedient young girl to hear that there was no youth in the world like a certain youth he the prince of his generation she might softly consent when requested to be his princess and if never requested for mrs doria envisaged failure she might easily transfer her softness to squires of lower degree clare had always been blindly obedient to her mother adrian called them mrs doria battledoria and the fair shuttlecockiana and her mother accepted in this blind obedience the text of her entire character it is difficult for those who think very earnestly for their children to know when their children are thinking on their own account the exercise of their volition we construe as revolt our love does not like to be invalided and deposed from its command and here i think yonder old thrush on the lawn who has just kicked the last of her lank offspring out of the nest to go shift for itself much the kinder of the two though sentimental people do shrug their shoulders at these unsentimental acts of the creatures who never wander from nature now excess of obedience is to one who manages most exquisitely as bad as insurrection happily mrs doria saw nothing in her daughters manner save a want of iron her pallor her lassitude the tremulous nerves in her face exhibited an imperious requirement of the mineral the reason why men and women are mysterious to us and prove disappointing we learn from the pilgrims scrip is that we will read them from our own book just as we are perplexed by reading ourselves from theirs mrs doria read her daughter from her own book and she was gay she laughed with adrian at the breakfasttable and mockseriously joined in his jocose assertion that clare was positively and by all hymeneal auspices betrothed to the owner of that ring be he who he may and must whenever he should choose to come and claim her give her hand to him for everybody agreed the owner must be masculine as no woman would drop a weddingring and follow him whither he listed all the world over amiable giggling forey girls called clare the betrothed dark man or fair was mooted adrian threw off the first strophe of clares fortune in burlesque rhymes with an insinuating gipsy twang her aunt forey warned her to have her dresses in readiness her grandpapa forey pretended to grumble at bridal presents being expected from grandpapas this one smelt orangeflower another spoke solemnly of an old shoe the finding of a weddingring was celebrated through all the palpitating accessories and rosy ceremonies involved by that famous instrument in the midst of the general hilarity clare showed her deplorable want of iron by bursting into tears did the poor mockedat heart divine what might be then enacting perhaps dimly as we say that is without eyes at an altar stand two fair young creatures ready with their oaths they are asked to fix all time to the moment and they do so if there is hesitation at the immense undertaking it is but maidenly she conceives as little mental doubt of the sanity of the act as he over them hangs a cool young curate in his raiment of office behind are two apparently lucid people distinguished from each other by sex and age the foremost a bunch of simmering black satin under her shadow a cockrobin in the dress of a gentleman big joy swelling out his chest and pert satisfaction cocking his head these be they who stand here in place of parents to the young couple all is well the service proceeds firmly the bridegroom tells forth his words this hour of the complacent giant at least is his and that he means to hold him bound through the eternities men may hear clearly and with brave modesty speaks she no less firmly though her body trembles her voice just vibrating while the tone travels on like a smitten vase time hears sentence pronounced on him the frail hands bind his huge limbs and lock the chains he is used to it he lets them do as they will then comes that period when they are to give their troth to each other the man with his right hand takes the woman by her right hand the woman with her right hand takes the man by his right handdevils dare not laugh at whom angels crowd to contemplate their hands are joined their blood flows as one stream adam and fair eve front the generations are they not lovely purer fountains of life were never in two bosoms and then they loose their hands and the cool curate doth bid the man to put a ring on the womans fourth finger counting thumb and the man thrusts his hand into one pocket and into another forward and back many times into all his pockets he remembers that he felt for it and felt it in his waistcoat pocket when in the gardens and his hand comes forth empty and the man is ghastly to look at yet though angels smile shall not devils laugh the curate deliberates the black satin bunch ceases to simmer he in her shadow changes from a beaming cockrobin to an inquisitive sparrow eyes multiply questions lips have no reply time ominously shakes his chain and in the pause a sound of mockery stings their ears think ye a hero is one to be defeated in his first battle look at the clock there are but seven minutes to the stroke of the celibate hours the veteran is surely lifting his two hands to deliver fire and his shot will sunder them in twain so nearly united all the jewellers of london speeding down with sacks full of the nuptial circlet cannot save them the battle must be won on the field and what does the hero now it is an inspiration for who else would dream of such a reserve in the rear none see what he does only that the blacksatin bunch is remonstratingly agitated stormily shaken and subdued and as though the menacing cloud had opened and dropped the dear token from the skies at his demand he produces the symbol of their consent and the service proceeds with this ring i thee wed they are prayed over and blest for good or for ill this deed is done the names are registered fees fly right and left they thank and salute the curate whose official coolness melts into a smile of monastic gallantry the beadle on the steps waves off a gaping world as they issue forth bridegroom and bridesman recklessly scatter gold on him carriage doors are banged to the coachmen drive off and the scene closes everybody happy chapter xxx and the next moment the bride is weeping as if she would dissolve to one of dians virgin fountains from the clasp of the sungod she has nobly preserved the mask imposed by comedies till the curtain has fallen and now she weeps streams with tears have patience o impetuous young man it is your profession to be a hero this poor heart is new to it and her duties involve such wild acts such brigandage such terrors and tasks she is quite unnerved she did you honour till now bear with her now she does not cry the cry of ordinary maidens in like cases while the struggle went on her tender face was brave but alas omens are against her she holds an everpresent dreadful one on that fatal fourth finger of hers which has coiled itself round her dream of delight and takes her in its clutch like a horrid serpent and yet she must love it she dares not part from it she must love and hug it and feed on its strange honey and all the bliss it gives her casts all the deeper shadow on what is to come say is it not enough to cause feminine apprehension for a woman to be married in another womans ring you are amazons ladies at saragossa and a thousand citadelswherever there is strife and time is to be taken by the throat then shall few men match your sublime fury but what if you see a vulture visible only to yourselves hovering over the house you are gaily led by the torch to inhabit will you not crouch and be cowards as for the hero in the hour of victory he pays no heed to omens he does his best to win his darling to confidence by caresses is she not his is he not hers and why when the battle is won does she weep does she regret what she has done oh never never her soft blue eyes assure him steadfast love seen swimming on clear depths of faith in them through the shower he is silenced by her exceeding beauty and sits perplexed waiting for the shower to pass alone with mrs berry in her bedroom lucy gave tongue to her distress and a second character in the comedy changed her face o mrs berry mrs berry what has happened what has happened my darlin child the bridal berry gazed at the finger of doleful joy id forgot all about it and thats whatve made me feel so queer ever since then ive been seemin as if i wasnt myself somehow without my ring dear dear what a wilful young gentleman we aint a match for men in that statelord help us mrs berry sat on the edge of a chair lucy on the edge of the bed what do you think of it mrs berry is it not terrible i cant say i should a liked it myself my dear mrs berry candidly responded oh why why why did it happen the young bride bent to a flood of fresh tears murmuring that she felt already oldforsaken havent you got a comfort in your religion for all accidents mrs berry inquired none for this i know its wrong to cry when i am so happy i hope he will forgive me mrs berry vowed her bride was the sweetest softest beautifulest thing in life ill cry no more said lucy leave me mrs berry and come back when i ring she drew forth a little silver cross and fell upon her knees to the bed mrs berry left the room tiptoe when she was called to return lucy was calm and tearless and smiled kindly to her its over now she said mrs berry sedately looked for her ring to follow he does not wish me to go in to the breakfast you have prepared mrs berry i begged to be excused i cannot eat mrs berry very much deplored it as she had laid out a superior nuptial breakfast but with her mind on her ring she nodded assentingly we shall not have much packing to do mrs berry no my dear its pretty well all done we are going to the isle of wight mrs berry and a very suitable spot yeve chose my dear he loves the sea he wishes to be near it dont ye cross tonight if its anyways rough my dear it isnt advisable mrs berry sank her voice to say dont ye be soft and give way to him there or youll both be repenting it lucy had only been staving off the unpleasantness she had to speak she saw mrs berrys eyes pursuing her ring and screwed up her courage at last mrs berry yes my dear mrs berry you shall have another ring another my dear berry did not comprehend ones quite enough for the objeck she remarked i mean lucy touched her fourth finger i cannot part with this she looked straight at mrs berry that bewildered creature gazed at her and at the ring till she had thoroughly exhausted the meaning of the words and then exclaimed horrorstruck deary me now you dont say that youre to be married again in your own religion the young wife repeated i can never part with it but my dear the wretched berry wrung her hands divided between compassion and a sense of injury my dear she kept expostulating like a mute i know all that you would say mrs berry i am very grieved to pain you it is mine now and must be mine i cannot give it back there she sat suddenly developed to the most inflexible little heroine in the three kingdoms from her first perception of the meaning of the young brides words mrs berry a shrewd physiognomist knew that her case was hopeless unless she treated her as she herself had been treated and seized the ring by force of arms and that she had not heart for what she gasped faintly ones own lawful weddingring you wouldnt give back to a body because it is mine mrs berry it was yours but it is mine now you shall have whatever you ask for but that pray forgive me it must be so mrs berry rocked on her chair and sounded her hands together it amazed her that this soft little creature could be thus firm she tried argument dont ye know my dear its the fatalest thing youre inflictin upon me reelly dont ye know that bein bereft of ones own lawful weddingrings the fatalest thing in life and theres no prosperity after it for what stands in place o that when thats gone my dear and what could ye give me to compensate a body for the loss o that dont ye knowoh deary me the little brides face was so set that poor berry wailed off in despair i know it said lucy i know it all i know what i do to you dear dear mrs berry forgive me if i parted with my ring i know it would be fatal so this fair young freebooter took possession of her argument as well as her ring berry racked her distracted wits for a further appeal but my child she counterargued you dont understand it aint as you think it aint a hurt to you now not a bit it aint it makes no difference now any ring does while the wearers a maid and your mr richard will find the very ring he intended for ye and of course thats the one youll wear as his wife its all the same now my dear its no shame to a maid now donow dotheres a darlin wheedling availed as little as argument mrs berry said lucy you know what myhe spoke with this ring i thee wed it was with this ring then how could it be with another berry was constrained despondently to acknowledge that was logic she hit upon an artful conjecture wont it be unlucky your wearin of the ring which served me so think o that it may it may it may cried lucy and arnt you rushin into it my dear mrs berry lucy said again it was this ring it cannotit never can be another it was this what it brings me i must bear i shall wear it till i die then what am i to do the illused woman groaned what shall i tell my husband when he come back to me and see ive got a new ring waitin for him wont that be a welcome quoth lucy how can he know it is not the same in a plain gold ring you never see so keen a eyed man in joolry as my berry returned his solitary spouse not know my dear why any one would know thatve got eyes in his head theres as much difference in weddingrings as theres in wedding people now do pray be reasonable my own sweet pray do not ask me pleads lucy pray do think better of it urges berry pray pray mrs berry pleads lucy and not leave your old berry all forlorn just when youre so happy indeed i would not you dear kind old creature lucy faltered mrs berry thought she had her just when youre going to be the happiest wife on earthall you want yours she pursued the tender strain a handsome young gentleman love and fortune smilin on ye lucy rose up mrs berry she said i think we must not lose time in getting ready or he will be impatient poor berry surveyed her in abject wonder from the edge of her chair dignity and resolve were in the ductile form she had hitherto folded under her wing in an hour the heroine had risen to the measure of the hero without being exactly aware what creature she was dealing with berry acknowledged to herself it was not one of the common run and sighed and submitted its like a divorce that it is she sobbed after putting the corners of her apron to her eyes berry bustled humbly about the packing then lucy whose heart was full to her came and kissed her and berry bumped down and regularly cried this over she had recourse to fatalism i suppose it was to be my dear its my punishment for meddlin wi such matters no im not sorry bless ye both whod a thought you was so wilfulyou that any one might have taken for one of the sillysofts youre a pair my dear indeed you are you was made to meet but we mustnt show him weve been cryingmen dont like it when theyre happy lets wash our faces and try to bear our lot so saying the blacksatin bunch careened to a renewed deluge she deserved some sympathy for if it is sad to be married in another persons ring how much sadder to have ones own old accustomed lawful ring violently torn off ones finger and eternally severed from one but where you have heroes and heroines these terrible complications ensue they had now both fought their battle of the ring and with equal honour and success in the chamber of banquet richard was giving ripton his last directions though it was a private wedding mrs berry had prepared a sumptuous breakfast chickens offered their breasts pies hinted savoury secrets things mystic in a mash with gallic appellatives jellies creams fruits strewed the table as a tower in the midst the cake colossal the priestly vesture of its nuptial white relieved by hymeneal splendours many hours much labour and anxiety of mind mrs berry had expended upon this breakfast and why there is one who comes to all feasts that have their basis in folly whom criminals of trained instinct are careful to provide against who will speak and whose hateful voice must somehow be silenced while the feast is going on this personage is the philosopher mrs berry knew him she knew that he would come she provided against him in the manner she thought most efficacious that is by cheating her eyes and intoxicating her conscience with the due and proper glories incident to weddings where fathers dilate mothers collapse and marriage settlements are flourished on high by the family lawyer and had there been no show of the kind to greet her on her return from the church she would and she foresaw she would have stared at squalor and emptiness and repented her work the philosopher would have laid hold of her by the ear and called her bad names entrenched behind a breakfasttable so legitimately adorned mrs berry defied him in the presence of that cake he dared not speak above a whisper and there were wines to drown him in should he still think of protesting fiery wines and cool claret sent purposely by the bridegroom for the delectation of his friend for one good hour therefore the labour of many hours kept him dumb ripton was fortifying himself so as to forget him altogether and the world as well till the next morning ripton was excited overdone with delight he had already finished one bottle and listened pleasantly flushed to his emphatic and more abstemious chief he had nothing to do but to listen and to drink the hero would not allow him to shout victory or hear a word of toasts and as from the quantity of oil poured on it his eloquence was becoming a natural force in his bosom the poor fellow was afflicted with a sort of elephantiasis of suppressed emotion at times he halfrose from his chair and fell vacuously into it again or he chuckled in the face of weighty severelyworded instructions tapped his chest stretched his arms yawned and in short behaved so singularly that richard observed it and said on my soul i dont think you know a word im saying every word ricky ripton spirted through the opening im going down to your governor and tell him sir austin heres your only chance of being a happy fatherno nooh dont you fear me ricky i shall talk the old gentleman over his chief said look here you had better not go down tonight go down the first thing tomorrow by the six oclock train give him my letter listen to megive him my letter and dont speak a word till he speaks his eyebrows will go up and down he wont say much i know him if he asks you about her dont be a fool but say what you think of her sensibly no cork could hold in ripton when she was alluded to he shouted shes an angel richard checked him speak sensibly i sayquietly you can say how gentle and good she ismy fleurdeluce and say this was not her doing if any ones to blame its i i made her marry me then go to lady blandish if you dont find her at the house you may say whatever you please to her give her my letter and tell her i want to hear from her immediately she has seen lucy and i know what she thinks of her you will then go to farmer blaize i told you lucy happens to be his nieceshe has not lived long there she lived with her aunt desborough in france while she was a child and can hardly be called a relative to the farmertheres not a point of likeness between them poor darling she never knew her mother go to mr blaize and tell him you will treat him just as you would treat any other gentleman if you are civil he is sure to be and if he abuses me for my sake and hers you will still treat him with respect you hear and then write me a full account of all that has been said and done you will have my address the day after tomorrow by the way tom will be here this afternoon write out for him where to call on you the day after tomorrow in case you have heard anything in the morning you think i ought to know at once as tom will join me that night dont mention to anybody about my losing the ring ripton i wouldnt have adrian get hold of that for a thousand pounds how on earth i came to lose it how well she bore it rip how beautifully she behaved ripton again shouted an angel throwing up the heels of his second bottle he said you may trust your friend richard aha when you pulled at old mrs berry i didnt know what was up i do wish youd let me drink her health heres to penelope said richard just wetting his mouth the carriage was at the door a couple of dire organs each grinding the same tune and a vulturescented itinerant band from which not the secretest veiled wedding can escape worked harmoniously without in the production of discord and the noise acting on his nervous state made him begin to fume and send in messages for his bride by the maid by and by the lovely young bride presented herself dressed for her journey and smiling from stained eyes mrs berry was requested to drink some wine which ripton poured out for her enabling mrs berry thereby to measure his condition the bride now kissed mrs berry and mrs berry kissed the bridegroom on the plea of her softness lucy gave ripton her hand with a musical goodbye mr thompson and her extreme graciousness made him just sensible enough to sit down before he murmured his fervent hopes for her happiness i shall take good care of him said mrs berry focussing her eyes to the comprehension of the company farewell penelope cried richard i shall tell the police everywhere to look out for your lord oh my dears goodbye and heaven bless ye both berry quavered touched with compunction at the thoughts of approaching loneliness ripton his mouth drawn like a bow to his ears brought up the rear to the carriage receiving a fair slap on the cheek from an old shoe precipitated by mrs berrys enthusiastic female domestic white handkerchiefs were waved the adieux had fallen to signs they were off then did a thought of such urgency illumine mrs berry that she telegraphed hand in air awakening riptons lungs for the coachman to stop and ran back to the house richard chafed to be gone but at his brides intercession he consented to wait presently they beheld the old blacksatin bunch stream through the streetdoor down the bit of garden and up the astonished street halting panting capless at the carriage door a book in her handa muchused dogleaved steamy greasy book which at the same time calling out in breathless jerks there never ye mind looks i aint got a new one read it and dont ye forget it she discharged into lucys lap and retreated to the railings a signal for the coachman to drive away for good how richard laughed at the berrys bridal gift lucy too lost the omen at her heart as she glanced at the title of the volume it was dr kitchener on domestic cookery chapter xxxi general withdrawing of heads from streetwindows emigration of organs and bands and a relaxed atmosphere in the circle of mrs berrys abode proved that dan cupid had veritably flown to suck the life of fresh regions with a pensive mind she grasped riptons arm to regulate his steps and returned to the room where her creditor awaited her in the interval he had stormed her undefended fortress the cake from which altitude he shook a dolorous head at the guilty woman she smoothed her excited apron sighing let no one imagine that she regretted her complicity she was ready to cry torrents but there must be absolute castigation before this criminal shall conceive the sense of regret and probably then she will cling to her wickedness the moresuch is the born pagans tenacity mrs berry sighed and gave him back his shake of the head o you wanton improvident creature said he o you very wise old gentleman said she he asked her the thing she had been doing she enlightened him with the fatalists reply he sounded a bogeys alarm of contingent grave results she retreated to the entrenched camp of the fact she had helped to make its done she exclaimed how could she regret what she felt comfort to know was done convinced that events alone could stamp a mark on such stubborn flesh he determined to wait for them and crouched silent on the cake with one finger downwards at riptons incision there showing a crumbling chasm and gloomy rich recess the eloquent indication was understood dear dear cried mrs berry what a heap o cake and no one to send it to ripton had resumed his seat by the table and his embrace of the claret clear ideas of satisfaction had left him and resolved to a boiling geysir of indistinguishable transports he bubbled and waggled and nodded amicably to nothing and successfully though not without effort preserved his uppermost member from the seductions of the nymph gravitation who was on the lookout for his whole length shortly ha ha he shouted about a minute after mrs berry had spoken and almost abandoned himself to the nymph on the spot mrs berrys words had just reached his wits why do you laugh young man she inquired familiar and motherly on account of his condition ripton laughed louder and caught his chest on the edge of the table and his nose on a chicken thats goo he said recovering and rocking under mrs berrys eyes no friend i did not say no friend she remarked i said no one meanin i know not where for to send it to riptons response to this was you put a griffin on that cake wheatsheaves each side his crest mrs berry said sweetly oldest baronetcy n england waved ripton yes mrs berry encouraged him on you think hes richards were oblige be very close and shes the most lovelyif i hear man say thing gainst her you neednt for to cry over her young man said mrs berry i wanted for to drink their right healths by their right names and then go about my days work and i do hope you wont keep me ripton stood bolt upright at her words you do he said and filling a bumper he with cheerfully vinous articulation and glibness of tongue proposed the health of richard and lucy feverel of raynham abbey and that mankind should not require an expeditious example of the way to accept the inspiring toast he drained his bumper at a gulp it finished him the farthing rushlight of his reason leapt and expired he tumbled to the sofa and there stretched some minutes subsequent to riptons signalization of his devotion to the bridal pair mrs berrys maid entered the room to say that a gentleman was inquiring below after the young gentleman who had departed and found her mistress with a tottering wineglass in her hand exhibiting every symptom of unconsoled hysterics her mouth gaped as if the fell creditor had her by the swallow she ejaculated with horrible exultation that she had been and done it as her disastrous aspect seemed to testify and her evident but inexplicable access of misery induced the sympathetic maid to tender those caressing words that were all mrs berry wanted to go off into the selfcaressing fit without delay and she had already given the preluding demoniac ironic outburst when the maid called heaven to witness that the gentleman would hear her upon which mrs berry violently controlled her bosom and ordered that he should be shown upstairs instantly to see her the wretch she was she repeated the injunction the maid did as she was told and mrs berry wishing first to see herself as she was mutely accosted the lookingglass and tried to look a very little better she dropped a shawl on ripton and was settled smoothing her agitation when her visitor was announced the gentleman was adrian harley an interview with tom bakewell had put him on the track and now a momentary survey of the table and its whitevestured cake made him whistle mrs berry plaintively begged him to do her the favour to be seated a fine morning maam said adrian it have been mrs berry answered glancing over her shoulder at the window and gulping as if to get her heart down from her mouth a very fine spring pursued adrian calmly anatomizing her countenance mrs berry smothered an adjective to weather on a deep sigh her wretchedness was palpable in proportion to it adrian waned cheerful and brisk he divined enough of the business to see that there was some strange intelligence to be fished out of the culprit who sat compressing hysterics before him and as he was never more in his element than when he had a sinner and a repentant prostrate abject sinner in hand his affable countenance might well deceive poor berry i presume these are mr thompsons lodgings he remarked with a look at the table mrs berrys head and the whites of her eyes informed him that they were not mr thompsons lodgings no said adrian and threw a carelessly inquisitive eye about him mr feverel is out i suppose a convulsive start at the name and two corroborating hands dropped on her knees formed mrs berrys reply mr feverels man continued adrian told me i should be certain to find him here i thought he would be with his friend mr thompson im too late i perceive their entertainment is over i fancy you have been having a party of them here maama bachelors breakfast in the presence of that cake this observation seemed to mask an irony so shrewd that mrs berry could barely contain herself she felt she must speak making her face as deplorably propitiating as she could she began sir may i beg for to know your name mr harley accorded her request groaning in the clutch of a pitiless truth she continued and you are mr harley that wasoh and youve come for mr mr richard feverel was the gentleman mr harley had come for oh and its no mistake and hes of raynham abbey mrs berry inquired adrian very much amused assured her that he was born and bred there his fathers sir austin wailed the blacksatin bunch from behind her handkerchief adrian verified richards descent oh then what have i been and done she cried and stared blankly at her visitor i been and married my baby i been and married the bread out of my own mouth o mr harley mr harley i knew you when you was a boy that big and wore jackets and all of you and its my softness thats my ruin for i never can resist a mans asking look at that cake mr harley adrian followed her directions quite coolly weddingcake maam he said bridecake it is mr harley did you make it yourself maam the quiet ease of the question overwhelmed mrs berry and upset that train of symbolic representations by which she was seeking to make him guess the catastrophe and spare her the furnace of confession i did not make it myself mr harley she replied its a bought cake and im a lost woman little i dreamed when i had him in my arms a baby that i should some day be marrying him out of my own house i little dreamed that oh why did he come to me dont you remember his old nurse when he was a baby in arms that went away so sudden and no fault of hers mr harley the very mornin after the night you got into mr bensons cellar and got so tipsy on his madearyi remember it as clear as yesterdayand mr benson was that angry he threatened to use the whip to you and i helped put you to bed im that very woman adrian smiled placidly at these reminiscences of his guileless youthful life well maam well he said he would bring her to the furnace wont you see it all kind sir mrs berry appealed to him in pathetic dumb show doubtless by this time adrian did see it all and was mentally cursing at folly and reckoning the immediate consequences but he looked uninstructed his peculiar dimplesmile was undisturbed his comfortable fullbodied posture was the same well maam he spurred her on mrs berry burst forth it were done this mornin mr harley in the church at halfpast eleven of the clock or twenty to by licence adrian was now obliged to comprehend a case of matrimony oh he said like one who is as hard as facts and as little to be moved somebody was married this morning was it mr thompson or mr feverel mrs berry shuffled up to ripton and removed the shawl from him saying do he look like a new married bridegroom mr harley adrian inspected the oblivious ripton with philosophic gravity this young gentleman was at church this morning he asked oh quite reasonable and proper then mrs berry begged him to understand of course maam adrian lifted and let fall the stupid inanimate limbs of the gone wretch puckering his mouth queerly you were all reasonable and proper maam the principal male performer then is my cousin mr feverel he was married by you this morning by licence at your parish church and came here and ate a hearty breakfast and left intoxicated mrs berry flew out he never drink a drop sir a more moderate young gentleman you never see oh dont ye think that now mr harley he was as upright and master of his mind as you be ay the wise youth nodded thanks to her for the comparison i mean the other form of intoxication mrs berry sighed she could say nothing on that score adrian desired her to sit down and compose herself and tell him circumstantially what had been done she obeyed in utter perplexity at his perfectly composed demeanour mrs berry as her recital declared was no other than that identical woman who once in old days had dared to behold the baronet behind his mask and had ever since lived in exile from the raynham world on a little pension regularly paid to her as an indemnity she was that woman and the thought of it made her almost accuse providence for the betraying excess of softness it had endowed her with how was she to recognize her baby grown a man he came in a feigned name not a word of the family was mentioned he came like an ordinary mortal though she felt something more than ordinary to himshe knew she did he came bringing a beautiful young lady and on what grounds could she turn her back on them why seeing that all was chaste and legal why should she interfere to make them unhappyso few the chances of happiness in this world mrs berry related the seizure of her ring one wrench said the sobbing culprit one and my ring was off she had no suspicions and the task of writing her name in the vestrybook had been too enacting for a thought upon the other signatures i daresay you were exceedingly sorry for what you had done said adrian indeed sir moaned berry i were and am and would do your best to rectify the mischiefeh maam indeed and indeed sir i would she protested solemnly as of course you shouldknowing the family where may these lunatics have gone to spend the moon mrs berry swimmingly replied to the islei dont quite know sir she snapped the indication short and jumped out of the pit she had fallen into repentant as she might be those dears should not be pursued and cruelly balked of their young bliss tomorrow if you please mr harley not today a pleasant spot adrian observed smiling at his easy prey by a measurement of dates he discovered that the bridegroom had brought his bride to the house on the day he had quitted raynham and this was enough to satisfy adrians mind that there had been concoction and chicanery chance probably had brought him to the old woman chance certainly had not brought him to the young one very well maam he said in answer to her petitions for his favourable offices with sir austin in behalf of her little pension and the bridal pair i will tell him you were only a blind agent in the affair being naturally soft and that you trust he will bless the consummation he will be in town tomorrow morning but one of you two must see him tonight an emetic kindly administered will set our friend here on his legs a bath and a clean shirt and he might go i dont see why your name should appear at all brush him up and send him to bellingham by the seven oclock train he will find his way to raynham he knows the neighbourhood best in the dark let him go and state the case remember one of you must go with this fair prospect of leaving a choice of a perdition between the couple of unfortunates for them to fight and lose all their virtues over adrian said good morning mrs berry touchingly arrested him you wont refuse a piece of his cake mr harley oh dear no maam adrian turned to the cake with alacrity i shall claim a very large piece richard has a great many friends who will rejoice to eat his weddingcake cut me a fair quarter mrs berry put it in paper if you please i shall be delighted to carry it to them and apportion it equitably according to their several degrees of relationship mrs berry cut the cake somehow as she sliced through it the sweetness and hapless innocence of the bride was presented to her and she launched into eulogies of lucy and clearly showed how little she regretted her conduct she vowed that they seemed made for each other that both were beautiful both had spirit both were innocent and to part them or make them unhappy would be mrs berry wrought herself to cry aloud oh such a pity adrian listened to it as the expression of a matteroffact opinion he took the huge quarter of cake nodded multitudinous promises and left mrs berry to bless his good heart so dies the system was adrians comment in the street and now let prophets roar he dies respectably in a marriagebed which is more than i should have foretold of the monster meantime he gave the cake a dramatic tap ill go sow nightmares chapter xxxii adrian really bore the news he had heard with creditable disinterestedness and admirable repression of anything beneath the dignity of a philosopher when one has attained that felicitous point of wisdom from which one sees all mankind to be fools the diminutive objects may make what new moves they please one does not marvel at them their sedateness is as comical as their frolic and their frenzies more comical still on this intellectual eminence the wise youth had built his castle and he had lived in it from an early period astonishment never shook the foundations nor did envy of greater heights tempt him to relinquish the security of his stronghold for he saw none jugglers he saw running up ladders that overtopped him and airballoons scaling the empyrean but the former came precipitately down again and the latter were at the mercy of the winds while he remained tranquil on his solid unambitious ground fitting his morality to the laws his conscience to his morality his comfort to his conscience not that voluntarily he cut himself off from his fellows on the contrary his sole amusement was their society alone he was rather dull as a man who beholds but one thing must naturally be study of the animated varieties of that one thing excited him sufficiently to think life a pleasant play and the faculties he had forfeited to hold his elevated position he could serenely enjoy by contemplation of them in others thuswonder at master richards madness though he himself did not experience it he was eager to mark the effect on his beloved relatives as he carried along his vindictive hunch of cake he shaped out their different attitudes of amaze bewilderment horror passing by some personal chagrin in the prospect for his patron had projected a journey commencing with paris culminating on the alps and lapsing in rome a delightful journey to show richard the highways of history and tear him from the risk of further ignoble fascinations that his spirit might be altogether bathed in freshness and revived this had been planned during richards absence to surprise him now the dream of travel was to adrian what the love of woman is to the race of young men it supplanted that foolishness it was his romance as we say that buoyant anticipation on which in youth we ride the airs and which as we wax older and too heavy for our atmosphere hardens to the hobby which if an obstinate animal is a safer horse and conducts man at a slower pace to the sexton adrian had never travelled he was aware that his romance was earthly and had discomforts only to be evaded by the one potent talisman possessed by his patron his alp would hardly be grand to him without an obsequious landlord in the foreground he must recline on mammons imperial cushions in order to moralize becomingly on the ancient world the search for pleasure at the expense of discomfort as frantic lovers woo their mistresses to partake the shelter of a but and batten on a crust adrian deemed the bitterness of beggarliness let his sweet mistress be given him in the pomp and splendour due to his superior emotions or not at all consequently the wise youth had long nursed an ineffectual passion and it argued a great nature in him that at the moment when his wishes were to be crowned he should look with such slight touches of spleen at the gorgeous composite fabric of parisian cookery and roman antiquities crumbling into unsubstantial mockery assuredly very few even of the philosophers would have turned away uncomplainingly to meaner delights the moment after hippias received the first portion of the cake he was sitting by the window in his hotel reading he had fought down his breakfast with more than usual success and was looking forward to his dinner at the foreys with less than usual timidity ah glad youve come adrian he said and expanded his chest i was afraid i should have to ride down this is kind of you well walk down together through the park its absolutely dangerous to walk alone in these streets my opinion is that orangepeel lasts all through the year now and will till legislation puts a stop to it i give you my word i slipped on a piece of orangepeel yesterday afternoon in piccadilly and i thought i was down i saved myself by a miracle you have an appetite i hope asked adrian i think i shall get one after a bit of a walk chirped hippias yes i think i feel hungry now charmed to hear it said adrian and began unpinning his parcel on his knees how should you define folly he checked the process to inquire hm hippias meditated he prided himself on being oracular when such questions were addressed to him i think i should define it to be a slide very good definition in other words a piece of orangepeel once on it your life and limbs are in danger and you are saved by a miracle you must present that to the pilgrim and the monument of folly what would that be hippias meditated anew all the human race on one anothers shoulders he chuckled at the sweeping sourness of the instance very good adrian applauded or in default of that some symbol of the thing say such as this of which i have here brought you a chip adrian displayed the quarter of the cake this is the monument made portableeh cake cried hippias retreating to his chair to dramatize his intense disgust youre right of them that eat it if iif i dont mistake he peered at it the noxious composition bedizened in that way is what they call weddingcake its arrant poison who is it you want to kill what are you carrying such stuff about for adrian rang the bell for a knife to present you with your due and proper portion you will have friends and relatives and cant be saved from them not even by miracle it is a habit which exhibits perhaps the unconscious inherent cynicism of the human mind for people who consider that they have reached the acme of mundane felicity to distribute this token of esteem to their friends with the object probably he took the knife from a waiter and went to the table to slice the cake of enabling those friends these edifices require very delicate incisioneach particular currant and subtle condiment hangs to its neighboura weddingcake is evidently the most highly civilized of cakes and partakes of the evils as well as the advantages of civilizationi was saying they send us these lovetokens no doubt we shall have to weigh out the crumbs if each is to have his fair share that we may the better estimate their state of bliss by passing some hours in purgatory this as far as i can apportion it without weights and scales is your share my uncle he pushed the corner of the table bearing the cake towards hippias get away hippias vehemently motioned and started from his chair ill have none of it i tell you its death its fifty times worse than that beastly compound christmas pudding what fool has been doing this then who dares send me cake me its an insult you are not compelled to eat any before dinner said adrian pointing the corner of the table after him but your share you must take and appear to consume one who has done so much to bring about the marriage cannot in conscience refuse his allotment of the fruits maidens i hear first cook it under their pillows and extract nuptial dreams therefromsaid to be of a lighter class taken that way its a capital cake and upon my honour you have helped to make ityou have indeed so here it is the table again went at hippias he ran nimbly round it and flung himself on a sofa exhausted crying there my appetites gone for today then shall i tell richard that you wont touch a morsel of his cake said adrian leaning on his two hands over the table and looking at his uncle richard yes your nephew my cousin richard your companion since youve been in town hes married you know married this morning at kensington parish church by licence at halfpast eleven of the clock or twenty to married and gone to spend his honeymoon in the isle of wight a very delectable place for a months residence i have to announce to you that thanks to your assistance the experiment is launched sir richard married there was something to think and to say in objection to it but the wits of poor hippias were softened by the shock his hand travelled halfway to his forehead spread out to smooth the surface of that seat of reason and then fell surely you knew all about it you were so anxious to have him in town under your charge married hippias jumped uphe had it why hes under age hes an infant so he is but the infant is not the less married fib like a man and pay your feewhat does it matter any one who is breeched can obtain a licence in our noble country and the interests of morality demand that it should not be difficult is it truecan you persuade anybody that you have known nothing about it ha infamous joke i wish sir you would play your pranks on somebody else said hippias sternly as he sank back on the sofa youve done me up for the day i can assure you adrian sat down to instil belief by gentle degrees and put an artistic finish to the work he had the gratification of passing his uncle through varied contortions and at last hippias perspired in conviction and exclaimed this accounts for his conduct to me that boy must have a cunning nothing short of infernal i feel i feel it just here he drew a hand along his midriff im not equal to this world of fools he added faintly and shut his eyes no i cant dine eat ha no go without me shortly after hippias went to bed saying to himself as he undressed see what comes of our fine schemes poor austin and as the pillow swelled over his ears im not sure that a days fast wont do me good the dyspepsy had bought his philosophy at a heavy price he had a right to use it adrian resumed the procession of the cake he sighted his melancholy uncle algernon hunting an appetite in the row and looking as if the hope ahead of him were also onelegged the captain did not pass with out querying the ungainly parcel i hope i carry it ostentatiously enough said adrian enclosed is wherewithal to quiet the alarm of the land now may the maids and wives of merry england sleep secure i had half a mind to fix it on a pole and engage a band to parade it this is our dear richards weddingcake married at halfpast eleven this morning by licence at the kensington parish church his own ring being lost he employed the ring of his beautiful brides lachrymose landlady she standing adjacent by the altar his farewell to you as a bachelor and hers as a maid you can claim on the spot if you think proper and digest according to your powers algernon let off steam in a whistle thompson the solicitors daughter he said i met them the other day somewhere about here he introduced me to her a pretty little baggage no adrian set him right tis a miss desborough a roman catholic dairymaid reminds one of pastoral england in the time of the plantagenets hes quite equal to introducing her as thompsons daughter and himself as beelzebubs son however the wild animal is in hymens chains and the cake is cut will you have your morsel oh by all meansnot now algernon had an unwonted air of reflectionfather know it not yet he will tonight by nine oclock then i must see him by seven dont say you met me he nodded and pricked his horse wants money said adrian putting the combustible he carried once more in motion the women were the crowning joy of his contemplative mind he had reserved them for his final discharge dear demonstrative creatures dyspepsia would not weaken their poignant outcries or selfinterest check their fainting fits on the generic woman one could calculate well might the pilgrims scrip say of her that she is always at natures breast not intending it as a compliment each woman is eve throughout the ages whereas the pilgrim would have us believe that the adam in men has become warier if not wiser and weak as he is has learnt a lesson from time probably the pilgrims meaning may be taken to be that man grows and woman does not at any rate adrian hoped for such natural choruses as you hear in the nursery when a bauble is lost he was awake to mrs dorias maternal predestinations and guessed that clare stood ready with the best form of filial obedience they were only a poor couple to gratify his mephistophelian humour to be sure but mrs doria was equal to twenty and they would proclaim the diverse ways with which maidenhood and womanhood took disappointment while the surrounding forey girls and other females of the family assembly were expected to develop the finer shades and tapering edges of an agitation to which no woman could be cold all went well he managed cleverly to leave the cake unchallenged in a conspicuous part of the drawingroom and stepped gaily down to dinner much of the conversation adverted to richard mrs doria asked him if he had seen the youth or heard of him seen him no heard of him yes said adrian i have heard of him i heard that he was sublimely happy and had eaten such a breakfast that dinner was impossible claret and cold chicken cake and cake at breakfast they all interjected that seems to be his fancy just now what an extraordinary taste you know he is educated on a system one fast young male forey allied the system and the cake in a miserable pun adrian a hater of puns looked at him and held the table silent as if he were going to speak but he said nothing and the young gentleman vanished from the conversation in a blush extinguished by his own spark mrs doria peevishly exclaimed oh fishcake i suppose i wish he understood a little better the obligations of relationship whether he understands them i cant say observed adrian but i assure you he is very energetic in extending them the wise youth talked innuendoes whenever he had an opportunity that his dear relative might be rendered sufficiently inflammable by and by at the aspect of the cake but he was not thought more than commonly mysterious and deep was his appointment at the house of those grandison people mrs doria asked with a hostile upperlip adrian warmed the blindfolded parties by replying do they keep a beadle at the door mrs dorias animosity to mrs grandison made her treat this as a piece of satirical ingenuousness i daresay they do she said and a curate on hand oh i should think a dozen old mr forey advised his punning grandson clarence to give that house a wide berth where he might be disposed of and dishedup at a moments notice and the scent ran off at a jest the foreys gave good dinners and with the old gentleman the excellent old fashion remained in permanence of trooping off the ladies as soon as they had taken their sustenance and just exchanged a smile with the flowers and the dessert when they rose to fade with a beautiful accord and the gallant males breathed under easier waistcoats and settled to the business of the table sure that an hour for unbosoming and imbibing was their own adrian took a chair by brandon forey a barrister of standing i want to ask you he said whether an infant in law can legally bind himself if hes old enough to affix his signature to an instrument i suppose he can yawned brandon is he responsible for his acts ive no doubt we could hang him then what he could do for himself you could do for him not quite so much pretty near for instance he can marry thats not a criminal case you know and the marriage is valid you can dispute it yes and the greeks and the trojans can fight it holds then both water and fire the patriarch of the table sang out to adrian that he stopped the vigorous circulation of the claret dear me sir said adrian i beg pardon the circumstances must excuse me the fact is my cousin richard got married to a dairymaid this morning and i wanted to know whether it held in law it was amusing to watch the manly coolness with which the announcement was taken nothing was heard more energetic than deuce he has and a dairymaid i thought it better to let the ladies dine in peace adrian continued i wanted to be able to console my aunt well butwell but the old gentleman much the most excited puffedeh brandon hes a boy this young ass do you mean to tell me a boy can go and marry when he pleases and any troll he pleases and the marriage is good if i thought that id turn every woman off my premises i would from the housekeeper to the scullerymaid id have no woman near him tilltill till the young greenhorn was grey sir suggested brandon till he knew what women are made of sir the old gentleman finished his sentence vehemently what dye think will feverel say to it mr adrian he has been trying the very system you have proposed sirone that does not reckon on the powerful action of curiosity on the juvenile intelligence im afraid its the very worst way of solving the problem of course it is said clarence none but a fool at your age adrian relieved his embarrassment it is natural my dear clarence that you should consider the idea of an isolated or imprisoned manhood something monstrous and we do not expect you to see what amount of wisdom it contains you follow one extreme and we the other i dont say that a middle course exists the history of mankind shows our painful efforts to find one but they have invariably resolved themselves into asceticism or laxity acting and reacting the moral question is if a naughty little man by reason of his naughtiness releases himself from foolishness does a foolish little man by reason of his foolishness save himself from naughtiness a discussion peculiar to men of the world succeeded the laugh at mr clarence then coffee was handed round and the footman informed adrian in a low voice that mrs doria forey particularly wished to speak with him adrian preferred not to go in alone very well he said and sipped his coffee they talked on sounding the depths of law in brandon forey and receiving nought but hollow echoes from that profound cavity he would not affirm that the marriage was invalid he would not affirm that it could not be annulled he thought not still he thought it would be worth trying a consummated and a nonconsummated union were two different things dear me said adrian does the law recognize that why thats almost human another message was brought to adrian that mrs doria forey very particularly wished to speak with him what can be the matter he exclaimed pleased to have his faith in woman strengthened the cake had exploded no doubt so it proved when the gentlemen joined the fair society all the younger ladies stood about the table whereon the cake stood displayed gaps being left for those sitting to feast their vision and intrude the comments and speculations continually arising from fresh shocks of wonder at the unaccountable apparition entering with the halfguilty air of men who know they have come from a grosser atmosphere the gallant males also ranged themselves round the common object of curiosity here adrian mrs doria cried where is adrian pray come here tell me where did this cake come from whose is it what does it do here you know all about it for you brought it clare saw you bring it into the room what does it mean i insist upon a direct answer now do not make me impatient adrian certainly mrs doria was equal to twenty by her concentrated rapidity and volcanic complexion it was evident that suspicion had kindled i was really bound to bring it adrian protested answer me the wise youth bowed categorically this cake came from the house of a person a female of the name of berry it belongs to you partly partly to me partly to clare and to the rest of our family on the principle of equal division for which purpose it is present yes speak it means my dear aunt what that kind of cake usually does mean this then is the breakfast and the ring adrian where is richard mrs doria still clung to unbelief in the monstrous horror but when adrian told her that richard had left town her struggling hope sank the wretched boy has ruined himself she said and sat down trembling oh that system the delicate vituperations gentle ladies use instead of oaths mrs doria showered on that system she hesitated not to say that her brother had got what he deserved opinionated morbid weak justice had overtaken him now he would see but at what a price at what a sacrifice mrs doria commanded adrian to confirm her fears sadly the wise youth recapitulated berrys words he was married this morning at halfpast eleven of the clock or twenty to twelve by licence at the kensington parish church then that was his appointment mrs doria murmured that was the cake for breakfast breathed a second of her sex and it was his ring exclaimed a third the men were silent and made long faces clare stood cold and sedate she and her mother avoided each others eyes is it that abominable country person adrian the happy damsel is i regret to say the papist dairymaid said adrian in sorrowful but deliberate accents then arose a feminine hum in the midst of which mrs doria cried brandon she was a woman of energy her thoughts resolved to action spontaneously brandon she drew the barrister a little aside can they not be followed and separated i want your advice cannot we separate them a boy it is really shameful if he should be allowed to fall into the toils of a designing creature to ruin himself irrevocably can we not brandon the worthy barrister felt inclined to laugh but he answered her entreaties from what i hear of the young groom i should imagine the office perilous im speaking of law brandon can we not obtain an order from one of your courts to pursue them and separate them instantly this evening yes brandon was sorry to say she decidedly could not you might call on one of your judges brandon brandon assured her that the judges were a hardworked race and to a man slept heavily after dinner will you do so tomorrow the first thing in the morning will you promise me to do so brandonor a magistrate a magistrate would send a policeman after them my dear brandon i begi beg you to assist us in this dreadful extremity it will be the death of my poor brother i believe he would forgive anything but this you have no idea what his notions are of blood brandon tipped adrian a significant nod to step in and aid what is it aunt asked the wise youth you want them followed and torn asunder by wild policemen tomorrow brandon queerly interposed wont that bejust too late adrian suggested mrs doria sighed out her last spark of hope you see said adrian yes yes mrs doria did not require any of his elucidations pray be quiet adrian and let me speak brandon it cannot be its quite impossible can you stand there and tell me that boy is legally married i never will believe it the law cannot be so shamefully bad as to permit a boya mere childto do such absurd things grandpapa she beckoned to the old gentleman grandpapa pray do make brandon speak these lawyers never will he might stop it if he would if i were a man do you think i would stand here well my dear the old gentleman toddled to compose her im quite of your opinion i believe he knows no more than you or i my belief is they none of them know anything till they join issue and go into court i want to see a few female lawyers to encourage the bankrupt perruquier sir said adrian they would have to keep a large supply of wigs on hand and you can jest adrian his aunt reproached him but i will not be beaten i knowi am firmly convinced that no law would ever allow a boy to disgrace his family and ruin himself like that and nothing shall persuade me that it is so now tell me brandon and pray do speak in answer to my questions and please to forget you are dealing with a woman can my nephew be rescued from the consequences of his folly is what he has done legitimate is he bound for life by what he has done while a boy wella brandon breathed through his teeth ahm the matters so very delicate you see helen youre to forget that adrian remarked ahm well pursued brandon perhaps if you could arrest and divide them before nightfall and make affidavit of certain facts yes the eager woman hastened his lagging mouth wellhm ain that casea or if a lunatic you could prove him to have been of unsound mind oh theres no doubt of his madness on my mind brandon yes well in that case or if of different religious persuasions she is a catholic mrs doria joyfully interjected yes well in that caseobjections might be taken to the form of the marriage might be proved fictitious or if hes under say eighteen years he cant be much more cried mrs doria i think she appeared to reflect and then faltered imploringly to adrian what is richards age the kind wise youth could not find it in his heart to strike away the phantom straw she caught at oh about that i should fancy he muttered and found it necessary at the same time to duck and turn his head for concealment mrs doria surpassed his expectations yes i well then brandon was resuming with a shrug which was meant to say he still pledged himself to nothing when clares voice was heard from out the buzzing circle of her cousins richard is nineteen years and six months old today mama nonsense child he is mama clares voice was very steadfast nonsense i tell you how can you know richard is one year and nine months older than me mama mrs doria fought the fact by years and finally by months clare was too strong for her singular child she mentally apostrophized the girl who scornfully rejected straws while drowning but theres the religion still she comforted herself and sat down to cogitate the men smiled and looked vacuous music was proposed there are times when soft music hath not charms when it is put to as base uses as imperial caesars dust and is taken to fill horrid pauses angelica forey thumped the piano and sang im a laughing gitana haha haha matilda forey and her cousin mary branksburne wedded their voices and songfully incited all young people to haste to the bower that love has built and defy the wise ones of the world but the wise ones of the world were in a majority there and very few places of assembly will be found where they are not so the glowing appeal of the british balladmonger passed into the bosom of the emptiness he addressed clare was asked to entertain the company the singular child calmly marched to the instrument and turned over the appropriate illustrations to the balladmongers repertory clare sang a little irish air her duty done she marched from the piano mothers are rarely deceived by their daughters in these matters but clare deceived her mother and mrs doria only persisted in feeling an agony of pity for her child that she might the more warrantably pity herselfa not uncommon form of the emotion for there is no juggler like that heart the balladmonger puts into our mouths so boldly remember that she saw years of selfdenial years of a ripening scheme rendered fruitless in a minute and by the system which had almost reduced her to the condition of constitutional hypocrite she had enough of bitterness to brood over and some excuse for selfpity still even when she was cooler mrs dorias energetic nature prevented her from giving up straws were straws and the frailer they were the harder she clutched them she rose from her chair and left the room calling to adrian to follow her adrian she said turning upon him in the passage you mentioned a house where this horrible cakewhere he was this morning i desire you to take me to that woman immediately the wise youth had not bargained for personal servitude he had hoped he should be in time for the last act of the opera that night after enjoying the comedy of real life my dear aunthe was beginning to insinuate order a cab to be sent for and get your hat said mrs doria there was nothing for it but to obey he stamped his assent to the pilgrims dictum that women are practical creatures and now reflected on his own account that relationship to a young fool may be a vexation and a nuisance however mrs doria compensated him what mrs doria intended to do the practical creature did not plainly know but her energy positively demanded to be used in some way or other and her instinct directed her to the offender on whom she could use it in wrath she wanted somebody to be angry with somebody to abuse she dared not abuse her brother to his face him she would have to console adrian was a fellowhypocrite to the system and would she was aware bring her into painfully delicate albeit highly philosophic ground by a discussion of the case so she drove to bessy berry simply to inquire whither her nephew had flown when a soft woman and that soft woman a sinner is matched with a woman of energy she does not show much fight and she meets no mercy bessy berrys creditor came to her in female form that night she then beheld it in all its terrors hitherto it had appeared to her as a male a disembodied spirit of her imagination possessing male attributes and the peculiar male characteristic of being moved and ultimately silenced by tears as female her creditor was terrible indeed still had it not been a late hour bessy berry would have died rather than speak openly that her babes had sped to make their nest in the isle of wight they had a long start they were out of the reach of pursuers they were safe and she told what she had to tell she told more than was wise of her to tell she made mention of her early service in the family and of her little pension alas her little pension her creditor had come expecting no paymentcome as creditors are wont in such moods just to take it out of herto employ the familiar term at once mrs doria pounced upon the pension that of course you know is at an end she said in the calmest manner and berry did not plead for the little bit of bread to her she only asked a little consideration for her feelings true admirers of women had better stand aside from the scene undoubtedly it was very sad for adrian to be compelled to witness it mrs doria was not generous the pilgrim may be wrong about the sex not growing but its fashion of conducting warfare we must allow to be barbarous and according to what is deemed the pristine or wild cat method ruin nothing short of it accompanied poor berry to her bed that night and her character bled till morning on her pillow the scene over adrian reconducted mrs doria to her home mice had been at the cake during her absence apparently the ladies and gentlemen present put it on the greedy mice who were accused of having gorged and gone to bed im sure theyre quite welcome said mrs doria its a farce this marriage and adrian has quite come to my way of thinking i would not touch an atom of it why they were married in a married womans ring can that be legal as you call it oh im convinced dont tell me austin will be in town tomorrow and if he is true to his principles he will instantly adopt measures to rescue his son from infamy i want no legal advice i go upon common sense common decency this marriage is false mrs dorias fine scheme had become so much a part of her life that she could not give it up she took clare to her bed and caressed and wept over her as she would not have done had she known the singular child saying poor richard my dear poor boy we must save him clare we must save him of the two the mother showed the greater want of iron on this occasion clare lay in her arms rigid and emotionless with one of her hands tightlocked all she said was i knew it in the morning mama she slept clasping richards nuptial ring by this time all specially concerned in the system knew it the honeymoon was shoring placidly above them is not happiness like another circulating medium when we have a very great deal of it some poor hearts are aching for what is taken away from them when we have gone out and seized it on the highways certain inscrutable laws are sure to be at work to bring us to the criminal bar sooner or later who knows the honeymoon that did not steal somebodys sweetness richard turpin went forth singing money or life to the world richard feverel has done the same substituting happiness for money frequently synonyms the coin he wanted he would have and was just as much a highway robber as his fellow dick so that those who have failed to recognize him as a hero before may now regard him in that light meanwhile the world he has squeezed looks exceedingly patient and beautiful his coin chinks delicious music to him nature and the order of things on earth have no warmer admirer than a jolly brigand or a young man made happy by the jews chapter xxxiii and now the author of the system was on trial under the eyes of the lady who loved him what so kind as they yet are they very rigorous those soft watchful womans eyes if you are below the measure they have made of you you will feel it in the fulness of time she cannot but show you that she took you for a giant and has had to come down a bit you feel yourself strangely diminishing in those sweet mirrors till at last they drop on you complacently level but oh beware vain man of ever waxing enamoured of that wonderful elongation of a male creature you saw reflected in her adoring upcast orbs beware of assisting to delude her a woman who is not quite a fool will forgive your being but a man if you are surely that she will haply learn to acknowledge that no mortal tailor could have fitted that figure she made of you respectably and that practically though she sighs to think it her ideal of you was on the pattern of an overgrown charityboy in the regulation jacket and breech for this she first scorns the narrow capacities of the tailor and then smiles at herself but shouldst thou when the hour says plainly be thyself and the woman is willing to take thee as thou art shouldst thou still aspire to be that thing of shanks and wrests wilt thou not seem contemptible as well as ridiculous and when the fall comes will it not be flat on thy face instead of to the common height of men you may fall miles below her measure of you and be safe nothing is damaged save an overgrown charityboy but if you fall below the common height of men you must make up your mind to see her rustle her gown spy at the lookingglass and transfer her allegiance the moral of which is that if we pretend to be what we are not woman for whose amusement the farce is performed will find us out and punish us for it and it is usually the end of a sentimental dalliance had sir austin given vent to the pain and wrath it was natural he should feel he might have gone to unphilosophic excesses and however much he lowered his reputation as a sage lady blandish would have excused him she would not have loved him less for seeing him closer but the poor gentleman tasked his soul and stretched his muscles to act up to her conception of him he a man of science in life who was bound to be surprised by nothing in nature it was not for him to do more than lift his eyebrows and draw in his lips at the news delivered by ripton thompson that ill bird at raynham all he said after ripton had handed the letters and carried his penitential headache to bed was you see emmeline it is useless to base any system on a human being a very philosophical remark for one who has been busily at work building for nearly twenty years too philosophical to seem genuine it revealed where the blow struck sharpest richard was no longer the richard of his creationhis pride and his joybut simply a human being with the rest the bright star had sunk among the mass and yet what had the young man done and in what had the system failed the lady could not but ask herself this while she condoled with the offended father my friend she said tenderly taking his hand before she retired i know how deeply you must be grieved i know what your disappointment must be i do not beg of you to forgive him now you cannot doubt his love for this young person and according to his light has he not behaved honourably and as you would have wished rather than bring her to shame you will think of that it has been an accidenta misfortunea terrible misfortune the god of this world is in the machinenot out of it sir austin interrupted her and pressed her hand to get the goodnight over at any other time her mind would have been arrested to admire the phrase now it seemed perverse vain false and she was tempted to turn the meaning that was in it against himself much as she pitied him you know emmeline he added i believe very little in the fortune or misfortune to which men attribute their successes and reverses they are useful impersonations to novelists but my opinion is sufficiently high of flesh and blood to believe that we make our own history without intervention accidentsterrible misfortuneswhat are theygoodnight goodnight she said looking sad and troubled when i said misfortune i meant of course that he is to blame butshall i leave you his letter to me i think i have enough to meditate upon he replied coldly bowing god bless you she whispered andmay i say it do not shut your heart he assured her that he hoped not to do so and the moment she was gone he set about shutting it as tight as he could if instead of saying base no system on a human being he had said never experimentalize with one he would have been nearer the truth of his own case he had experimented on humanity in the person of the son he loved as his life and at once when the experiment appeared to have failed all humanitys failings fell on the shoulders of his son richards parting laugh in the trainit was explicable now it sounded in his ears like the mockery of this base nature of ours at every endeavour to exalt and chasten it the young man had plotted this from step to step sir austin traced the plot the curious mask he had worn since his illness the selection of his incapable uncle hippias for a companion in preference to adrian it was an evident wellperfected plot that hideous laugh would not be silenced base like the rest treacherous a creature of passions using his abilities solely to gratify themnever surely had humanity such chances as in him a manichaean tendency from which the sententious eulogist of nature had been struggling for years and which was partly at the bottom of the system now began to cloud and usurp dominion of his mind as he sat alone in the forlorn deadhush of his library he saw the devil how are we to know when we are at the head and fountain of the fates of them we love there by the springs of richards future his father sat and the devil said to him only be quiet do nothing resolutely do nothing your object now is to keep a brave face to the world so that all may know you superior to this human nature that has deceived you for it is the shameless deception not the marriage that has wounded you ay answered the baronet the shameless deception not the marriage wicked and ruinous as it must be a destroyer of my tenderest hopes my dearest schemes not the marriagethe shameless deception and he crumpled up his sons letter to him and tossed it into the fire how are we to distinguish the dark chief of the manichaeans when he talks our own thoughts to us further he whispered and your systemif you would be brave to the world have courage to cast the dream of it out of you relinquish an impossible project see it as it isdead too good for men ay muttered the baronet all who would save them perish on the cross and so he sat nursing the devil by and by he took his lamp and put on the old cloak and cap and went to gaze at ripton that exhausted debauchee and youth without a destiny slept a dead sleep a handkerchief was bound about his forehead and his helpless sunken chin and snoring nose projected up the pillow made him look absurdly piteous the baronet remembered how often he had compared his boy with this one his own bright boy and where was the difference between them mere outward gilding said his familiar yes he responded i daresay this one never positively plotted to deceive his father he followed his appetites unchecked and is internally the sounder of the two ripton with his sunken chin and snoring nose under the light of the lamp stood for human nature honest however abject miss random i fear very much is a necessary establishment whispered the monitor does the evil in us demand its natural food or it corrupts the whole ejaculated sir austin and is no angel of avail till that is drawn off and is that our conflictto see whether we can escape the contagion of its embrace and come uncorrupted out of that the world is wise in its way said the voice though it look on itself through port wine he suggested remembering his lawyer thompson wise in not seeking to be too wise said the voice and getting intoxicated on its drug of comfort human nature is weak and miss random is an establishment and wild oats an institution it always has been so and always will be so i fear in spite of your very noble efforts and leadswhither and endswhere richards laugh taken up by horrid reverberations as it were through the lengths of the lower halls replied this colloquy of two voices in a brain was concluded by sir austin asking again if there were no actual difference between the flower of his hopes and yonder drunken weed and receiving for answer that there was a decided dissimilarity in the smell of the couple becoming cognizant of which he retreated sir austin did not battle with the tempter he took him into his bosom at once as if he had been ripe for him and received his suggestions and bowed to his dictates because he suffered and decreed that he would suffer silently and be the only sufferer it seemed to him that he was greatminded in his calamity he had stood against the world the world had beaten him what then he must shut his heart and mask his face that was all to be far in advance of the mass is as fruitless to mankind he reflected as straggling in the rear for how do we know that they move behind us at all or move in our track what we win for them is lost and where we are overthrown we lie it was thus that a fine mind and a fine heart at the bounds of a nature not great chose to colour his retrogression and countenance his shortcoming and it was thus that he set about ruining the work he had done he might well say as he once did that there are hours when the clearest soul becomes a cunning fox for a grief that was private and peculiar he unhesitatingly cast the blame upon humanity just as he had accused it in the period of what he termed his own ordeal how had he borne that by masking his face and he prepared the ordeal for his son by doing the same this was by no means his idea of a mans duty in tribulation about which he could be strenuously eloquent but it was his instinct so to act and in times of trial great natures alone are not at the mercy of their instincts moreover it would cost him pain to mask his face pain worse than that he endured when there still remained an object for him to open his heart to in proportion and he always reposed upon the spartan comfort of bearing pain and being passive do nothing said the devil he nursed which meant in his case take me into you and dont cast me out excellent and sane is the outburst of wrath to men when it stops short of slaughter for who that locks it up to eat in solitary can say that it is consumed sir austin had as weak a digestion for wrath as poor hippias for a green duckling instead of eating it it ate him the wild beast in him was not the less deadly because it did not roar and the devil in him not the less active because he resolved to do nothing he sat at the springs of richards future in the forlorn deadhush of his library there hearing the cinders click in the extinguished fire and that humming stillness in which one may fancy one hears the midnight fates busily stirring their embryos the lamp glowed mildly on the bust of chatham toward morning a gentle knock fell at his door lady blandish glided in with hasty step she came straight to him and took both his hands my friend she said speaking tearfully and trembling i feared i should find you here i could not sleep how is it with you well emmeline well he replied torturing his brows to fix the mask he wished it had been adrian who had come to him he had an extraordinary longing for adrians society he knew that the wise youth would divine how to treat him and he mentally confessed to just enough weakness to demand a certain kind of management besides adrian he had not a doubt would accept him entirely as he seemed and not pester him in any way by trying to unlock his heart whereas a woman he feared would be waxing too womanly and swelling from tears and supplications to a scene of all things abhorred by him the most so he rapped the floor with his foot and gave the lady no very welcome face when he said it was well with him she sat down by his side still holding one hand firmly and softly detaining the other oh my friend may i believe you may i speak to you she leaned close to him you know my heart i have no better ambition than to be your friend surely i divide your grief and may i not claim your confidence who has wept more over your great and dreadful sorrows i would not have come to you but i do believe that sorrow shared relieves the burden and it is now that you may feel a womans aid and something of what a woman could be to you be assured he gravely said i thank you emmeline for your intentions no no not for my intentions and do not thank me think of himthink of your dear boy our richard as we have called himoh do not think it a foolish superstition of mine but i have had a thought this night that has kept me in torment till i rose to speak to you tell me first you have forgiven him a father bears no malice to his son emmeline your heart has forgiven him my heart has taken what he gave and quite forgiven him you will hear no complaints of mine the lady paused despondingly and looked at him in a wistful manner saying with a sigh yes i know how noble you are and different from others he drew one of his hands from her relaxed hold you ought to be in bed emmeline i cannot sleep go and talk to me another time no it must be now you have helped me when i struggled to rise into a clearer world and i think humble as i am i can help you now i have had a thought this night that if you do not pray for him and bless himit will end miserably my friend have you done so he was stung and offended and could hardly help showing it in spite of his mask have you done so austin this is assuredly a new way of committing fathers to the follies of their sons emmeline no not that but will you pray for your boy and bless him before the day comes he restrained himself to pronounce his words calmlyand i must do this or it will end in misery how else can it end can i save him from the seed he has sown consider emmeline what you say he has repeated his cousins sin you see the end of that oh so different this young person is not is not of the class poor austin wentworth allied himself to indeed it is different and hebe just and admit his nobleness i fancied you did this young person has great beauty she has the elements of good breeding sheindeed i think had she been in another position you would not have looked upon her unfavourably she may be too good for my son the baronet spoke with sublime bitterness no woman is too good for richard and you know it pass her yes i will speak only of him he met her by a fatal accident we thought his love dead and so did he till he saw her again he met her he thought we were plotting against him he thought he should lose her for ever and in the madness of an hour he did this my emmeline pleads bravely for clandestine matches ah do not trifle my friend say would you have had him act as young men in his position generally do to young women beneath them sir austin did not like the question it probed him very severely you mean he said that fathers must fold their arms and either submit to infamous marriages or have these creatures ruined i do not mean that exclaimed the lady striving for what she did mean and how to express it i mean that he loved her is it not a madness at his age but what i chiefly mean issave him from the consequences no you shall not withdraw your hand think of his pride his sensitiveness his great wild naturewild when he is set wrong think how intense it is set upon love think my friend do not forget his love for you sir austin smiled an admirable smile of pity that i should save him or any one from consequences is asking more than the order of things will allow to you emmeline and is not in the disposition of this world i cannot consequences are the natural offspring of acts my child you are talking sentiment which is the distraction of our modern age in everythinga phantasmal vapour distorting the image of the life we live you ask me to give him a golden age in spite of himself all that could be done by keeping him in the paths of virtue and truth i did he is become a man and as a man he must reap his own sowing the baffled lady sighed he sat so rigid he spoke so securely as if wisdom were to him more than the love of his son and yet he did love his son feeling sure that he loved his son while he spoke so loftily she reverenced him still baffled as she was and sensible that she had been quibbled with all i ask of you is to open your heart to him she said he kept silent call him a manhe is and must ever be the child of your education my friend you would console me emmeline with the prospect that if he ruins himself he spares the world of young women yes that is something closely she scanned the mask it was impenetrable he could meet her eyes and respond to the pressure of her hand and smile and not show what he felt nor did he deem it hypocritical to seek to maintain his elevation in her soft soul by simulating supreme philosophy over offended love nor did he know that he had an angel with him then a blind angel and a weak one but one who struck upon his chance am i pardoned for coming to you she said after a pause surely i can read my emmelines intentions he gently replied very poor ones i feel my weakness i cannot utter half i have been thinking oh if i could you speak very well emmeline at least i am pardoned surely so and before i leave you dear friend shall i be forgivenmay i beg itwill you bless him he was again silent pray for him austin pray for him ere the night is over as she spoke she slid down to his feet and pressed his hand to her bosom the baronet was startled in very dread of the soft fit that wooed him he pushed back his chair and rose and went to the window its day already he said with assumed vivacity throwing open the shutters and displaying the young light on the lawn lady blandish dried her tears as she knelt and then joined him and glanced up silently at richards moon standing in wane toward the west she hoped it was because of her having been premature in pleading so earnestly that she had failed to move him and she accused herself more than the baronet but in acting as she had done she had treated him as no common man and she was compelled to perceive that his heart was at present hardly superior to the hearts of ordinary men however composed his face might be and apparently serene his wisdom from that moment she grew critical of him and began to study her idola process dangerous to idols he now that she seemed to have relinquished the painful subject drew to her and as one who wished to smooth a foregone roughness murmured gods rarest blessing is after all a good woman my emmeline bears her sleepless night well she does not shame the day he gazed down on her with a fondling tenderness i could bear many many she replied meeting his eyes and you would see me look better and better if if only but she had no encouragement to end the sentence perhaps he wanted some mute form of consolation perhaps the handsome placid features of the darkeyed dame touched him at any rate their platonism was advanced by his putting an arm about her she felt the arm and talked of the morning thus proximate they by and by both heard something very like a groan behind them and looking round beheld the saurian eye lady blandish smiled but the baronets discomposure was not to be concealed by a strange fatality every stage of their innocent loves was certain to have a human beholder oh im sure i beg pardon benson mumbled arresting his head in a melancholy pendulosity he was ordered out of the room and i think i shall follow him and try to get forty winks said lady blandish they parted with a quiet squeeze of hands the baronet then called in benson get me my breakfast as soon as you can he said regardless of the aspect of injured conscience benson sombrely presented to him i am going to town early and benson he added you will also go to town this afternoon or tomorrow if it suits you and take your book with you to mr thompson you will not return here a provision will be made for you you can go the heavy butler essayed to speak but the tremendous blow and the baronets gesture choked him at the door he made another effort which shook the rolls of his loose skin pitiably an impatient signal sent him out dumband raynham was quit of the one believer in the great shaddock dogma chapter xxxiv it was the month of july the solent ran up green waves before a fullblowing southwester gay little yachts bounded out like foam and flashed their sails light as seanymphs a crown of deep summer blue topped the flying mountains of cloud by an open window that looked on the brine through nodding roses our young bridal pair were at breakfast regaling worthily both of them had the scientific humanist observed them he could not have contested the fact that as a couple who had set up to be father and mother of britons they were doing their duty files of eggcups with disintegrated shells bore witness to it and they were still at work hardly talking from rapidity of exercise both were dressed for an expedition she had her bonnet on and he his yachtinghat his sleeves were turned over at the wrists and her gown showed its lining on her lap at times a chance word might spring a laugh but eating was the business of the hour as i would have you to know it always will be where cupid is in earnest tribute flowed in to them from the subject land neglected lies loves pennywhistle on which they played so prettily and charmed the spheres to hear them what do they care for the spheres who have one another come eggs come bread and butter come tea with sugar in it and milk and welcome the jolly hours that is a fair interpretation of the music in them just now yonder instrument was good only for the overture after all what finer aspiration can lovers have than to be free man and woman in the heart of plenty and is it not a glorious level to have attained ah wretched scientific humanist not to be by and mark the admirable sight of these young creatures feeding it would have been a spell to exorcise the manichee methinks the mighty performance came to an end and then with a flourish of his tablenapkin husband stood over wife who met him on the confident budding of her mouth the poetry of mortals is their daily prose is it not a glorious level to have attained a short quickblooded kiss radiant fresh and honest as aurora and then richard says without lack of cheer no letter today my lucy whereat her sweet eyes dwell on him a little seriously but he cries never mind hell be coming down himself some morning he has only to know her and alls well eh and so saying he puts a hand beneath her chin and seems to frame her fair face in fancy she smiling up to be looked at but one thing i do want to ask my darling says lucy and dropped into his bosom with hands of petition take me on board his yacht with him todaynot leave me with those people will he im a good sailor he knows the best afloat laughs richard hugging her but you know you darling bit of a sailor they dont allow more than a certain number on board for the race and if they hear youve been with me therell be cries of foul play besides theres lady judith to talk to you about austin and lord mountfalcons compliments for you to listen to and mr morton to take care of you lucys eyes fixed sideways an instant i hope i dont frown and blush as i did she said screwing her pliable brows up to him winningly and he bent his cheek against hers and murmured something delicious and we shall be separated forhow many hours one two three hours she pouted to his flatteries and then i shall come on board to receive my brides congratulations and then my husband will talk all the time to lady judith and then i shall see my wife frowning and blushing at lord mountfalcon am i so foolish richard she forgot her trifling to ask in an earnest way and had another aurorean kiss just brushing the dew on her lips for answer after hiding a month in shyest shade the pair of happy sinners had wandered forth one day to look on men and marvel at them and had chanced to meet mr morton of poer hall austin wentworths friend and ralphs uncle mr morton had once been intimate with the baronet but had given him up for many years as impracticable and hopeless for which reason he was the more inclined to regard richards misdemeanour charitably and to lay the faults of the son on the father and thinking society to be the one thing requisite to the young man he had introduced him to the people he knew in the island among others to the lady judith felle a fair young dame who introduced him to lord mountfalcon a puissant nobleman who introduced him to the yachtsmen beginning to congregate so that in a few weeks he found himself in the centre of a brilliant company and for the first time in his life tasted what it was to have free intercourse with his fellowcreatures of both sexes the son of a system was therefore launched not only through the surf but in deep waters now the baronet had so far compromised between the recurrence of his softer feelings and the suggestions of his new familiar that he had determined to act toward richard with justness the world called it magnanimity and even lady blandish had some thoughts of the same kind when she heard that he had decreed to richard a handsome allowance and had scouted mrs dorias proposal for him to contest the legality of the marriage but sir austin knew well he was simply just in not withholding money from a youth so situated and here again the world deceived him by embellishing his conduct for what is it to be just to whom we love he knew it was not magnanimous but the cry of the world somehow fortified him in the conceit that in dealing perfect justice to his son he was doing all that was possible because so much more than common fathers would have done he had shut his heart consequently richard did not want money what he wanted more and did not get was a word from his father and though he said nothing to sadden his young bride she felt how much it preyed upon him to be at variance with the man whom now that he had offended him and gone against him he would have fallen on his knees to the man who was as no other man to him she heard him of nights when she lay by his side and the darkness and the broken mutterings of those nights clothed the figure of the strange stern man in her mind not that it affected the appetites of the pretty pair we must not expect that of cupid enthroned and in condition under the influence of seaair too the files of eggcups laugh at such an idea still the worm did gnaw them judge then of their delight when on this pleasant morning as they were issuing from the garden of their cottage to go down to the sea they caught sight of tom bakewell rushing up the road with a portmanteau on his shoulders and some distance behind him discerned adrian its all right shouted richard and ran off to meet him and never left his hand till he had hauled him up firing questions at him all the way to where lucy stood lucy this is adrian my cousinisnt he an angel his eyes seemed to add while lucys clearly answered that he is the fullbodied angel ceremoniously bowed to her and acted with reserved unction the benefactor he saw in their greetings i think we are not strangers he was good enough to remark and very quickly let them know he had not breakfasted on hearing which they hurried him into the house and lucy put herself in motion to have him served dear old rady said richard tugging at his hand again how glad i am youve come i dont mind telling you weve been horridly wretched six seven eight nine eggs was adrians comment on a survey of the breakfasttable why wouldnt he write why didnt he answer one of my letters but here you are so i dont mind now he wants to see us does he well go up tonight ive a match on at eleven my little yachtive called her the blandishagainst fred cuiries begum i shall beat but whether i do or not well go up tonight whats the news what are they all doing my dear boy adrian returned sitting comfortably down let me put myself a little more on an equal footing with you before i undertake to reply half that number of eggs will be sufficient for an unmarried man and then well talk theyre all very well as well as i can recollect after the shaking my total vacuity has had this morning i came over by the first boat and the sea the sea has made me love mother earth and desire of her fruits richard fretted restlessly opposite his cool relative adrian what did he say when he heard of it i want to know exactly what words he said well says the sage my son speech is the small change of silence he said less than i do thats how he took it cried richard and plunged in meditation soon the table was cleared and laid out afresh and lucy preceded the maid bearing eggs on the tray and sat down unbonneted and like a thoroughbred housewife to pour out the tea for him now well commence said adrian tapping his egg with meditative cheerfulness but his expression soon changed to one of pain all the more alarming for his benevolent efforts to conceal it could it be possible the egg was bad oh horror lucy watched him and waited in trepidation this egg has boiled three minutes and threequarters he observed ceasing to contemplate it dear dear said lucy i boiled them myself exactly that time richard likes them so and you like them hard mr harley on the contrary i like them soft two minutes and a half or threequarters at the outside an egg should never rashly verge upon hardnessnever three minutes is the excess of temerity if richard had told me if i had only known the lovely little hostess interjected ruefully biting her lip we mustnt expect him to pay attention to such matters said adrian trying to smile hang it there are more eggs in the house cried richard and pulled savagely at the bell lucy jumped up saying oh yes i will go and boil some exactly the time you like pray let me go mr harley adrian restrained her departure with a motion of his hand no he said i will be ruled by richards tastes and heaven grant me his digestion lucy threw a sad look at richard who stretched on a sofa and left the burden of the entertainment entirely to her the eggs were a melancholy beginning but her ardour to please adrian would not be damped and she deeply admired his resignation if she failed in pleasing this glorious herald of peace no matter by what small misadventure she apprehended calamity so there sat this fair dove with brows at work above her serious smiling blue eyes covertly studying every aspect of the plumpfaced epicure that she might learn to propitiate him he shall not think me timid and stupid thought this brave girl and indeed adrian was astonished to find that she could both chat and be useful as well as look ornamental when he had finished one egg behold two fresh ones came in boiled according to his prescription she had quietly given her orders to the maid and he had them without fuss possibly his look of dismay at the offending eggs had not been altogether involuntary and her womans instinct inexperienced as she was may have told her that he had come prepared to be not very well satisfied with anything in loves cottage there was mental faculty in those pliable brows to see through and combat an unwitting wise youth how much she had achieved already she partly divined when adrian said i think now im in case to answer your questions my dear boythanks to mrs richard and he bowed to her his first direct acknowledgment of her position lucy thrilled with pleasure ah cried richard and settled easily on his back to begin the pilgrim has lost his notebook and has been persuaded to offer a reward which shall maintain the happy finder thereof in an asylum for life bensonsuperlative bensonhas turned his shoulders upon raynham none know whither he has departed it is believed that the sole surviving member of the sect of the shaddockdogmatists is under a total eclipse of woman benson gone richard exclaimed what a tremendous time it seems since i left raynham so it is my dear boy the honeymoon is mahomets minute or say the persian kings waterpail that you read of in the story you dip your head in it and when you draw it out you discover that you have lived a life to resume your uncle algernon still roams in pursuit of the lost onei should say hops your uncle hippias has a new and most perplexing symptom a determination of bridecake to the nose ever since your generous present to him though he declares he never consumed a morsel of it he has been under the distressing illusion that his nose is enormous and i assure you he exhibits quite a maidenly timidity in following itthrough a doorway for instance he complains of its terrible weight i have conceived that benson invisible might be sitting on it his hand and the doctors are in hourly consultation with it but i fear it will not grow smaller the pilgrim has begotten upon it a new aphorism that size is a matter of opinion poor uncle hippy said richard i wonder he doesnt believe in magic theres nothing supernatural to rival the wonderful sensations he does believe in good god fancy coming to that im sure im very sorry lucy protested but i cant help laughing charming to the wise youth her pretty laughter sounded the pilgrim has your notion richard whom does he not forestall confirmed dyspepsia is the apparatus of illusions and he accuses the ages that put faith in sorcery of universal indigestion which may have been the case owing to their infamous cookery he says again if you remember that our own age is travelling back to darkness and ignorance through dyspepsia he lays the seat of wisdom in the centre of our system mrs richard for which reason you will understand how sensible i am of the vast obligation i am under to you at the present moment for your especial care of mine richard looked on at lucys little triumph attributing adrians subjugation to her beauty and sweetness she had latterly received a great many compliments on that score which she did not care to hear and adrians homage to a practical quality was far pleasanter to the young wife who shrewdly guessed that her beauty would not help her much in the struggle she had now to maintain adrian continuing to lecture on the excelling virtues of wise cookery a thought struck her where where had she tossed mrs berrys book so thats all about the homepeople said richard all replied adrian or stay you know clares going to be married not your aunt helen oh bother my aunt helen what do you think she had the impertinence to writebut never mind is it to ralph your aunt helen i was going to say my dear boy is an extraordinary woman it was from her originally that the pilgrim first learnt to call the female the practical animal he studies us all you know the pilgrims scrip is the abstract portraiture of his surrounding relatives well your aunt helen mrs doria battledoria laughed richard being foiled in a little pet scheme of her owncall it a system if you likeof some ten or fifteen years standing with regard to miss clare the fair shuttlecockiana instead of fretting like a man and questioning providence and turning herself and everybody else inside out and seeing the world upside down what does the practical animal do she wanted to marry her to somebody she couldnt marry her to so she resolved instantly to marry her to somebody she could marry her to and as old gentlemen enter into these transactions with the practical animal the most readily she fixed upon an old gentleman an unmarried old gentleman a rich old gentleman and now a captive old gentleman the ceremony takes place in about a week from the present time no doubt you will receive your invitation in a day or two and that cold icy wretched clare has consented to marry an old man groaned richard ill put a stop to that when i go to town richard got up and strode about the room then he bethought him it was time to go on board and make preparations im off he said adrian youll take her she goes in the empress mountfalcons vessel he starts us a little schooneryachtsuch a beauty ill have one like her some day goodbye darling he whispered to lucy and his hand and eyes lingered on her and hers on him seeking to make up for the priceless kiss they were debarred from but she quickly looked away from him as he held heradrian stood silent his brows were up and his mouth dubiously contracted he spoke at last go on the water yes its only to st helens short and sharp do you grudge me the nourishment my poor system has just received my son oh bother your system put on your hat and come along ill put you on board in my boat richard i have already paid the penalty of them who are condemned to come to an island i will go with you to the edge of the sea and i will meet you there when you return and take up the tale of the tritons but though i forfeit the pleasure of mrs richards company i refuse to quit the land yes oh mr harley lucy broke from her husband and i will stay with you if you please i dont want to go among those people and we can see it all from the shore dearest i dont want to go you dont mind of course i will go if you wish but i would so much rather stay and she lengthened her plea in her attitude and look to melt the discontent she saw gathering adrian protested that she had much better go that he could amuse himself very well till their return and so forth but she had schemes in her pretty head and held to it to be allowed to stay in spite of lord mountfalcons disappointment cited by richard and at the great risk of vexing her darling as she saw richard pished and glanced contemptuously at adrian he gave way ungraciously there do as you like get your things ready to leave this evening no im not angrywho could be he seemed as he looked up from her modest fondling to ask adrian and seized the indemnity of a kiss on her forehead which however did not immediately disperse the shade of annoyance he felt good heavens he exclaimed such a day as this and a fellow refuses to come on the water well come along to the edge of the sea adrians angelic quality had quite worn off to him he never thought of devoting himself to make the most of the material there was but somebody else did and that fair somebody succeeded wonderfully in a few short hours she induced adrian to reflect that the baronet had only to see her and the family muddle would be smoothed at once he came to it by degrees still the gradations were rapid her manner he liked she was certainly a nice picture best of all she was sensible he forgot the farmers niece in her she was so very sensible she appeared really to understand that it was a womans duty to know how to cook but the difficulty was by what means the baronet could be brought to consent to see her he had not yet consented to see his son and adrian spurred by lady blandish had ventured something in coming down he was not inclined to venture more the small debate in his mind ended by his throwing the burden on time time would bring the matter about christians as well as pagans are in the habit of phrasing this excuse for folding their arms forgetful says the pilgrims scrip that the devils imps enter into no such armistice as she loitered along the shore with her amusing companion lucy had many things to think of there was her darlings match the yachts were started by pistolshot by lord mountfalcon on board the empress and her little heart beat after richards straining sails then there was the strangeness of walking with a relative of richards one who had lived by his side so long and the thought that perhaps this night she would have to appear before the dreaded father of her husband o mr harley she said is it trueare we to go tonight and me she faltered will he see me ah that is what i wanted to talk to you about said adrian i made some reply to our dear boy which he has slightly misinterpreted our second person plural is liable to misconstruction by an ardent mind i said see you and he supposednow mrs richard i am sure you will understand me just at present perhaps it would be advisablewhen the father and son have settled their accounts the daughterinlaw cant be a debtor lucy threw up her blue eyes a halfcowardly delight at the chance of a respite from the awful interview made her quickly apprehensive o mr harley you think he should go alone first well that is my notion but the fact is he is such an excellent husband that i fancy it will require more than a mans power of persuasion to get him to go but i will persuade him mr harley perhaps if you would there is nothing i would not do for his happiness murmured lucy the wise youth pressed her hand with lymphatic approbation they walked on till the yachts had rounded the point is it tonight mr harley she asked with some trouble in her voice now that her darling was out of sight i dont imagine your eloquence even will get him to leave you tonight adrian replied gallantly besides i must speak for myself to achieve the passage to an island is enough for one day no necessity exists for any hurry except in the brain of that impetuous boy you must correct it mrs richard men are made to be managed and women are born managers now if you were to let him know that you dont want to go tonight and let him guess after a day or two that you would very much rather you might affect a peculiar repugnance by taking it on yourself you see this wild young man will not require such frightful efforts of persuasion both his father and he are exceedingly delicate subjects and his father unfortunately is not in a position to be managed directly its a strange office to propose to you but it appears to devolve upon you to manage the father through the son prodigal having made his peace you who have done all the work from a distance naturally come into the circle of the paternal smile knowing it due to you i see no other way if richard suspects that his father objects for the present to welcome his daughterinlaw hostilities will be continued the breach will be widened bad will grow to worse and i see no end to it adrian looked in her face as much as to say now are you capable of this piece of heroism and it did seem hard to her that she should have to tell richard she shrank from any trial but the proposition chimed in with her fears and her wishes she thought the wise youth very wise the poor child was not insensible to his flattery and the subtler flattery of making herself in some measure a sacrifice to the home she had disturbed she agreed to simulate as adrian had suggested victory is the commonest heritage of the hero and when richard came on shore proclaiming that the blandish had beaten the begum by seven minutes and threequarters he was hastily kissed and congratulated by his bride with her fingers among the leaves of dr kitchener and anxiously questioned about wine dearest mr harley wants to stay with us a little and he thinks we ought not to go immediatelythat is before he has had some letters and i feel i would so much rather ah thats it you coward said richard well then tomorrow we had a splendid race did you see us oh yes i saw you and was sure my darling would win and again she threw on him the cold water of that solicitude about wine mr harley must have the best you know and we never drink it and im so silly i dont know good wine and if you would send tom where he can get good wine i have seen to the dinner so thats why you didnt come to meet me pardon me darling well i do but mountfalcon doesnt and lady judith thinks you ought to have been there ah but my heart was with you richard put his hand to feel for the little heart her eyelids softened and she ran away it is to say much of the dinner that adrian found no fault with it and was in perfect goodhumour at the conclusion of the service he did not abuse the wine they were able to procure for him which was also much the coffee too had the honour of passing without comment these were sound first steps toward the conquest of an epicure and as yet cupid did not grumble after coffee they strolled out to see the sun set from lady judiths grounds the wind had dropped the clouds had rolled from the zenith and ranged in amphitheatre with distant flushed bodies over sea and land titanic crimson head and chest rising from the wave faced hyperion falling there hung briareus with deepindented trunk and ravined brows stretching all his hands up to unattainable blue summits northwest the range had a rich white glow as if shining to the moon and westward streams of amber melting into upper rose shot out from the dipping disk what sandoe calls the passionflower of heaven said richard under his breath to adrian who was serenely chanting greek hexameters and answered in the swing of the caesura he might as well have said cauliflower lady judith with a black lace veil tied over her head met them in the walk she was tall and dark darkhaired darkeyed sweet and persuasive in her accent and manner a second edition of the blandish thinks adrian she welcomed him as one who had claims on her affability she kissed lucy protectingly and remarking on the wonders of the evening appropriated her husband adrian and lucy found themselves walking behind them the sun was under all the spaces of the sky were alight and richards fancy flamed so youre not intoxicated with your immense triumph this morning said lady judith dont laugh at me when its over i feel ashamed of the trouble ive taken look at that gloryim sure you despise me for it was i not there to applaud you i only think such energies should be turned into some definitely useful channel but you must not go into the army what else can i do you are fit for so much that is better i never can be anything like austin but i think you can do more well i thank you for thinking it lady judith something i will do a man must deserve to live as you say sauces adrian was heard to articulate distinctly in the rear sauces are the top tree of this science a woman who has mastered sauces sits on the apex of civilization briareus reddened duskily seaward the west was all a burning rose how can men see such sights as those and live idle richard resumed i feel ashamed of asking my men to work for meor i feel so now not when youre racing the begum i think theres no necessity for you to turn democrat like austin do you write now no what is writing like mine it doesnt deceive me i know its only the excuse im making to myself for remaining idle i havent written a line sincelately because you are so happy no not because of that of course im very happy he did not finish vague shapeless ambition had replaced love in yonder skies no scientific humanist was by to study the natural development and guide him this lady would hardly be deemed a very proper guide to the undirected energies of the youth yet they had established relations of that nature she was five years older than he and a woman which may explain her serene presumption the cloudgiants had broken up a brawny shoulder smouldered over the sea well work together in town at all events said richard why cant we go about together at night and find out people who want help lady judith smiled and only corrected his nonsense by saying i think we mustnt be too romantic you will become a knighterrant i suppose you have the characteristics of one especially at breakfast adrians unnecessarily emphatic gastronomical lessons to the young wife here came in you must be our champion continued lady judith the rescuer and succourer of distressed dames and damsels we want one badly you do said richard earnestly from what i hear from what i know his thoughts flew off with him as knighterrant hailed shrilly at exceeding critical moment by distressed dames and damsels images of airy towers hung around his fancy performed miraculous feats the towers crumbled the stars grew larger seemed to throb with lustre his fancy crumbled with the towers of the air his heart gave a leap he turned to lucy my darling what have you been doing and as if to compensate her for his little knighterrant infidelity he pressed very tenderly to her we have been engaged in a charming conversation on domestic cookery interposed adrian cookery such an evening as this his face was a handsome likeness of hippias at the presentation of bridecake dearest you know its very useful lucy mirthfully pleaded indeed i quite agree with you child said lady judith and i think you have the laugh of us i certainly will learn to cook some day womans mission in so many words ejaculated adrian and pray what is mans to taste thereof and pronounce thereupon let us give it up to them said lady judith to richard you and i never will make so delightful and beautifully balanced a world of it richard appeared to have grown perfectly willing to give everything up to the fair face his bridal hesper next day lucy had to act the coward anew and as she did so her heart sank to see how painfully it affected him that she should hesitate to go with him to his father he was patient gentle he sat down by her side to appeal to her reason and used all the arguments he could think of to persuade her if we go together and make him see us both if he sees he has nothing to be ashamed of in yourather everything to be proud of if you are only near him you will not have to speak a word and im certainas certain as that i livethat in a week we shall be settled happily at raynham i know my father so well lucy nobody knows him but i lucy asked whether mr harley did not adrian not a bit adrian only knows a part of people lucy and not the best part lucy was disposed to think more highly of the object of her conquest is it he that has been frightening you lucy no no richard oh dear no she cried and looked at him more tenderly because she was not quite truthful he doesnt know my father at all said richard but lucy had another opinion of the wise youth and secretly maintained it she could not be won to imagine the baronet a man of human mould generous forgiving full of passionate love at heart as richard tried to picture him and thought him now that he beheld him again through adrians embassy to her he was that awful figure shrouded by the midnight why are you so harsh she had heard richard cry more than once she was sure that adrian must be right well i tell you i wont go without you said richard and lucy begged for a little more time cupid now began to grumble and with cause adrian positively refused to go on the water unless that element were smooth as a plate the southwest still joked boisterously at any comparison of the sort the days were magnificent richard had yachting engagements and lucy always petitioned to stay to keep adrian company conceiving it her duty as hostess arguing with adrian was an absurd idea if richard hinted at his retaining lucy the wise youth would remark its a wholesome interlude to your extremely cupidinous behaviour my dear boy richard asked his wife what they could possibly find to talk about all manner of things said lucy not only cookery he is so amusing though he does make fun of the pilgrims scrip and i think he ought not and then do you know darlingyou wont think me vaini think he is beginning to like me a little richard laughed at the humble mind of his beauty doesnt everybody like you admire you doesnt lord mountfalcon and mr morton and lady judith but he is one of your family richard and they all will if she isnt a coward ah no she sighs and is chidden the conquest of an epicure or any young wifes conquest beyond her husband however loyally devised for their mutual happiness may be costly to her richard in his hours of excitement was thrown very much with lady judith he consulted her regarding what he termed lucys cowardice lady judith said i think shes wrong but you must learn to humour little women then would you advise me to go up alone he asked with a cloudy forehead what else can you do be reconciled yourself as quickly as you can you cant drag her like a captive you know it is not pleasant for a young husband fancying his bride the peerless flower of creation to learn that he must humour a little woman in her it was revolting to richard what i fear he said is that my father will make it smooth with me and not acknowledge her so that whenever i go to him i shall have to leave her and tit for tatan abominable existence like a ball on a billiardtable i wont bear that ignominy and this i know i know she might prevent it at once if she would only be brave and face it you you lady judith you wouldnt be a coward where my old lord tells me to go i go the lady coldly replied theres not much merit in that pray dont cite me women are born cowards you know but i love the women who are not cowards the little thingyour wife has not refused to go nobut tears who can stand tears lucy had come to drop them unaccustomed to have his will thwarted and urgent where he saw the thing to do so clearly the young husband had spoken strong words and she who knew that she would have given her life by inches for him who knew that she was playing a part for his happiness and hiding for his sake the nature that was worthy his esteem the poor little martyr had been weak a moment she had adrians support the wise youth was very comfortable he liked the air of the island and he liked being petted a nice little woman a very nice little woman tom bakewell heard him murmur to himself according to a habit he had and his air of rather succulent patronage as he walked or sat beside the innocent beauty with his head thrown back and a smile that seemed always to be in secret communion with his marked abdominal prominence showed that she was gaining part of what she played for wise youths who buy their loves are not unwilling when opportunity offers to try and obtain the commodity for nothing examinations of her hand as for some occult purpose and unctuous pattings of the same were not infrequent adrian waxed now and then anacreontic in his compliments lucy would say thats worse than lord mountfalcon better english than the noble lord deigns to employallow that quoth adrian he is very kind said lucy to all save to our noble vernacular added adrian he seems to scent a rival to his dignity there it may be that adrian scented a rival to his lymphatic emotions we are at our ease here in excellent society he wrote to lady blandish i am bound to confess that the huron has a happy fortune or a superlative instinct blindfold he has seized upon a suitable mate she can look at a lord and cook for an epicure besides dr kitchener she reads and comments on the pilgrims scrip the love chapter of course takes her fancy that picture of woman drawn by reverence and coloured by love she thinks beautiful and repeats it tossing up pretty eyes also the lovers petition give me purity to be worthy the good in her and grant her patience to reach the good in me tis quite taking to hear her lisp it be sure that i am repeating the petition i make her read me her choice passages she has not a bad voice the lady judith i spoke of is austins miss menteith married to the incapable old lord felle or fellow as the wits here call him lord mountfalcon is his cousin and herwhat she has been trying to find out but they have both got over their perplexity and act respectively the bad man reproved and the chaste counsellor a position in which our young couple found them and haply diverted its perils they had quite taken them in hand lady judith undertakes to cure the fair papist of a pretty modest trick of frowning and blushing when addressed and his lordship directs the exuberant energies of the original man tis thus we fulfil our destinies and are content sometimes they change pupils my lord educates the little dame and my lady the hope of raynham joy and blessings unto all as the german poet sings lady judith accepted the hand of her decrepit lord that she might be of potent service to her fellowcreatures austin you know had great hopes of her i have for the first time in my career a field of lords to study i think it is not without meaning that i am introduced to it by a yeomans niece the language of the two social extremes is similar i find it to consist in an instinctively lavish use of vowels and adjectives my lord and farmer blaize speak the same tongue only my lords has lost its backbone and is limp though fluent their pursuits are identical but that one has money or as the pilgrim terms it vantage and the other has not their ideas seem to have a special relationship in the peculiarity of stopping where they have begun young tom blaize with vantage would be lord mountfalcon even in the character of their parasites i see a resemblance though i am bound to confess that the hon peter brayder who is my lords parasite is by no means noxious this sounds dreadfully democrat pray dont be alarmed the discovery of the affinity between the two extremes of the royal british oak has made me thrice conservative i see now that the national love of a lord is less subservience than a form of selflove putting a goldlace hat on ones image as it were to bow to it i see too the admirable wisdom of our systemcould there be a finer balance of power than in a community where men intellectually nil have lawful vantage and a goldlace hat on how soothing it is to intellectthat noble rebel as the pilgrim has itto stand and bow and know itself superior this exquisite compensation maintains the balance whereas that period anticipated by the pilgrim when science shall have produced an intellectual aristocracy is indeed horrible to contemplate for what despotism is so black as one the mind cannot challenge twill be an iron age wherefore madam i cry and shall continue to cry vive lord mountfalcon long may he sip his burgundy long may the baconfed carry him on their shoulders mr morton who does me the honour to call me young mephisto and socrates missed leaves tomorrow to get master ralph out of a scrape our richard has just been elected member of a club for the promotion of nausea is he happy you ask as much so as one who has had the misfortune to obtain what he wanted can be speed is his passion he races from point to point in emulation of leander and don juan he swam i hear to the opposite shores the other day or some worldshaking feat of the sort himself the hero whom he went to meet or as they who pun say his hero was a bet a pretty little domestic episode occurred this morning he finds her abstracted in the fire of his caresses she turns shy and seeks solitude green jealousy takes hold of him he lies in wait and discovers her with his new rivala veteran edition of the culinary doctor blind to the doctors great national services deaf to her wild music he grasps the intruder dismembers him and performs upon him the treatment he has recommended for dressed cucumber tears and shrieks accompany the descent of the gastronome down she rushes to secure the cherished fragments he follows they find him true to his character alighted and straggling over a bed of blooming flowers yet ere a fairer flower can gather him a heel black as pluto stamps him into earth flowers and allhappy burial pathetic tribute to his merit is watering his grave when by saunters my lord mountfalcon whats the mattah says his lordship soothing his moustache they break apart and tis left to me to explain from the window my lord looks shocked richard is angry with her for having to be ashamed of himself beauty dries her eyes and after a pause of general foolishness the business of life is resumed i may add that the doctor has just been dug up and we are busy in the enemys absence renewing old aeson with enchanted threads by the way a papist priest has blest them a month had passed when adrian wrote this letter he was very comfortable so of course he thought time was doing his duty not a word did he say of richards return and for some reason or other neither richard nor lucy spoke of it now lady blandish wrote back his father thinks he has refused to come to him by your utter silence on the subject i fear that it must be so make him come bring him by force insist on his coming is he mad he must come at once to this adrian replied after a contemplative comfortable lapse of a day or two which might be laid to his efforts to adopt the ladys advice the point is that the half man declines to come without the whole man the terrible question of sex is our obstruction lady blandish was in despair she had no positive assurance that the baronet would see his son the mask put them all in the dark but she thought she saw in sir austin irritation that the offender at least when the opening to come and make his peace seemed to be before him should let days and weeks go by she saw through the mask sufficiently not to have any hope of his consenting to receive the couple at present she was sure that his equanimity was fictitious but she pierced no farther or she might have started and asked herself is this the heart of a woman the lady at last wrote to richard she said come instantly and come alone then richard against his judgment gave way my father is not the man i thought him he exclaimed sadly and lucy felt his eyes saying to her and you too are not the woman i thought you nothing could the poor little heart reply but strain to his bosom and sleeplessly pray in his arms all the night chapter xxxv three weeks after richard arrived in town his cousin clare was married under the blessings of her energetic mother and with the approbation of her kinsfolk to the husband that had been expeditiously chosen for her the gentleman though something more than twice the age of his bride had no idea of approaching senility for many long connubial years to come backed by his tailor and his hairdresser he presented no such bad figure at the altar and none would have thought that he was an ancient admirer of his brides mama as certainly none knew he had lately proposed for mrs doria before there was any question of her daughter these things were secrets and the elastic and happy appearance of mr john todhunter did not betray them at the altar perhaps he would rather have married the mother he was a man of property well born tolerably well educated and had when mrs doria rejected him for the first time the reputation of being a foolwhich a wealthy man may have in his youth but as he lived on and did not squander his moneyamassed it on the contrary and did not seek to go into parliament and did other negative wise things the worlds opinion as usual veered completely round and john todhunter was esteemed a shrewd sensible manonly not brilliant that he was brilliant could not be said of him in fact the man could hardly talk and it was a fortunate provision that no impromptu deliveries were required of him in the marriageservice mrs doria had her own reasons for being in a hurry she had discovered something of the strange impassive nature of her child not from any confession of clares but from signs a mother can read when her eyes are not resolutely shut she saw with alarm and anguish that clare had fallen into the pit she had been digging for her so laboriously in vain she entreated the baronet to break the disgraceful and as she said illegal alliance his son had contracted sir austin would not even stop the little pension to poor berry at least you will do that austin she begged pathetically you will show your sense of that horrid womans conduct he refused to offer up any victim to console her then mrs doria told him her thoughtsand when an outraged energetic lady is finally brought to exhibit these painfully hoarded treasures she does not use half words as a medium his system and his conduct generally were denounced to him without analysis she let him understand that the world laughed at him and he heard this from her at a time when his mask was still soft and liable to be acted on by his nerves you are weak austin weak i tell you she said and like all angry and selfinterested people prophecy came easy to her in her heart she accused him of her own fault in imputing to him the wreck of her project the baronet allowed her to revel in the proclamation of a dire future and quietly counselled her to keep apart from him which his sister assured him she would do but to be passive in calamity is the province of no woman mark the race at any hour what revolution and hubbub does not that little instrument the needle avert from us says the pilgrims scrip alas that in calamity women cannot stitch now that she saw clare wanted other than iron it struck her she must have a husband and be made secure as a woman and a wife this seemed the thing to do and as she had forced the iron down clares throat so she forced the husband and clare gulped at the latter as she had at the former on the very day that mrs doria had this new track shaped out before her john todhunter called at the foreys old john sang out mrs doria show him up to me i want to see him particularly he sat with her alone he was a man multitudes of women would have marriedwhom will they notand who would have married any presentable woman but women do want asking and john never had the word the rape of such men is left to the practical animal so john sat alone with his old flame he had become resigned to her perpetual lamentation and living suttee for his defunct rival but ha what meant those soft glances nowaddressed to him his tailor and his hairdresser gave youth to john but they had not the art to bestow upon him distinction and an undistinguished man what woman looks at john was an indistinguishable man for that reason he was dry wood to a soft glance and now she said it is time you should marry and you are the man to be the guide and helper of a young woman john you are well preservedyounger than most of the young men of our day you are eminently domestic a good son and will be a good husband and good father some one you must marrywhat do you think of clare for a wife for you at first john todhunter thought it would be very much like his marrying a baby however he listened to it and that was enough for mrs doria she went down to johns mother and consulted with her on the propriety of the scheme of wedding her daughter to john in accordance with his proposition mrs todhunters jealousy of any disturbing force in the influence she held over her son mrs doria knew to be one of the causes of johns remaining constant to the impression she had aforetime produced on him she spoke so kindly of john and laid so much stress on the ingrained obedience and passive disposition of her daughter that mrs todhunter was led to admit she did think it almost time john should be seeking a mate and that heall things consideredwould hardly find a fitter one and this john todhunterold john no moreheard to his amazement when a day or two subsequently he instanced the probable disapproval of his mother the match was arranged mrs doria did the wooing it consisted in telling clare that she had come to years when marriage was desirable and that she had fallen into habits of moping which might have the worse effect on her future life as it had on her present health and appearance and which a husband would cure richard was told by mrs doria that clare had instantaneously consented to accept mr john todhunter as lord of her days and with more than obediencewith alacrity at all events when richard spoke to clare the strange passive creature did not admit constraint on her inclinations mrs doria allowed richard to speak to her she laughed at his futile endeavours to undo her work and the boyish sentiments he uttered on the subject let us see child she said let us see which turns out the best a marriage of passion or a marriage of common sense heroic efforts were not wanting to arrest the union richard made repeated journeys to hounslow where ralph was quartered and if ralph could have been persuaded to carry off a young lady who did not love him from the bridegroom her mother averred she did love mrs doria might have been defeated but ralph in his cavalry quarters was cooler than ralph in the bursley meadows women are oddities dick he remarked running a finger right and left along his upper lip best leave them to their own freaks shes a dear girl though she doesnt talk i like her for that if she cared for me id go the race she never did its no use asking a girl twice she knows whether she cares a fig for a fellow the hero quitted him with some contempt as ralph morton was a young man and he had determined that john todhunter was an old man he sought another private interview with clare and getting her alone said clare ive come to you for the last time will you marry ralph morton to which clare replied i cannot marry two husbands richard will you refuse to marry this old man i must do as mama wishes then youre going to marry an old mana man you dont love and cant love oh good god do you know what youre doing he flung about in a fury do you know what it is clare he caught her two hands violently have you any idea of the horror youre going to commit she shrank a little at his vehemence but neither blushed nor stammered answering i see nothing wrong in doing what mama thinks right richard your mother i tell you its an infamy clare its a miserable sin i tell you if i had done such a thing i would not live an hour after it and coldly to prepare for it to be busy about your dresses they told me when i came in that you were with the milliner to be smiling over the horrible outrage decorating yourself dear richard said clare you will make me very unhappy that one of my blood should be so debased he cried brushing angrily at his face unhappy i beg you to feel for yourself clare but i suppose and he said it scornfully girls dont feel this sort of shame she grew a trifle paler next to mama i would wish to please you dear richard have you no will of your own he exclaimed she looked at him softly a look he interpreted for the meekness he detested in her no i believe you have none he added and what can i do i cant step forward and stop this accursed marriage if you would but say a word i would save you but you tie my hands and they expect me to stand by and see it done will you not be there richard said clare following the question with her soft eyes it was the same voice that had so thrilled him on his marriage morn oh my darling clare he cried in the kindest way he had ever used to her if you knew how i feel this and now as he wept she wept and came insensibly into his arms my darling clare he repeated she said nothing but seemed to shudder weeping you will do it clare you will be sacrificed so lovely as you are too clare you cannot be quite blind if i dared speak to you and tell you all look up can you still consent i must not disobey mama clare murmured without looking up from the nest her cheek had made on his bosom then kiss me for the last time said richard ill never kiss you after it clare he bent his head to meet her mouth and she threw her arms wildly round him and kissed him convulsively and clung to his lips shutting her eyes her face suffused with a burning red then he left her unaware of the meaning of those passionate kisses argument with mrs doria was like firing paperpellets against a stone wall to her indeed the young married hero spoke almost indecorously and that which his delicacy withheld him from speaking to clare he could provoke nothing more responsive from the practical animal than poohpooh tush tush and fiddlededee really mrs doria said to her intimates that boys education acts like a disease on him he cannot regard anything sensibly he is for ever in some mad excess of his fancy and what he will come to at last heaven only knows i sincerely pray that austin will be able to bear it threats of prayer however that harp upon their sincerity are not very well worth having mrs doria had embarked in a practical controversy as it were with her brother doubtless she did trust he would be able to bear his sorrows to come but one who has uttered prophecy can barely help hoping to see it fulfilled she had prophecied much grief to the baronet poor john todhunter who would rather have married the mother and had none of your heroic notions about the sacred necessity for love in marriage moved as one guiltless of offence and deserving his happiness mrs doria shielded him from the hero to see him smile at clares obedient figure and try not to look paternal was touching meantime clares marriage served one purpose it completely occupied richards mind and prevented him from chafing at the vexation of not finding his father ready to meet him when he came to town a letter had awaited adrian at the hotel which said detain him till you hear further from me take him about with you into every form of society no more than that adrian had to extemporize that the baronet had gone down to wales on pressing business and would be back in a week or so for ulterior inventions and devices wherewith to keep the young gentleman in town he applied to mrs doria leave him to me said mrs doria ill manage him and she did who can say asks the pilgrims scrip when he is not walking a puppet to some woman mrs doria would hear no good of lucy i believe she observed as adrian ventured a shrugging protest in her behalfit is my firm opinion that a scullerymaid would turn any of you men round her little fingeronly give her time and opportunity by dwelling on the arts of women she reconciled it to her conscience to do her best to divide the young husband from his wife till it pleased his father they should live their unhallowed union again without compunction or a sense of incongruity she abused her brother and assisted the fulfilment of his behests so the puppets were marshalled by mrs doria happy or sad or indifferent quite against his set resolve and the tide of his feelings richard found himself standing behind clare in the churchthe very edifice that had witnessed his own marriage and heard i clare doria take thee john pemberton clearly pronounced he stood with black brows dissecting the arts of the tailor and hairdresser on unconscious john the back and much of the middle of mr todhunters head was bald the back shone like an eggshell but across the middle the artist had drawn two long dabs of hair from the sides and plastered them cunningly so that all save wilful eyes would have acknowledged the head to be covered the mans only pretension was to a respectable juvenility he had a good chest stout limbs a face inclined to be jolly mrs doria had no cause to be put out of countenance at all by the exterior of her soninlaw nor was she her splendid hair and gratified smile made a light in the church playing puppets must be an immense pleasure to the practical animal the forey bridesmaids five in number and one miss doria their cousin stood as girls do stand at these sacrifices whether happy sad or indifferent a smile on their lips and tears in attendance old mrs todhunter an exceedingly small ancient woman was also there i cant have my boy john married without seeing it done she said and throughout the ceremony she was muttering audible encomiums on her johns manly behaviour the ring was affixed to clares finger there was no ring lost in this commonsense marriage the instant the clergyman bade him employ it john drew the ring out and dropped it on the finger of the cold passive hand in a businesslike way as one who had studied the matter mrs doria glanced aside at richard richard observed clare spread out her fingers that the operation might be the more easily effected he did duty in the vestry a few minutes and then said to his aunt now ill go youll come to the breakfast child the foreys he cut her short ive stood for the family and ill do no more i wont pretend to eat and make merry over it richard goodbye she had attained her object and she wisely gave way well go and kiss clare and shake his hand pray pray be civil she turned to adrian and said he is going you must go with him and find some means of keeping him or hell be running off to that woman now no wordsgo richard bade clare farewell she put up her mouth to him humbly but he kissed her on the forehead do not cease to love me she said in a quavering whisper in his ear mr todhunter stood beaming and endangering the art of the hairdresser with his pockethandkerchief now he positively was married he thought he would rather have the daughter than the mother which is a reverse of the order of human thankfulness at a gift of the gods richard my boy he said heartily congratulate me i should be happy to if i could sedately replied the hero to the consternation of those around nodding to the bridesmaids and bowing to the old lady he passed out adrian who had been behind him deputed to watch for a possible unpleasantness just hinted to john you know poor fellow he has got into a mess with his marriage oh ah yes kindly said john poor fellow all the puppets then rolled off to the breakfast adrian hurried after richard in an extremely discontented state of mind not to be at the breakfast and see the best of the fun disgusted him however he remembered that he was a philosopher and the strong disgust he felt was only expressed in concentrated cynicism on every earthly matter engendered by the conversation they walked side by side into kensington gardens the hero was mouthing away to himself talking by fits presently he faced adrian crying and i might have stopped it i see it now i might have stopped it by going straight to him and asking him if he dared marry a girl who did not love him and i never thought of it good heaven i feel this miserable affair on my conscience ah groaned adrian an unpleasant cargo for the conscience that i would rather carry anything on mine than a married couple do you purpose going to him now the hero soliloquized hes not a bad sort of man well hes not a cavalier said adrian and thats why you wonder your aunt selected him no doubt hes decidedly of the roundhead type with the puritan extracted or inoffensive if latent theres the double infamy cried richard that a man you cant call bad should do this damned thing well its hard we cant find a villain he would have listened to me im sure go to him now richard my son go to him now its not yet too late who knows if he really has a noble elevated superior mindthough not a cavalier in person he may be one at hearthe might to please you and since you put such stress upon it abstainperhaps with some loss of dignity but never mind and the request might be singular or seem so but everything has happened before in this world you know my dear boy and what an infinite consolation it is for the eccentric that reflection the hero was impervious to the wise youth he stared at him as if he were but a speck in the universe he visioned it was provoking that richard should be adrians best subject for cynical pastime in the extraordinary heterodoxies he started and his worst in the way he took it and the wise youth against his will had to feel as conscious of the young mans imaginative mental armour as he was of his muscular physical the same sort of day mused richard looking up i suppose my fathers right we make our own fates and nature has nothing to do with it adrian yawned some difference in the trees though richard continued abstractedly growing bald at the top said adrian will you believe that my aunt helen compared the conduct of that wretched slave clare to lucys who she had the cruel insolence to say entangled me into marriage the hero broke out loudly and rapidly you knowi told you adrianhow i had to threaten and insist and how she pleaded and implored me to wait ah hum mumbled adrian you remember my telling you richard was earnest to hear her exonerated pleaded and implored my dear boy oh no doubt she did wheres the lass that doesnt call my wife by another name if you please the generic title cant be cancelled because of your having married one of the body my son she did all she could to persuade me to wait emphasized richard adrian shook his head with a deplorable smile come come my good ricky not all not all richard bellowed what more could she have done she could have shaved her head for instance this happy shaft did stick with a furious exclamation richard shot in front adrian following him and asking him merely to have his assumption verified whether he did not think she might have shaved her head and presuming her to have done so whether in candour he did not think he would have waitedat least till she looked less of a rank lunatic after a minute or so the wise youth was but a fly buzzing about richards head three weeks of separation from lucy and an excitement deceased caused him to have soft yearnings for the dear lovely homeface he told adrian it was his intention to go down that night adrian immediately became serious he was at a loss what to invent to detain him beyond the stale fiction that his father was coming tomorrow he rendered homage to the genius of woman in these straits my aunt he thought would have the lie ready and not only that but she would take care it did its work at this juncture the voice of a cavalier in the row hailed them proving to be the honourable peter brayder lord mountfalcons parasite he greeted them very cordially and richard remembering some fun they had in the island asked him to dine with them postponing his return till the next day lucy was his it was even sweet to dally with the delight of seeing her the hon peter was one who did honour to the body he belonged to though not so tall as a west of london footman he was as shapely and he had a power of making his voice insinuating or arrogant as it suited the exigencies of his profession he had not a rap of money in the world yet he rode a horse lived high expended largely the world said that the hon peter was salaried by his lordship and that in common with that of parasite he exercised the ancient companion profession this the world said and still smiled at the hon peter for he was an engaging fellow and where he went not lord mountfalcon would not go they had a quiet little hotel dinner ordered by adrian and made a square at the table ripton thompson being the fourth richard sent down to his office to fetch him and the two friends shook hands for the first time since the great deed had been executed deep was the old dogs delight to hear the praises of his beauty sounded by such aristocratic lips as the hon peter brayders all through the dinner he was throwing out hints and small queries to get a fuller account of her and when the claret had circulated he spoke a word or two himself and heard the hon peter eulogize his taste and wish him a bride as beautiful at which ripton blushed and said he had no hope of that and the hon peter assured him marriage did not break the mould after the wine this gentleman took his cigar on the balcony and found occasion to get some conversation with adrian alone our young friend heremade it all right with the governor he asked carelessly oh yes said adrian but it struck him that brayder might be of assistance in showing richard a little of the society in every form required by his chiefs prescript that is he continued we are not yet permitted an interview with the august author of our being and i have rather a difficult post tis mine both to keep him here and also to find him the opportunity to measure himself with his fellowman in other words his father wants him to see something of life before he enters upon housekeeping now i am proud to confess that im hardly equal to the task the demi or damnedmondeif its that he wants him to observeis one that i have not got the walk to ha ha laughed brayder you do the keeping i offer to parade the demi i must say though its a queer notion of the old gentleman its the continuation of a philosophic plan said adrian brayder followed the curvings of the whiff of his cigar with his eyes and ejaculated infernally philosophic has lord mountfalcon left the island adrian inquired mount to tell the truth i dont know where he is chasing some light craft i suppose thats poor mounts weakness its his ruin poor fellow hes so confoundedly in earnest at the game he ought to know it by this time if fame speaks true remarked adrian hes a baby about women and always will be said brayder hes been once or twice wanting to marry them now theres a womanyouve heard of mrs mount all the world knows herif that woman hadnt scandalizedthe young man joined them and checked the communication brayder winked to adrian and pitifully indicated the presence of an innocent a married man you know said adrian yes yeswe wont shock him brayder observed he appeared to study the young man while they talked next morning richard was surprised by a visit from his aunt mrs doria took a seat by his side and spoke as follows my dear nephew now you know i have always loved you and thought of your welfare as if you had been my own child more than that i fear well now you are thinking of returning toto that placeare you not yes it is as i thought very well now let me speak to you you are in a much more dangerous position than you imagine i dont deny your fathers affection for you it would be absurd to deny it but you are of an age now to appreciate his character whatever you may do he will always give you money that you are sure of that you know very well but you are one to want more than money you want his love richard i am convinced you will never be happy whatever base pleasures you may be led into if he should withhold his love from you now child you know you have grievously offended him i wish not to animadvert on your conductyou fancied yourself in love and so on and you were rash the less said of it the better now but you must nowit is your duty now to do somethingto do everything that lies in your power to show him you repent no interruptions listen to me you must consider him austin is not like other men austin requires the most delicate management you mustwhether you feel it or nopresent an appearance of contrition i counsel it for the good of all he is just like a woman and where his feelings are offended he wants utter subservience he has you in town and he does not see younow you know that he and i are not in communication we have likewise our differenceswell he has you in town and he holds aloofhe is trying you my dear richard no he is not at raynham i do not know where he is he is trying you child and you must be patient you must convince him that you do not care utterly for your own gratification if this personi wish to speak of her with respect for your sakewell if she loves you at allif i say she loves you one atom she will repeat my solicitations for you to stay and patiently wait here till he consents to see you i tell you candidly its your only chance of ever getting him to receive her that you should know and now richard i may add that there is something else you should know you should know that it depends entirely upon your conduct now whether you are to see your fathers heart for ever divided from you and a new family at raynham you do not understand i will explain brothers and sisters are excellent things for young people but a new brood of them can hardly be acceptable to a young man in fact they are and must be aliens i only tell you what i have heard on good authority dont you understand now foolish boy if you do not humour him he will marry her oh i am sure of it i know it and this you will drive him to i do not warn you on the score of your prospects but of your feelings i should regard such a contingency richard as a final division between you think of the scandal but alas that is the least of the evils it was mrs dorias object to produce an impression and avoid an argument she therefore left him as soon as she had as she supposed made her mark on the young man richard was very silent during the speech and save for an exclamation or so had listened attentively he pondered on what his aunt said he loved lady blandish and yet he did not wish to see her lady feverel mrs doria laid painful stress on the scandal and though he did not give his mind to this he thought of it he thought of his mother where was she but most his thoughts recurred to his father and something akin to jealousy slowly awakened his heart to him he had given him up and had not latterly felt extremely filial but he could not bear the idea of a division in the love of which he had ever been the idol and sole object and such a man too so good so generous if it was jealousy that roused the young mans heart to his father the better part of love was also revived in it he thought of old days of his fathers forbearance his own wilfulness he looked on himself and what he had done with the eyes of such a man he determined to do all he could to regain his favour mrs doria learnt from adrian in the evening that her nephew intended waiting in town another week that will do smiled mrs doria he will be more patient at the end of a week oh does patience beget patience said adrian i was not aware it was a propagating virtue i surrender him to you i shant be able to hold him in after one week more i assure you my dear aunt hes already thank you no explanation mrs doria begged when richard saw her next he was informed that she had received a most satisfactory letter from mrs john todhunter quite a glowing account of johns behaviour but on richards desiring to know the words clare had written mrs doria objected to be explicit and shot into worldly gossip clare seldom glows said richard no i mean for her his aunt remarked dont look like your father child i should like to have seen the letter said richard mrs doria did not propose to show it chapter xxxvi a lady driving a pair of greys was noticed by richard in his rides and walks she passed him rather obviously and often she was very handsome a bold beauty with shining black hair red lips and eyes not afraid of men the hair was brushed from her temples leaving one of those fine reckless outlines which the action of driving and the pace admirably set off she took his fancy he liked the air of petulant gallantry about her and mused upon the picture rare to him of a glorious dashing woman he thought too she looked at him he was not at the time inclined to be vain or he might have been sure she did once it struck him she nodded slightly he asked adrian one day in the parkwho she was i dont know her said adrian probably a superior priestess of paphos now thats my idea of bellona richard exclaimed not the fury they paint but a spirited dauntless eagerlooking creature like that bellona returned the wise youth i dont think her hair was black red wasnt it i shouldnt compare her to bellona though no doubt shes as ready to spill blood look at her she does seem to scent carnage i see your idea no i should liken her to diana emerged from the tutorship of master endymion and at nice play among the gods depend upon itthey tell us nothing of the matterolympus shrouds the storybut you may be certain that when she left the pretty shepherd she had greater vogue than venus up aloft brayder joined them see mrs mount go by he said oh thats mrs mount cried adrian whos mrs mount richard inquired a sister to miss random my dear boy like to know her drawled the hon peter richard replied indifferently no and mrs mount passed out of sight and out of the conversation the young man wrote submissive letters to his father i have remained here waiting to see you now five weeks he wrote i have written to you three letters and you do not reply to them let me tell you again how sincerely i desire and pray that you will come or permit me to come to you and throw myself at your feet and beg my forgiveness and hers she as earnestly implores it indeed i am very wretched sir believe me there is nothing i would not do to regain your esteem and the love i fear i have unhappily forfeited i will remain another week in the hope of hearing from you or seeing you i beg of you sir not to drive me mad whatever you ask of me i will consent to nothing he would not do the baronet commented as he read there is nothing he would not do he will remain another week and give me that final chance and it is i who drive him mad already he is beginning to cast his retribution on my shoulders sir austin had really gone down to wales to be out of the way a shaddockdogmatist does not meet misfortune without hearing of it and the author of the pilgrims scrip in trouble found london too hot for him he quitted london to take refuge among the mountains living there in solitary commune with a virgin notebook some indefinite scheme was in his head in this treatment of his son had he construed it it would have looked ugly and it settled to a vague principle that the young man should be tried and tested let him learn to deny himself something let him live with his equals for a term if he loves me he will read my wishes thus he explained his principle to lady blandish the lady wrote you speak of a term till when may i name one to him it is the dreadful uncertainty that reduces him to despair that and nothing else pray be explicit in return he distantly indicated richards majority how could lady blandish go and ask the young man to wait a year away from his wife her instinct began to open a wide eye on the idol she worshipped when people do not themselves know what they mean they succeed in deceiving and imposing upon others not only was lady blandish mystified mrs doria who pierced into the recesses of everybodys mind and had always been in the habit of reading off her brother from infancy and had never known herself to be once wrong about him she confessed she was quite at a loss to comprehend austins principle for principle he has said mrs doria he never acts without one but what it is i cannot at present perceive if he would write and command the boy to await his return all would be clear he allows us to go and fetch him and then leaves us all in a quandary it must be some womans influence that is the only way to account for it singular interjected adrian what pride women have in their sex well i have to tell you my dear aunt that the day after tomorrow i hand my charge over to your keeping i cant hold him in an hour longer ive had to leash him with lies till my inventions exhausted i petition to have them put down to the chiefs account but when the stream runs dry i can do no more the last was that i had heard from him desiring me to have the southwest bedroom ready for him on tuesday proximate so says my son ill wait till then and from the gigantic effort he exhibited in coming to it i doubt any human powers getting him to wait longer we must we must detain him said mrs doria if we do not i am convinced austin will do something rash that he will for ever repent he will marry that woman adrian mark my words now with any other young man but richards education that ridiculous system has he no distraction nothing to amuse him poor boy i suppose he wants his own particular playfellow the wise youth had to bow to a reproof i tell you adrian he will marry that woman my dear aunt can a chaste man do aught more commendable has the boy no object we can induce him to followif he had but a profession what say you to the regeneration of the streets of london and the profession of moralscavenger aunt i assure you i have served a months apprenticeship with him we sally forth on the tenth hour of the night a female passes i hear him groan is she one of them adrian i am compelled to admit she is not the saint he deems it the portion of every creature wearing petticoats to be another groan an evident internal it cannot beand yetthat we hear on the stage rollings of eyes impious questionings of the creator of the universe savage mutterings against brutal males and then we meet a second young person and repeat the performanceof which i am rather tired it would be all very well but he turns upon me and lectures me because i dont hire a house and furnish it for all the women one meets to live in in purity now thats too much to ask of a quiet man master thompson has latterly relieved me im happy to say mrs doria thought her thoughts has austin written to you since you were in town not an aphorism returned adrian i must see richard tomorrow morning mrs doria ended the colloquy by saying the result of her interview with her nephew was that richard made no allusion to a departure on the tuesday and for many days afterward he appeared to have an absorbing business on his hands but what it was adrian did not then learn and his admiration of mrs dorias genius for management rose to a very high pitch on a morning in october they had an early visitor in the person of the hon peter whom they had not seen for a week or more gentlemen he said flourishing his cane in his most affable manner ive come to propose to you to join us in a little dinnerparty at richmond nobodys in town you know londons as dead as a stockfish nothing but the scrapings to offer you but the weathers fine i flatter myself youll find the company agreeable what says my friend feverel richard begged to be excused no no positively you must come said the hon peter ive had some trouble to get them together to relieve the dulness of your incarceration richmonds within the rules of your prison you can be back by night moonlight on the waterlovely woman weve engaged a citybarge to pull us back eight oarsim not sure it isnt sixteen comethe word adrian was for going richard said he had an appointment with ripton youre in for another rick you two said adrian arrange that we go you havent seen the cockneys paradise abjure blazes and taste of peace my son after some persuasion richard yawned wearily and got up and threw aside the care that was on him saying very well just as you like well take old rip with us adrian consulted brayders eye at this the hon peter briskly declared he should be delighted to have feverels friend and offered to take them all down in his drag if you dont get a match on to swim there with the tideeh feverel my boy richard replied that he had given up that sort of thing at which brayder communicated a queer glance to adrian and applauded the youth richmond was under a still october sun the pleasant landscape bathed in autumn stretched from the foot of the hill to a red horizon haze the day was like none that richard vividly remembered it touched no link in the chain of his recollection it was quiet and belonged to the spirit of the season adrian had divined the character of the scrapings they were to meet brayder introduced them to one or two of the men hastily and in rather an undervoice as a thing to get over they made their bow to the first knot of ladies they encountered propriety was observed strictly even to severity the general talk was of the weather here and there a lady would seize a buttonhole or any little bit of the habiliments of the man she was addressing and if it came to her to chide him she did it with more than a forefinger this however was only here and there and a privilege of intimacy where ladies are gathered together the queen of the assemblage may be known by her court of males the queen of the present gathering leaned against a corner of the open window surrounded by a stalwart court in whom a practised eye would have discerned guardsmen and ripton with a sinking of the heart apprehended lords they were fine men offering inanimate homage the trim of their whiskerage the cut of their coats the highbred indolence in their aspect eclipsed riptons sense of selfesteem but they kindly looked over him occasionally one committed a momentary outrage on him with an eyeglass seeming to cry out in a voice of scathing scorn whos this and ripton got closer to his hero to justify his humble pretensions to existence and an identity in the shadow of him richard gazed about heroes do not always know what to say or do and the cold bath before dinner in strange company is one of the instances he had recognized his superb bellona in the lady by the garden window for brayder the men had nods and yokes the ladies a pretty playfulness he was very busy passing between the groups chatting laughing taking the feminine taps he received and sometimes returning them in sly whispers adrian sat down and crossed his legs looking amused and benignant whose dinner is it ripton heard a mignonne beauty ask of a cavalier mounts i suppose was the answer where is he why dont he come an affaire i fancy there he is again how shamefully he treats mrs mount she dont seem to cry over it mrs mount was flashing her teeth and eyes with laughter at one of her court who appeared to be fool dinner was announced the ladies proclaimed extravagant appetites brayder posted his three friends ripton found himself under the lee of a dame with a bosom on the other side of him was the mignonne adrian was at the lower end of the table ladies were in profusion and he had his share brayder drew richard from seat to seat a happy man had established himself next to mrs mount him brayder hailed to take the head of the table the happy man objected brayder continued urgent the lady tenderly insisted the happy man grimaced dropped into the post of honour strove to look placable richard usurped his chair and was not badly welcomed by his neighbour then the dinner commenced and had all the attention of the company till the flying of the first champagnecork gave the signal and a hum began to spread sparkling wine that looseneth the tongue and displayeth the verity hath also the quality of colouring it the ladies laughed high richard only thought them gay and natural they flung back in their chairs and laughed to tears ripton thought only of the pleasure he had in their society the champagnecorks continued a regular filefiring where have you been lately i havent seen you in the park said mrs mount to richard no he replied ive not been there the question seemed odd she spoke so simply that it did not impress him he emptied his glass and had it filled again the hon peter did most of the open talking which related to horses yachting opera and sport generally who was ruined by what horse or by what woman he told one or two of richards feats fair smiles rewarded the hero do you bet said mrs mount only on myself returned richard bravo cried his bellona and her eye sent a lingering delirious sparkle across her brimming glass at him im sure youre a safe one to back she added and seemed to scan his points approvingly richards cheeks mounted bloom dont you adore champagne quoth the dame with a bosom to ripton oh yes answered ripton with more candour than accuracy i always drink it do you indeed said the enraptured bosom ogling him you would be a friend now i hope you dont object to a lady joining you now and then champagnes my folly a laugh was circling among the ladies of whom adrian was the centre first low and as he continued some narration peals resounded till those excluded from the fun demanded the cue and ladies leaned behind gentlemen to take it up and formed an electric chain of laughter each one as her ear received it caught up her handkerchief and laughed and looked shocked afterwards or looked shocked and then spouted laughter the anecdote might have been communicated to the bewildered cavaliers but coming to a lady of a demurer cast she looked shocked without laughing and reproved the female table in whose breasts it was consigned to burial but here and there a mans head was seen bent and a ladys mouth moved though her face was not turned toward him and a mans broad laugh was presently heard while the lady gazed unconsciously before her and preserved her gravity if she could escape any other ladys eyes failing in which handkerchiefs were simultaneously seized and a second chime arose till the tickling force subsided to a few chance bursts what nonsense it is that my father writes about women thought richard he says they cant laugh and dont understand humour it comes he reflected of his shutting himself from the world and the idea that he was seeing the world and feeling wiser flattered him he talked fluently to his dangerous bellona he gave her some reminiscences of adrians whimsies oh said she thats your tutor is it she eyed the young man as if she thought he must go far and fast ripton felt a push look at that said the bosom fuming utter disgust he was directed to see a manly arm round the waist of the mignonne now thats what i dont like in company the bosom inflated to observe with sufficient emphasis she always will allow it with everybody give her a nudge ripton protested that he dared not upon which she said then i will and inclined her sumptuous bust across his lap breathing wine in his face and gave the nudge the mignonne turned an inquiring eye on ripton a mischievous spark shot from it she laughed and said arent you satisfied with the old girl impudence muttered the bosom growing grander and redder do do fill her glass and keep her quietshe drinks port when theres no more champagne said the mignonne the bosom revenged herself by whispering to ripton scandal of the mignonne and between them he was enabled to form a correcter estimate of the company and quite recovered from his original awe so much so as to feel a touch of jealousy at seeing his lively little neighbour still held in absolute possession mrs mount did not come out much but there was a deferential manner in the bearing of the men toward her which those haughty creatures accord not save to clever women and she contrived to hold the talk with three or four at the head of the table while she still had passages aside with richard the port and claret went very well after the champagne the ladies here did not ignominiously surrender the field to the gentlemen they maintained their position with honour silver was seen far out on thames the wine ebbed and the laughter sentiment and cigars took up the wondrous tale oh what a lovely night said the ladies looking above charming said the gentlemen looking below the faintsmelling cool autumn air was pleasant after the feast fragrant weeds burned bright about the garden we are split into couples said adrian to richard who was standing alone eying the landscape tis the influence of the moon apparently we are in cyprus how has my son enjoyed himself how likes he the society of aspasia i feel like a wise greek tonight adrian was jolly and rolled comfortably as he talked ripton had been carried off by the sentimental bosom he came up to them and whispered by jove ricky do you know what sort of women these are richard said he thought them a nice sort puritan exclaimed adrian slapping ripton on the back why didnt you get tipsy sir dont you ever intoxicate yourself except at lawful marriages reveal to us what you have done with the portly dame ripton endured his bantering that he might hang about richard and watch over him he was jealous of his innocent beautys husband being in proximity with such women murmuring couples passed them to and fro by jove ricky ripton favoured his friend with another hard whisper theres a woman smoking and why not o riptonus said adrian art unaware that woman cosmopolitan is woman consummate and dost grumble to pay the small price for the splendid gem well i dont like women to smoke said plain ripton why maynt they do what men do the hero cried impetuously i hate that contemptible narrowmindedness its that makes the ruin and horrors i see why maynt they do what men do i like the women who are brave enough not to be hypocrites by heaven if these women are bad i like them better than a set of hypocritical creatures who are all show and deceive you in the end bravo shouted adrian there speaks the regenerator ripton as usual was crushed by his leader he had no argument he still thought women ought not to smoke and he thought of one far away lonely by the sea who was perfect without being cosmopolitan the pilgrims scrip remarks that young men take joy in nothing so much as the thinking women angels and nothing sours men of experience more than knowing that all are not quite so the aphorist would have pardoned ripton thompson his first random extravagance had he perceived the simple warmhearted worship of feminine goodness richards young bride had inspired in the breast of the youth it might possibly have taught him to put deeper trust in our nature ripton thought of her and had a feeling of sadness he wandered about the grounds by himself went through an open postern and threw himself down among some bushes on the slope of the hill lying there and meditating he became aware of voices conversing what does he want said a womans voice its another of his villanies i know upon my honour brayder when i think of what i have to reproach him for i think i must go mad or kill him tragic said the hon peter havent you revenged yourself bella pretty often best deal openly this is a commercial transaction you ask for money and you are to have iton the conditions double the sum and debts paid he applies to me you know my dear bella it has long been all up between you i think mount has behaved very well considering all he knows hes not easily hoodwinked you know he resigns himself to his fate and follows other game then the condition is that i am to seduce this young man my dear bella you strike your bird like a hawk i didnt say seduce hold him inplay with him amuse him i dont understand halfmeasures women seldom do how i hate you brayder i thank your ladyship the two walked farther ripton had heard some little of the colloquy he left the spot in a serious mood apprehensive of something dark to the people he loved though he had no idea of what the hon peters stipulation involved on the voyage back to town richard was again selected to sit by mrs mount brayder and adrian started the jokes the pair of parasites got on extremely well together soft fell the plash of the oars softly the moonlight curled around them softly the banks glided by the ladies were in a state of high sentiment they sang without request all deemed the british balladmonger an appropriate interpreter of their emotions after good wine and plenty thereof fair throats will make men of taste swallow that remarkable composer eyes lips hearts darts and smarts and sighs beauty duty bosom blossom false one farewell to this pathetic strain they melted mrs mount though strongly requested declined to sing she preserved her state under the tall aspens of brentfordait and on they swept the white moon in their wake richards hand lay open by his side mrs mounts little white hand by misadventure fell into it it was not pressed or soothed for its fall or made intimate with eloquent fingers it lay there like a bit of snow on the cold ground a yellow leaf wavering down from the aspens struck richards cheek and he drew away the very hand to throw back his hair and smooth his face and then folded his arms unconscious of offence he was thinking ambitiously of his life his blood was untroubled his brain calmly working which is the more perilous is a problem put by the pilgrim to meet the temptings of eve or to pique her mrs mount stared at the young man as at a curiosity and turned to flirt with one of her court the guardsmen were mostly sentimental one or two rattled and one was such a goodhumoured fellow that adrian could not make him ridiculous the others seemed to give themselves up to a silent waxing in length of limb however far they sat removed everybody was entangled in their legs pursuing his studies adrian came to the conclusion that the same close intellectual and moral affinity which he had discovered to exist between our nobility and our yeomanry is to be observed between the guardsman class and that of the corps de ballet they both live by the strength of their legs where also their wits if they do not altogether reside there are principally developed both are volage wine tobacco and the moon influence both alike and admitting the one marked difference that does exist it is after all pretty nearly the same thing to be coquetting and sinning on two legs as on the point of a toe a long guardsman with a deep bass voice sang a doleful song about the twining tendrils of the heart ruthlessly torn but required urgent persuasions and heavy trumpeting of his lungs to get to the end before he had accomplished it adrian had contrived to raise a laugh in his neighbourhood so that the company was divided and the camp split jollity returned to onehalf while sentiment held the other ripton blotted behind the bosom was only lucky in securing a higher degree of heat than was possible for the rest are you cold she would ask smiling charitably i am said the mignonne as if to excuse her conduct you always appear to be the fat one sniffed and snapped wont you warm two mrs mortimer said the naughty little woman disdain prevented any further notice of her those familiar with the ladies enjoyed their sparring which was frequent the mignonne was heard to whisper that poor fellow will certainly be stewed very prettily the ladies took and gave warmth for the air on the water was chill and misty adrian had beside him the demure one who had stopped the circulation of his anecdote she in nowise objected to the fair exchange but said hush betweenwhiles past kew and hammersmith on the cool smooth water across putney reach through battersea bridge and the city grew around them and the shadows of great millfactories slept athwart the moonlight all the ladies prattled sweetly of a charming day when they alighted on land several cavaliers crushed for the honour of conducting mrs mount to her home my broughams here i shall go alone said mrs mount some one arrange my shawl she turned her back to richard who had a view of a delicate neck as he manipulated with the bearing of a mailed knight which way are you going she asked carelessly and to his reply as to the direction said then i can give you a lift and she took his arm with a matterofcourse air and walked up the stairs with him ripton saw what had happened he was going to follow the portly dame retained him and desired him to get her a cab oh you happy fellow said the brighteyed mignonne passing by ripton procured the cab and stuffed it full without having to get into it himself try and let him come in too said the persecuting creature again passing take liberties with your menyou shant with me retorted the angry bosom and drove off so shes been and gone and run away and left him after all his trouble cried the pert little thing peering into riptons eyes now youll never be so foolish as to pin your faith to fat women again there he shall be made happy another time she gave his nose a comical tap and tripped away with her possessor ripton rather forgot his friend for some minutes random thoughts laid hold of him cabs and carriages rattled past he was sure he had been among members of the nobility that day though when they went by him now they only recognized him with an effort of the eyelids he began to think of the day with exultation as an event recollections of the mignonne were captivating blue eyesjust what i like and such a little impudent nose and red lips poutingthe very thing i like and her hair darkish i thinksay brown and so saucy and light on her feet and kind she is or she wouldnt have talked to me like that thus with a groaning soul he pictured her his reason voluntarily consigned her to the aristocracy as a natural appanage but he did amorously wish that fortune had made a lord of him then his mind reverted to mrs mount and the strange bits of the conversation he had heard on the hill he was not one to suspect anybody positively he was timid of fixing a suspicion it hovered indefinitely and clouded people without stirring him to any resolve still the attentions of the lady toward richard were queer he endeavoured to imagine they were in the nature of things because richard was so handsome that any woman must take to him but hes married said ripton and he mustnt go near these people if hes married not a high morality perhaps better than none at all better for the world were it practised more he thought of richard along with that sparkling dame alone with her the adorable beauty of his dear bride her pure heavenly face swam before him thinking of her he lost sight of the mignonne who had made him giddy he walked to richards hotel and up and down the street there hoping every minute to hear his step sometimes fancying he might have returned and gone to bed two oclock struck ripton could not go away he was sure he should not sleep if he did at last the cold sent him homeward and leaving the street on the moonlight side of piccadilly he met his friend patrolling with his head up and that swing of the feet proper to men who are chanting verses old rip cried richard cheerily what on earth are you doing here at this hour of the morning ripton muttered of his pleasure at meeting him i wanted to shake your hand before i went home richard smiled on him in an amused kindly way that all you may shake my hand any day like a true man as you are old rip ive been speaking about you do you know thatmrs mountnever saw you all the time at richmond or in the boat oh ripton said well assured that he was a dwarf you saw her safe home yes ive been there for the last couple of hourstalking she talks capitally shes wonderfully clever shes very like a man only much nicer i like her but richard excuse meim sure i dont mean to offend youbut now youre marriedperhaps you couldnt help seeing her home but i think you really indeed oughtnt to have gone upstairs ripton delivered this opinion with a modest impressiveness what do you mean said richard you dont suppose i care for any woman but my little darling down there he laughed no of course not thats absurd what i mean is that people perhaps willyou know they dothey say all manner of things and that makes unhappiness and i do wish you were going home tomorrow ricky i mean to your dear wife ripton blushed and looked away as he spoke the hero gave one of his scornful glances so youre anxious about my reputation i hate that way of looking on women because they have been once misledlook how much weaker they arebecause the world has given them an ill fame you would treat them as contagious and keep away from them for the sake of your character it would be different with me quoth ripton how asked the hero because im worse than you was all the logical explanation ripton was capable of i do hope you will go home soon he added yes said richard and i so do i hope so but ive work to do now i dare not i cannot leave it lucy would be the last to ask meyou saw her letter yesterday now listen to me rip i want to make you be just to women then he read ripton a lecture on erring women speaking of them as if he had known them and studied them for years clever beautiful but betrayed by love it was the first duty of all true men to cherish and redeem them we turn them into curses rip these divine creatures and the world suffered for it thatthat was the root of all the evil in the world i dont feel anger or horror at these poor women rip its strange i knew what they were when we came home in the boat but i doit tears my heart to see a young girl given over to an old mana man she doesnt love thats shamedont speak of it forgetting to contest the premiss that all betrayed women are betrayed by love ripton was quite silenced he like most young men had pondered somewhat on this matter and was inclined to be sentimental when he was not hungry they walked in the moonlight by the railings of the park richard harangued at leisure while riptons teeth chattered chivalry might be dead but still there was something to do went the strain the lady of the day had not been thrown in the heros path without an object he said and he was sadly right there he did not express the thing clearly nevertheless ripton understood him to mean he intended to rescue that lady from further transgressions and show a certain scorn of the world that lady and then other ladies unknown were to be rescued ripton was to help he and ripton were to be the knights of this enterprise when appealed to ripton acquiesced and shivered not only were they to be knights they would have to be titans for the powers of the world the spurious ruling social gods would have to be defied and overthrown and titan number one flung up his handsome bold face as if to challenge base jove on the spot and titan number two strained the upper button of his coat to meet across his pockethandkerchief on his chest and warmed his fingers under his coattails the moon had fallen from her high seat and was in the mists of the west when he was allowed to seek his blankets and the cold acting on his friends eloquence made riptons flesh very contrite the poor fellow had thinner blood than the hero but his heart was good by the time he had got a little warmth about him his heart gratefully strove to encourage him in the conception of becoming a knight and a titan and so striving ripton fell asleep and dreamed chapter xxxvii behold the hero embarked in the redemption of an erring beautiful woman alas writes the pilgrim at this very time to lady blandish i cannot get that legend of the serpent from me the more i think has he not caught you and ranked you foremost in his legions for see till you were fashioned the fruits hung immobile on the boughs they swayed before us glistening and cold the hand must be eager that plucked them they did not come down to us and smile and speak our language and read our thoughts and know when to fly when to follow how surely to have us do but mark one of you standing openly in the track of the serpent what shall be done with her i fear the world is wiser than its judges turn from her says the world by day the sons of the world do it darkens and they dance together downward then comes there one of the worlds elect who deems old counsel devilish indifference to the end of evil worse than its pursuit he comes to reclaim her from deepest bane will he bring her back to highest blessing is not that a bait already poor fish tis wondrous flattering the serpent has slimed her so to secure him with slow weary steps he draws her into light she clings to him she is human part of his work and he loves it as they mount upward he looks on her more while she it may be looks above what has touched him what has passed out of her and into him the serpent laughs below at the gateways of the sun they fall together this alliterative production was written without any sense of the peril that makes prophecy it suited sir austin to write thus it was a channel to his acrimony moderated through his philosophy the letter was a reply to a vehement entreaty from lady blandish for him to come up to richard and forgive him thoroughly richards name was not mentioned in it he tries to be more than he is thought the lady and she began insensibly to conceive him less than he was the baronet was conscious of a certain false gratification in his sons apparent obedience to his wishes and complete submission a gratification he chose to accept as his due without dissecting or accounting for it the intelligence reiterating that richard waited and still waited richards letters and more his dumb abiding and practical penitence vindicated humanity sufficiently to stop the course of virulent aphorisms he could speak we have seen in sorrow for this frail nature of ours that he had once stood forth to champion but how long will this last he demanded with the air of hippias he did not reflect how long it had lasted indeed his indigestion of wrath had made of him a moral dyspepsy it was not mere obedience that held richard from the aims of his young wife nor was it this new knightly enterprise he had presumed to undertake hero as he was a youth open to the insane promptings of hot blood he was not a fool there had been talk between him and mrs doria of his mother now that he had broken from his father his heart spoke for her she lived he knew he knew no more words painfully hovering along the borders of plain speech had been communicated to him filling him with moody imaginings if he thought of her the red was on his face though he could not have said why but now after canvassing the conduct of his father and throwing him aside as a terrible riddle he asked mrs doria to tell him of his other parent as softly as she could she told the story to her the shame was past she could weep for the poor lady richard dropped no tears disgrace of this kind is always present to a son and educated as he had been these tidings were a vivid fire in his brain he resolved to hunt her out and take her from the man here was work set to his hand all her dear husband did was right to lucy she encouraged him to stay for that purpose thinking it also served another there was tom bakewell to watch over lucy there was work for him to do whether it would please his father he did not stop to consider as to the justice of the act let us say nothing on ripton devolved the humbler task of grubbing for sandoes place of residence and as he was unacquainted with the name by which the poet now went in private his endeavours were not immediately successful the friends met in the evening at lady blandishs townhouse or at the foreys where mrs doria procured the reverer of the royal martyr and staunch conservative a favourable reception pity deep pity for richards conduct ripton saw breathing out of mrs doria algernon feverel treated his nephew with a sort of rough commiseration as a young fellow who had run off the road pity was in lady blandishs eyes though for a different cause she doubted if she did well in seconding his fathers unwise schemesupposing him to have a scheme she saw the young husband encompassed by dangers at a critical time not a word of mrs mount had been breathed to her but the lady had some knowledge of life she touched on delicate verges to the baronet in her letters and he understood her well enough if he loves this person to whom he has bound himself what fear for him or are you coming to think it something that bears the name of love because we have to veil the rightful appellation so he responded remote among the mountains she tried very hard to speak plainly finally he came to say that he denied himself the pleasure of seeing his son specially that he for a time might be put to the test the lady seemed to dread this was almost too much for lady blandish loves charity boy so loftily serene now that she saw him half denudeda thing of shanks and wristswas a trial for her true heart going home at night richard would laugh at the faces made about his marriage well carry the day rip my lucy and i or ill do it alonewhat there is to do he slightly adverted to a natural want of courage in women which ripton took to indicate that his beauty was deficient in that quality up leapt the old dog im sure there never was a braver creature upon earth richard shes as brave as shes lovely ill swear she is look how she behaved that day how her voice sounded she was trembling brave shed follow you into battle richard and richard rejoined talk on dear old rip shes my darling love whatever she is and she is gloriously lovely no eyes are like hers ill go down tomorrow morning the first thing ripton only wondered the husband of such a treasure could remain apart from it so thought richard for a space but if i go rip he said despondently if i go for a day even i shall have undone all my work with my father she says it herselfyou saw it in her last letter yes ripton assented and the words please remember me to dear mr thompson fluttered about the old dogs heart it came to pass that mrs berry having certain business that led her through kensington gardens spied a figure that she had once dandled in long clothes and helped make a man of if ever woman did he was walking under the trees beside a lady talking to her not indifferently the gentleman was her bridegroom and her babe i know his back said mrs berry as if she had branded a mark on it in infancy but the lady was not her bride mrs berry diverged from the path and got before them on the left flank she stared retreated and came round upon the right there was that in the ladys face which mrs berry did not like her innermost question was why he was not walking with his own wife she stopped in front of them they broke and passed about her the lady made a laughing remark to him whereat he turned to look and mrs berry bobbed she had to bob a second time and then he remembered the worthy creature and hailed her penelope shaking her hand so that he put her in countenance again mrs berry was extremely agitated he dismissed her promising to call upon her in the evening she heard the lady slip out something from a side of her lip and they both laughed as she toddled off to a sheltering tree to wipe a corner of each eye i dont like the looks of that woman she said and repeated it resolutely why doesnt he walk arminarm with her was her neat inquiry wheres his wife succeeded it after many interrogations of the sort she arrived at naming the lady a boldfaced thing adding subsequently brazen the lady had apparently shown mrs berry that she wished to get rid of her and had checked the outpouring of her emotions on the breast of her babe i know a lady when i see one said mrs berry i havent lived with em for nothing and if shes a lady bred and born i wasnt married in the church alive then if not a lady what was she mrs berry desired to know shes imitation lady im sure she is berry vowed i say she dont look proper establishing the lady to be a spurious article however what was one to think of a married man in company with such oh no it aint that mrs berry returned immediately on the charitable tack belike its some one of his acquaintance ve married her for her looks and heve just met her why itd be as bad as my berry the relinquished spouse of berry ejaculated in horror at the idea of a second man being so monstrous in wickedness just coupled too mrs berry groaned on the suspicious side of the debate and such a sweet young thing for his wife but no ill never believe it not if he tell me so himself and men dont do that she whimpered women are swift at coming to conclusions in these matters soft women exceedingly swift and soft women who have been betrayed are rapid beyond measure mrs berry had not cogitated long ere she pronounced distinctly and without a shadow of dubiosity my opinion ismarried or not married and wheresomever he pick her upshes nothin more nor less than a bella donna as which poisonous plant she forthwith registered the lady in the botanical notebook of her brain it would have astonished mrs mount to have heard her person so accurately hit off at a glance in the evening richard made good his promise accompanied by ripton mrs berry opened the door to them she could not wait to get him into the parlour youre my own blessed babe and im as good as your mother though i didnt suck ye bein a maid she cried falling into his arms while richard did his best to support the unexpected burden then reproaching him tenderly for his guileat mention of which ripton chuckled deeming it his own most honourable portion of the plotmrs berry led them into the parlour and revealed to richard who she was and how she had tossed him and hugged him and kissed him all over when he was only that bigshowing him her stumpy fat arm i kissed ye from head to tail i did said mrs berry and you neednt be ashamed of it its be hoped youll never have nothin worse come tye my dear richard assured her he was not a bit ashamed but warned her that she must not do it now mrs berry admitting it was out of the question now and now that he had a wife moreover the young men laughed and ripton laughing overloudly drew on himself mrs berrys attention but that mr thompson therehowever he can look me in the face after his inncence helping blindfold an old woman though i aint sorry for what i didthat im free for to say and its over and blessed be all amen so now where is she and how is she mr richard my dearits only cuttin off the s and you are as you waswhy didnt ye bring her with ye to see her old berry richard hurriedly explained that lucy was still in the isle of wight oh and youve left her for a day or two said mrs berry good god i wish it had been a day or two cried richard ah and how long have it been asked mrs berry her heart beginning to beat at his manner of speaking dont talk about it said richard oh you never been dudgeonin already oh you havent been peckin at one another yet mrs berry exclaimed ripton interposed to tell her such fears were unfounded then how long ha you been divided in a guilty voice ripton stammered since september september breathed mrs berry counting on her fingers september october novtwo months and more nigh three a young married husband away from the wife of his bosom nigh three months oh my oh my what do that mean my father sent for meim waiting to see him said richard a few more words helped mrs berry to comprehend the condition of affairs then mrs berry spread her lap flattened out her hands fixed her eyes and spoke my dear young gentlemanid like to call ye my darlin babe im going to speak as a mother to ye whether ye likes it or no and what old berry says you wont mind for shes had ye when there was no conventionals about ye and she has the feelins of a mother to you though humble her state if theres one that know matrimony its me my dear though berry did give me no more but nine months of it and ive known the worst of matrimony

was a and now yous b so youre my a b he says write yourself down that he says the bad man with his jokesberry went to service mrs berrys softness came upon her so i tell ye berry went to service he left the wife of his bosom forlorn and he went to service because he were allays an ambitious man and wasnt so to speak happy out of his uniformwhich was his liverynot even in my arms and he let me know it he got among them kitchen sluts which was my mournin ready made and worse than a widows cap to me which is no shame to wear and some say becoming theres no man as ever lived known better than my berry how to show his legs to advantage and gals look at em i dont wonder now that berry was prostrated his temptations was strong and his flesh was weak then what i say is that for a young married manbe he whomsoever he may beto be separated from the wife of his bosoma young sweet thing and he an innocent young gentlemanso to sunder in their state and be kep from each other i say its as bad as

dear young gentleman some mens hearts is vagabonds bornthey must go astrayits their natur to but all men are men and i know the foundation of em by reason of my woe mrs berry paused richard was humorously respectful to the sermon the truth in the good creatures address was not to be disputed or despised notwithstanding the inclination to laugh provoked by her quaint way of putting it ripton nodded encouragingly at every sentence for he saw her drift and wished to second it seeking for an illustration of her meaning mrs berry solemnly continued we all know what checked prespiration is but neither of the young gentlemen could resist this out they burst in a roar of laughter laugh away said mrs berry i dont mind ye i say again we all do know what checked prespiration is it fly to the lungs it gives ye mortal inflammation and it carries ye off then i say checked matrimony is as bad it fly to the heart and it carries off the virtue thats in ye and you might as well be dead them that is joined its their salvation not to separate it dont so much matter before it that mr thompson thereif he go astray it aint from the blessed fold he hurt himself alonenot double and belike treble for who can say now what may be theres time for it im for holding back young people so that they knows their minds howsomever they rattles about their hearts i aint a speeder of matrimony and goods my reason but where its been donewhere theyre lawfully joined and their bodies made one i do say this that to put division between em then its to make wanderin comets of emcreatures without a objeck and no soul can say what theys good for but to rush about mrs berry here took a heavy breath as one who has said her utmost for the time being my dear old girl richard went up to her and applauding her on the shoulder youre a very wise old woman but you mustnt speak to me as if i wanted to stop here im compelled to i do it for her good chiefly its your father thats doin it my dear well im waiting his pleasure a pretty pleasure puttin a snake in the nest of young turtledoves and why dont she come up to you well that you must ask her the fact is shes a little timid girlshe wants me to see him first

abidei tell you my dear she aint soft noexcept to the man of her heart and the best of womens too soft theremores our sorrow well well said richard who thought he knew i agree with you mrs berry ripton struck in mrs richard would do anything in the world her husband asked her im quite sure bless you for your good opinion mr thompson why see her she aint frail on her feet she looks ye straight in the eyes she aint one of your hangdown misses look how she behaved at the ceremony ah sighed ripton and if youd ha seen her when she spoke to me about my ring depend upon it my dear mr richard if she blinded you about the nerve sheve got it was somethin she thought she ought to do for your sake and i wish id been by to counsel her poor blessed babeand how much longer now can ye stay divided from that darlin richard paced up and down a fathers will urged mrs berry thats a sons law but he mustnt go again the laws of his nature to do it just be quiet at presenttalk of other things theres a good woman said richard mrs berry meekly folded her arms how strange now our meetin like this meetin at all too she remarked contemplatively its them advertisements they brings people together from the ends of the earth for good or for bad i often say theres more lucky accidents or unlucky ones since advertisements was the rule than ever there was before they make a number of romances depend upon it do you walk much in the gardens my dear now and then said richard very pleasant it is there with the fine folks and flowers and titled people continued mrs berry that was a handsome woman you was awalkin beside this mornin very said richard she was a handsome woman or i should say is for her day aint past and she know it i thought at firstby her backit might ha been your aunt mrs forey for she do step out well and hold up her shoulders straight as a dart she be but when i come to see her faceoh dear me says i this aint one of the family they none of em got such bold facesnor no lady as i know have but shes a fine womanthat nobody can gainsay mrs berry talked further of the fine woman it was a liberty she took to speak in this disrespectful tone of her and mrs berry was quite aware that she was laying herself open to rebuke she had her end in view no rebuke was uttered and during her talk she observed intercourse passing between the eyes of the young men look here penelope richard stopped her at last will it make you comfortable if i tell you ill obey the laws of my nature and go down at the end of the week ill thank the lord of heaven if you do she exclaimed very well thenbe happyi will now listen i want you to keep your rooms for methose she had i expect in a day or two to bring a lady here a lady faltered mrs berry yes a lady may i make so bold as to ask what lady you may not not now of course you will know mrs berrys short neck made the best imitation it could of an offended swans action she was very angry she said she did not like so many ladies which natural objection richard met by saying that there was only one lady and mrs berry he added dropping his voice you will treat her as you did my dear girl for she will require not only shelter but kindness i would rather leave her with you than with any one she has been very unfortunate his serious air and habitual tone of command fascinated the softness of berry and it was not until he had gone that she spoke out unfortnate hes going to bring me an unfortnate female oh not from my babe can i bear that never will i have her here i see it its that boldfaced woman hes got mixed up in and sheve been and made the young man think hell go for to reform her its one o their artsthat is and hes too innocent a young man to mean anythin else but i aint a house of magdalens no and sooner than have her here id have the roof fall over me i would she sat down to eat her supper on the sublime resolve in love mrs berrys charity was all on the side of the law and this is the case with many of her sisters the pilgrim sneers at them for it and would have us credit that it is their admirable instinct which at the expense of every virtue save one preserves the artificial barrier simply to impose upon us men i presume are hardly fair judges and should stand aside and mark early next day mrs berry bundled off to richards hotel to let him know her determination she did not find him there returning homeward through the park she beheld him on horseback riding by the side of the identical lady the sight of this public exposure shocked her more than the secret walk under the trees you dont look near your reform yet mrs berry apostrophized her you dont look to me one thatd come the fair penitent till youve left off bein fairif then you do which some of ye dont laugh away and show yet airs spite o your hat and feather and your ridin habit youre a bella donna setting her down again absolutely for such whatever it might signify mrs berry had a virtuous glow in the evening she heard the noise of wheels stopping at the door never she rose from her chair to exclaim he aint rided her out in the mornin and been and made a magdalen of her afore dark a lady veiled was brought into the house by richard mrs berry feebly tried to bar his progress in the passage he pushed past her and conducted the lady into the parlour without speaking mrs berry did not follow she heard him murmur a few sentences within then he came out all her crest stood up as she whispered vigorously mr richard if that woman stay here i go forth my house aint a penitentiary for unfortnate females sir he frowned at her curiously but as she was on the point of renewing her indignant protest he clapped his hand across her mouth and spoke words in her ear that had awful import to her she trembled breathing low my god forgive me richard and her virtue was humbled lady feverel is it your mother mr richard and her virtue was humbled chapter xxxviii one may suppose that a prematurely aged oily little man a poet in bad circumstances a decrepit butterfly chained to a disappointed inkstand will not put out strenuous energies to retain his ancient paramour when a robust young man comes imperatively to demand his mother of him in her person the colloquy was short between diaper sandoe and richard the question was referred to the poor spiritless lady who seeing that her son made no question of it cast herself on his hands small loss to her was diaper but he was the loss of habit and that is something to a woman who has lived the blood of her son had been running so long alien from her that the sense of her motherhood smote her now with strangeness and richards stern gentleness seemed like dreadful justice come upon her her heart had almost forgotten its maternal functions she called him sir till he bade her remember he was her son her voice sounded to him like that of a brokenthroated lamb so painful and weak it was with the plaintive stop in the utterance when he kissed her her skin was cold her thin hand fell out of his when his grasp related can sin hunt one like this he asked bitterly reproaching himself for the shame she had caused him to endure and a deep compassion filled his breast poetic justice had been dealt to diaper the poet he thought of all he had sacrificed for this womanthe comfortable quarters the friend the happy flights he could not but accuse her of unfaithfulness in leaving him in his old age habit had legalized his union with her he wrote as pathetically of the break of habit as men feel at the death of love and when we are old and have no fair hope tossing golden locks before us a wound to this our second nature is quite as sad i know not even if it be not actually sadder day by day richard visited his mother lady blandish and ripton alone were in the secret adrian let him do as he pleased he thought proper to tell him that the public recognition he accorded to a particular lady was in the present state of the world scarcely prudent tis a proof to me of your moral rectitude my son but the world will not think so no one character is sufficient to cover twoin a protestant country especially the divinity that doth hedge a bishop would have no chance in contact with your madam danae drop the woman my son or permit me to speak what you would have her hear richard listened to him with disgust well youve had my doctorial warning said adrian and plunged back into his book when lady feverel had revived to take part in the consultations mrs berry perpetually opened on the subject of richards matrimonial duty another chain was cast about him do not oh do not offend your father was her one repeated supplication sir austin had grown to be a vindictive phantom in her mind she never wept but when she said this so mrs berry to whom richard had once made mention of lady blandish as the only friend he had among women bundled off in her blacksatin dress to obtain an interview with her and an ally after coming to an understanding on the matter of the visit and reiterating many of her views concerning young married people mrs berry said my lady if i may speak so bold id say the sin thats bein done is the sin o the lookerson and when everybody appear frightened by that young gentlemans father ill sayhopin your pardonthey no cause be frighted at all for though its nigh twenty year since i knew him and i knew him then just sixteen monthsno moreill say his hearts as soft as a womans which ive cause for to know and thats it thats where everybodys deceived by him and i was its because he keeps his face and makes ye think youre dealin with a man of iron and all the while theres a woman underneath and a man thats like a woman hes the puzzle o life we can see through ourselves my lady and we can see through men but one o that sorthes like somethin out of nature then i sayhopin be excusedwhats to do is for to treat him like a woman and not for to let him have his own waywhich he dont know himself and is why nobody else do let that sweet young couple come together and be wholesome in spite of him i say and then give him time to come round just like a woman and round hell come and give em his blessin and we shall know weve made him comfortable hes angry because matrimony have come between him and his son and he womanlike hes wantin to treat what is as if it isnt but matrimonys a holier than him it began long long before him and its be hoped will endoor longs the time after if the worlds not coming to rackwishin him no harm now mrs berry only put lady blandishs thoughts in bad english the lady took upon herself seriously to advise richard to send for his wife he wrote bidding her come lucy however had wits and inexperienced wits are as a little knowledge in pursuance of her sage plan to make the family feel her worth and to conquer the members of it one by one she had got up a correspondence with adrian whom it tickled adrian constantly assured her all was going well time would heal the wound if both the offenders had the fortitude to be patient he fancied he saw signs of the baronets relenting they must do nothing to arrest those favourable symptoms indeed the wise youth was languidly seeking to produce them he wrote and felt as lucys benefactor so lucy replied to her husband a cheerful rigmarole he could make nothing of save that she was happy in hope and still had fears then mrs berry trained her fist to indite a letter to her bride her bride answered it by saying she trusted to time you poor marter mrs berry wrote back i know what your sufferins be they is the only kind a wife should never hide from her husband he thinks all sorts of things if she can abide being away and you trusting to time why its like trusting not to catch cold out of your natural clothes there was no shaking lucys firmness richard gave it up he began to think that the life lying behind him was the life of a fool what had he done in it he had burnt a rick and got married he associated the two acts of his existence where was the hero he was to have carved out of tom bakewella wretch he had taught to lie and chicane and for what great heavens how ignoble did a flash from the light of his aspirations make his marriage appear the young man sought amusement he allowed his aunt to drag him into society and sick of that he made late evening calls on mrs mount oblivious of the purpose he had in visiting her at all her manlike conversation which he took for honesty was a refreshing change on fair lips call me bella ill call you dick said she and it came to be bella and dick between them no mention of bella occurred in richards letters to lucy mrs mount spoke quite openly of herself i pretend to be no better than i am she said and i know im no worse than many a woman who holds her head high to back this she told him stories of blooming dames of good repute and poured a little social sewerage into his ears also she understood him what you want my dear dick is something to do you went and got married like ahumfriends must be respectful go into the army try the turf i can put you up to a trick or twofriends should make themselves useful she told him what she liked in him youre the only man i was ever alone with who dont talk to me of love and make me feel sick i hate men who cant speak to a woman sensiblyjust wait a minute she left him and presently returned with ah dick old fellow how are youarrayed like a cavalier one arm stuck in her side her hat jauntily cocked and a pretty oath on her lips to give reality to the costume what do you think of me wasnt it a shame to make a woman of me when i was born to be a man i dont know that said richard for the contrast in her attire to those shooting eyes and lips aired her sex bewitchingly what you think i dont do it well charming but i cant forget now that is too bad she pouted then she proposed that they should go out into the midnight streets arminarm and out they went and had great fits of laughter at her impertinent manner of using her eyeglass and outrageous affectation of the supreme dandy they take up men dick for going about in womens clothes and vice versaw i suppose youll bail me old fellaa if i have to make my bow to the beak wont you say its becas im an honest woman and dont care to hide theaunmentionables when i wear themas the tothers do sprinkled with the dandys famous invocations he began to conceive romance in that sort of fun youre a wopper my brave dick wont let any peeler take me by jove and he with many assurances guaranteed to stand by her while she bent her thin fingers trying the muscle of his arm and reposed upon it more there was delicacy in her dandyism she was a graceful cavalier sir julius as they named the dandys attire was frequently called for on his evening visits to mrs mount when he beheld sir julius he thought of the lady and vice versaw as sir julius was fond of exclaiming was ever hero in this fashion wooed the woman now and then would peep through sir julius or she would sit and talk and altogether forget she was impersonating that worthy fop she never uttered an idea or a reflection but richard thought her the cleverest woman he had ever met all kinds of problematic notions beset him she was cold as ice she hated talk about love and she was branded by the world a rumour spread that reached mrs dorias ears she rushed to adrian first the wise youth believed there was nothing in it she sailed down upon richard is this true that you have been seen going publicly about with an infamous woman richard tell me pray relieve me richard knew of no person answering to his aunts description in whose company he could have been seen tell me i say dont quibble do you know any woman of bad character the acquaintance of a lady very much misjudged and illused by the world richard admitted to urgent grave advice mrs doria tendered her nephew both from the moral and the worldly point of view mentally ejaculating all the while that ridiculous system that disgraceful marriage sir austin in his mountain solitude was furnished with serious stuff to brood over the rumour came to lady blandish she likewise lectured richard and with her he condescended to argue but he found himself obliged to instance something he had quite neglected instead of her doing me harm its i that will do her good lady blandish shook her head and held up her finger this person must be very clever to have given you that delusion dear she is clever and the world treats her shamefully she complains of her position to you not a word but i will stand by her she has no friend but me my poor boy has she made you think that how unjust you all are cried richard how mad and wicked is the man who can let him be tempted so thought lady blandish he would pronounce no promise not to visit her not to address her publicly the world that condemned her and cast her out was no betterworse for its miserable hypocrisy he knew the world now the young man said my child the world may be very bad i am not going to defend it but you have some one else to think of have you forgotten you have a wife richard ay you all speak of her now theres my aunt remember you have a wife do you think i love any one but lucy poor little thing because i am married am i to give up the society of women of women isnt she a woman too much so sighed the defender of her sex adrian became more emphatic in his warnings richard laughed at him the wise youth sneered at mrs mount the hero then favoured him with a warning equal to his own in emphasis and surpassing it in sincerity we wont quarrel my dear boy said adrian im a man of peace besides we are not fairly proportioned for a combat ride your steed to virtues goal all i say is that i think hell upset you and its better to go at a slow pace and in companionship with the children of the sun you have a very nice little woman for a wifewell goodbye to have his wife and the world thrown at his face was unendurable to richard he associated them somewhat after the manner of the rick and the marriage charming sir julius always gay always honest dispersed his black moods why youre taller richard made the discovery of course i am dont you remember you said i was such a little thing when i came out of my womans shell and how have you done it grown to please you now if you can do that you can do anything and so i would do anything you would honour thenhis project recurred to him but the incongruity of speaking seriously to sir julius struck him dumb then what asked she then youre a gallant fellow that all isnt it enough not quite you were going to say something i saw it in your eyes you saw that i admired you yes but a man mustnt admire a man i suppose i had an idea you were a woman what when i had the heels of my boots raised half an inch sir julius turned one heel and volleyed out silver laughter i dont come much above your shoulder even now she said and proceeded to measure her height beside him with arch upglances you must grow more fraid i cant dick bootmakers cant do it ill show you how and he lifted sir julius lightly and bore the fair gentleman to the lookingglass holding him there exactly on a level with his head will that do yes oh but i cant stay here why cant you why cant i he should have known thenit was thundered at a closed door in him that he played with fire but the door being closed he thought himself internally secure their eyes met he put her down instantly sir julius charming as he was lost his vogue seeing that the wily woman resumed her shell the memory of sir julius breathing about her still doubled the feminine attraction i ought to have been an actress she said richard told her he found all natural women had a similar wish yes ah then if i had been sighed mrs mount gazing on the pattern of the carpet he took her hand and pressed it you are not happy as you are no may i speak to you yes her nearest eye setting a dimple of her cheek in motion slid to the corner toward her ear as she sat with her head sideways to him listening when he had gone she said to herself old hypocrites talk in that way but i never heard of a young man doing it and not making love at the same time their next meeting displayed her quieter subdued as one who had been set thinking he lauded her fair looks dont make me thrice ashamed she petitioned but it was not only that mood with her dauntless defiance that splendidly befitted her gallant outline and gave a wildness to her bright bold eyes when she would call out happy who dares say im not happy dyou think if the world whips me ill wince dyou think i care for what they say or do let them kill me they shall never get one cry out of me and flashing on the young man as if he were the congregated enemy add there now you know methat was a mood that well became her and helped the work she ought to have been an actress this must not go on said lady blandish and mrs doria in unison a common object brought them together they confined their talk to it and did not disagree mrs doria engaged to go down to the baronet both ladies knew it was a dangerous likely to turn out a disastrous expedition they agreed to it because it was something to do and doing anything is better than doing nothing do it said the wise youth when they made him a third do it if you want him to be a hermit for life you will bring back nothing but his dead body ladiesa hellenic rather than a roman triumph he will listen to youhe will accompany you to the stationhe will hand you into the carriageand when you point to his seat he will bow profoundly and retire into his congenial mists adrian spoke their thoughts they fretted they relapsed speak to him you adrian said mrs doria speak to the boy solemnly it would be almost better he should go back to that little thing he has married almost lady blandish opened her eyes i have been advising it for the last month and more a choice of evils said mrs dorias soursweet face and shake of the head each lady saw a point of dissension and mutually agreed with heroic effort to avoid it by shutting their mouths what was more they preserved the peace in spite of adrians artifices well ill talk to him again he said ill try to get the engine on the conventional line command him exclaimed mrs doria gentle means are i think the only means with richard said lady blandish throwing banter aside as much as he could adrian spoke to richard you want to reform this woman her manner is openfair and freethe traditional characteristic we wont stop to canvass how that particular honesty of deportment that wins your approbation has been gained in her college it is not uncommon girls you know are not like boys at a certain age they cant be quite natural its a bad sign if they dont blush and fib and affect this and that it wears off when theyre women but a woman who speaks like a man and has all those excellent virtues you admirewhere has she learned the trick she tells you you dont surely approve of the school well what is there in it then reform her of course the task is worthy of your energies but if you are appointed to do it dont do it publicly and dont attempt it just now may i ask you whether your wife participates in this undertaking richard walked away from the interrogation the wise youth who hated long unrelieved speeches and had healed his conscience said no more dear tender lucy poor darling richards eyes moistened her letters seemed sadder latterly yet she never called to him to come or he would have gone his heart leapt up to her he announced to adrian that he should wait no longer for his father adrian placidly nodded the enchantress observed that her knight had a clouded brow and an absent voice richardi cant call you dick now i really dont know whyshe said i want to beg a favour of you name it i can still call you bella i suppose if you care to what i want to say is this when you meet me outto cut it shortplease not to recognize me and why do you ask to be told that certainly i do then look i wont compromise you i see no harm bella no she caressed his hand and there is none i know that but modest eyelids were drooped other people do struggling eyes were raised what do we care for other people nothing i dont not that snapping her finger i care for you though a prolonged look followed the declaration youre foolish bella not quite so giddythats all he did not combat it with his usual impetuosity adrians abrupt inquiry had sunk in his mind as the wise youth intended it should he had instinctively refrained from speaking to lucy of this lady but what a noble creature the woman was so they met in the park mrs mount whipped past him and secresy added a new sense to their intimacy adrian was gratified at the result produced by his eloquence though this lady never expressed an idea richard was not mistaken in her cleverness she could make evenings pass gaily and one was not the fellow to the other she could make you forget she was a woman and then bring the fact startlingly home to you she could read men with one quiver of her halfclosed eyelashes she could catch the coming mood in a man and fit herself to it what does a woman want with ideas who can do thus much keenness of perception conformity delicacy of handling these be all the qualities necessary to parasites love would have scared the youth she banished it from her tongue it may also have been true that it sickened her she played on his higher nature she understood spontaneously what would be most strange and taking to him in a woman various as the serpent of old nile she acted fallen beauty humorous indifference reckless daring arrogance in ruin and acting thus what think youshe did it so well because she was growing half in earnest richard i am not what i was since i knew you you will not give me up quite never bella i am not so bad as im painted you are only unfortunate now that i know you i think so and yet i am happier she told him her history when this soft horizon of repentance seemed to throw heavens twilight across it a womans history you know certain chapters expunged it was dark enough to richard did you love the man he asked you say you love no one now did i love him he was a nobleman and i a tradesmans daughter no i did not love him i have lived to learn it and now i should hate him if i did not despise him can you be deceived in love said richard more to himself than to her yes when were young we can be very easily deceived if there is such a thing as love we discover it after we have tossed about and roughed it then we find the man or the woman that suits usand then its too late we cant have him singular murmured richard she says just what my father said he spoke aloud i could forgive you if you had loved him dont be harsh grave judge how is a girl to distinguish you had some affection for him he was the first she chose to admit that yes and the first who talks of love to a girl must be a fool if he doesnt blind her that makes what is called first love nonsense isnt it he repelled the insinuation because i know it is not bella nevertheless she had opened a wider view of the world to him and a colder he thought poorly of girls a woman a sensible brave beautiful woman seemed on comparison infinitely nobler than those weak creatures she was best in her character of lovely rebel accusing foul injustice what am i to do you tell me to be different how can i what am i to do will virtuous people let me earn my bread i could not get a housemaids place they wouldnt have mei see their noses smelling yes i can go to the hospital and sing behind a screen do you expect me to bury myself alive why man i have blood i cant become a stone you say i am honest and i will be then let me tell you that i have been used to luxuries and i cant do without them i might have married menlots would have had me but who marries one like me but a fool and i could not marry a fool the man i marry i must respect he could not respect mei should know him to be a fool and i should be worse off than i am now as i am now they may look as pious as they likei laugh at them and so forth direr things imputations upon wives horrible exultation at the universal peccancy of husbands this lovely outcast almost made him think she had the right on her side so keenly her parthian arrows pierced the holy centres of society and exposed its rottenness mrs mounts house was discreetly conducted nothing ever occurred to shock him there the young man would ask himself where the difference was between her and the women of society how base too was the army of banded hypocrites he was ready to declare war against them on her behalf his casus belli accurately worded would have read curiously because the world refused to lure the lady to virtue with the offer of a housemaids place our knight threw down his challenge but the lady had scornfully rebutted this prospect of a return to chastity then the form of the challenge must be because the world declined to support the lady in luxury for nothing but what did that mean in other words she was to receive the devils wages without rendering him her services such an arrangement appears hardly fair on the world or on the devil heroes will have to conquer both before they will get them to subscribe to it heroes however are not in the habit of wording their declarations of war at all lance in rest they challenge and they charge like women they trust to instinct and graft on it the muscle of men wide fly the leisurelyremonstrating hosts institutions are scattered they know not wherefore heads are broken that have not the balm of a reason why tis instinct strikes surely there is something divine in instinct still war declared where were these hosts the hero could not charge down on the ladies and gentlemen in a ballroom and spoil the quadrille he had sufficient reticence to avoid sounding his challenge in the law courts nor could he well go into the houses of parliament with a trumpet though to come to a tussle with the nations direct representatives did seem the likelier method it was likewise out of the question that he should enter every house and shop and battle with its master in the cause of mrs mount where then was his enemy everybody was his enemy and everybody was nowhere shall he convoke multitudes on wimbledon common blue policemen and a distant dread of ridicule bar all his projects alas for the hero in our day nothing teaches a strong arm its impotence so much as knocking at empty air what can i do for this poor woman cried richard after fighting his phantom enemy till he was worn out o rip old rip he addressed his friend im distracted i wish i was dead what good am i for miserable selfish what have i done but make every soul i know wretched about me i follow my own inclinationsi make people help me by lying as hard as they canand im a liar and when ive got it im ashamed of myself and now when i do see something unselfish for me to do i come upon grinsi dont know where to turnhow to actand i laugh at myself like a devil it was only friend riptons ear that was required so his words went for little but ripton did say he thought there was small matter to be ashamed of in winning and wearing the beauty of earth richard added his customary comment of poor little thing he fought his duello with empty air till he was exhausted a last letter written to his father procured him no reply then said he i have tried my utmost i have tried to be dutifulmy father wont listen to me one thing i can doi can go down to my dear girl and make her happy and save her at least from some of the consequences of my rashness theres nothing better for me he groaned his great ambition must be covered by a housetop he and the cat must warm themselves on the domestic hearth the hero was not aware that his heart moved him to this his heart was not now in open communion with his mind mrs mount heard that her friend was goingwould go she knew he was going to his wife far from discouraging him she said nobly goi believe i have kept you let us have an evening together and then go for good if you like if not then to meet again another time forget me i shant forget you youre the best fellow i ever knew richard you are on my honour i swear i would not step in between you and your wife to cause either of you a moments unhappiness when i can be another woman i will and i shall think of you then lady blandish heard from adrian that richard was positively going to his wife the wise youth modestly veiled his own merit in bringing it about by saying i couldnt see that poor little woman left alone down there any longer well yes said mrs doria to whom the modest speech was repeated i suppose poor boy its the best he can do now richard bade them adieu and went to spend his last evening with mrs mount the enchantress received him in state do you know this dress no its the dress i wore when i first met younot when i first saw you i think i remarked you sir before you deigned to cast an eye upon humble me when we first met we drank champagne together and i intend to celebrate our parting in the same liquor will you liquor with me old boy she was gay she revived sir julius occasionally he dispirited left the talking all to her mrs mount kept a footman at a late hour the man of calves dressed the table for supper it was a point of honour for richard to sit down to it and try to eat drinking thanks to the kindly mother nature who loves to see her children made fools of is always an easier matter the footman was diligent the champagne corks feebly recalled the filefiring at richmond well drink to what we might have been dick said the enchantress oh the glorious wreck she looked his heart choked as he gulped the buzzing wine what down my boy she cried they shall never see me hoist signals of distress we must all die and the secret of the thing is to die game by jove did you ever hear of laura fern a superb girl handsomer than your humble servantif youll believe ita miss in the bargain and as a consequence i suppose a much greater rake she was in the huntingfield her horse threw her and she fell plump on a stake it went into her left breast all the fellows crowded round her and one young man who was in love with herhe sits in the house of peers nowwe used to call him duck because he was such a dearhe dropped from his horse to his knees laura laura my darling speak a word to methe last she turned over all white and bloody ii shant be in at the death and gave up the ghost wasnt that dying game heres to the example of laura fenn why whats the matter see it makes a man turn pale to hear how a woman can die fill the glasses john why youre as bad its give me a turn my lady pleaded john and the mans hand was unsteady as he poured out the wine you ought not to listen go and drink some brandy john footman went from the room my brave dick richard what a face youve got he showed a deep frown on a colourless face cant you bear to hear of blood you know it was only one naughty woman out of the world the clergyman of the parish didnt refuse to give her decent burial we christians hurrah she cheered and laughed a lurid splendour glanced about her like lights from the pit pledge me dick drink and recover yourself who minds we must all diethe good and the bad ashes to ashesdust to dustand wine for living lips thats poetryalmost sentiment may we never say die till weve drunk our fill not badeh a little vulgar perhaps by jove do you think me horrid wheres the wine richard shouted he drank a couple of glasses in succession and stared about was he in hell with a lost soul raving to him nobly spoken and nobly acted upon my brave dick now well be companions she wished that heaven had made her such a man ah dick dick too late too late softly fell her voice her eyes threw slanting beams do you see this she pointed to a symbolic golden anchor studded with gems and coiled with a rope of hair in her bosom it was a gift of his do you know when i stole the lock foolish dick you gave me an anchor without a rope come and see she rose from the table and threw herself on the sofa dont you recognize your own hair i should know a thread of mine among a million something of the strength of samson went out of him as he inspected his hair on the bosom of delilah and you knew nothing of it you hardly know it now you see it what couldnt a woman steal from you but youre not vain and thats a protection youre a miracle dick a man thats not vain sit here she curled up her feet to give him place on the sofa now let us talk like friends that part to meet no more you found a ship with fever on board and you werent afraid to come alongside and keep her company the fever isnt catching you see let us mingle our tears together ha ha a man said that once to me the hypocrite wanted to catch the fever but he was too old how old are you dick richard pushed a few months forward twentyone you just look it you blooming boy now tell me my age adonistwentywhat richard had given the lady twentyfive years she laughed violently you dont pay compliments dick best to be honest guess again you dont like to not twentyfive or twentyfour or twentythree or see how he begins to staretwentytwo just twentyone my dear i think my birthdays somewhere in next month why look at me closecloser have i a wrinkle and when in heavens namehe stopped short i understand you when did i commence for to live at the ripe age of sixteen i saw a nobleman in despair because of my beauty he vowed hed die i didnt want him to do that so to save the poor man for his family i ran away with him and i dare say they didnt appreciate the sacrifice and he soon forgot to if he ever did its the way of the world richard seized some dead champagne emptied the bottle into a tumbler and drank it off john footman entered to clear the table and they were left without further interruption bella bella richard uttered in a deep sad voice as he walked the room she leaned on her arm her hair crushed against a reddened cheek her eyes halfshut and dreamy bella he dropped beside her you are unhappy she blinked and yawned as one who is awakened suddenly i think you spoke said she you are unhappy bella you cant conceal it your laugh sounds like madness you must be unhappy so young too only twentyone what does it matter who cares for me the mighty pity falling from his eyes took in her whole shape she did not mistake it for tenderness as another would have done who cares for you bella i do what makes my misery now but to see you there and know of no way of helping you father of mercy it seems too much to have to stand by powerless while such ruin is going on her hand was shaken in his by the passion of torment with which his frame quaked involuntarily a tear started between her eyelids she glanced up at him quickly then looked down drew her hand from his and smoothed it eying it bella you have a father alive a linendraper dear he wears a white neckcloth this article of apparel instantaneously changed the tone of the conversation for he rising abruptly nearly squashed the ladys lapdog whose squeaks and howls were piteous and demanded the most fervent caresses of its mistress it was oh my poor pet mumpsy and he didnt like a nasty great big ugly heavy foot an his poor soft silkymummumback he didnt and he soodnt that hemummumsoodnt and he cried out and knew the place to come to and was oh so sorry for what had happened to himmummummumand now he was going to be made happy his mistress make him happymummummummooooo yes said richard savagely from the other end of the room you care for the happiness of your dog a course se does mumpsy was simperingly assured in the thick of his silky flanks richard looked for his hat mumpsy was deposited on the sofa in a twinkling now said the lady you must come and beg mumpsys pardon whether you meant to do it or no because little doggies cant tell thathow should they and theres poor mumpsy thinking youre a great terrible rival that tries to squash him all flat to nothing on purpose pretending you didnt see and hes trembling poor dear wee pet and i may love my dog sir if i like and i do and i wont have him illtreated for hes never been jealous of you and he is a darling ten times truer than men and i love him fifty times better so come to him with me first a smile changed richards face then laughing a melancholy laugh he surrendered to her humour and went through the form of begging mumpsys pardon the dear dog i do believe he saw we were getting dull said she and immolated himself intentionally noble animal well well act as if we thought so let us be gay richard and not part like ancient fogies wheres your fun you can rattle why dont you you havent seen me in one of my charactersnot sir julius wait a couple of minutes she ran out a white visage reappeared behind a spring of flame her black hair was scattered over her shoulders and fell half across her brows she moved slowly and came up to him fastening weird eyes on him pointing a finger at the region of witches sepulchral cadences accompanied the representation he did not listen for he was thinking what a deadly charming and exquisitely horrid witch she was something in the way her underlids worked seemed to remind him of a forgotten picture but a veil hung on the picture there could be no analogy for this was beautiful and devilish and that if he remembered rightly had the beauty of seraphs his reflections and her performance were stayed by a shriek the spirits of wine had run over the plate she held to the floor she had the coolness to put the plate down on the table while he stamped out the flame on the carpet again she shrieked she thought she was on fire he fell on his knees and clasped her skirts all round drawing his arms down them several times still kneeling he looked up and asked do you feel safe now she bent her face glaring down till the ends of her hair touched his cheek said she do you was she a witch verily there was sorcery in her breath sorcery in her hair the ends of it stung him like little snakes how do i do it dick she flung back laughing like you do everything bella he said and took breath there i wont be a witch i wont be a witch they may burn me to a cinder but i wont be a witch she sang throwing her hair about and stamping her feet i suppose i look a figure i must go and tidy myself no dont change i like to see you so he gazed at her with a mixture of wonder and admiration i cant think you the same personnot even when you laugh richard her tone was serious you were going to speak to me of my parents how wild and awful you looked bella my father richard was a very respectable man bella youll haunt me like a ghost my mother died in my infancy richard dont put up your hair bella i was an only child her head shook sorrowfully at the glistening fireirons he followed the abstracted intentness of her look and came upon her words ah yes speak of your father bella speak of him shall i haunt you and come to your bedside and cry tis time dear bella if you will tell me where he lives i will go to him he shall receive you he shall not refusehe shall forgive you if i haunt you you cant forget me richard let me go to your father bella let me go to him tomorrow ill give you my time its all i can give o bella let me save you so you like me best dishevelled do you you naughty boy ha ha and away she burst from him and up flew her hair as she danced across the room and fell at full length on the sofa he felt giddy bewitched well talk of everyday things dick she called to him from the sofa its our last

gentlemen made ofmade of such are young gentlemen made of after this trifling she sang a spanish ballad sweetly he was in the mood when imagination intensely vivifies everything mere suggestions of music sufficed the lady in the ballad had been wronged lo it was the lady before him and soft horns blew he smelt the languid nightflowers he saw the stars crowd large and close above the arid plain this lady leaning at her window desolate pouring out her abandoned heart heroes know little what they owe to champagne the lady wandered to venice thither he followed her at a leap in venice she was not happy he was prepared for the misery of any woman anywhere but oh to be with her to glide with phantommotion through throbbing street past houses muffled in shadow and gloomy legends under storied bridges past palaces charged with full life in dead quietness past grand old towers colossal squares gleaming quays and out and on with her on into the silver infinity shaking over seas was it the champagne the music or the poetry something of the two former perhaps but most the enchantress playing upon him how many instruments cannot clever women play upon at the same moment and this enchantress was not too clever or he might have felt her touch she was no longer absolutely bent on winning him or he might have seen a manoeuvre she liked himliked none better she wished him well her pique was satisfied still he was handsome and he was going what she liked him for she rathervery slightlywished to do away with or see if it could be done away with just as one wishes to catch a pretty butterfly without hurting its patterned wings no harm intended to the innocent insect only one wants to inspect it thoroughly and enjoy the marvel of it in ones tender possession and have the felicity of thinking one could crush it if one would he knew her what she was this lady in seville or in venice the spot was on her sailing the pathways of the moon it was not celestial light that illumined her beauty her sin was there but in dreaming to save he was soft to her sindrowned it in deep mournfulness silence and the rustle of her dress awoke him from his musing she swam wavelike to the sofa she was at his feet i have been light and careless tonight richard of course i meant it i must be happy with my best friend going to leave me those witch underlids were working brightly you will not forget me and i shall trytry her lips twitched she thought him such a very handsome fellow if i changeif i can change oh if you could know what a net im in richard now at those words as he looked down on her haggard loveliness not divine sorrow but a devouring jealousy sprang like fire in his breast and set him rocking with horrid pain he bent closer to her pale beseeching face her eyes still drew him down bella no no promise me swear it lost richard lost for ever give me up he cried i never will and strained her in his arms and kissed her passionately on the lips she was not acting now as she sidled and slunk her halfaverted head with a kind of maiden shame under his arm sighing heavily weeping clinging to him it was wicked truth not a word of love between them was ever hero in this fashion won chapter xxxix at a season when the pleasant southwestern island has few attractions to other than invalids and hermits enamoured of wind and rain the potent nobleman lord mountfalcon still lingered there to the disgust of his friends and special parasite mounts in for it again they said among themselves hang the women was a natural sequence for dont you see what a shame it was of the women to be always kindling such a very inflammable subject all understood that cupid had twanged his bow and transfixed a peer of britain for the fiftieth time but none would perceive though he vouched for it with his most eloquent oaths that this was a totally different case from the antecedent ones so it had been sworn to them too frequently before he was as a man with mighty tidings and no language intensely communicative but inarticulate good round oaths had formerly compassed and expounded his noble emotions they were now quite beyond the comprehension of blasphemy even when emphasized and by this the poor lord divinely felt the case was different there is something impressive in a great human hulk writhing under the unutterable torments of a mastery he cannot contend with or account for or explain by means of intelligible words at first he took refuge in the depths of his contempt for women cupid gave him line when he had come to vent his worst of them the fair face now stamped on his brain beamed the more triumphantly so the harpooned whale rose to the surface and after a few convulsions surrendered his huge length my lord was in love with richards young wife he gave proofs of it by burying himself beside her to her could she have seen it he gave further proofs of a real devotion in affecting and in her presence feeling nothing beyond a lively interest in her wellbeing this wonder that when near her he should be cool and composed and when away from her wrapped in a tempest of desires was matter for what powers of cogitation the heavy nobleman possessed the hon peter tired of his journeys to and fro urged him to press the business lord mountfalcon was wiser or more scrupulous than his parasite almost every evening he saw lucy the inexperienced little wife apprehended no harm in his visits moreover richard had commended her to the care of lord mountfalcon and lady judith lady judith had left the island for london lord mountfalcon remained there could be no harm if she had ever thought so she no longer did secretly perhaps she was flattered lord mountfalcon was as well educated as it is the fortune of the run of titled elder sons to be he could talk and instruct he was a lord and he let her understand that he was wicked very wicked and that she improved him the heroine in common with the hero has her ambition to be of use in the worldto do some good and the task of reclaiming a bad man is extremely seductive to good women dear to their tender bosoms as old china is a bad man they are mending lord mountfalcon had none of the arts of a libertine his gold his title and his person had hitherto preserved him from having long to sigh in vain or sigh at all possibly the hon peter did his villanies for him no alarm was given to lucys pure instinct as might have been the case had my lord been overadept it was nice in her martyrdom to have a true friend to support her and really to be able to do something for that friend too simpleminded to think much of his lordships position she was yet a woman he a great nobleman does not scorn to acknowledge me and think something of me may have been one of the halfthoughts passing through her now and then as she reflected in selfdefence on the proud family she had married into january was watering and freezing old earth by turns when the hon peter travelled down to the sun of his purse with great news he had no sooner broached his lordships immediate weakness than mountfalcon began to plunge like a heavy dragoon in difficulties he swore by this and that he had come across an angel for his sins and would do her no hurt the next moment he swore she must be his though she cursed like a cat his lordships illustrations were not choice i havent advanced an inch he groaned brayder upon my soul that little woman could do anything with me by heaven id marry her tomorrow here i am seeing her every day in the week out or in and what do you think she gets me to talk abouthistory isnt it enough to make a fellow mad and there am i lecturing like a prig and by heaven while im at it i feel a pleasure in it and when i leave the house i should feel an immense gratification in shooting somebody what do they say in town not much said brayder significantly whens that fellowher husbandcoming down i rather hope weve settled him for life mount nobleman and parasite exchanged looks how dye mean brayder hummed an air and broke it to say hes in for don juan at a gallop thats all the deuce has bella got him mountfalcon asked with eagerness brayder handed my lord a letter it was dated from the sussex coast signed richard and was worded thus my beautiful devil since were both devils together and have found each other out come to me at once or i shall be going somewhere in a hurry come my bright hellstar i ran away from you and now i ask you to come to me you have taught me how devils love and i cant do without you come an hour after you receive this mountfalcon turned over the letter to see if there was any more complimentary loveepistle he remarked and rising from his chair and striding about muttered the dog how infamously he treats his wife very bad said brayder how did you get hold of this strolled into bellas dressingroom waiting for her turned over her pincushion haphazard you know her trick by jove i think that girl does it on purpose thank heaven i havent written her any letters for an age is she going to him not she but its odd mountdid you ever know her refuse money before she tore up the cheque in style and presented me the fragments with two or three of the delicacies of language she learnt at your academy i rather like to hear a woman swear it embellishes her mountfalcon took counsel of his parasite as to the end the letter could be made to serve both conscientiously agreed that richards behaviour to his wife was infamous and that he at least deserved no mercy but said his lordship it wont do to show the letter at first shell be swearing its false and then shell stick to him closer i know the sluts the rule of contrary said brayder carelessly she must see the trahison with her eyes they believe their eyes theres your chance mount you step in you give her revenge and consolationtwo birds at one shot thats what they like youre an ass brayder the nobleman exclaimed youre an infernal blackguard you talk of this little woman as if she and other women were all of a piece i dont see anything i gain by this confounded letter her husbands a brutethats clear will you leave it to me mount be damned before i do muttered my lord thank you now see how this will end youre too soft mount youll be made a fool of i tell you brayder theres nothing to be done if i carry her offive been on the point of doing it every daywhatll come of that shell looki cant stand her eyesi shall be a foolworse off with her than i am now mountfalcon yawned despondently and what do you think he pursued isnt it enough to make a fellow gnash his teeth sheshe mentioned something in an underbreath and turned red as he said it hm brayder put up his mouth and rapped the handle of his cane on his chin thats disagreeable mount you dont exactly want to act in that character you havent got a diploma bother do you think i love her a bit less broke out my lord in a frenzy by heaven id read to her by her bedside and talk that infernal history to her if it pleased her all day and all night youre evidently graduating for a midwife mount the nobleman appeared silently to accept the imputation what do they say in town he asked again brayder said the sole question was whether it was maid wife or widow ill go to her this evening mountfalcon resumed afterto judge by the cast of his facereflecting deeply ill go to her this evening she shall know what infernal torment she makes me suffer do you mean to say she dont know it hasnt an ideathinks me a friend and so by heaven ill be to her ahm went the honourable peter this way to the sign of the green man ladies do you want to be pitched out of the window brayder once was enough mount the salvage man is strong i may have forgotten the trick of alighting on my feet therethere ill be sworn shes excessively innocent and thinks you a disinterested friend ill go to her this evening mountfalcon repeated she shall know what damned misery it is to see her in such a position i cant hold out any longer deceits horrible to such a girl as that id rather have her cursing me than speaking and looking as she does dear little girlshes only a child you havent an idea how sensible that little woman is have you inquired the cunning one my belief is brayder that there are angels among women said mountfalcon evading his parasites eye as he spoke to the world lord mountfalcon was the thoroughly wicked man his parasite simply ingeniously dissipated full many a man of god had thought it the easier task to reclaim the hon peter lucy received her noble friend by firelight that evening and sat much in the shade she offered to have the candles brought in he begged her to allow the room to remain as it was i have something to say to you he observed with a certain solemnity yesto me said lucy quickly lord mountfalcon knew he had a great deal to say but how to say it and what it exactly was he did not know you conceal it admirably he began but you must be very lonely herei fear unhappy i should have been lonely but for your kindness my lord said lucy i am not unhappy her face was in shade and could not belie her is there any help that one who would really be your friend might give you mrs feverel none indeed that i know of lucy replied who can help us to pay for our sins at least you may permit me to endeavour to pay my debts since you have helped me to wash out some of any sins ah my lord said lucy not displeased it is sweet for a woman to believe she has drawn the serpents teeth i tell you the truth lord mountfalcon went on what object could i have in deceiving you i know you quite above flatteryso different from other women oh pray do not say that interposed lucy according to my experience then but you say you have met suchsuch very bad women i have and now that i meet a good one it is my misfortune your misfortune lord mountfalcon yes and i might say more his lordship held impressively mute how strange men are thought lucy he had some unhappy secret tom bakewell who had a habit of coming into the room on various pretences during the noblemans visits put a stop to the revelation if his lordship intended to make any when they were alone again lucy said smiling do you know i am always ashamed to ask you to begin to read mountfalcon stared to readoh ha yes he remembered his evening duties very happy im sure let me see where were we the life of the emperor julian but indeed i feel quite ashamed to ask you to read my lord its new to me like a new worldhearing about emperors and armies and things that really have been on the earth we walk upon it fills my mind but it must have ceased to interest you and i was thinking that i would not tease you any more your pleasure is mine mrs feverel pon my honour id read till i was hoarse to hear your remarks are you laughing at me do i look so lord mountfalcon had fine full eyes and by merely dropping the lids he could appear to endow them with mental expression no you are not said lucy i must thank you for your forbearance the nobleman went on his honour loudly now it was an object of lucys to have him reading for his sake for her sake and for somebody elses sake which somebody else was probably considered first in the matter when he was reading to her he seemed to be legitimizing his presence there and though she had no doubts or suspicions whatever she was easier in her heart while she had him employed in that office so she rose to fetch the book laid it open on the table at his lordships elbow and quietly waited to ring for candles when he should be willing to commence that evening lord mountfalcon could not get himself up to the farce and he felt a pity for the strangely innocent unprotected child with anguish hanging over her that withheld the words he wanted to speak or insinuate he sat silent and did nothing what i do not like him for said lucy meditatively is his changing his religion he would have been such a hero but for that i could have loved him who is it you could have loved mrs feverel lord mountfalcon asked the emperor julian oh the emperor julian well he was an apostate but then you know he meant what he was about he didnt even do it for a woman for a woman cried lucy what man would for a woman i would you lord mountfalcon yes id turn catholic tomorrow you make me very unhappy if you say that my lord then ill unsay it lucy slightly shuddered she put her hand upon the bell to ring for lights do you reject a convert mrs feverel said the nobleman oh yes yes i do one who does not give his conscience i would not have if he gives his heart and body can he give more lucys hand pressed the bell she did not like the doubtful light with one who was so unscrupulous lord mountfalcon had never spoken in this way before he spoke better too she missed the aristocratic twang in his voice and the hesitation for words and the fluid lordliness with which he rolled over difficulties in speech simultaneously with the sounding of the bell the door opened and presented tom bakewell there was a double knock at the same instant at the street door lucy delayed to give orders can it be a letter tomso late she said changing colour pray run and see that ant powst tom remarked as he obeyed his mistress are you very anxious for a letter mrs feverel lord mountfalcon inquired oh noyes i am very said lucy her quick ear caught the tones of a voice she remembered that dear old thing has come to see me she cried starting up tom ushered a bunch of black satin into the room mrs berry said lucy running up to her and kissing her me my darlin mrs berry breathless and rosy with her journey returned the salute me truly it is in fault of a better for i aint one to stand by and give the devil his licenceroamin and the salt sure enough have spilte my bridegown at the beginnin which aint the best sign bless yeoh here he is she beheld a male figure in a chair by the half light and swung around to address him you bad man she held aloft one of her fat fingers ive come on ye like a bolt i have and goin to make ye do your duty naughty boy but youre my darlin babe she melted as was her custom and ill never meet you and not give to ye the kiss of a mother before lord mountfalcon could find time to expostulate the soft woman had him by the neck and was down among his luxurious whiskers ha she gave a smothered shriek and fell back what hairs that tom bakewell just then illumined the transaction oh my gracious mrs berry breathed with horror i been and kiss a strange man lucy halflaughing but in dreadful concern begged the noble lord to excuse the woful mistake extremely flattered highly favoured im sure said his lordship rearranging his disconcerted moustache may i beg the pleasure of an introduction my husbands dear old nursemrs berry said lucy taking her hand to lend her countenance lord mountfalcon mrs berry mrs berry sought grace while she performed a series of apologetic bobs and wiped the perspiration from her forehead lucy put her into a chair lord mountfalcon asked for an account of her passage over to the island receiving distressingly full particulars by which it was revealed that the softness of her heart was only equalled by the weakness of her stomach the recital calmed mrs berry down well and wheres mywheres mr richard yer husband my dear mrs berry turned from her tale to question did you expect to see him here said lucy in a broken voice and where else my love since he havent been seen in london a whole fortnight lucy did not speak we will dismiss the emperor julian till tomorrow i think said lord mountfalcon rising and bowing lucy gave him her hand with mute thanks he touched it distantly embraced mrs berry in a farewell bow and was shown out of the house by tom bakewell the moment he was gone mrs berry threw up her arms did ye ever know sich a horrid thing to go and happen to a virtuous woman she exclaimed i could

and i cannot cannot help crying mrs berry mrs berry was inclined to be miserable at what she heard from lucys lips and she was herself full of dire apprehension but it was never this excellent creatures system to be miserable in company the sight of a sorrow that was not positive and could not refer to proof set her resolutely the other way fiddlefaddle she said id like to see him repent he

matrimony pointed especially at young couples i should a been a fool if i hadnt suffered myself she confessed so ill thank my berry if i makes you wise in season lucy smoothed her ruddy plump cheeks and gazed up affectionately into the soft womans kind brown eyes endearing phrases passed from mouth to mouth and as she gazed lucy blushed as one who has something very secret to tell very sweet very strange but cannot quite bring herself to speak it well theses three men in my life i kissed said mrs berry too much absorbed in her extraordinary adventure to notice the young wifes struggling bosom

you are a very ungenerous suspicious naughty old woman said lucy chiding her and youre a silly unsuspectin little bird mrs berry retorted as she returned her taps on the cheek you havent told me what

let it come all at once on him and thinks helosin breath im a father nor a hint even you havent give him lucy kissed her to indicate it was quite a secret oh you are a sweet one said bessy berry and rocked her more closely and lovingly then these two had a whispered conversation from which let all of male persuasion retire a space nothing under one mile returning after a due interval we see mrs berry counting on her fingers ends concluding the sum she cries prophetically now this right everythinga baby in the balance now i say this angelinfant come from on high its gods messenger my love and its not wrong to say so he thinks you worthy or you wouldnt a had onenot for all the tryin in the world you wouldnt and some tries hard enough poor creatures now let us rejice and make merry im for

dont you understand now mrs berry smacked her knees only to think of her bein that thoughtful and she a catholic too never tell me that people of one religion aint as good as another after that why you want to make him a historian to be sure and that rake of a lord whove been comin here playin at wolf you been and made himunbeknown to himselfsort o tutor to the unborn blessed ha ha say that little women aint got art ekal to the cunningest of em oh i understand why to be sure didnt i know a lady a widow of a clergyman he was a postermost child and afore his birth that women read nothin but blairs grave over and over again from the end to the beginninthats a serious bookvery hard readinand at four years of age that child that come of it reelly was the piousest infanthe was like a little curate his eyes was up he talked so solemn mrs berry imitated the little curates appearance and manner of speaking so she got her wish for one but at this lady lucy laughed they chattered on happily till bedtime lucy arranged for mrs berry to sleep with her if its not dreadful to ye my sweet sleepin beside a woman said mrs berry i know it were to me shortly after my berry and i felt it it dont somehow seem natral after matrimonya woman in your bed i was obliged to have somebody for the cold sheets do give ye the creeps when youve been used to that thats different upstairs they went together lucy not sharing these objections then lucy opened certain drawers and exhibited pretty caps and laced linen all adapted for a very small body all the work of her own hands and mrs berry praised them and her you been guessing a boywomanlike she said then they cooed and kissed and undressed by the fire and knelt at the bedside with their arms about each other praying both praying for the unborn child and mrs berry pressed lucys waist the moment she was about to breathe the petition to heaven to shield and bless that coming life and thereat lucy closed to her and felt a strong love for her then lucy got into bed first leaving berry to put out the light and before she did so berry leaned over her and eyed her roguishly saying i never see ye like this but im half in love with ye myself you blushin beauty sweets your eyes and your hair do take one solyin back id never forgive my father if he kep me away from ye fourandtwenty hours just husband o that berry pointed at the young wifes loveliness ye look so ripe with kisses and there they are alanguishin you never look so but in your bed ye beautyjust as it ought to be lucy had to pretend to rise to put out the light before berry would give up her amorous chaste soliloquy then they lay in bed and mrs berry fondled her and arranged for their departure tomorrow and reviewed richards emotions when he came to hear he was going to be made a father by her and hinted at lucys delicious shivers when richard was again in his rightful place which she bessy berry now usurped and all sorts of amorous sweet things enough to make one fancy the adage subverted that stolen fruits are sweetest she drew such glowing pictures of bliss within the law and the limits of the conscience till at last worn out lucy murmured peepy dear berry and the soft woman gradually ceased her chirp bessy berry did not sleep she lay thinking of the sweet brave heart beside her and listening to lucys breath as it came and went squeezing the fair sleepers hand now and then to ease her love as her reflections warmed a storm of wind came howling over the hampshire hills and sprang white foam on the water and shook the bare trees it passed leaving a thin cloth of snow on the wintry land the moon shone brilliantly berry heard the housedog bark his bark was savage and persistent she was roused by the noise by and by she fancied she heard a movement in the house then it seemed to her that the housedoor opened she cocked her ears and could almost make out voices in the midnight stillness she slipped from the bed locked and bolted the door of the room assured herself of lucys unconsciousness and went on tiptoe to the window the trees all stood white to the north the ground glittered the cold was keen berry wrapped her fat arms across her bosom and peeped as close over into the garden as the situation of the window permitted berry was a soft not a timid woman and it happened this night that her thoughts were above the fears of the dark she was sure of the voices curiosity without a shade of alarm held her on the watch and gathering bundles of her dayapparel round her neck and shoulders she silenced the chattering of her teeth as well as she could and remained stationary the low hum of the voices came to a break something was said in a louder tone the housedoor quietly shut a man walked out of the garden into the road he paused opposite her window and berry let the blind go back to its place and peeped from behind an edge of it he was in the shadow of the house so that it was impossible to discern much of his figure after some minutes he walked rapidly away and berry returned to the bed an icicle from which lucys limbs sensitively shrank next morning mrs berry asked tom bakewell if he had been disturbed in the night tom the mysterious said he had slept like a top mrs berry went into the garden the snow was partially melted all save one spot just under the portal and there she saw the print of a mans foot by some strange guidance it occurred to her to go and find one of richards boots she did so and unperceived she measured the sole of the boot in that solitary footmark there could be no doubt that it fitted she tried it from heel to toe a dozen times chapter xl sir austin feverel had come to town with the serenity of a philosopher who says tis now time and the satisfaction of a man who has not arrived thereat without a struggle he had almost forgiven his son his deep love for him had wellnigh shaken loose from wounded pride and more tenacious vanity stirrings of a remote sympathy for the creature who had robbed him of his son and hewed at his system were in his heart of hearts this he knew and in his own mind he took credit for his softness but the world must not suppose him soft the world must think he was still acting on his system otherwise what would his long absence signifysomething highly unphilosophical so though love was strong and was moving him to a straightforward course the last tug of vanity drew him still aslant the aphorist read himself so well that to juggle with himself was a necessity as he wished the world to see him he beheld himself one who entirely put aside mere personal feelings one in whom parental duty based on the science of life was paramount a scientific humanist in short he was therefore rather surprised at a coldness in lady blandishs manner when he did appear at last said the lady in a sad way that sounded reproachfully now the scientific humanist had of course nothing to reproach himself with but where was richard adrian positively averred he was not with his wife if he had gone said the baronet he would have anticipated me by a few hours this when repeated to lady blandish should have propitiated her and shown his great forgiveness she however sighed and looked at him wistfully their converse was not happy and deeply intimate philosophy did not seem to catch her mind and fine phrases encountered a rueful assent more flattering to their grandeur than to their influence days went by richard did not present himself sir austins pitch of selfcommand was to await the youth without signs of impatience seeing this the lady told him her fears for richard and mentioned the rumour of him that was about if said the baronet this person his wife is what you paint her i do not share your fears for him i think too well of him if she is one to inspire the sacredness of that union i think too well of him it is impossible the lady saw one thing to be done call her to you she said have her with you at raynham recognize her it is the disunion and doubt that so confuses him and drives him wild i confess to you i hoped he had gone to her it seems not if she is with you his way will be clear will you do that science is notoriously of slow movement lady blandishs proposition was far too hasty for sir austin women rapid by nature have no idea of science we shall see her there in time emmeline at present let it be between me and my son he spoke loftily in truth it offended him to be asked to do anything when he had just brought himself to do so much a month elapsed and richard appeared on the scene the meeting between him and his father was not what his father had expected and had crooned over in the welsh mountains richard shook his hand respectfully and inquired after his health with the common social solicitude he then said during your absence sir i have taken the liberty without consulting you to do something in which you are more deeply concerned than myself i have taken upon myself to find out my mother and place her under my care i trust you will not think i have done wrong i acted as i thought best sir austin replied you are of an age richard to judge for yourself in such a case i would have you simply beware of deceiving yourself in imagining that you considered any one but yourself in acting as you did i have not deceived myself sir said richard and the interview was over both hated an exposure of the feelings and in that both were satisfied but the baronet as one who loves hoped and looked for tones indicative of trouble and delight in the deep heart and richard gave him none of those the young man did not even face him as he spoke if their eyes met by chance richards were defiantly cold his whole bearing was changed this rash marriage has altered him said the very just man of science in life and that meant it has debased him he pursued his reflections i see in him the desperate maturity of a suddenlyripened nature and but for my faith that good work is never lost what should i think of the toil of my years lost perhaps to me lost to him it may show itself in his children the philosopher we may conceive has contentment in benefiting embryos but it was a somewhat bitter prospect to sir austin bitterly he felt the injury to himself one little incident spoke well of richard a poor woman called at the hotel while he was missing the baronet saw her and she told him a tale that threw christian light on one part of richards nature but this might gratify the father in sir austin it did not touch the man of science a feverel his son would not do less he thought he sat down deliberately to study his son no definite observations enlightened him richard ate and drank joked and laughed he was generally before adrian in calling for a fresh bottle he talked easily of current topics his gaiety did not sound forced in all he did nevertheless there was not the air of a youth who sees a future before him sir austin put that down it might be carelessness and wanton blood for no one could say he had much on his mind the man of science was not reckoning that richard also might have learned to act and wear a mask dead subjectsthis is to say people not on their guardhe could penetrate and dissect it is by a rare chance as scientific men well know that one has an opportunity of examining the structure of the living however that rare chance was granted to sir austin they were engaged to dine with mrs doria at the foreys and walked down to her in the afternoon father and son arminarm adrian beside them previously the offended father had condescended to inform his son that it would shortly be time for him to return to his wife indicating that arrangements would ultimately be ordered to receive her at raynham richard had replied nothing which might mean excess of gratitude or hypocrisy in concealing his pleasure or any one of the thousand shifts by which gratified human nature expresses itself when all is made to run smooth with it now mrs berry had her surprise ready charged for the young husband she had lucy in her own house waiting for him every day she expected him to call and be overcome by the rapturous surprise and every day knowing his habit of frequenting the park she marched lucy thither under the plea that master richard whom she had already christened should have an airing the round of the red winter sun was behind the bare kensington chestnuts when these two parties met happily for lucy and the hope she bore in her bosom she was perversely admiring a fair horsewoman galloping by at the moment mrs berry plucked at her gown once or twice to prepare her eyes for the shock but lucys head was still half averted and thinks mrs berry twont hurt her if she go into his arms head foremost they were close mrs berry performed the bob preliminary richard held her silent with a terrible face he grasped her arm and put her behind him other people intervened lucy saw nothing to account for berrys excessive flutter berry threw it on the air and some breakfast bacon which she said she knew in the morning while she ate it was bad for the bile and which probably was the cause of her bursting into tears much to lucys astonishment what you ate makes you cry mrs berry its all mrs berry pressed at her heart and leaned sideways its all stomach my dear dont ye mind and becoming aware of her unfashionable behaviour she trailed off to the shelter of the elms you have a singular manner with old ladies said sir austin to his son after berry had been swept aside scarcely courteous she behaved like a mad woman certainlyare you ill my son richard was deathpale his strong form smitten through with weakness the baronet sought adrians eye adrian had seen lucy as they passed and he had a glimpse of richards countenance while disposing of berry had lucy recognized them he would have gone to her unhesitatingly as she did not he thought it well under the circumstances to leave matters as they were he answered the baronets look with a shrug are you ill richard sir austin again asked his son come on sir come on cried richard his fathers further meditations as they stepped briskly to the foreys gave poor berry a character which one who lectures on matrimony and has kissed but three men in her life shrieks to hear the very title of richard will go to his wife tomorrow sir austin said to adrian some time before they went in to dinner adrian asked him if he had chanced to see a young fairhaired lady by the side of the old one richard had treated so peculiarly and to the baronets acknowledgment that he remembered to have observed such a person adrian said that was his wife sir sir austin could not dissect the living subject as if a bullet had torn open the young mans skull and some blast of battle laid his palpitating organization bare he watched every motion of his brain and his heart and with the grief and terror of one whose mental habit was ever to pierce to extremes not altogether conscious that he had hitherto played with life he felt that he was suddenly plunged into the stormful reality of it he projected to speak plainly to his son on all points that night richard is very gay mrs doris whispered her brother all will be right with him tomorrow he replied for the game had been in his hands so long so long had he been the god of the machine that having once resolved to speak plainly and to act he was to a certain extent secure bad as the thing to mend might be i notice he has rather a wild laughi dont exactly like his eyes said mrs doria you will see a change in him tomorrow the man of science remarked it was reserved for mrs doria herself to experience that change in the middle of the dinner a telegraphic message from her soninlaw worthy john todhunter reached the house stating that clare was alarmingly ill bidding her come instantly she cast about for some one to accompany her and fixed on richard before he would give his consent for richard to go sir austin desired to speak with him apart and in that interview he said to his son my dear richard it was my intention that we should come to an understanding together this night but the time is shortpoor helen cannot spare many minutes let me then say that you deceived me and that i forgive you we fix our seal on the past you will bring your wife to me when you return and very cheerfully the baronet looked down on the generous future he thus founded will you have her at raynham at once sir said richard yes my son when you bring her are you mocking me sir pray what do you mean i ask you to receive her at once well the delay cannot be long i do not apprehend that you will be kept from your happiness many days i think it will be some time sir said richard sighing deeply and what mental freak is this that can induce you to postpone it and play with your first duty what is my first duty sir since you are married to be with your wife i have heard that from an old woman called berry said richard to himself not intending irony will you receive her at once he asked resolutely the baronet was clouded by his sons reception of his graciousness his grateful prospect had formerly been richards marriagethe culmination of his system richard had destroyed his participation in that he now looked for a pretty scene in recompenserichard leading up his wife to him and both being welcomed by him paternally and so held one ostentatious minute in his embrace he said before you return i demur to receiving her very well sir replied his son and stood as if he had spoken all really you tempt me to fancy you already regret your rash proceeding the baronet exclaimed and the next moment it pained him he had uttered the words richards eyes were so sorrowfully fierce it pained him but he divined in that look a history and he could not refrain from glancing acutely and asking do you regret it sir the question aroused one of those struggles in the young mans breast which a passionate storm of tears may still and which sink like leaden death into the soul when tears come not richards eyes had the light of the desert do you his father repeated you tempt mei almost fear you do at the thoughtfor he expressed his mindthe pity that he had for richard was not pure gold ask me what i think of her sir ask me what she is ask me what it is to have taken one of gods precious angels and chained her to misery ask me what it is to have plunged a sword into her heart and to stand over her and see such a creature bleeding do i regret that why yes i do would you his eyes flew hard at his father under the ridge of his eyebrows sir austin winced and reddened did he understand there is ever in the minds eye a certain wilfulness we see and understand we see and wont understand tell me why you passed by her as you did this afternoon he said gravely and in the same voice richard answered i passed her because i could not do otherwise your wife richard yes my wife if she had seen you richard god spared her that mrs doria bustling in practical haste and bearing richards hat and greatcoat in her energetic hands came between them at this juncture dimples of commiseration were in her cheeks while she kissed her brothers perplexed forehead she forgot her trouble about clare deploring his fatuity sir austin was forced to let his son depart as of old he took counsel with adrian and the wise youth was soothing somebody has kissed him sir and the chaste boy cant get over it this absurd suggestion did more to appease the baronet than if adrian had given a veritable reasonable key to richards conduct it set him thinking that it might be a prudish strain in the young mans mind due to the system in difficulties i may have been wrong in one thing he said with an air of the utmost doubt of it i perhaps was wrong in allowing him so much liberty during his probation adrian pointed out to him that he had distinctly commanded it yes yes that is on me his was an order of mind that would accept the most burdensome charges and by some species of moral usury make a profit out of them clare was little talked of adrian attributed the employment of the telegraph to john todhunters uxorious distress at a toothache or possibly the first symptoms of an heir to his house that childs mind has disease in it she is not sound said the baronet on the doorstep of the hotel when they returned stood mrs berry her wish to speak a few words with the baronet reverentially communicated she was ushered upstairs into his room mrs berry compressed her person in the chair she was beckoned to occupy well maam you have something to say observed the baronet for she seemed loth to commence wishin i hadnt mrs berry took him up and mindful of the good rule to begin at the beginning pursued i dare say sir austin you dont remember me and i little thought when last we parted our meeting d be like this twenty year dont go over one without showin it no more than twenty ox its a might o timetwenty year leastways not quite twenty it aint round figures are best adrian remarked in them round figures a beloved son have growed up and got himself married said mrs berry diving straight into the case sir austin then learnt that he had before him the culprit who had assisted his son in that venture it was a stretch of his patience to hear himself addressed on a family matter but he was naturally courteous he came to my house sir austin a stranger if twenty year alters us as have knowed each other on the earth how must they alter they that we parted with just come from heaven and a heavenly babe he were so sweet so strong so fat adrian laughed aloud mrs berry bumped a curtsey to him in her chair continuing i wished afore i spoke to say how thankful am i bound to be for my pension not cut short as have offended so but that i know sir austin feverel raynham abbey aint one o them that likes to hear their good deeds pumlished and a pension to me now its something more than it were for a pension and pretty rosy cheeks in a maid which i wasthats a bait many a manll bite that wont so a forsaken wife if you will speak to the point maam i will listen to you the baronet interrupted her its the beginnin thats the worst and thats over thank the lord so ill speak sir austin and say my saylord speed me believin our idees o matrimony to be simlar then ill say once marriedmarried for life yes i dont even like widows for i cant stop at the grave not at the tomb i cant stop my husbands my husband and if im a body at the resurrection i say speaking humbly my berry is the husband o my body and to think of two claimin of me thenit makes me hot all over such is my notion of that state tween man and woman no givin in marriage o course i know and if so im single the baronet suppressed a smile really my good woman you wander very much beggin pardon sir austin but i has my point before me all the same and im comin to it acknowledgin our error itd done and bein done its writ aloft oh if you ony knew what a sweet young creature she be indeed taint all of humble birth thats unworthy sir austin and she got her idees too she reads history she talk that sensible as would surprise ye but for all that shes a prey to the artful o menunpertected and its a young marriagebut theres no fear for her as far as she go the fears tother way theres that in a manat the commencementwhich make of him lord knows what if you any way interferes whereas a woman bides quiet its consolation catch her which is what we mean by seduein whereas a manhes a savage sir austin turned his face to adrian who was listening with huge delight well maam i see you have something in your mind if you would only come to it quickly then heres my point sir austin i say you bred him so as there aint another young gentleman like him in england and proud he make me and as for her ill risk sayinits done and no harmyou might search england through and nowhere will ye find a maid thats his match like his own wife then there they be are they together as should be o lord no months they been divided then she all lonely and exposed i went and fetched her out of seducers wayswhich they may say what they like but the inncent is most open to when theyre healthy and confidini fetch her andthe libertyboxed her safe in my own house so much for that sweet that you may do with women but its himmr richardi am bold i know but thereim in for it and the lordll help me its him sir austin in this great metropolis warm from a young marriage its him andi say nothin of her and how sweet she bears it and its eating her at a time when natur should have no other trouble but the one thats goin onits him and i askso boldshall thereand a christian gentlemen his fathershall there be a tug tween him as a son and him as a husbandsoon to be somethin else i speak bold outid have sons obey their fathers but a priests words spoke over them which theyre now in my ears i say i aint a doubt on earthim sure there aint one in heavenwhich dootys the holier of the two sir austin heard her to an end their views on the junction of the sexes were undoubtedly akin to be lectured on his prime subject however was slightly disagreeable and to be obliged mentally to assent to this old ladys doctrine was rather humiliating when it could not be averred that he had latterly followed it out he sat crosslegged and silent a finger to his temple one gets so addlegated thinkin many things said mrs berry simply thats why we see wonder clever people goin wrongto my mind i think its alays the plan in a dielemmer to pray god and walk forward the keenwitted soft woman was tracking the baronets thoughts and she had absolutely run him down and taken an explanation out of his mouth by which mrs berry was to have been informed that he had acted from a principle of his own and devolved a wisdom she could not be expected to comprehend of course he became advised immediately that it would be waste of time to direct such an explanation to her inferior capacity he gave her his hand saying my son has gone out of town to see his cousin who is ill he will return in two or three days and then they will both come to me at raynham mrs berry took the tips of his fingers and went halfway to the floor perpendicularly he pass her like a stranger in the park this evenin she faltered ah said the baronet yes well they will be at raynham before the week is over mrs berry was not quite satisfied not of his own accord he pass that sweet young wife of his like a stranger this day sir austin i must beg you not to intrude further maam mrs berry bobbed her bunch of a body out of the room alls well that ends well she said to herself its just bad inquirin too close among men we must take em somethin like providenceas they come thank heaven i kep back the baby in mrs berrys eyes the baby was the victorious reserve adrian asked his chief what he thought of that specimen of woman i think i have not met a better in my life said the baronet mingling praise and sarcasm clare lies in her bed as placid as in the days when she breathed her white hands stretched their length along the sheets at peace from head to feet she needs iron no more richard is face to face with death for the first time he sees the sculpture of claythe spark gone clare gave her mother the welcome of the dead this child would have spoken nothing but kind commonplaces had she been alive she was dead and none knew her malady on her fourth finger were two weddingrings when hours of weeping had silenced the mothers anguish she for some comfort she saw in it pointed out that strange thing to richard speaking low in the chamber of the dead and then he learnt that it was his own lost ring clare wore in the two worlds he learnt from her husband that clares last request had been that neither of the rings should be removed she had written it she would not speak it i beg of my husband and all kind people who may have the care of me between this and the grave to bury me with my hands untouched the tracing of the words showed the bodily torment she was suffering as she wrote them on a scrap of paper found beside her pillow in wonder as the dim idea grew from the waving of clares dead hand richard paced the house and hung about the awful room dreading to enter it reluctant to quit it the secret clare had buried while she lived arose with her death he saw it play like flame across her marble features the memory of her voice was like a knife at his nerves his coldness to her started up accusingly her meekness was bitter blame on the evening of the fourth day her mother came to him in his bedroom with a face so white that he asked himself if aught worse could happen to a mother than the loss of her child choking she said to him read this and thrust a leatherbound pocketbook trembling in his hand she would not breathe to him what it was she entreated him not to open it before her tell me she said tell me what you think john must not hear of it i have nobody to consult but you o richard my diary was written in the round hand of clares childhood on the first page the first name his eye encountered was his own richards fourteenth birthday i have worked him a purse and put it under his pillow because he is going to have plenty of money he does not notice me now because he has a friend now and he is ugly but richard is not and never will be the occurrences of that day were subsequently recorded and a childish prayer to god for him set down step by step he saw her growing mind in his history as she advanced in years she began to look back and made much of little trivial remembrances all bearing upon him we went into the fields and gathered cowslips together and pelted each other and i told him he used to call them coalssleeps when he was a baby and he was angry at my telling him for he does not like to be told he was ever a baby he remembered the incident and remembered his stupid scorn of her meek affection little clare how she lived before him in her white dress and pink ribbons and soft dark eyes upstairs she was lying dead he read on mama says there is no one in the world like richard and i am sure there is not not in the whole world he says he is going to be a great general and going to the wars if he does i shall dress myself as a boy and go after him and he will not know me till i am wounded oh i pray he will never never be wounded i wonder what i should feel if richard was ever to die upstairs clare was lying dead lady blandish said there was a likeness between richard and me richard said i hope i do not hang down my head as she does he is angry with me because i do not look people in the face and speak out but i know i am not looking after earthworms yes he had told her that a shiver seized him at the recollection then it came to a period when the words richard kissed me stood by themselves and marked a day in her life afterwards it was solemnly discovered that richard wrote poetry he read one of his old forgotten compositions penned when he had that ambition thy truth to me is truer than horse or dog or blade thy vows to me are fewer than ever maiden made thou steppest from thy splendour to make my life a song my bosom shall be tender as thine has risen strong all the verses were transcribed it is he who is the humble knight clare explained at the close and his lady is a queen any queen would throw her crown away for him it came to that period when clare left raynham with her mother richard was not sorry to lose me he only loves boys and men something tells me i shall never see raynham again he was dressed in blue he said goodbye clare and kissed me on the cheek richard never kisses me on the mouth he did not know i went to his bed and kissed him while he was asleep he sleeps with one arm under his head and the other out on the bed i moved away a bit of his hair that was over his eyes i wanted to cut it i have one piece i do not let anybody see i am unhappy not even mama she says i want iron i am sure i do not i like to write my name clare doria forey richards is richard doria feverel his breast rose convulsively clare doria forey he knew the music of that name he had heard it somewhere it sounded faint and mellow now behind the hills of death he could not read for tears it was midnight the hour seemed to belong to her the awful stillness and the darkness were clares clares voice clear and cold from the grave possessed it painfully with blinded eyes he looked over the breathless pages she spoke of his marriage and her finding the ring i knew it was his i knew he was going to be married that morning i saw him stand by the altar when they laughed at breakfast his wife must be so beautiful richards wife perhaps he will love me better now he is married mama says they must be separated that is shameful if i can help him i will i pray so that he may be happy i hope god hears poor sinners prayers i am very sinful nobody knows it as i do they say i am good but i know when i look on the ground i am not looking after earthworms as he said oh do forgive me god then she spoke of her own marriage and that it was her duty to obey her mother a blank in the diary ensued i have seen richard richard despises me was the next entry but now as he read his eyes were fixed and the delicate feminine handwriting like a black thread drew on his soul to one terrible conclusion i cannot live richard despises me i cannot bear the touch of my fingers or the sight of my face oh i understand him now he should not have kissed me so that last time i wished to die while his mouth was on mine further i have no escape richard said he would die rather than endure it i know he would why should i be afraid to do what he would do i think if my husband whipped me i could bear it better he is so kind and tries to make me cheerful he will soon be very unhappy i pray to god half the night i seem to be losing sight of my god the more i pray richard laid the book open on the table phantom surges seemed to be mounting and travelling for his brain had clare taken his wild words in earnest did she lie there deadhe shrouded the thought he wrapped the thoughts in shrouds but he was again reading a quarter to one oclock i shall not be alive this time tomorrow i shall never see richard now i dreamed last night we were in the fields together and he walked with his arm round my waist we were children but i thought we were married and i showed him i wore his ring and he saidif you always wear it clare you are as good as my wife then i made a vow to wear it for ever and ever it is not mamas fault she does not think as richard and i do of these things he is not a coward nor am i he hates cowards i have written to his father to make him happy perhaps when i am dead he will hear what i say i heard just now richard call distinctlyclare come out to me surely he has not gone i am going i know not where i cannot think i am very cold the words were written larger and staggered towards the close as if her hand had lost mastery over the pen i can only remember richard now a boy a little boy and a big boy i am not sure now of his voice i can only remember certain words clari and don ricardo and his laugh he used to be full of fun once we laughed all day together tumbling in the hay then he had a friend and began to write poetry and be proud if i had married a young man he would have forgiven me but i should not have been happier i must have died god never looks on me it is past two oclock the sheep are bleating outside it must be very cold in the ground goodbye richard with his name it began and ended even to herself clare was not overcommunicative the book was slender yet her nineteen years of existence left half the number of pages white those last words drew him irresistibly to gaze on her there she lay the same impassive clare for a moment he wondered she had not movedto him she had become so different she who had just filled his ears with strange tidingsit was not possible to think her dead she seemed to have been speaking to him all through his life his image was on that still heart he dismissed the nightwatchers from the room and remained with her alone till the sense of death oppressed him and then the shock sent him to the window to look for sky and stars behind a low broad pine hung with frosty mist he heard a bellwether of the flock in the silent fold death in life it sounded the mother found him praying at the foot of clares bed she knelt by his side and they prayed and their joint sobs shook their bodies but neither of them shed many tears they held a dark unspoken secret in common they prayed god to forgive her clare was buried in the family vault of the todhunters her mother breathed no wish to have her lying at lobourne after the funeral what they alone upon earth knew brought them together richard she said the worst is over for me i have no one to love but you dear we have all been fighting against god and this richard you will come with me and be united to your wife and spare my brother what i suffer he answered the broken spirit i have killed one she sees me as i am i cannot go with you to my wife because i am not worthy to touch her hand and were i to go i should do this to silence my selfcontempt go you to her and when she asks of me say i have a death upon my head thatno say that i am abroad seeking for that which shall cleanse me if i find it i shall come to claim her if not god help us all she had no strength to contest his solemn words or stay him and he went forth chapter xli a man with a beard saluted the wise youth adrian in the full blaze of piccadilly with a clap on the shoulder adrian glanced leisurely behind do you want to try my nerves my dear fellow im not a man of fashion happily or you would have struck the seat of them how are you that was his welcome to austin wentworth after his long absence austin took his arm and asked for news with the hunger of one who had been in the wilderness five years the whigs have given up the ghost my dear austin the free briton is to receive libertys pearl the ballot the aristocracy has had a cycles notice to quit the monarchy and old madeira are going out demos and cape wines are coming in they call it reform so you see your absence has worked wonders depart for another five years and you will return to ruined stomachs cracked sconces general upset an equality made perfect by universal prostration austin indulged him in a laugh i want to hear about ourselves how is old ricky you know of hiswhat do they call it when greenhorns are licensed to jump into the milkpails of dairymaidsa very charming little woman she makes by the waypresentable quite old anacreons rose in milk well everybody thought the system must die of it not a bit it continued to flourish in spite its in a consumption now thoughemaciated lean raw spectral ive this morning escaped from raynham to avoid the sight of it i have brought our genial uncle hippias to towna delightful companion i said to him weve had a fine spring ugh he answers theres a time when you come to think the spring old you should have heard how he trained out the old i felt something like decay in my sap just to hear him in the prizefight of life my dear austin our uncle hippias has been unfairly hit below the belt lets guard ourselves there and go and order dinner but wheres ricky now and what is he doing said austin ask what he has done the miraculous boy has gone and got a baby a child richard has one austins clear eyes shone with pleasure i suppose its not common among your tropical savages he has one one as big as two that has been the deathblow to the system it bore the marriagethe baby was too much for it could it swallow the baby twould live she the wonderful woman has produced a large boy i assure you its quite amusing to see the system opening its mouth every hour of the day trying to gulp him down aware that it would be a consummate cure or a happy release by degrees austin learnt the baronets proceedings and smiled sadly how has ricky turned out he asked what sort of a character has he the poor boy is ruined by his excessive anxiety about it character he has the character of a bullet with a treble charge of powder behind it enthusiasm is the powder that boy could get up an enthusiasm for the maiden days of ops he was going to reform the world after your fashion austinyou have something to answer for unfortunately he began with the feminine side of it cupid proud of phoebus newly slain or pluto wishing to people his kingdom if you like put it into the soft head of one of the guileless grateful creatures to kiss him for his good work oh horror he never expected that conceive the system in the flesh and you have our richard the consequence is that this male peri refuses to enter his paradise though the gates are open for him the trumpets blow and the fair unspotted one awaits him fruitful within we heard of him last that he was trying the german waterspreparatory to his undertaking the release of italy from the subjugation of the teuton lets hope theyll wash him he is in the company of lady judith felleyour old friend the ardent female radical who married the decrepit to carry out her principles they always marry english lords or foreign princes i admire their tactics judith is bad for him in such a state i like her but she was always too sentimental said austin sentiment made her marry the old lord i suppose i like her for her sentiment austin sentimental people are sure to live long and die fat feeling thats the slayer coz sentiment tis the cajolery of existence the soft bloom which whoso weareth he or she is enviable would that i had more youre not much changed adrian im not a radical austin further inquiries responded to in adrians figurative speech instructed austin that the baronet was waiting for his son in a posture of statuesque offended paternity before he would receive his daughterinlaw and grandson that was what adrian meant by the efforts of the system to swallow the baby were in a tangle said the wise youth time will extricate us i presume or what is the venerable signor good for austin mused some minutes and asked for lucys place of residence well go to her by and by said adrian i shall go and see her now said austin well well go and order the dinner first coz give me her address really austin you carry matters with too long a beard adrian objected dont you care what you eat he roared hoarsely looking humorously hurt i daresay not a slice out of him thats handysauce du ciel go batten on the baby cannibal dinner at seven adrian gave him his own address and lucys and strolled off to do the better thing overnight mrs berry had observed a long stranger in her teacup posting him on her fingers and starting him with a smack he had vaulted lightly and thereby indicated that he was positively coming the next day she forgot him in the bustle of her duties and the absorption of her faculties in thoughts of the incomparable stranger lucy had presented to the world till a knock at the streetdoor reminded her there he is she cried as she ran to open to him theres my stranger come never was a womans faith in omens so justified the stranger desired to see mrs richard feverel he said his name was mr austin wentworth mrs berry clasped her hands exclaiming come at last and ran bolt out of the house to look up and down the street presently she returned with many excuses for her rudeness saying i expected to see her comin home mr wentworth every day twice a day she go out to give her blessed angel an airing no leavin the child with nursemaids for her she is a mother and good milk too thank the lord though her hearts so low indoors mrs berry stated who she was related the history of the young couple and her participation in it and admired the beard although id swear you dont wear it for ornament now she said having in the first impulse designed a stroke at mans vanity ultimately mrs berry spoke of the family complication and with dejected head and joined hands threw out dark hints about richard while austin was giving his cheerfuller views of the case lucy came in preceding the baby i am austin wentworth he said taking her hand they read each others faces these two and smiled kinship your name is lucy she affirmed it softly and mine is austin as you know mrs berry allowed time for lucys charms to subdue him and presented richards representative who seeing a new face suffered himself to be contemplated before he commenced crying aloud and knocking at the doors of nature for something that was due to him aint he a lusty darlin says mrs berry aint he like his own father there cant be no doubt about zoo zoo pitty pet look at his fists aint he got passion aint he a splendid roarer oh and she went off rapturously into babylanguage a fine boy certainly mrs berry exhibited his legs for further proof desiring austins confirmation as to their being dumplings lucy murmured a word of excuse and bore the splendid roarer out of the room she might a done it here said mrs berry theres no prettier sight i say if her dear husband could but see that hes off in his heroicshe want to be doin all sorts o things i say hell never do anything grander than that baby you should a seen her uncle over that babyhe came here for i said you shall see your own family my dear and so she thinks he come and he

innocence its a sight to see him with that baby my belief is hes unhappy cause he cant anyways be nursemaid to him o mr wentworth what do you think of her sir austins reply was as satisfactory as a mans poor speech could make it he heard that lady feverel was in the house and mrs berry prepared the way for him to pay his respects to her then mrs berry ran to lucy and the house buzzed with new life the simple creatures felt in austins presence something good among them he dont speak much said mrs berry but i see by his eye he mean a deal he aint one o yer longword gentry whos all gay deceivers every one of em lucy pressed the hearty suckling into her breast i wonder what he thinks of me mrs berry i could not speak to him i loved him before i saw him i knew what his face was like

sorrow my sweetand my berry talkin of his roman matronsheres a english wifell match em all thats what he thinks and now that leetle dark under yer eyell clear my darlin now heve come mrs berry looked to no more than that lucy to no more than the peace she had in being near richards best friend when she sat down to tea it was with a sense that the little room that held her was her home perhaps for many a day a chop procured and cooked by mrs berry formed austins dinner during the meal he entertained them with anecdotes of his travels poor lucy had no temptation to try to conquer austin that heroic weakness of hers was gone mrs berry had said three cupsi goes no further and lucy had rejected the proffer of more tea when austin who was in the thick of a brazilian forest asked her if she was a good traveller i mean can you start at a minutes notice lucy hesitated and then said yes decisively to which mrs berry added that she was not a luggagewoman there used to be a train at seven oclock austin remarked consulting his watch the two women were silent could you get ready to come with me to raynham in ten minutes austin looked as if he had asked a commonplace question lucys lips parted to speak she could not answer loud rattled the teaboard to mrs berrys dropping hands joy and deliverance she exclaimed with a foundering voice will you come austin kindly asked again lucy tried to stop her beating heart as she answered yes mrs berry cunningly pretended to interpret the irresolution in her tones with a mighty whisper shes thinking whats to be done with baby he must learn to travel said austin oh cried mrs berry and ill be his nuss and bear him a sweet oh and think of it me nursemaid once more at raynham abbey but its nursewoman now you must say let us be goin on the spot she started up and away in hot haste fearing delay would cool the heavensent resolve austin smiled eying his watch and lucy alternately she was wishing to ask a multitude of questions his face reassured her and saying i will be dressed instantly she also left the room talking bustling preparing wrapping up my lord and looking to their neatnesses they were nevertheless ready within the time prescribed by austin and mrs berry stood humming over the baby hell sleep it through she said hes had enough for an alderman and goes to sleep sound after his dinner he do a duck before they departed lucy ran up to lady feverel she returned for the small one one moment mr wentworth just two said austin master richard was taken up and when lucy came back her eyes were full of tears she thinks she is never to see him again mr wentworth she shall austin said simply off they went and with austin near her lucy forgot to dwell at all upon the great act of courage she was performing i do hope baby will not wake was her chief solicitude he cries nursewoman berry from the rear his little tumtums as tight as he can hold a pet a lamb a bird a beauty and ye may take yer oath he never wakes till thats slack heve got character of his own a blessed there are some tremendous citadels that only want to be taken by storm the baronet sat alone in his library sick of resistance and rejoicing in the pride of no surrender a terror to his friends and to himself hearing austins name sonorously pronounced by the man of calves he looked up from his book and held out his hand glad to see you austin his appearance betokened complete security the next minute he found himself escaladed it was a cry from mrs berry that told him others were in the room besides austin lucy stood a little behind the lamp mrs berry close to the door the door was half open and passing through it might be seen the petrified figure of a fine man the baronet glancing over the lamp rose at mrs berrys signification of a womans personality austin stepped back and led lucy to him by the hand i have brought richards wife sir he said with a pleased perfectly uncalculating countenance that was disarming very pale and trembling lucy bowed she felt her two hands taken and heard a kind voice could it be possible it belonged to the dreadful father of her husband she lifted her eyes nervously her hands were still detained the baronet contemplated richards choice had he ever had a rivalry with those pure eyes he saw the pain of her position shooting across her brows and uttering gentle inquiries as to her health placed her in a seat mrs berry had already fallen into a chair what aspect do you like for your bedroomeast said the baronet lucy was asking herself wonderingly am i to stay perhaps you had better take to richards room at once he pursued you have the lobourne valley there and a good morning air and will feel more at home lucys colour mounted mrs berry gave a short cough as one who should say the day is ours undoubtedlystrange as it was to think itthe fortress was carried lucy is rather tired said austin and to hear her christian name thus bravely spoken brought grateful dew to her eyes the baronet was about to touch the bell but have you come alone he asked at this mrs berry came forward not immediately it seemed to require effort for her to move and when she was within the region of the lamp her agitation could not escape notice the blissful bundle shook in her arms by the way what is he to me austin inquired generally as he went and unveiled the younger hope of raynham my relationship is not so defined as yours sir an observer might have supposed that the baronet peeped at his grandson with the courteous indifference of one who merely wished to compliment the mother of anybodys child i really think hes like richard austin laughed lucy looked i am sure he is as like as one to one mrs berry murmured feebly but grandpapa not speaking she thought it incumbent on her to pluck up and hes as healthy as his father was sir austinspite o the might a beens reglar as the clock we never want a clock since he come we knows the hour o the day and of the night you nurse him yourself of course the baronet spoke to lucy and was satisfied on that point mrs berry was going to display his prodigious legs lucy fearing the consequent effect on the prodigious lungs begged her not to wake him td take a deal to do that said mrs berry and harped on master richards health and the small wonder it was that he enjoyed it considering the superior quality of his diet and the lavish attentions of his mother and then suddenly fell silent on a deep sigh he looks healthy said the baronet but i am not a judge of babies thus having capitulated raynham chose to acknowledge its new commandant who was now borne away under the directions of the housekeeper to occupy the room richard had slept in when an infant austin cast no thought on his success the baronet said she is extremely welllooking he replied a person you take to at once there it ended but a much more animated colloquy was taking place aloft where lucy and mrs berry sat alone lucy expected her to talk about the reception they had met with and the house and the peculiarities of the rooms and the solid happiness that seemed in store mrs berry all the while would persist in consulting the lookingglass her first distinct answer was my dear tell me candid how do i look very nice indeed mrs berry but could you have believed he would be so kind so considerate i am sure i looked a frump returned mrs berry oh dear two birds at a shot what do you think now i never saw so wonderful a likeness says lucy likeness look at me mrs berry was trembling and hot in the palms youre very feverish dear berry what can it be aint it like the loveflutters of a young gal my dear go to bed berry dear says lucy pouting in her soft caressing way i will undress you and see to you dear heart youve had so much excitement ha ha

into their calves i seen my berry your husband large as life lucy meditated on optical delusions but mrs berry described him as the colossus who had marched them into the library and vowed that he had recognized her and quaked time aint aged him said mrs berry whereas me heve got his excuse now i know i look a frump lucy kissed her you look the nicest dearest old thing you may say an old thing my

i tell you he shall come to you and fall on his knees to you and beg your forgiveness berry on his knees yes and he shall beg and pray you to forgive him if you get more from martin berry than breathaway words greatll be my wonder said mrs berry we will see said lucy thoroughly determined to do something for the good creature that had befriended her mrs berry examined her gown wont it seem were runnin after him she murmured faintly he is your husband mrs berry he may be wanting to come to you now oh where is all i was goin to say to that man when we met mrs berry ejaculated lucy had left the room on the landing outside the door lucy met a lady dressed in black who stopped her and asked if she was richards wife and kissed her passing from her immediately lucy despatched a message for austin and related the berry history austin sent for the great man and said do you know your wife is here before berry had time to draw himself up to enunciate his longest he was requested to step upstairs and as his young mistress at once led the way berry could not refuse to put his legs in motion and carry the stately edifice aloft of the interview mrs berry gave lucy a slight sketch that night he began in the old way my dear and says i a true heart and plain words martin berry so there he cuts himself and his johnson short and down he goesdown on his knees i never could a believed it i kep my dignity as a woman till i see that sight but that done for me i was a ripe apple in his arms fore i knew where i was theres something about a fine man on his knees thats too much for us women and it reely was the penitent on his two knees not the lover on his one if he mean it but ah what do you think he begs of me my dearnot to make it known in the house just yet i cant i cant say that look well lucy attributed it to his sense of shame at his conduct and mrs berry did her best to look on it in that light did the barnet kiss ye when you wished him goodnight she asked lucy said he had not then bide awake as long as ye can was mrs berrys rejoinder and now let us pray blessings on that simplespeaking gentleman who does so much cause he says so little like many other natural people mrs berry was only silly where her own soft heart was concerned as she secretly anticipated the baronet came into her room when all was quiet she saw him go and bend over richard the second and remain earnestly watching him he then went to the halfopened door of the room where lucy slept leaned his ear a moment knocked gently and entered mrs berry heard low words interchanging within she could not catch a syllable yet she would have sworn to the context heve called her his daughter promised her happiness and given a fathers kiss to her when sir austin passed out she was in a deep sleep chapter xlii briareus reddening angrily over the seawhat is that vaporous titan and hesper set in his rosy garlandwhy looks he so implacably sweet it is that one has left that bright home to go forth and do cloudy work and he has got a stain with which he dare not return far in the west fair lucy beckons him to come ah heaven if he might how strong and fierce the temptation is how subtle the sleepless desire it drugs his reason his honour for he loves her she is still the first and only woman to him otherwise would this black spot be hell to him otherwise would his limbs be chained while her arms are spread open to him and if he loves her why then what is one fall in the pit or a thousand is not love the password to that beckoning bliss so may we say but here is one whose body has been made a temple to him and it is desecrated a temple and desecrated for what is it fit for but for a dance of devils his education has thus wrought him to think he can blame nothing but his own baseness but to feel base and accept the bliss that beckonshe has not fallen so low as that ah happy english home sweet wife what mad miserable wisp of the fancy led him away from you high in his conceit poor wretch that thought to be he of the hundred hands and war against the absolute gods jove whispered a light commission to the laughing dame she met him and how did he shake olympus with laughter sure it were better to be orestes the furies howling in his ears than one called to by a heavenly soul from whom he is for ever outcast he has not the oblivion of madness clothed in the lights of his first passion robed in the splendour of old skies she meets him everywhere morning evening night she shines above him waylays him suddenly in forest depths drops palpably on his heart at moments he forgets he rushes to embrace her calls her his beloved and lo her innocent kiss brings agony of shame to his face daily the struggle endured his father wrote to him begging him by the love he had for him to return from that hour richard burnt unread all the letters he received he knew too well how easily he could persuade himself words from without might tempt him and quite extinguish the spark of honourable feeling that tortured him and that he clung to in desperate selfvindication to arrest young gentlemen on the downward slope is both a dangerous and thankless office it is nevertheless one that fair women greatly prize and certain of them professionally follow lady judith as far as her sex would permit was also of the titans in their battle against the absolute gods for which purpose mark you she had married a lord incapable in all save his acres her achievements she kept to her own mind she did not look happy over them she met richard accidentally in paris she saw his state she let him learn that she alone on earth understood him the consequence was that he was forthwith enrolled in her train it soothed him to be near a woman did she venture her guess as to the cause of his conduct she blotted it out with a facility women have and cast on it a melancholy hue he was taught to participate in she spoke of sorrows personal sorrows much as he might speak of hisvaguely and with selfblame and she understood him how the dark unfathomed wealth within us gleams to a womans eye we are at compound interest immediately so much richer than we knewalmost as rich as we dreamed but then the instant we are away from her we find ourselves bankrupt beggared how is that we do not ask we hurry to her and bask hungrily in her orbs the eye must be feminine to be thus creative i cannot say why lady judith understood richard and he feeling infinitely vile somehow held to her more feverishly as one who dreaded the worst in missing her the spirit must rest he was weak with what he suffered austin found them among the hills of nassau in rhineland titans male and female who had not displaced jove and were now adrift prone on floods of sentiment the blueflocked peasant swinging behind his oxen of a morning the gailykerchiefed fruitwoman the jackassdriver even the doctor of those regions have done more for their fellows horrible reflection lady judith is serene above it but it frets at richard when he is out of her shadow often wretchedly he watches the young men of his own age trooping to their work not cloudwork theirs work solid unambitious fruitful lady judith had a nobler in prospect for the hero he gaped blindfolded for anything and she gave him the map of europe in tatters he swallowed it comfortably it was an intoxicating cordial himself on horseback overriding wrecks of empires well might common sense cower with the meaner animals at the picture tacitly they agreed to recast the civilized globe the quality of vapour is to melt and shape itself anew but it is never the quality of vapour to reassume the same shapes briareus of the hundred unoccupied hands may turn to a monstrous donkey with his hind legs aloft or twenty thousand jabbering apes the phantasmic groupings of the young brain are very like those we see in the skies and equally the sport of the wind lady judith blew there was plenty of vapour in him and it always resolved into some shape or other you that mark those clouds of eventide and know youth will see the similitude it will not be strange it will barely seem foolish to you that a young man of richards age richards education and position should be in this wild state had he not been nursed to believe he was born for great things did she not say she was sure of it and to feel base yet born for better is enough to make one grasp at anything cloudy suppose the hero with a game leg how intense is his faith to quacks with what a passion of longing is he not seized to break somebodys head they spoke of italy in low voices the time will come said she and i shall be ready said he what rank was he to take in the liberating army captain colonel general in chief or simple private here as became him he was much more positive and specific than she was simple private he said yet he save himself caracoling on horseback private in the cavalry then of course private in the cavalry overriding wrecks of empires she looked forth under her brows with mournful indistinctness at that object in the distance they read petrarch to get up the necessary fires italia mia vain indeed was this speaking to those thick and mortal wounds in her fair body but their sighs went with the tiber the arno and the po and their hands joined who has not wept for italy i see the aspirations of a world arise for her thick and frequent as the puffs of smoke from cigars of pannonian sentries so when austin came richard said he could not leave lady judith lady judith said she could not part with him for his sake mind this richard verified perhaps he had reason to be grateful the high road of folly may have led him from one that terminates worse he is foolish god knows but for my part i will not laugh at the hero because he has not got his occasion meet him when he is as it were anointed by his occasion and he is no laughing matter richard felt his safety in this which to please the world we must term folly exhalation of vapours was a wholesome process to him and somebody who gave them shape and hue a beneficent iris he told austin plainly he could not leave her and did not anticipate the day when he could why cant you go to your wife richard for a reason you would be the first to approve austin he welcomed austin with every show of manly tenderness and sadness at heart austin he had always associated with his lucy in that hesperian palace of the west austin waited patiently lady judiths old lord played on all the baths in nassau without evoking the tune of health whithersoever he listed she changed her abode so admirable a wife was to be pardoned for espousing an old man she was an enthusiast even in her connubial duties she had the brows of an enthusiast with occasion she might have been a charlotte corday so let her also be shielded from the ban of ridicule nonsense of enthusiasts is very different from nonsense of ninnies she was truly a highminded person of that order who always do what they see to be right and always have confidence in their optics she was not unworthy of a young mans admiration if she was unfit to be his guide she resumed her ancient intimacy with austin easily while she preserved her new footing with richard she and austin were not unlike only austin never dreamed and had not married an old lord the three were walking on the bridge at limburg on the lahn where the shadow of a stone bishop is thrown by the moonlight on the water brawling over slabs of slate a woman passed them bearing in her arms a baby whose mighty size drew their attention what a wopper richard laughed well that is a fine fellow said austin but i dont think hes much bigger than your boy hell do for a nineteenthcentury arminius richard was saying then he looked at austin what was that you said lady judith asked of austin what have i said that deserves to be repeated austin counterqueried quite innocently richard has a son you didnt know it his modesty goes very far said lady judith sweeping the shadow of a curtsey to richards paternity richards heart throbbed with violence he looked again in austins face austin took it so much as a matter of course that he said nothing more on the subject well murmured lady judith when the two men were alone richard said in a quick voice austin you were in earnest you didnt know it richard no why they all wrote to you lucy wrote to you your father your aunt i believe adrian wrote too i tore up their letters said richard hes a noble fellow i can tell you youve nothing to be ashamed of hell soon be coming to ask about you i made sure you knew no i never knew richard walked away and then said what is he like well he really is like you but he has his mothers eyes and shes yes i think the child has kept her well theyre both at raynham both hence fantastic vapours what are ye to this where are the dreams of the hero when he learns he has a child nature is taking him to her bosom she will speak presently every domesticated boor in these hills can boast the same yet marvels the hero at none of his visioned prodigies as he does when he comes to hear of this most common performance a father richard fixed his eyes as if he were trying to make out the lineaments of his child telling austin he would be back in a few minutes he sallied into the air and walked on and on a father he kept repeating to himself a child and though he knew it not he was striking the keynotes of nature but he did know of a singular harmony that suddenly burst over his whole being the moon was surpassingly bright the summer air heavy and still he left the high road and pierced into the forest his walk was rapid the leaves on the trees brushed his cheeks the dead leaves heaped in the dells noised to his feet something of a religious joya strange sacred pleasurewas in him by degrees it wore he remembered himself and now he was possessed by a proportionate anguish a father he dared never see his child and he had no longer his phantasies to fall upon he was utterly bare to his sin in his troubled mind it seemed to him that clare looked down on himclare who saw him as he was and that to her eyes it would be infamy for him to go and print his kiss upon his child then came stern efforts to command his misery and make the nerves of his face iron by the log of an ancient tree half buried in dead leaves of past summers beside a brook he halted as one who had reached his journeys end there he discovered he had a companion in lady judiths little dog he gave the friendly animal a pat of recognition and both were silent in the forestsilence it was impossible for richard to return his heart was surcharged he must advance and on he footed the little dog following an oppressive slumber hung about the forestbranches in the dells and on the heights was the same dead heat here where the brook tinkled it was no coollipped sound but metallic and without the spirit of water yonder in a space of moonlight on lush grass the beams were as white fire to sight and feeling no haze spread around the valleys were clear defined to the shadows of their verges the distances sharply distinct and with the colours of day but slightly softened richard beheld a roe moving across a slope of sward far out of riflemark the breathless silence was significant yet the moon shone in a broad blue heaven tongue out of mouth trotted the little dog after him crouched panting when he stopped an instant rose weariedly when he started afresh now and then a large white nightmoth flitted through the dusk of the forest on a barren corner of the wooded highland looking inland stood grey topless ruins set in nettles and rank grassblades richard mechanically sat down on the crumbling flints to rest and listened to the panting of the dog sprinkled at his feet were emerald lights hundreds of glowworms studded the dark dry ground he sat and eyed them thinking not at all his energies were expended in action he sat as a part of the ruins and the moon turned his shadow westward from the south overhead as she declined long ripples of silver cloud were imperceptibly stealing toward her they were the van of a tempest he did not observe them or the leaves beginning to chatter when he again pursued his course with his face to the rhine a huge mountain appeared to rise sheer over him and he had it in his mind to scale it he got no nearer to the base of it for all his vigorous outstepping the ground began to dip he lost sight of the sky then heavy thunderdrops streak his cheek the leaves were singing the earth breathed it was black before him and behind all at once the thunder spoke the mountain he had marked was bursting over him up startled the whole forest in violet fire he saw the country at the foot of the hills to the bounding rhine gleam quiver extinguished then there were pauses and the lightning seemed as the eye of heaven and the thunder as the tongue of heaven each alternately addressing him filling him with awful rapture alone theresole human creature among the grandeurs and mysteries of stormhe felt the representative of his kind and his spirit rose and marched and exulted let it be glory let it be ruin lower down the lightened abysses of air rolled the wrathful crash then white thrusts of light were darted from the sky and great curving ferns seen steadfast in pallor a second were supernaturally agitated and vanished then a shrill song roused in the leaves and the herbage prolonged and louder it sounded as deeper and heavier the deluge pressed a mighty force of water satisfied the desire of the earth even in this drenched as he was by the first outpouring richard had a savage pleasure keeping in motion he was scarcely conscious of the wet and the grateful breath of the weeds was refreshing suddenly he stopped short lifting a curious nostril he fancied he smelt meadowsweet he had never seen the flower in rhinelandnever thought of it and it would hardly be met with in a forest he was sure he smelt it fresh in dews his little companion wagged a miserable wet tail some way in advance he went an slowly thinking indistinctly after two or three steps he stooped and stretched out his hand to feel for the flower having he knew not why a strong wish to verify its growth there groping about his hand encountered something warm that started at his touch and he with the instinct we have seized it and lifted it to look at it the creature was very small evidently quite young richards eyes now accustomed to the darkness were able to discern it for what it was a tiny leveret and ha supposed that the dog had probably frightened its dam just before he found it he put the little thing on one hand in his breast and stepped out rapidly as before the rain was now steady from every tree a fountain poured so cool and easy had his mind become that he was speculating on what kind of shelter the birds could find and how the butterflies and moths saved their coloured wings from washing folded close they might hang under a leaf he thought lovingly he looked into the dripping darkness of the coverts on each side as one of their children he was next musing on a strange sensation he experienced it ran up one arm with an indescribable thrill but communicated nothing to his heart it was purely physical ceased for a time and recommenced till he had it all through his blood wonderfully thrilling he grew aware that the little thing he carried in his breast was licking his hand there the small rough tongue going over and over the palm of his hand produced the strange sensation he felt now that he knew the cause the marvel ended but now that he knew the cause his heart was touched and made more of it the gentle scraping continued without intermission as on he walked what did it say to him human tongue could not have said so much just then a pale grey light on the skirts of the flying tempest displayed the dawn richard was walking hurriedly the green drenched weeds lay all about in his path bent thick and the forest drooped glimmeringly impelled as a man who feels a revelation mounting obscurely to his brain richard was passing one of those little forestchapels hung with votive wreaths where the peasant halts to kneel and pray cold still in the twilight it stood raindrops pattering round it he looked within and saw the virgin holding her child he moved by but not many steps had he gone ere his strength went out of him and he shuddered what was it he asked not he was in other hands vivid as lightning the spirit of life illumined him he felt in his heart the cry of his child his darlings touch with shut eyes he saw them both they drew him from the depths they led him a blind and tottering man and as they led him he had a sense of purification so sweet he shuddered again and again when he looked out from his trance on the breathing world the small birds hopped and chirped warm fresh sunlight was over all the hills he was on the edge of the forest entering a plain clothed with ripe corn under a spacious morning sky chapter xliii they heard at raynham that richard was coming lucy had the news first in a letter from ripton thompson who met him at bonn ripton did not say that he had employed his vacation holiday on purpose to use his efforts to induce his dear friend to return to his wife and finding richard already on his way of course ripton said nothing to him but affected to be travelling for his pleasure like any cockney richard also wrote to her in case she should have gone to the sea he directed her to send word to his hotel that he might not lose an hour his letter was sedate in tone very sweet to her assisted by the faithful female berry she was conquering an aphorist womans reason is in the milk of her breasts was one of his rough notes due to an observation of lucys maternal cares let us remember therefore we men who have drunk of it largely there that she has it mrs berry zealously apprised him how early master richards education had commenced and the great future historian he must consequently be this trait in lucy was of itself sufficient to win sir austin here my plan with richard was false he reflected in presuming that anything save blind fortuity would bring him such a mate as he should have he came to add and has got he could admit now that instinct had so far beaten science for as richard was coming as all were to be happy his wisdom embraced them all paternally as the author of their happiness between him and lucy a tender intimacy grew i told you she could talk sir said adrian she thinks said the baronet the delicate question how she was to treat her uncle he settled generously farmer blaize should come up to raynham when he would lucy must visit him at least three times a week he had farmer blaize and mrs berry to study and really excellent aphorisms sprang from the plain human bases this natural couple presented it will do us no harm he thought some of the honest blood of the soil in our veins and he was content in musing on the parentage of the little cradled boy a common sight for those who had the entry to the library was the baronet cherishing the hand of his daughterinlaw so richard was crossing the sea and hearts at raynham were beating quicker measures as the minutes progressed that night he would be with them sir austin gave lucy a longer warmer salute when she came down to breakfast in the morning mrs berry waxed thrice amorous its your second bridals ye sweet livin widow she said thanks be the lord its the same man too and a baby over the bedpost she appended seriously strange berry declared it to be strange i feel none o this to my berry now all my feelins o love seem tave gone into you two sweet chicks in fact the faithless male berry complained of being treated badly and affected a superb jealousy of the baby but the good dame told him that if he suffered at all he suffered his due berrys position was decidedly uncomfortable it could not be concealed from the lower household that he had a wife in the establishment and for the complications this gave rise to his wife would not legitimately console him lucy did intercede but mrs berry was obdurate she averred she would not give up the child till he was weaned then perhaps she said prospectively you see i aint so soft as you thought for youre a very unkind vindictive old woman said lucy belike i am mrs berry was proud to agree we like a new character now and then berry had delayed too long were it not notorious that the straightlaced prudish dare not listen to the natural chaste certain things mrs berry thought it advisable to impart to the young wife with regard to berrys infidelity and the charity women should have toward sinful men might here be reproduced enough that she thought proper to broach the matter and cite her own christian sentiments now that she was indifferent in some degree oily calm is on the sea at raynham they look up at the sky and speculate that richard is approaching fairly speeded he comes to throw himself on his darlings mercy lucy irradiated over forest and sea tempest and peaceto her the hero comes humbly great is that day when we see our folly ripton and he were the friends of old richard encouraged him to talk of the two he could be eloquent on and ripton whose secret vanity was in his powers of speech never tired of enumerating lucys virtues and the peculiar attributes of the baby she did not say a word against me rip against you richard the moment she knew she was to be a mother she thought of nothing but her duty to the child shes one who cant think of herself youve seen her at raynham rip yes once they asked me down and your fathers so fond of herim sure he thinks no woman like her and hes right she is so lovely and so good richard was too full of blame of himself to blame his father too british to expose his emotions ripton divined how deep and changed they were by his manner he had cast aside the hero and however ripton had obeyed him and looked up to him in the heroic time he loved him tenfold now he told his friend how much lucys mere womanly sweetness and excellence had done for him and richard contrasted his own profitless extravagance with the patient beauty of his dear home angel he was not one to take her on the easy terms that offered there was that to do which made his cheek burn as he thought of it but he was going to do it even though it lost her to him just to see her and kneel to her was joy sufficient to sustain him and warm his blood in the prospect they marked the white cliffs growing over the water nearer the sun made them lustrous houses and people seemed to welcome the wild youth to common sense simplicity and home they were in town by midday richard had a momentary idea of not driving to his hotel for letters after a short debate he determined to go there the porter said he had two letters for mr richard feverelone had been waiting some time he went to the box and fetched them the first richard opened was from lucy and as he read it ripton observed the colour deepen on his face while a quivering smile played about his mouth he opened the other indifferently it began without any form of address richards forehead darkened at the signature this letter was in a sloping feminine hand and flourished with light strokes all over like a field of the bearded barley thus it ran i know you are in a rage with me because i would not consent to ruin you you foolish fellow what do you call it going to that unpleasant place together thank you my milliner is not ready yet and i want to make a good appearance when i do go i suppose i shall have to some day your health sir richard now let me speak to you seriously go home to your wife at once but i know the sort of fellow you are and i must be plain with you did i ever say i loved you you may hate me as much as you please but i will save you from being a fool now

sister and treat mei laughed at it then my god how i could cry now if water did any good to a devil as you politely call poor me i called at your house and saw your manservant who said mount had just

you and me goodbye dear dick you wont think that of me may i eat dry bread to the day of my death if i took or ever will touch a scrap of their money bella richard folded up the letter silently jump into the cab he said to ripton anything the matter richard no the driver received directions richard sat without speaking his friend knew that face he asked whether there was bad news in the letter for answer he had the lie circumstancial he ventured to remark that they were going the wrong way its the right way cried richard and his jaws were hard and square and his eyes looked heavy and full ripton said no more but thought the cabman pulled up at a club a gentleman in whom ripton recognized the hon peter brayder was just then swinging a leg over his horse with one foot in the stirrup hearing his name called the hon peter turned about and stretched an affable hand is mountfalcon in town said richard taking the horses reins instead of the gentlemanly hand his voice and aspect were quite friendly mount brayder replied curiously watching the action yes hes off this evening he is in town richard released his horse i want to see him where is he the young man looked pleasant that which might have aroused brayders suspicions was an old affair in parasitical register by this time want to see him what about he said carelessly and gave the address by the way he sang out we thought of putting your name down feverel he indicated the lofty structure what do you say richard nodded back at him crying hurry brayder returned the nod and those who promenaded the district soon beheld his body in elegant motion to the stepping of his wellearned horse what do you want to see lord mountfalcon for richard said ripton i just want to see him richard replied ripton was left in the cab at the door of my lords residence he had to wait there a space of about ten minutes when richard returned with a clearer visage though somewhat heated he stood outside the cab and ripton was conscious of being examined by those strong grey eyes as clear as speech he understood them to say to him you wont do but which of the many things on earth he would not do for he was at a loss to think go down to raynham ripton say i shall be there tonight certainly dont bother me with questions drive off at once or wait get another cab ill take this ripton was ejected and found himself standing alone in the street as he was on the point of rushing after the galloping cabhorse to get a word of elucidation he heard some one speak behind him you are feverels friend ripton had an eye for lords an ambrosial footman standing at the open door of lord mountfalcons house and a gentleman standing on the doorstep told him that he was addressed by that nobleman he was requested to step into the house when they were alone lord mountfalcon slightly ruffled said feverel has insulted me grossly i must meet him of course its a piece of infernal follyi suppose he is not quite mad riptons only definite answer was a gasping iteration of my lord my lord resumed i am perfectly guiltless of offending him as far as i know in fact i had a friendship for him is he liable to fits of this sort of thing not yet at conversationpoint ripton stammered fits my lord ah went the other eying ripton in lordly cognizant style you know nothing of this business perhaps ripton said he did not have you any influence with him not much my lord only now and thena little you are not in the army the question was quite unnecessary ripton confessed to the law and my lord did not look surprised i will not detain you he said distantly bowing ripton gave him a commoners obeisance but getting to the door the sense of the matter enlightened him its a duel my lord no help for it if his friends dont shut him up in bedlam between this and tomorrow morning of all horrible things a duel was the worst in riptons imagination he stood holding the handle of the door revolving this last chapter of calamity suddenly opened where happiness had promised a duel but he wont my lordhe mustnt fight my lord he must come on the ground said my lord positively ripton ejaculated unintelligible stuff finally lord mountfalcon said i went out of my way sir in speaking to you i saw you from the window your friend is mad deuced methodical i admit but mad i have particular reasons to wish not to injure the young man and if an apology is to be got out of him when were on the ground ill take it and well stop the damned scandal if possible you understand im the insulted party and i shall only require of him to use formal words of excuse to come to an amicable settlement let him just say he regrets it now sir the nobleman spoke with considerable earnestness should anything happeni have the honour to be known to mrs fevereland i beg you will tell her i very particularly desire you to let her know that i was not to blame mountfalcon rang the bell and bowed him out with this on his mind ripton hurried down to those who were waiting in joyful trust at raynham chapter xliv the watch consulted by hippias alternately with his pulse in occult calculation hideous to mark said halfpast eleven on the midnight adrian wearing a composedly amused expression on his dimpled plump faceheld slightly sideways aloof from paper and pensat writing at the library table round the baronets chair in a semicircle were lucy lady blandish mrs doria and ripton that very ill bird at raynham they were silent as those who question the flying minutes ripton had said that richard was sure to come but the feminine eyes reading him ever and anon had gathered matter for disquietude which increased as time sped sir austin persisted in his habitual air of speculative repose remote as he appeared from vulgar anxiety he was the first to speak and betray his state pray put up that watch impatience serves nothing he said halfturning hastily to his brother behind him hippias relinquished his pulse and mildly groaned its no nightmare this his remark was unheard and the bearing of it remained obscure adrians pen made a louder flourish on his manuscript whether in commiseration or infernal glee none might say what are you writing the baronet inquired testily of adrian after a pause twitched it may be by a sort of jealousy of the wise youths coolness do i disturb you sir rejoined adrian i am engaged on a portion of a proposal for uniting the empires and kingdoms of europe under one paternal head on the model of the evertobeadmired and lamented holy roman this treats of the management of youths and maids and of certain magisterial functions connected therewith it is decreed that these officers be all and every men of science etc and adrian cheerily drove his pen afresh mrs doria took lucys hand mutely addressing encouragement to her and lucy brought as much of a smile as she could command to reply with i fear we must give him up tonight observed lady blandish if he said he would come he will come sir austin interjected between him and the lady there was something of a contest secretly going on he was conscious that nothing save perfect success would now hold this selfemancipating mind she had seen him through he declared to me he would be certain to come said ripton but he could look at none of them as he said it for he was growing aware that richard might have deceived him and was feeling like a black conspirator against their happiness he determined to tell the baronet what he knew if richard did not come by twelve what is the time he asked hippias in a modest voice time for me to be in bed growled hippias as if everybody present had been treating him badly mrs berry came in to apprise lucy that she was wanted above she quietly rose sir austin kissed her on the forehead saying you had better not come down again my child she kept her eyes on him oblige me by retiring for the night he added lucy shook their hands and went out accompanied by mrs doria this agitation will be bad for the child he said speaking to himself aloud lady blandish remarked i think she might just as well have returned she will not sleep she will control herself for the childs sake you ask too much of her of her not he emphasized it was twelve oclock when hippias shut his watch and said with vehemence im convinced my circulation gradually and steadily decreases going back to the preharvey period murmured adrian as he wrote sir austin and lady blandish knew well that any comment would introduce them to the interior of his machinery the eternal view of which was sufficiently harrowing so they maintained a discreet reserve taking it for acquiescence in his deplorable condition hippias resumed despairingly its a fact ive brought you to see that no one can be more moderate than i am and yet i get worse my system is organically soundi believe i do every possible thing and yet i get worse nature never forgives ill go to bed the dyspepsy departed unconsoled sir austin took up his brothers thought i suppose nothing short of a miracle helps us when we have offended her nothing short of a quack satisfies us said adrian applying wax to an envelope of official dimensions ripton sat accusing his soul of cowardice while they talked haunted by lucys last look at him he got up his courage presently and went round to adrian who after a few whispered words deliberately rose and accompanied him out of the room shrugging when they had gone lady blandish said to the baronet he is not coming tomorrow then if not tonight he replied but i say he will come tonight you do really wish to see him united to his wife the question made the baronet raise his brows with some displeasure can you ask me i mean said the ungenerous woman your system will require no further sacrifices from either of them when he did answer it was to say i think her altogether a superior person i confess i should scarcely have hoped to find one like her admit that your science does not accomplish everything no it was presumptuousbeyond a certain point said the baronet meaning deep things lady blandish eyed him ah me she sighed if we would always be true to our own wisdom you are very singular tonight emmeline sir austin stopped his walk in front of her in truth was she not unjust here was an offending son freely forgiven here was a young woman of humble birth freely accepted into his family and permitted to stand upon her qualities who would have done moreor as much this lady for instance had the case been hers would have fought it all the people of position that he was acquainted with would have fought it and that without feeling it so peculiarly but while the baronet thought this he did not think of the exceptional education his son had received he took the common ground of fathers forgetting his system when it was absolutely on trial false to his son it could not be said that he had been false to his system he was others saw it plainly but he had to learn his lesson by and by lady blandish gave him her face then stretched her hand to the table saying well well she fingered a halfopened parcel lying there and drew forth a little book she recognized ha what is this she said benson returned it this morning he informed her the stupid fellow took it away with himby mischance i am bound to believe it was nothing other than the old notebook lady blandish turned over the leaves and came upon the later jottings she read a maker of proverbswhat is he but a narrow mind with the mouthpiece of narrower i do not agree with that she observed he was in no humour for argument was your humility feigned when you wrote it he merely said consider the sort of minds influenced by set sayings a proverb is the halfwayhouse to an idea i conceive and the majority rest there content can the keeper of such a house be flattered by his company she felt her feminine intelligence swaying under him again there must be greatness in a man who could thus speak of his own special and admirable aptitude further she read which is the coward among ushe who sneers at the failings of humanity oh that is true how much i admire that cried the darkeyed dame as she beamed intellectual raptures another aphorism seemed closely to apply to him there is no more grievous sight as there is no greater perversion than a wise man at the mercy of his feelings he must have written it she thought when he had himself for an examplestrange man that he is lady blandish was still inclined to submission though decidedly insubordinate she had once been fairly conquered but if what she reverenced as a great mind could conquer her it must be a great man that should hold her captive the autumn primrose blooms for the loftiest manhood is a vindictive flower in lesser hands nevertheless sir austin had only to be successful and this ladys allegiance was his for ever the trial was at hand she said again he is not coming tonight and the baronet on whose visage a contemplative pleased look had been rising for a minute past quietly added he is come richards voice was heard in the hall there was commotion all over the house at the return of the young heir berry seizing every possible occasion to approach his bessy now that her involuntary coldness had enhanced her valuesuch is men as the soft woman reflectedberry ascended to her and delivered the news in pompous tones and wheedling gestures the best word youve spoke for many a day says she and leaves him unfeed in an attitude to hurry and pour bliss into lucys ears lord be praised she entered the adjoining room exclaiming were got to be happy at last they men have come to their senses i could cry to your virgin and kiss your cross you sweet hush lucy admonished her and crooned over the child on her knees the tiny open hands full of sleep clutched the large blue eyes started awake and his mother all trembling and palpitating knowing but thirsting to hear it covered him with her tresses and tried to still her frame and rocked and sang low interdicting even a whisper from bursting mrs berry richard had come he was under his fathers roof in the old home that had so soon grown foreign to him he stood close to his wife and child he might embrace them both and now the fulness of his anguish and the madness of the thing he had done smote the young man now first he tasted hard earthly misery had not god spoken to him in the tempest had not the finger of heaven directed him homeward and he had come here he stood congratulations were thick in his ears the cup of happiness was held to him and he was invited to drink of it which was the dream his work for the morrow or this but for a leaden load that he felt like a bullet in his breast he might have thought the morrow with death sitting on it was the dream yes he was awake now first the cloud of phantasms cleared away he beheld his real life and the colours of true human joy and on the morrow perhaps he was to close his eyes on them that leaden bullet dispersed all unrealities they stood about him in the hall his father lady blandish mrs doria adrian ripton people who had known him long they shook his hand they gave him greetings he had never before understood the worth of or the meaning now that he did they mocked him there was mrs berry in the background bobbing there was martin berry bowing there was tom bakewell grinning somehow he loved the sight of these better ah my old penelope he said breaking through the circle of his relatives to go to her tom how are you bless ye my mr richard whimpered mrs berry and whispered rosily alls agreeable now shes waiting up in bed for ye like a newborn the person who betrayed most agitation was mrs doria she held close to him and eagerly studied his face and every movement as one accustomed to masks you are pale richard he pleaded exhaustion what detained you dear business he said she drew him imperiously apart from the others richard is it over he asked what she meant the dreadful duel richard he looked darkly is it over is it done richard getting no immediate answer she continuedand such was her agitation that the words were shaken by pieces from her mouth dont pretend not to understand me richard is it over are you going to die the death of my childclares death is not one in a family enough think of your dear young wifewe love her soyour childyour father will you kill us all mrs doria had chanced to overhear a trifle of riptons communication to adrian and had built thereon with the dark forces of a stricken soul wondering how this woman could have divined it richard calmly said its arrangedthe matter you allude to indeedtruly dear yes tell mebut he broke away from her saying you shall hear the particulars tomorrow and she not alive to double meaning just then allowed him to leave her he had eaten nothing for twelve hours and called for food but he would take only dry bread and claret which was served on a tray in the library he said without any show of feeling that he must eat before he saw the young hope of raynham so there he sat breaking bread and eating great mouthfuls and washing them down with wine talking of what they would his fathers studious mind felt itself years behind him he was so completely altered he had the precision of speech the bearing of a man of thirty indeed he had all that the necessity for cloaking an infinite misery gives but let things be as they might he was there for one night in his life sir austins perspective of the future was bounded by the night will you go to your wife now he had asked and richard had replied with a strange indifference the baronet thought it better that their meeting should be private and sent word for lucy to wait upstairs the others perceived that father and son should now be left alone adrian went up to him and said i can no longer witness this painful sight so goodnight sir famish you may cheat yourself into the belief that youve made a meal but depend upon it your progenyand it threatens to be numerouswill cry aloud and rue the day nature never forgives a lost dinner can never be replaced goodnight my dear boy and hereoblige me by taking this he handed richard the enormous envelope containing what he had written that evening credentials he exclaimed humorously slapping richard on the shoulder ripton heard also the words propagatorspecies but had no idea of their import the wise youth looked you see weve made matters all right for you here and quitted the room on that unusual gleam of earnestness richard shook his hand and riptons then lady blandish said her goodnight praising lucy and promising to pray for their mutual happiness the two men who knew what was hanging over him spoke together outside ripton was for getting a positive assurance that the duel would not be fought but adrian said time enough tomorrow hes safe enough while hes here ill stop it tomorrow ending with banter of ripton and allusions to his adventures with miss random which must adrian said have led him into many affairs of the sort certainly richard was there and while he was there he must be safe so thought ripton and went to his bed mrs doria deliberated likewise and likewise thought him safe while he was there for once in her life she thought it better not to trust to her instinct for fear of useless disturbance where peace should be so she said not a syllable of it to her brother she only looked more deeply into richards eyes as she kissed him praising lucy i have found a second daughter in her dear oh may you both be happy they all praised lucy now his father commenced the moment they were alone poor helen your wife has been a great comfort to her richard i think helen must have sunk without her so lovely a young person possessing mental faculty and a conscience for her duties i have never before met he wished to gratify his son by these eulogies of lucy and some hours back he would have succeeded now it had the contrary effect you compliment me on my choice sir richard spoke sedately but the irony was perceptible and he could speak no other way his bitterness was so intense i think you very fortunate said his father sensitive to tone and manner as he was his ebullition of paternal feeling was frozen richard did not approach him he leaned against the chimneypiece glancing at the floor and lifting his eyes only when he spoke fortunate very fortunate as he revolved his later history and remembered how clearly he had seen that his father must love lucy if he but knew her and remembered his efforts to persuade her to come with him a sting of miserable rage blackened his brain but could he blame that gentle soul whom could he blame himself not utterly his father yes and no the blame was here the blame was there it was everywhere and nowhere and the young man cast it on the fates and looked angrily at heaven and grew reckless richard said his father coming close to him it is late tonight i do not wish lucy to remain in expectation longer or i should have explained myself to you thoroughly and i thinkor at least hopeyou would have justified me i had cause to believe that you had not only violated my confidence but grossly deceived me it was not so i now know i was mistaken much of our misunderstanding has resulted from that mistake but you were marrieda boy you knew nothing of the world little of yourself to save you in afterlifefor there is a period when mature men and women who have married young are more impelled to temptation than in youththough not so exposed to itto save you i say i decreed that you should experience selfdenial and learn something of your fellows of both sexes before settling into a state that must have been otherwise precarious however excellent the woman who is your mate my system with you would have been otherwise imperfect and you would have felt the effects of it it is over now you are a man the dangers to which your nature was open are i trust at an end i wish you to be happy and i give you both my blessing and pray god to conduct and strengthen you both sir austins mind was unconscious of not having spoken devoutly true or not his words were idle to his son his talk of dangers over and happiness mockery richard coldly took his fathers extended hand we will go to her said the baronet i will leave you at her door not moving looking fixedly at his father with a hard face on which the colour rushed richard said a husband who has been unfaithful to his wife may go to her there sir it was horrible it was cruel richard knew that he wanted no advice on such a matter having fully resolved what to do yesterday he would have listened to his father and blamed himself alone and done what was to be done humbly before god and her now in the recklessness of his misery he had as little pity for any other soul as for his own sir austins brows were deep drawn down what did you say richard clearly his intelligence had taken it but thisthe worst he could hearthis that he had dreaded once and doubted and smoothed over and cast asidecould it be richard said i told you all but the very words when we last parted what else do you think would have kept me from her angered at his callous aspect his father cried what brings you to her now that will be between us two was the reply sir austin fell into his chair meditation was impossible he spoke from a wrathful heart you will not dare to take her without no sir richard interrupted him i shall not have no fear then you did not love your wife did i not a smile passed faintly over richards face did you care so much for thisthis other person so much if you ask me whether i had affection for her i can say i had none o base human nature then how then why a thousand questions rose in the baronets mind bessy berry could have answered them every one poor child poor child he apostrophized lucy pacing the room thinking of her knowing her deep love for his sonher true forgiving heartit seemed she should be spared this misery he proposed to richard to spare her vast is the distinction between women and men in this one sin he said and supported it with physical and moral citations his argument carried him so far that to hear him one would have imagined he thought the sin in men small indeed his words were idle she must know it said richard sternly i will go to her now sir if you please sir austin detained him expostulated contradicted himself confounded his principles made nonsense of all his theories he could not induce his son to waver in his resolve ultimately their goodnight being interchanged he understood that the happiness of raynham depended on lucys mercy he had no fears of her sweet heart but it was a strange thing to have come to on which should the accusation fallon science or on human nature he remained in the library pondering over the question at times breathing contempt for his son and again seized with unwonted suspicion of his own wisdom troubled much to be pitied even if he deserved that blow from his son which had plunged him into wretchedness richard went straight to tom bakewell roused the heavy sleeper and told him to have his mare saddled and waiting at the park gates east within an hour toms nearest approach to a hero was to be a faithful slave to his master and in doing this he acted to his conception of that high and glorious character he got up and heroically dashed his head into cold water she shall be ready sir he nodded tom if you dont see me back here at raynham your money will go on being paid to you rather see you than the money mr richard said tom and you will always watch and see no harm comes to her tom mrs richard sir tom stared god bless me mr richard no questions youll do what i say ay sir that i will didn isle o wight the very name of the island shocked richards blood and he had to walk up and down before he could knock at lucys door that infamous conspiracy to which he owed his degradation and misery scarce left him the feelings of a man when he thought of it the soft beloved voice responded to his knock he opened the door and stood before her lucy was halfway toward him in the moment that passed ere she was in his arms he had time to observe the change in her he had left her a girl he beheld a womana blooming woman for pale at first no sooner did she see him than the colour was rich and deep on her face and neck and bosom half shown through the loose dressingrobe and the sense of her exceeding beauty made his heart thump and his eyes swim my darling each cried and they clung together and her mouth was fastened on his they spoke no more his soul was drowned in her kiss supporting her whose strength was gone he almost as weak as she hung over her and clasped her closer closer till they were as one body and in the oblivion her lips put upon him he was free to the bliss of her embrace heaven granted him that he placed her in a chair and knelt at her feet with both arms around her her bosom heaved her eyes never quitted him their light as the light on a rolling wave this young creature commonly so frank and straightforward was broken with bashfulness in her husbands armswomanly bashfulness on the torrent of womanly love tenfold more seductive than the bashfulness of girlhood terrible tenfold the loss of her seemed now as distantlyfar on the horizon of memorythe fatal truth returned to him lose her lose this he looked up as if to ask god to confirm it the same sweet blue eyes the eyes that he had often seen in the dying glories of evening on him they dwelt shifting and fluttering and glittering but constant the light of them as the light on a rolling wave and true to him true good glorious as the angels of heaven and his she was a womanhis wife the temptation to take her and be dumb was all powerful the wish to die against her bosom so strong as to be the prayer of his vital forces again he strained her to him but this time it was as a robber grasps priceless treasurewith exultation and defiance one instant of this lucy whose pure tenderness had now surmounted the first wild passion of their meeting bent back her head from her surrendered body and said almost voicelessly her underlids wistfully quivering come and see himbaby and then in great hope of the happiness she was going to give her husband and share with him and in tremour and doubt of what his feelings would be she blushed and her brows worked she tried to throw off the strangeness of a year of separation misunderstanding and uncertainty darling come and see him he is here she spoke more clearly though no louder richard had released her and she took his hand and he suffered himself to be led to the other side of the bed his heart began rapidly throbbing at the sight of a little rosycurtained cot covered with lace like milky summer cloud it seemed to him he would lose his manhood if he looked on that childs face stop he cried suddenly lucy turned first to him and then to her infant fearing it should have been disturbed lucy come back what is it darling said she in alarm at his voice and the grip he had unwittingly given her hand o god what an ordeal was this that tomorrow he must face death perhaps die and be torn from his darlinghis wife and his child and that ere he went forth ere he could dare to see his child and lean his head reproachfully on his young wifes breastfor the last time it might behe must stab her to the heart shatter the image she held of him lucy she saw him wrenched with agony and her own face took the whiteness of hisshe bending forward to him all her faculties strung to hearing he held her two hands that she might look on him and not spare the horrible wound he was going to lay open to her eyes lucy do you know why i came to you tonight she moved her lips repeating his words lucy have you guessed why i did not come before her head shook widened eyes lucy i did not come because i was not worthy of my wife do you understand darling she faltered plaintively and hung crouching under him what have i done to make you angry with me o beloved cried he the tears bursting out of his eyes o beloved was all he could say kissing her hands passionately she waited reassured but in terror lucy i stayed away from youi could not come to you because i dared not come to you my wife my beloved i could not come because i was a coward becausehear methis was the reason i have broken my marriage oath again her lips moved she caught at a dim fleshless meaning in them but you love me richard my husband you love me yes i have never loved i never shall love woman but you darling kiss me have you understood what i have told you kiss me she said he did not join lips i have come to you tonight to ask your forgiveness her answer was kiss me can you forgive a man so base but you love me richard yes that i can say before god i love you and i have betrayed you and am unworthy of younot worthy to touch your hand to kneel at your feet to breathe the same air with you her eyes shone brilliantly you love me you love me darling and as one who has sailed through dark fears into daylight she said my husband my darling you will never leave me we never shall be parted again he drew his breath painfully to smooth her face growing rigid with fresh fears at his silence he met her mouth that kiss in which she spoke what her soul had to say calmed her and she smiled happily from it and in her manner reminded him of his first vision of her on the summer morning in the field of the meadowsweet he held her to him and thought then of a holier picture of mother and child of the sweet wonders of life she had made real to him had he not absolved his conscience at least the pangs to come made him think so he now followed her leading hand lucy whispered you mustnt disturb himmustnt touch him dear and with dainty fingers drew off the covering to the little shoulder one arm of the child was out along the pillow the small hand open his babymouth was pouted full the dark lashes of his eyes seemed to lie on his plump cheeks richard stooped lower down to him hungering for some movement as a sign that he lived lucy whispered he sleeps like you richardone arm under his head great wonder and the stir of a grasping tenderness was in richard he breathed quick and soft bending lower till lucys curls as she nestled and bent with him rolled on the crimson quilt of the cot a smile went up the plump cheeks forthwith the bud of a mouth was in rapid motion the young mother whispered blushing hes dreaming of me and the simple words did more than richards eyes to make him see what was then lucy began to hum and buzz sweet babylanguage and some of the tiny fingers stirred and he made as if to change his cosy position but reconsidered and deferred it with a peaceful little sigh lucy whispered he is such a big fellow oh when you see him awake he is so like you richard he did not hear her immediately it seemed a bit of heaven dropped there in his likeness the more human the fact of the child grew the more heavenly it seemed his son his child should he ever see him awake at the thought he took the words that had been spoken and started from the dream he had been in will he wake soon lucy oh no not yet dear not for hours i would have kept him awake for you but he was so sleepy richard stood back from the cot he thought that if he saw the eyes of his boy and had him once on his heart he never should have force to leave him then he looked down on him again struggled to tear himself away two natures warred in his bosom or it may have been the magian conflict still going on he had come to see his child once and to make peace with his wife before it should be too late might he not stop with them might he not relinquish that devilish pledge was not divine happiness here offered to himif foolish ripton had not delayed to tell him of his interview with mountfalcon all might have been well but pride said it was impossible and then injury spoke for why was he thus base and spotted to the darling of his love a mad pleasure in the prospect of wreaking vengeance on the villain who had laid the trap for him once more blackened his brain if he would stay he could not so he resolved throwing the burden on fate the struggle was over but oh the pain lucy beheld the tears streaming hot from his face on the childs cot she marvelled at such excess of emotion but when his chest heaved and the extremity of mortal anguish appeared to have seized him her heart sank and she tried to get him in her arms he turned away from her and went to the window a halfmoon was over the lake look he said do you remember our rowing there one night and we saw the shadow of the cypress i wish i could have come early tonight that we might have had another row and i have heard you sing there darling said she will it make you happier if i go with you now i will no lucy lucy you are brave oh no that im not i thought so once i know i am not now yes to have livedthe child on your heartand never to have uttered a complaintyou are brave o my lucy my wife you that have made me man i called you a coward i remember it i was the cowardi the wretched vain fool darling i am going to leave you now you are brave and you will bear it listen in two days or three i may be backback for good if you will accept me promise me to go to bed quietly kiss the child for me and tell him his father has seen him he will learn to speak soon will he soon speak lucy dreadful suspicion kept her speechless she could only clutch one arm of his with both her hands going she presently gasped for two or three days no morei hope tonight yes now going now my husband her faculties abandoned her you will be brave my lucy richard my darling husband going what is it takes you from me but questioning no further she fell on her knees and cried piteously to him to staynot to leave them then she dragged him to the little sleeper and urged him to pray by his side and he did but rose abruptly from his prayer when he had muttered a few broken wordsshe praying on with tightstrung nerves in the faith that what she said to the interceding mother above would be stronger than human hands on him nor could he go while she knelt there and he wavered he had not reckoned on her terrible suffering she came to him quiet i knew you would remain and taking his hand innocently fondling it am i so changed from her he loved you will not leave me dear but dread returned and the words quavered as she spoke them he was almost vanquished by the loveliness of her womanhood she drew his hand to her heart and strained it there under one breast come lie on my heart she murmured with a smile of holy sweetness he wavered more and drooped to her but summoning the powers of hell kissed her suddenly cried the words of parting and hurried to the door it was over in an instant she cried out his name clinging to him wildly and was adjured to be brave for he would be dishonoured if he did not go then she was shaken off mrs berry was aroused by an unusual prolonged wailing of the child which showed that no one was comforting it and failing to get any answer to her applications for admittance she made bold to enter there she saw lucy the child in her lap sitting on the floor senselessshe had taken it from its sleep and tried to follow her husband with it as her strongest appeal to him and had fainted oh my oh my mrs berry moaned and i just now thinkin they was so happy warming and caressing the poor infant she managed by degrees to revive lucy and heard what had brought her to that situation go to his father said mrs berry tatetiddleteheightyo go my love and every horse in raynham shall be out after m this is what men brings us to heightyoightyiddletyah or you take blessed baby and ill go the baronet himself knocked at the door what is this he said i heard a noise and a step descend its mr richard have gone sir austin have gone from his wife and babe rumteumteiddledyoh my goodness what sorrows come on us and mrs berry wept and sang to baby and baby cried vehemently and lucy sobbing took him and danced him and sang to him with drawn lips and tears dropping over him and if the scientific humanist to the day of his death forgets the sight of those two poor true women jigging on their wretched hearts to calm the child he must have very little of the human in him there was no more sleep for raynham that night chapter xlv his ordeal is over i have just come from his room and seen him bear the worst that could be return at oncehe has asked for you i can hardly write intelligibly but i will tell you what we know two days after the dreadful night when he left us his father heard from ralph morton richard had fought a duel in france with lord mountfalcon and was lying wounded at a hamlet on the coast his father started immediately with his poor wife and i followed in company with his aunt and his child the wound was not dangerous he was shot in the side somewhere but the ball injured no vital part we thought all would be well oh how sick i am of theories and systems and the pretensions of men there was his son lying all but dead and the man was still unconvinced of the folly he had been guilty of i could hardly bear the sight of his composure i shall hate the name of science till the day i die give me nothing but commonplace unpretending people they were at a wretched french cabaret smelling vilely where we still remain and the people try as much as they can do to compensate for our discomforts by their kindness the french poor people are very considerate where they see suffering i will say that for them the doctors had not allowed his poor lucy to go near him she sat outside his door and none of us dared disturb her that was a sight for science his father and myself and mrs berry were the only ones permitted to wait on him and whenever we came out there she sat not speaking a wordfor she had been told it would endanger his lifebut she looked such awful eagerness she had the sort of eye i fancy mad persons have i was sure her reason was going we did everything we could think of to comfort her a bed was made up for her and her meals were brought to her there of course there was no getting her to eat what do you suppose his alarm was fixed on he absolutely said to mebut i have not patience to repeat his words he thought her to blame for not commanding herself for the sake of her maternal duties he had absolutely an idea of insisting that she should make an effort to suckle the child i shall love that mrs berry to the end of my days i really believe she has twice the sense of any of usscience and all she asked him plainly if he wished to poison the child and then he gave way but with a bad grace poor man perhaps i am hard on him i remember that you said richard had done wrong yes well that may be but his father eclipsed his wrong in a greater wronga crime or quite as bad for if he deceived himself in the belief that he was acting righteously in separating husband and wife and exposing his son as he did i can only say that there are some who are worse than people who deliberately commit crimes no doubt science will benefit by it they kill little animals for the sake of science we have with us doctor bairam and a french physician from dieppe a very skilful man it was he who told us where the real danger lay we thought all would be well a week had passed and no fever supervened we told richard that his wife was coming to him and he could bear to hear it i went to her and began to circumlocute thinking she listenedshe had the same eager look when i told her she might go in with me to see her dear husband her features did not change m despres who held her pulse at the time told me in a whisper it was cerebral feverbrain fever coming on we have talked of her since i noticed that though she did not seem to understand me her bosom heaved and she appeared to be trying to repress it and choke something i am sure now from what i know of her character that sheeven in the approaches of deliriumwas preventing herself from crying out her last hold of reason was a thought for richard it was against a creature like this that we plotted i have the comfort of knowing that i did my share in helping to destroy her had she seen her husband a day or two beforebut no there was a new system to interdict that or had she not so violently controlled her nature as she did i believe she might have been saved he said once of a man that his conscience was a coxcomb will you believe that when he saw his sons wifepoor victim lying delirious he could not even then see his error you said he wished to take providence out of gods hands his mad selfdeceit would not leave him i am positive that while he was standing over her he was blaming her for not having considered the child indeed he made a remark to me that it was unfortunate disastrous i think he saidthat the child should have to be fed by hand i dare say it is all i pray is that this young child may be saved from him i cannot bear to see him look on it he does not spare himself bodily fatiguebut what is that that is the vulgarest form of love i know what you will say you will say i have lost all charity and i have but i should not feel so austin if i could be quite sure that he is an altered man even now the blow has struck him he is reserved and simple in his speech and his grief is evident but i have doubts he heard her while she was senseless call him cruel and harsh and cry that she had suffered and i saw then his mouth contract as if he had been touched perhaps when he thinks his mind will be clearer but what he has done cannot be undone i do not imagine he will abuse women any more the doctor called her a forte et belle jeune femme and he said she was as noble a soul as ever god moulded clay upon a noble soul forte et belle she lies upstairs if he can look on her and not see his sin i almost fear god will never enlighten him she died five days after she had been removed the shock had utterly deranged her i was with her she died very quietly breathing her last breath without painasking for no onea death i should like to die her cries at one time were dreadfully loud she screamed that she was drowning in fire and that her husband would not come to her to save her we deadened the sound as much as we could but it was impossible to prevent richard from hearing he knew her voice and it produced an effect like fever on him whenever she called he answered you could not hear them without weeping mrs berry sat with her and i sat with him and his father moved from one to the other but the trial for us came when she was gone how to communicate it to richardor whether to do so at all his father consulted with us we were quite decided that it would be madness to breathe it while he was in that state i can admit nowas things have turned outwe were wrong his father left usi believe he spent the time in prayerand then leaning on me he went to richard and said in so many words that his lucy was no more i thought it must kill him he listened and smiled i never saw a smile so sweet and so sad he said he had seen her die as if he had passed through his suffering a long time ago he shut his eyes i could see by the motion of his eyeballs up that he was straining his sight to some inner heaveni cannot go on i think richard is safe had we postponed the tidings till he came to his clear senses it must have killed him his father was right for once then but if he has saved his sons body he has given the deathblow to his heart richard will never be what he promised a letter found on his clothes tells us the origin of the quarrel i have had an interview with lord m this morning i cannot say i think him exactly to blame richard forced him to fight at least i do not select him the foremost for blame he was deeply and sincerely affected by the calamity he has caused alas he was only an instrument your poor aunt is utterly prostrate and talks strange things of her daughters death she is only happy in drudging dr bairam says we must under any circumstances keep her employed whilst she is doing something she can chat freely but the moment her hands are not occupied she gives me an idea that she is going into a fit we expect the dear childs uncle today mr thompson is here i have taken him upstairs to look at her that poor young man has a true heart come at once you will not be in time to see her she will lie at raynham if you could you would see an angel he sits by her side for hours i can give you no description of her beauty you will not delay i know dear austin and i want you for your presence will make me more charitable than i find it possible to be have you noticed the expression in the eyes of blind men that is just how richard looks as he lies there silent in his bedstriving to image her on his brain the end
