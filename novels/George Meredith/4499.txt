the entire short works of george meredith contents farina case of general ople the tale of chloe the house on the beach the gentleman of fifty the sentimentalists miscellaneous prose farina by george meredith the white rose club in those lusty ages when the kaisers lifted high the golden goblet of aachen and drank elbow upward the greeneyed wine of old romance there lived a bowshot from the bones of the eleven thousand virgins and the three holy kings a prosperous rhinelander by name gottlieb groschen or as it was sometimes ennobled gottlieb von groschen than whom no wealthier merchant bartered for the glory of his ancient mothercity nor more honoured burgess swallowed impartially red juice and white under the shadow of his own figtree vinehills among the hottest sunbibbers of the rheingau glistened in the roll of gottliebs possessions cornacres below cologne basaltquarries about linz mineralsprings in nassau a legacy of the romans to the genius and enterprise of the first of german traders he could have bought up every hawking crag owner and all from hattos tower to rheineck loreley combing her yellow locks against the nightcloud beheld old gottliebs rafts endlessly stealing on the moonlight through the iron pass she peoples above st goar a wailful host were the wives of his raftsmen widowed there by her watery music this worthy citizen of cologne held vasty manuscript letters of the kaiser addressed to him dear wellborn son and subject of mine gottlieb and he was easy with the proudest princes of the holy german realm for gottlieb was a moneylender and an honest man in one body he laid out for the plenteous harvests of usury not pressing the seasons with too much rigour i sow my seed in winter said he and hope to reap good profit in autumn but if the crop be scanty better let it lie and fatten the soil old earths the wisest creditor he would add she never squeezes the sun but just takes what he can give her year by year and so makes sure of good annual interest therefore when people asked gottlieb how he had risen to such a pinnacle of fortune the old merchant screwed his eye into its wisest corner and answered slyly because i ve always been a student of the heavenly bodies a communication which failed not to make the orbs and systems objects of ardent popular worship in cologne where the science was long since considered alchymic and still may be seldom could the kaiser go to war on welschland without first taking earnest counsel of his wellborn son and subject gottlieb and lightening his chests indeed the imperial pastime must have ceased and the kaiser had languished but for him cologne counted its illustrious citizen something more than man the burghers doffed when he passed and scampish leatherdraggled urchins gazed after him with praeternatural respect on their hanging chins as if a goldmine of great girth had walked through the awestruck game but for the young men of cologne he had a higher claim to reverence as father of the fair margarita the white rose of germany a noble maiden peerless and a jewel for princes the devotion of these youths should give them a name in chivalry in her honour daily and nightly they earned among themselves black bruises and paraded discoloured countenances with the humble hope to find it pleasing in her sight the tender fanatics went in bands up and down rhineland challenging wayfarers and the peasantry with staff and beaker to acknowledge the supremacy of their mistress whoso of them journeyed into foreign parts wrote home boasting how many times his head had been broken on behalf of the fair margarita and if this happened very often a spirit of envy was created which compelled him when he returned to verify his prowess on no less than a score of his rivals not to possess a beautyscar as the wounds received in these endless combats were called became the sign of inferiority so that much voluntary maiming was conjectured to be going on and to obviate this piece of treachery minutes of fights were taken and attested setting forth that a certain glorious cut or crack was honourably won in fair field on what occasion and from whom every member of the white rose club keeping his particular scroll and on days of festival and holiday wearing it haughtily in his helm strangers entering cologne were astonished at the hideous appearance of the striplings and thought they never had observed so ugly a race but they were forced to admit the fine influence of beauty on commerce seeing that the consumption of beer increased almost hourly all bavaria could not equal cologne for quantity made away with the chief members of the white rose club were berthold schmidt the rich goldsmiths son dietrich schill son of the imperial saddler heinrich abt franz endermann and ernst geller sons of chief burghers each of whom carried a yardlong scroll in his cap and was too disfigured in person for men to require an inspection of the document they were dangerous youths to meet for the oaths ceremonies and recantations they demanded from every wayfarer under the rank of baron were what few might satisfactorily perform if lovers of woman other than the fair margarita or loyal husbands and what none save trained heads and stomachs could withstand however naturally manful the captain of the club was he who could drink most beer without intermediate sighing and whose face reckoned the proudest number of slices and mixture of colours the captaincy was most in dispute between dietrich schill and berthold schmidt who in the heat and constancy of contention were gradually losing likeness to man good coin they gloried to reflect needs no stamp one youth in cologne held out against the standing tyranny and chose to do beauty homage in his own fashion and at his leisure it was farina and oaths were registered against him over empty beerbarrels an axiom of the white rose club laid it down that everybody must be enamoured of margarita and the conscience of the club made them trebly suspicious of those who were not members they had the consolation of knowing that farina was poor but then he was affirmed a student of black arts and from such a one the worst might reasonably be feared he might bewitch margarita dietrich schill was deputed by the club to sound the white rose herself on the subject of farina and one afternoon in the vintage season when she sat under the hot vinepoles among maiden friends eating ripe grapes up sauntered dietrich smirking cap in hand with his scroll trailed behind him wilt thou said margarita offering him a bunch unhappy villain that i am replied dietrich gesticulating foxlike refusal if i but accept a favour i break faith with the club break it to pleasure me said margarita smiling wickedly dietrich gasped he stood on tiptoe to see if any of the club were by and halfstretched out his hand a mocking laugh caused him to draw it back as if stung the grapes fell farina was at margaritas feet offering them in return wilt thou said margarita with softer stress and slight excess of bloom in her cheeks farina put the purple cluster to his breast and clutched them hard on his heart still kneeling margaritas brow and bosom seemed to be reflections of the streaming crimson there she shook her face to the sky and affected laughter at the symbol her companions clapped hands farinas eyes yearned to her once and then he rose and joined in the pleasantry fury helped dietrich to forget his awkwardness he touched farina on the shoulder with two fingers and muttered huskily the club never allow that farina bowed as to thank him deeply for the rules of the club i am not a member you know said he and strolled to a seat close by margarita dietrich glared after him as head of a club he understood the use of symbols he had lost a splendid opportunity and farina had seized it farina had robbed him may i speak with mistress margarita inquired the white rose chief in a ragged voice surely dietrich do speak said margarita alone he continued is that allowed by the club said one of the young girls with a saucy glance dietrich deigned no reply but awaited margaritas decision she hesitated a second then stood up her full height before him faced him steadily and beckoned him some steps up the vinepath dietrich bowed and passing farina informed him that the club would wring satisfaction out of him for the insult farina laughed but answered look you of the club beerswilling has improved your manners as much as fighting has beautified your faces go on drink and fight but remember that the kaisers coming and fellows with him who will not be bullied what mean you cried dietrich lurching round on his enemy not so loud friend returned farina or do you wish to frighten the maidens i mean this that the club had better give as little offence as possible and keep their eyes as wide as they can if they want to be of service to mistress margarita dietrich turned off with a grunt now said margarita she was tapping her foot dietrich grew unfaithful to the club and looked at her longer than his mission warranted she was bright as the sunset gardens of the golden apples the braids of her yellow hair were bound in wreaths and on one side of her head a saffron crocus was stuck with the bell downward sweetness song and wit hung like dews of morning on her grapestained lips she wore a scarlet corset with bands of black velvet across her shoulders the girlish gown was thin blue stuff and fell short over her firmset feet neatly cased in white leather with buckles there was witness in her limbs and the way she carried her neck of an amiable but capable dragon ready when aroused to bristle up and guard the golden apples against all save the rightful claimant yet her nether lip and little white chinball had a dreamy droop her frank blue eyes went straight into the speaker the dragon slept it was a dangerous charm for says the minnesinger what ornament more enchants us on a young beauty than the soft slumber of a strength never yet called forth and that herself knows not of it sings double things to the heart of knighthood lures and warns us woos and threatens tis as nature shining peace yet the mother of storm there is no man rapturously exclaims heinrich von der jungferweide can resist the desire to win a sweet treasure before which lies a dragon sleeping the very danger prattles promise but the dragon must really sleep as with margarita a sham dragon shamming sleep has destroyed more virgins than all the heathen emperors says old hans aepfelmann of duesseldorf margaritas foot was tapping quicker speak dietrich she said dietrich declared to the club that at this point he muttered we love you margarita was glad to believe he had not spoken of himself he then informed her of the fears entertained by the club sworn to watch over and protect her regarding farinas arts and what fear you said margarita we fear sweet mistress he may be in league with sathanas replied dietrich truly then said margarita of all the youths in cologne he is the least like his confederate dietrich gulped and winked like a patient recovering wryfaced from an abhorred potion we have warned you fraulein groschen he exclaimed it now becomes our duty to see that you are not snared margarita reddened and returned you are kind but i am a christian maiden and not a pagan soldan and i do not require a body of tawny guards at my heels thereat she flung back to her companions and began staining her pretty mouth with grapes anew the tapestry word fair maids will have their hero in history siegfried was margaritas chosen she sang of siegfried all over the house o the old days of germany when such a hero walked she sang and who wins margarita mused farina happier than siegfried has in his arms brunhild and chrimhild together crowning the young girls breast was a cameo and the skill of some cunning artist out of welschland had wrought on it the story of the drachenfels her bosom heaved the battle up and down this cameo was a north star to german manhood but caused many chaste expressions of abhorrence from aunt lisbeth gottliebs unmarried sister who seemed instinctively to take part with the dragon she was a frailfashioned little lady with a face betokening the perpetual smack of lemon and who reigned in her brothers household when the good wife was gone margaritas robustness was beginning to alarm and shock aunt lisbeths sealed stock of virtue she must be watched such a madl as that said aunt lisbeth ursula what limbs she has margarita was watched but the spy being neither foe nor friend nothing was discovered against her this did not satisfy aunt lisbeth whose own suspicion was her best witness she allowed that margarita dissembled well but said she to her niece though it is good in a girl not to flaunt these naughtinesses in effrontery i care for you too much not to saybe what you seem my little one and that am i exclaimed margarita starting up and towering right good my niece lisbeth squealed but now frau groschen lies in gods acre you owe your duty to me mind did you confess last week from beginning to end replied margarita aunt lisbeth fixed pious reproach on margaritas cameo and still you wear that thing why not said margarita girl who would bid you set it in such a place save satan oh thou poor lost child that the eyes of the idle youths may be drawn there and thou become his snare to others margarita what was that welsh wandering juggler but the foul fiend himself mayhap thou maiden of sin they say he has been seen in cologne lately he was swarthy as satan and limped of one leg good master in heaven protect us it was satan himself i could swear aunt lisbeth crossed brow and breast margarita had commenced fingering the cameo as if to tear it away but aunt lisbeths finish made her laugh outright where i see no harm aunty i shall think the good god is she answered and where i see theres harm i shall think satan lurks a simper of sour despair passed over aunt lisbeth she sighed and was silent being one of those very weak reeds who are easily vanquished and never overcome let us go on with the tapestry child said she now margarita was ambitious of completing a certain tapestry for presentation to kaiser heinrich on his entry into cologne after his last campaign on the turbaned danube the subject was again her beloved siegfried slaying the dragon on drachenfels whenever aunt lisbeth indulged in any bitter virginity and was overmatched by margaritas frank maidenhood she hung out this tapestry as a flag of truce they were working it in bits not having contrivances to do it in a piece margarita took siegfried and aunt lisbeth the dragon they shared the crag between them a roguish gleam of the rhine toward nonnenwerth could be already made out rolands corner hanging like a sentinel across the chanting island as one topheavy with long watch aunt lisbeth was a great proficient in the art and had taught margarita the little lady learnt it with many other gruesome matters in the palatine of bohemias family she usually talked of the spectres of hollenbogenblitz castle in the passing of the threads those were dismal spectres in bohemia smelling of murder and the charnelbreath of midnight they uttered noises that wintered the blood and revealed sights that stiffened hair three feet long ay and kept it stiff margarita placed herself on a settle by the lowarched window and aunt lisbeth sat facing her an evening sun blazoned the buttresses of the cathedral and shadowed the workframes of the peaceful couple to a temperate light margarita unrolled a sampler sheathed with twists of divers coloured threads and was soon busy silverthreading siegfrieds helm and horns i told you of the steward poor kraut did i not child inquired aunt lisbeth quietly clearing her throat many times said margarita and went on humming over her knee her love was a baron a baron so bold she loved him for love he loved her for gold he must see for himself and be satisfied continued aunt lisbeth and holy thomas to warn him for an example poor kraut poor kraut echoed margarita the king loved wine and the knight loved wine and they loved the summer weather they might have loved each other well but for one they loved together you may say poor kraut child said aunt lisbeth well his face was before that as red as this dragons jaw and ever after he went about as white as a pullets egg that was something wonderful that was it chimed margarita o the king he loved his lawful wife the knight a lawless lady and ten on onemade ringing strife beneath the forest shady fifty to one child said aunt lisbeth you forget the story they made kraut sit with them at the jabbering feast the only mortal there the walls were full of eyesockets without eyes but phosphorus instead burning blue and damp not tonight aunty dear it frightens me so pleaded margarita for she saw the dolor coming night when its broad midday thou timid one good heaven take pity on such as thou the dish was seven feet in length by four broad kraut measured it with his eye and never forgot it not he when the dishcover was lifted there he saw himself lying boiled i did not feel uncomfortable then kraut told us it seemed natural his face as it lay there he says was quite calm only a little wrinkled and piggishlookinglike there was the mole on his chin and the pucker under his left eyelid well the baron carved all the guests were greedy for a piece of him some cried out for breast some for toes it was shuddering cold to sit and hear that the baroness said cheek ah shrieked margarita that can i not bear i will not hear it aunt i will not cheek aunt lisbeth reiterated nodding to the floor margarita put her fingers to her ears still kraut says even then he felt nothing odd of course he was horrified to be sitting with spectres as you and i should be but the first tremble of it was over he had plunged into the bath of horrors and there he was i ve heard that you must pronounce the names of the virgin and trinity sprinkling water round you all the while for three minutes and if you do this without interruption everything shall disappear so they say oh dear heaven of mercy says kraut what i felt when the baron laid his long huntingknife across my left cheek here aunt lisbeth lifted her eyes to dote upon margaritas fright she was very displeased to find her niece with elbows on the windowsill and hands round her head quietly gazing into the street she said severely where did you learn that song you were last singing margarita speak thou girl margarita laughed the thrush and the lark and the blackbird they taught me how to sing and o that the hawk would lend his eye and the eagle lend his wing i will not hear these shameless songs exclaimed aunt lisbeth for i would view the lands they view and be where they have been it is not enough to be singing for ever in dells unseen a voice was heard applauding her good right good carol again gretelchen my birdie margarita turned and beheld her father in the doorway she tripped toward him and heartily gave him their kiss of meeting gottlieb glanced at the helm of siegfried guessed the work was going well you sing so lightsomely today grete very pretty and thats drachenfels bones of the virgins what a bold fellow was siegfried and a lucky to have the neatest lass in deutschland in love with him well we must marry her to siegfried after all i believe aha or somebody as good as siegfried so chirrup on my darling aunt lisbeth does not approve of my songs replied margarita untwisting some silver threads do thy fathers command girl said aunt lisbeth and doing his command should i do a thing of ill id rather die to his lovely face than wanton at his will therethere said aunt lisbeth straining out her fingers you see gottlieb what overindulgence brings her to not another girl in blessed rhineland and bohemia to boot dared say such wordsthani cant repeat themdont ask meshes becoming a frankish girl what ballads that said gottlieb smiling the ballad of holy ottilia and her lover was sold to darkness and she loved himloved him as you love siegfried you little one more my father for she saw winkried and i never saw siegfried ah if i had seen siegfried never mind she loved him but she loved virtue more and virtue is the child of god and the good god forgave her for loving winkried the devils son because she loved virtue more and he rescued her as she was being dragged downdowndown and was half fainting with the smell of brimstonerescued her and had her carried into his glory head and feet on the wings of angels before all men as a hope to little maidens and when i thought that i was lost i found that i was saved and i was borne through blessed clouds where the banners of bliss were waved and so you think you too may fall in love with devils sons girl was aunt lisbeths comment do look at lisbeths dragon little heart its so like said margarita to her father old gottlieb twitted his hose and chuckled shes my girl that may be seen said he patting her and wheezed up from his chair to waddle across to the dragon but aunt lisbeth tartly turned the dragon to the wall it is not yet finished gottlieb and must not be looked at she interposed i will call for wood and see to a fire these evenings of spring wax cold and away whimpered aunt lisbeth margarita sang i with my playmates in riot and disorder were gathering herb and blossom along the forest border thy mothers song child of my heart said gottlieb but vex not good lisbeth she loves thee and do you think she loves me and will you say tis true o and will she have me when i come up to woo thou leaping doe thou chattering pie said gottlieb she shall have ribbons and trinkets and shine like a morn of may when we are off to the little hillchurch our flowery bridal way that she shall and something more cried gottlieb but hark thee gretelchen the kaiser will be here in three days thou dear one had i not stored and hoarded all for thee i should now have my feet on a hearthstone where even he might warm his boot so get thy best dresses and jewels in order and look thyself proud as any in the land a simple burghers daughter now grete but so shalt thou not end my butterfly or theres neither worth nor wit in gottlieb groschen three days margarita exclaimed and the helm not finished and the tapestrypieces not sewed and joined and the water not shaded offoh i must work night and day child ill have no working at night your rosy cheeks will soon be sucked out by oillight and you look no better than poor tallow court beautiesto say nothing of the danger this old house saw charles the great embracing the chief magistrate of his liege city yonder some swear he slept in it he did not sneeze at smaller chambers than our kaisers abide no gold ceilings with cornice carvings but plain wooden beams know that the men of great renown were men of simple needs bare to the lord they laid them down and slept on mighty deeds god wot theres no emptying thy store of ballads grete so much shall be said of thee yes times are changeing were growing degenerate look at the men of linz now to what they were would they have let the lads of andernach float down cabbagestalks to them without a shy back and why all because they funk that brigandbeast werner who gets redemption from laach hard by his hold whenever he commits a crime worth paying for as for me my timber and stuffs must come down stream and are too good for the nixen under rhine or think you i would acknowledge him with a toll the helldog thunder and lightning if old scores could be rubbed out on his hide gottlieb whirled a thonglashing arm in air and groaned of law and justice what were they coming to margarita softened the theme with a verse and tho to sting his enemy is sweetness to the angry bee the angry bee must busy be ere sweet of sweetness hiveth he the arch thrill of his daughters voice tickled gottlieb thats it birdie you and the proverb are right i dont know which is best better hive and keep alive than vengeance wake with that you take a clatter in the cathedral square brought gottlieb on his legs to the window it was a company of horsemen sparkling in harness one trumpeter rode at the side of the troop and in front a standardbearer matted down the chest with ochre beard displayed aloft to the good citizens of cologne three brown hawks with birds in their beaks on an azure stardotted field holy cross exclaimed gottlieb low in his throat the arms of werner where got he money to mount his men why this is daring all cologne in our very teeth fend that he visit me now ruin smokes in that ruffians track i ve felt hot and cold by turns all day the horsemen came jingling carelessly along the street in scattered twos and threes laughing together and singling out the maidens at the gableshadowed windows with hawking eyes the good citizens of cologne did not look on them favourably some showed their backs and gruffly banged their doors others scowled and pocketed their fists not a few slunk into the side alleys like welllicked curs and scurried off with forebent knees they were in truth ferociouslooking fellows these trusty servants of the robber baron werner of werners eck behind andernach leather steel and dust clad them from head to foot big and black as bears wolfeyed foxnosed they glistened bravely in the falling beams of the sun and margarita thrust her fair braided yellow head a little forward over her fathers shoulder to catch the whole length of the grim cavalcade one of the troop was not long in discerning the young beauty he pointed her boldly out to a comrade who approved his appetite and referred her to a third the rest followed lead and margarita was as one spellstruck when she became aware that all those hungry eyes were preying on hers old gottlieb was too full of his own fears to think for her and when he drew in his head rather suddenly it was with a dismal foreboding that werners destination in cologne was direct to the house of gottlieb groschen for purposes only too well to be divined devils breeches muttered gottlieb look again grete and see if that helltroop stop the way outside margaritas cheeks were overflowing with the offended rose i will not look at them again father gottlieb stared and then patted her i would i were a man father gottlieb smiled and stroked his beard oh how i burn and the girl shivered visibly grete mind to be as much of a woman as you can and soon such raff as this you may sweep away like cobwebs and no harm done he was startled by a violent thumping at the streetdoor and as brazen a blast as if the dead were being summoned aunt lisbeth entered and flitted duskily round the room crying we are lost they are upon us better death with a bodkin never shall it be said of me never the monsters then admonishing them to lock bar bolt and block up every room in the house aunt lisbeth perched herself on the edge of a chair and reversed the habits of the screechowl by being silent when stationary theres nothing to fear for you lisbeth said gottlieb with discourteous emphasis gottlieb do you remember what happened at the siege of mainz and poor marthe herbstblum who had hoped to die as she was and dame altknopfchen and frau kaltblut and the old baker hans topfs sister all of them as holy as abbesses and that did not save them and nothing will from such godless devourers gottlieb was gone having often before heard mention of the calamity experienced by these fated women comfort thee good heart on my breast said margarita taking lisbeth to that sweet nest of peace and fortitude margarita tis your doing have i not saidlure them not for they swarm too early upon us and here they are and perhaps in five minutes all will be over herr jewhat you are laughing heavens of goodness the girl is delighted here a mocking haha accompanied by a thundering snack at the door shook the whole house and again the trumpet burst the ears with fury this summons which seemed to aunt lisbeth final wrought a strange composure in her countenance she was very pale but spread her dress decently as if fear had departed and clasped her hands on her knees the will of the lord above must be done said she it is impious to complain when we are given into the hand of the philistines others have been martyred and were yet acceptable to this heroic speech she added with cold energy let them come aunt cried margarita i hear my fathers voice with those men aunty i will not let him be alone i must go down to him you will be safe here i shall come to you if theres cause for alarm and in spite of aunt lisbeths astonished shriek of remonstrance she hurried off to rejoin gottlieb the wager ere margarita had reached the landing of the stairs she repented her haste and shrank back wrapt in a thunder of oaths she distinguished tis the little maiden we want lets salute her and begone or cap your skull with something thicker than youve on it now if you want a whole one happy father gottlieb von groschen i am answered her father and the kaiser s as fond of a pretty girl as we are down with her and no more drivelling its only for a moment old measure and scales i tell you rascals i know your master and if youre not punished for this may i die a beggar exclaimed gottlieb jumping with rage may you die as rich as an abbot and so you will if you dont bring her down for ive sworn to see her there s the end of it man ill see too if the laws allow this villany cried gottlieb insulting a peaceful citizen in his own house a friend of your emperor gottlieb von groschen groschen were cousins then you wouldnt shut out your nearest kin devils lightning dont you know me pfennig von pfennig this heres heller thats zwanziger all of us vons every soul youre not decided thisll sharpen you my jolly king paunch and margarita heard the ruffian step as if to get swing for a blow she hurried into the passage and slipping in front of her father said to his assailant you have asked for me i am here her face was colourless and her voice seemed to issue from between a tightened cord she stood with her left foot a little in advance and her whole body heaving and quivering her arms folded and pressed hard below her bosom her eyes dilated to a strong blue her mouth ashy white a strange lustre as of suppressed internal fire flickered over her my name s schwartz thier and so s my nature said the fellow with a grin but may i never smack lips with a pretty girl again if i harm such a young beauty as this friendly dealings my plan o life clear out of my house then fellow and heres money for you said gottlieb displaying a wrathfullytrembling handful of coin pish money forty times that wouldnt cover my bet and if it did shouldnt i be disgraced jeered at for a sheepheart no im no ninny and not to be diddled ill talk to the young lady silence out there alls going proper this to his comrades through the door so my beautiful maiden thus it stands we saw you at the window looking like a fresh rose with a gold crown on here are we poor fellows come to welcome the kaiser i began to glorify you schwartz thier says henker rothhals to me ill wager you odds you dont have a kiss of that fine girl within twenty minutes counting from the handsmack done was my word and we clapped our fists together now you see thats straightforward all i want is not to lose my money and be made a fool ofleaving alone that sugary mouth which makes mine water and he drew the back of his hand along his stubbled jaws so come dont hesitate no harm to you my beauty but a compliment and schwartz thiers your friend and anything else you like for ever after come times up pretty well margarita leaned to her father a moment as if mortal sickness had seized her then cramping her hands and feet she said in his ear leave me to my own care go get the men to protect thee and ordered schwartz thier to open the door wide seeing gottlieb would not leave her she joined her hands and begged him the good god will protect me i will overmatch these men look my father they dare not strike me in the street you they would fell without pity go what they dare in a house they dare not in the street schwartz thier had opened the door at sight of margarita the troop gave a shout now on the doorstep full in view my beauteous one that they may see what a lucky devil i amand have no doubts about the handing over margarita looked behind gottlieb was still there every member of him quaking like a bog under a heavy heel she ran to him my father i have a device wilt thou spoil it and give me to this beast you can do nothing nothing protect yourself and save me cologne broad day muttered gottlieb as if the enormity had prostrated his belief in facts and moved slowly back margarita strode to the doorstep schwartz thier was awaiting her his arm circled out and his leering face ducked to a level with his victims this rough show of gallantry proved costly to him as he was gently closing his iron hold about her enjoying before hand with grim mouthridges the flatteries of triumph margarita shot past him through the door and was already twenty paces beyond the troop before either of them thought of pursuing her at the first sound of a hoof henker rothhals seized the riders bridlerein and roared fair play for a fair bet leave all to the thier the thier when he had recovered from his amazement sought for old gottlieb to give him a backhit as margarita foresaw that he would not finding him at hand out lumbered the fellow as swiftly as his harness would allow and caught a glimpse of margarita rapidly fleeting up the cathedral square only five minutes schwartz thier some of the troop sung out the devil can do his business in one was the retort and schwartz thier swung himself on his broadbacked charger and gored the fine beast till she rattled out a blast of sparkles from the flint in a minute he drew up in front of margarita so you prefer settling this business in the square good my choice sweetheart and he sprang to her side the act of flight had touched the young girls heart with the spirit of flight she crouched like a winded hare under the nose of the hound and covered her face with her two hands margarita was no wisp in weight but schwartz thier had her aloft in his arm as easily as if he had tossed up a kerchief look all and witness he shouted lifting the other arm henker rothhals and the rest of the troop looked as they came trotting to the scene with the coolness of umpires but they witnessed something other than what schwartz thier proposed this was the sight of a formidable staff whirling an unfriendly halo over the head of the thier and descending on it with such honest intent to confound and overthrow him that the thier succumbed to its force without argument and the square echoed blow and fall simultaneously at the same time the wielder of this sound piece of logic seized margarita and raised a shout in the square for all true men to stand by him in rescuing a maiden from the clutch of brigands and ravishers a crowd was collecting but seemed to consider the circle now formed by the horsemen as in a manner charmed for only one a fair slender youth came forward and ranged himself beside the stranger take thou the maiden ill keep to the staff said this latter stumbling over his speech as if he was in a foreign land among old roots and wolfpits which had already shaken out a few of his teeth and made him cautious about the remainder can it be margarita exclaimed the youth bending to her and calling to her margarita fraulein groschen she opened her eyes shuddered and said i was not afraid am i safe safe while i have life and this good friend where is my father i have not seen him and youwho are you do i owe this to you oh no no me you owe nothing margarita gazed hurriedly round and at her feet there lay the thier with his steelcap shining in dints and three rivulets of blood coursing down his mottled forehead she looked again at the youth and a blush of recognition gave life to her cheeks i did not know you pardon me farina what thanks can reward such courage tell me shall we go the youth eyed her an instant but recovering himself took a rapid survey and called to the stranger to follow and help give the young maiden safe conduct home just then henker rothhals bellowed times up he was answered by a chorus of agreement from the troop they had hitherto patiently acted their parts as spectators immovable on their horses the assault on the thier was all in the play and a visible interference of fortune in favour of henker rothhals now general commotion shuttled them and the strangers keen hazel eyes read their intentions rightly when he lifted his redoubtable staff in preparation for another mighty swoop this time defensive rothhals and half a dozen others with a warcry of curses spurred their steeds at once to ride him down they had not reckoned the length and goodwill of their antagonists weapon scarce were they in motion when round it whizzed grazing the nostrils of their horses with a precision that argued practice in the feat and unhorsing two rothhals among the number he dropped heavily on his head and showed signs of being as incapable of combat as the thier a cheer burst from the crowd but fell short the foremost of their number was struck flat to the earth by a fellow of the troop calling on st george his patron saint the stranger began systematically to make a clear ring in his path forward several of the horsemen essayed a cut at his arm with their long doublehanded swords but the horses could not be brought a second time to the edge of the magic circle and the blood of these warriors being thoroughly up they now came at him on foot in their rage they would have made short work with the three in spite of the magistracy of cologne had they not been arrested by cries of werner werner at the southwest end of the square looking rhinewards rode the marauder baron in full armour helm and hauberk with a single retainer in his rear he had apparently caught sight of the brawl and either because he distinguished his own men or was seeking his natural element hastened up for his share in it which was usually that of the king of beasts his first call was for schwartz thier the men made way and he beheld his man in no condition to make military responses he shouted for henker rothhals and again the men opened their ranks mutely exhibiting the two stretched out in diverse directions with their feet slanting to a common point the baron glared then caught off his mailed glove and thrust it between his teeth a rasping gurgle of oaths was all they heard and presently surged up who was it margaritas eyes were shut she opened them fascinated with horror there was an unearthly awful and comic mixture of sounds in werners querulous fury that was like the noise of a complaining bear rolling up from hollowchested menace to yawning lament never in her life had margarita such a shock of fear the half gasp of a laugh broke on her trembling lips she stared at werner and was falling but farinas arm clung instantly round her waist the stranger caught up her laugh loud and hearty as for who did it sir baron he cried is a cheery tone i am the man as you may like to know whyand thats due to you and me both of usall i can say is the black muzzle yonder lying got his settler for merrymaking with this peaceful maiden here without her consentan offence in my green island they reckon a crack o the sconce light basting for i warrant all company present and he nodded sharply about as for the other there who looks as if a rope had been round his neck once and shirked its duty he counts his wages for helping the devil in his business as will any other lad here who likes to come on and try werner himself probably would have given him the work he wanted but his eye had sidled a moment over margarita and the hardlysuppressed applause of the crowd at the strangers speech failed to bring his ire into action this solitary time who is the maiden he asked aloud fraulein von groschen replied farina von groschen von groschen the daughter of gottlieb groschenrascals roared the baron turning on his men and out poured a mudspring of filthy oaths and threats which caused henker rothhals who had opened his eyes to close them again as if he had already gone to the place of heat only lend me thy staff friend cried werner not i thwack em with your own wood replied the stranger and fell back a leg werner knotted his stringy brows and seemed torn to pieces with the different pulling tides of his wrath he grasped the mane of his horse and flung abroad handfuls till the splendid animal reared in agony you shall none of you live over this night villains i ll hang you every hags son my last orders werekeep quiet in the city ye devils brood take that and that laying at them with his bare sword off with you and carry these two pigs out of sight quickly or ill have their heads and make sure o them the latter injunction sprang from policy for at the head of the chief street there was a glitter of the city guard marching with shouldered spears maiden said werner with a bulls bow let me conduct thee to thy father margarita did not reply but gave her hand to farina and took a step closer to the stranger werners brows grew black enough to have saved you fair maid he muttered hoarsely gratitude never was a womans gift say to your father that i shall make excuses to him for the conduct of my men whereupon casting a look of leisurely scorn toward the guard coming up in the last beams of day the baron shrugged his huge shoulders to an altitude expressing the various contemptuous shades of feudal coxcombry stuck one leatherruffled arm in his side and jolted off at an easy pace amen ejaculated the stranger leaning on his staff there are barons in my old land but never a brute beast in harness margarita stood before him and took his two hands you will come with me to my father he will thank you i cannot you will come tears and a sob of relief started from her the city guard on seeing werners redoubtable back turned had adopted double time and now came panting up while the stranger bent smiling under a fresh overflow of innocent caresses margarita was caught to her fathers breast you shall have vengeance for this sweet chuck cried old gottlieb in the intervals of his hugs fear not my father they are punished and margarita related the story of the strangers prowess elevating him into a second siegfried the guard huzzaed him but did not pursue the baron old gottlieb without hesitation saluted the astonished champion with a kiss on either cheek my best friend you have saved my daughter from indignity come with us home if you can believe that a home where the wolves come daring us dragging our dear ones from our very doorsteps come that we may thank you under a roof at least my little daughter is she not a brave lass shes nothing less than the white rose of germany said the stranger with a good bend of the shoulders to margarita so shes called exclaimed gottlieb she s worthy to be a man men would be the losers then more than they could afford replied the stranger with a ringing laugh come good friend said gottlieb you must need refreshment prove you are a true hero by your appetite as charles the great said to archbishop turpin i conquered the world because nature gave me a gizzard for everywhere the badge of subjection is a poor stomach come all a day well ended notwithstanding the silver arrow at the threshold of gottliebs house a number of the chief burgesses of cologne had corporated spontaneously to condole with him as he came near they raised a hubbub of gratulation strong were the expressions of abhorrence and disgust of werners troop in which these excellent citizens clothed their outraged feelings for the insult to gottlieb was the insult of all the rhinestream taxes were provoking enough to endure but that the licence of these freebooting bands should extend to the homes of free and peaceful men loyal subjects of the emperor was a sign that the evil had reached from pricks to pokes as the saying went and must now be met as became burgesses of ancient cologne and by joint action destroyed in in all of you said gottlieb broadening his smile to suit the many we ll talk about that indoors meantime ive got a hero to introduce to you flesh and blood no old womans coin and young girls dreamoday the honest thing and a rarity my masters all that over some good rhinejuice from above bacharach in and welcome friends gottlieb drew the stranger along with him under the carved old oakwood portals and the rest paired and reverentially entered in his wake margarita to make up for this want of courtesy formed herself the last of the procession she may have had another motive for she took occasion there to whisper something to farina bringing sun and cloud over his countenance in rapid flushes he seemed to remonstrate in dumb show but she with an attitude of silence signified her wish to seal the conversation and he drooped again on the door step she paused a moment and hung her head pensively as if moved by a reminiscence the youth had hurried away some strides margarita looked after him his arms were straightened to his flanks his hands clenched and straining out from the wrist he had the aspect of one tugging against the restraint of a chain that suddenly let out link by link to his whole force farina she called and wound him back with a run farina you do not think me ungrateful i could not tell my father in the crowd what you did for me he shall know he will thank you he does not understand you now farina he will look not so sorrowful so much i would say to you so much was rushing on her mind that her maidenly heart became unruly and warned her to beware the youth stood as if listening to a nightingale of the old woods after the first sweet stress of her voice was in his ear when she ceased he gazed into her eyes they were no longer deep and calm like forest lakes the tenderglowing blue quivered as with a spark of the young girls soul in the beams of the moon then rising oh margarita said the youth in tones that sank to sighs what am i to win your thanks though it were my life for such a boon he took her hand and she did not withdraw it twice his lips dwelt upon those pure fingers margarita you forgive me i have been so long without hope i have kissed your hand dearest of gods angels she gently restrained the full white hand in his pressure margarita i have thought never before death to have had this sacred bliss i am guerdoned in advance for every grief coming before death she dropped on him one look of a confiding softness that was to the youth like the opened gate of the innocent garden of her heart you pardon me margarita i may call you my beloved strive wait pray hope for you my star of life her face was so sweet a charity dear love one wordor say nothing but remain and move not so beautiful you are oh might i kneel to you here dote on you worship this white hand for ever the colour had passed out of her cheeks like a blissful western red leaving rich paleness in the sky and with her clear brows levelled at him her bosom lifting more and more rapidly she struggled against the charm that was on her and at last released her hand i must go i cannot stay pardon you who might not be proud of your lovefarewell she turned to move away but lingered a step from him hastily touching her bosom and either hand as if to feel for a brooch or a ring then she blushed drew the silver arrow from the gathered goldshot braids above her neck held it out to him and was gone farina clutched the treasure and reeled into the street half a dozen neighbours were grouped by the door what s the matter in master groschens house now one asked as he plunged into the midst of them matter quoth the joydrunken youth catching at the word and mused off into raptures there never was such happiness tis paradise within exile without but what exile a star ever in the heavens to lighten the road and cheer the path of the banished one and he loosened his vest and hugged the cold shaft on his breast what are you talking and capering at fellow exclaimed another cant you answer about those shrieks like a christian you that have just come out of the house why theres shrieking now it s a woman thousand thunders it sounds like the frau lisbeths voice what can be happening to her perhaps shes on fire was coolly suggested between two or three pity to see the old house burnt remarked one house the woman man the woman ah replied the other an ancient inhabitant of cologne shaking his head the house is oldest farina now recovering his senses heard shrieks that he recognized as possible in the case of aunt lisbeth dreading the wickedness of an opposing sex and alarmed by the inrush of old gottliebs numerous guests to confirm him she soon appeared and hung herself halfway out of one of the upper windows calling desperately to st ursula for aid he thanked the old lady in his heart for giving him a pretext to enter paradise again but before even love could speed him frau lisbeth was seized and dragged remorselessly out of sight and he and the rosy room darkened together farina twice strode off to the rhinestream as many times he returned it was hard to be away from her it was harder to be near and not close his heart flamed into jealousy of the stranger everything threatened to overturn his slight but lofty structure of bliss so suddenly shot into the heavens he had but to remember that his hand was on the silver arrow and a radiance broke upon his countenance and a calm fell upon his breast it was a plight of her troth to me mused the youth she loves me she would not trust her frank heart to speak oh generous young girl what am i to dare hope for such a prize for i never can be worthy and she is one who giving her heart gives it all do i not know her how lovely she looked thanking the stranger the blue of her eyes the warmlighted blue seemed to grow full on the closing lids like heavens gratitude her beauty is wonderful what wonder then if he loves her i should think him a squire in his degree there are squires of high birth and low so mused farina with his arms folded and his legs crossed in the shadow of margaritas chamber gradually he fell into a kind of hazy doze the houses became branded with silver arrows all up the cathedral stone was a glitter and dance and quiver of them in the sky mazed confusion of arrowy flights and falls farina beheld himself in the service of the emperor watching these signs and expecting on the morrow to win glory and a name for margarita glory and the name now won old gottlieb was just on the point of paternally blessing them when a rude pat aroused him from the delicious moondream hero by day houseguard by night that tells a tale said a cheerful voice the moon was shining down the cathedral square and street and farina saw the stranger standing solid and ruddy before him he was at first prompted to resent such familiar handling but the strangers face was of that bland honest nature which like the sun wins everywhere back a reflection of its own kindliness you are right replied farina so it is pretty wines inside there and a rare young maiden she has a throat like a nightingale and more ballads at command than a pipers wallet now if i hadnt a wife at home youre married cried farina seizing the strangers hand surely and my lass can say something for herself on the score of brave looks as well as the best of your german maids here trust me farina repressed an inclination to perform a few of those antics which violent joy excites and after rushing away and back determined to give his secret to the stranger look said he in a whisper that opens the private doors of a confidence but the stranger repeated the same word still more earnestly and brought farinas eyes on a couple of dark figures moving under the cathedral some lambs at stake when the wolves are prowling he added tis now two hours to the midnight i doubt if our days work be over till we hear the chime friend what interest do you take in the people of this house that you watch over them thus asked farina the stranger muffled a laugh in his beard an odd question good sooth why in the first place we like well whatso we have done good work for that goes for something in the second ive broken bread in this house put down that in the reckoning in the third well in the third add up all together and the sum totals at your service young sir farina marked him closely there was not a spot on his face for guile to lurk in or suspicion to fasten on he caught the strangers hand you called me friend just now make me your friend look i was going to say i love this maiden i would die for her i have loved her long this night she has given me a witness that my love is not vain i am poor she is rich i am poor i said and feel richer than the kaiser with this she has given me look it is what our german girls slide in their backhair this silver arrow a very pretty piece of heathenish wear exclaimed the stranger then i was going to saytell me friend of a way to win honour and wealth quickly i care not at how rare a risk only to wealth or high baronry will her father give her the stranger buzzed on his moustache in a pause of cool pity such as elders assume when young men talk of conquering the world for their mistresses and in truth it is a calm of mind well won things look so brisk at home here in the matter of the maiden that i should say wait a while and watch your chance but youre a boy of pluck i serve in the kaisers army under my lord the kaiser will be here in three days if you re of that mind then i doubt little you may get posted well but look again theres a ripe brew yonder marry you may win your spurs this night even who knowss life theres a tall fellow joining those two lurkers can you see into the murk shadow sir squire ay thanks to your styrian dungeons where i passed a years apprenticeship i learnt to watch the rats and mice at play with never a candleend they playd so well they sang so nice they dubbd me comrade called me friend so says the ballad of our redbeard kings captivity all evil has a good when our toes and chins are up poison plants make sweetest cup as the old wives mumble to us when were sick heigho would i were in the little island well home again though that were just their song of welcome to me as i am a christian tell me your name friend said farina guys my name young man goshawks my title guy the goshawk so they called me in my merry land the cap sticks when it no longer fits then i drove the arrow and was down on my enemy ere he could ruffle a feather now what would be my nickname a change so sad and a change so bad might set both christian and heathen a sighing change is a curse for its all for the worse age creeps up and youth is flying and so on with the old song but here am i and yonders a game that wants harrying so well just begin to nose about them a bit he crossed to the other side of the street and farina followed out of the moonlight the two figures and the taller one were evidently observing them for they also changed their position and passed behind an angle of the cathedral tell me how the streets cross all round the cathedral you know the city said the stranger holding out his hand farina traced with his finger a rough map of the streets on the strangers hand good thats how my lord always marks the battlefield and makes me show him the enemys posts forward this way he turned from the cathedral and both slid along close under the eaves and front hangings of the houses neither spoke farina felt that he was in the hands of a skilful captain and only regretted the want of a weapon to make harvest of the intended surprise for he judged clearly that those were fellows of werners band on the lookout they wound down numberless intersections of narrow streets with irregularbuilt houses standing or leaning wryfaced in row here a quaintbeamed cottage there almost a mansion with gilt arms brackets and devices oillamps unlit hung at intervals by the corners near a pale christ on crucifix across the passages they hung alight the passages and alleys were too dusky and close for the moon in her brightest ardour to penetrate down the streets a slender lane of white beams could steal in all conscience as the good citizens of cologne declared enough for those heathen hounds and sons of the sinful who are abroad when gods own blessed lamp is out so when there was a moon the expense of oil was saved to the cologne treasury thereby satisfying the virtuous after incessant doubling here and there listening to footfalls and themselves eluding a chase which their suspicious movements aroused they came upon the rhine a full flood of moonlight burnished the knightly river in glittering scales and plates and rings as headlong it rolled seaward on from under crag and banner of old chivalry and rapine both greeted the scene with a burst of pleasure the grey mist of flats on the south side glimmered delightful to their sight coming from that drowsy crowd and press of habitations but the solemn glory of the river delaying not heedless impassionedpouring on in some sublime conference between it and heaven to the great marriage of waters deeply shook farinas enamoured heart the youth could not restrain his tears as if a magic wand had touched him he trembled with love and that delicate bliss which maiden hope first showers upon us like a silver rain when she has taken the shape of some young beauty and plighted us her fair fleeting hand tenderly embraced him as they were emerging into the spaces of the moon a cheer from the stranger arrested farina seest thou on the wharf there that is the very one the tallest of the three lakin but we shall have him wrapt in a long cloak with low pointed cap and feather stood the person indicated he appeared to be meditating on the flow of the water unaware of hostile presences or quite regardless of them there was a majesty in his height and air which made the advance of the two upon him more wary and respectful than their first impulse had counselled they could not read his features which were mantled behind voluminous folds all save a pair of very strange eyes that even as they gazed directly downward seemed charged with restless fiery liquid the two were close behind him guy the goshawk prepared for one of those fatal pounces on the foe that had won him his title he consulted farina mutely who nodded readiness but the instant after a cry of anguish escaped from the youth lost gone lost where is it where the arrow the silver arrow my margarita ere the echoes of his voice had ceased lamenting into the distance they found themselves alone on the wharf the lilies of the valley he opened like a bat said the stranger his shadow was red said farina he was off like an arrow said the stranger oh pledge of my young love how could i lose thee exclaimed the youth and his eyes were misted with tears guy the goshawk shook his brown locks gravely bring me a man and i ll stand up against him whoever he be like a man but this fellow has an ill scent and foreign ways about him that he has his eye boils all down my backbone and tingles at my fingertips jesu save us save us repeated farina with the echo of a deadened soul they made the sign of the cross and purified the place with holy ejaculations i ve seen him at last grant it be for the last time thats my prayer in the name of the virgin and trinity said guy and now lets retrace our steps perchance we shall hunt up that bauble of yours but im not fit for mortal work this night longer burdened by their black encounter the two passed again behind the cathedral farinas hungry glances devoured each footmark of their track where the moon held no lantern for him he went on his knees and groped for his lost treasure with a misers eager patience of agony drawing his hand slowly over the stony kerb and between the interstices of the thicksown flints like an acutefeeling worm despair grew heavy in his breast at every turning he invoked some good new saint to aid him and ran over all the propitiations his fancy could suggest and his religious lore inspire byandby they reached the head of the street where margarita dwelt the moon was dipping down and paler as if touched with a warning of dawn chill sighs from the open land passed through the spaces of the city on certain coloured gables and woodcrossed fronts the white light lingered but mostly the houses were veiled in dusk and gottliebs house was confused in the twilight with those of his neighbours notwithstanding its greater stateliness and the old grandeur of its timbered bulk they determined to take up their position there again and paced on farina with his head below his shoulders and guy nostril in air as if uneasy in his sense of smell on the windowledge of a fairfitted domicile stood a flowerpot a rude earthen construction in the form of a riverbarge wherein grew some valley lilies that drooped their white bells over the sides the goshawk eyed them wistfully i must smell those blessed flowers if i wish to be saved and he stamped resolve with his staff moved by this exclamation farina gazed up at them how like a company of maidens they look floating in the vessel of life he said guy curiously inspected farina and the flowerpot shrugged and with his comrades aid mounted to a level with it seized the prize and redescended there he cried between long luxurious sniffs that chases him out of the nostril sooner than aught else the breath of a fresh lasslike flower i was tormented till now by the reek of the damned rising from under me this is heavens own incense i think and guy inhaled the flowers and spake prettily to them they have a melancholy sweetness friend said farina i think of whispering fays and elf and erl when their odour steals through me do not you nay nor hope to till my wits are clean gone was the goshawks reply to my mind tis an honest flower and could i do good service by the young maiden who there set it i should be rendering back good service done for if that flower has not battled the devil in my nose this night and beaten him my heads a medlar i scarce know whether as a devout christian i should listen to that friend farina mildly remonstrated lilies are indeed emblems of the saints but then they are not poor flowers of earth being transfigured lustrous unfadingly oh cross and passion with what silver serenity thy glory enwraps me gazing on these fair bells i look on the white sea of the saints i am enamoured of fleshly anguish and martyrdom all beauty is that worn by wansmiling faces wherein hope sits as a crown on sorrow and the pale ebb of mortal life is the twilight of joy everlasting colourless peace oh my beloved so walkest thou for my soul on the white sea ever at night clad in the straight fall of thy spotless virgin linen bearing in thy hand the lily and leaning thy cheek to it where the human rose is softened to a milky bloom of red the espousals of heaven with earth over thee moving with thee a wreath of sapphire stars and the solitude of purity around ah sighed the goshawk dandling his flowerpot the moon gives strokes as wells the sun i faith moonstruck and maidstruck in one hell be asking for his head soon this dash of the monk and the minstrel is a sure sign that s their way of loving in this land they all go mad straight off i never heard such talk guy accompanied these remarks with a pitiful glance at his companion come sir lover lend me a help to give back what weve borrowed to its rightful owner s blood but i feel an appetite this nightair takes me in the wind like a battering ram i thought i had laid in a stout fourandtwenty hours stock of westphalian wurst at master groschens suppertable good stuff washed down with superior rhine wine say your liebfrauenmilch for my taste though when i first tried it i grimaced like a merryandrew and remembered roast beef and gloster ale in my prayers the goshawk was in the act of replacing the pot of lilies when a blow from a short truncheon skilfully flung struck him on the neck and brought him to the ground with him fell the lilies he glared to the right and left and grasped the broken flowerpot for a return missile but no enemy was in view to test his accuracy of aim the deeparched doorways showed their empty recesses the windows slept has that youth played me false thought the discomfited squire as he leaned quietly on his arm farina was nowhere near guy was quickly reassured by my fay now thats a fine thing and a fine fellow and a fleet foot that lad ll rise hell be a squire some day look at him bowels of abecket tis a sight id rather see that now than old groschen s suppertable groaning with wurst again and running a river of rudesheimer tussle on ill lend a hand if theres occasion but you shall have the honour boy an you can win it this crying on of the hound was called forth by a chase up the street in which the goshawk beheld farina pursue and capture a stalwart runaway who refused with all his might to be brought back striving every two and three of his tiptoe steps to turn against the impulse farina had got on his neck and nether garments who d have thought the lad was so wiry and mettlesome with his soft face blue eyes and lank locks but a green mead has more in it than many a black mountain hail and well done if i could dub you knight i would trust me and he shook farina by the hand farina modestly stood aside and allowed the goshawk to confront his prisoner so sir shyithedark gallant stickitheback squire truncheon and knight of the noble order of quicksilver legs just take your stand at the distance you were off me when you discharged this instrument at my head by r lady i smart a scratch to pay you in coin and its lucky for you the coin is small or you might reckon on it the same trust me now back the goshawk lunged out with the truncheon but the prisoner displayed no hesitation in complying and fell back about a space of fifteen yards i suppose he guesses ive never done the stupid trick before mused guy or he would not be so sharp observing that farina had also fallen back in a line as guard guy motioned him to edge off to the right more bawling never mind why now thought guy if i were sure of notching him id do the speech part first but as im notthrowing truncheons being no honourable profession anywhereill reserve that the rascal dont quail well see how long he stands firm the goshawk cleared his wrist fixed his eye and swung the truncheon meditatively to and fro by one end he then launched off the shoulder a mighty downfling calmly watching it strike the prisoner to earth like an ox under the hammer a hit said he and smoothed his wrist farina knelt by the body and lifted the head on his breast berthold berthold he cried no further harm shall hap to you man speak you ken the scapegrace said guy sauntering up tis berthold schmidt son of old schmidt the great goldsmith of cologne st dunstan was not at his elbow this time a rival of mine whispered farina oho and the goshawk wound a low hiss at his tongues tip well as i should have spoken if his ears had been open justice struck the blow and a gentle one this comes of taking a flying shot and not standing up fair and that seems all that can be said where lives he farina pointed to the house of the lilies beshrew me the dog has some right on his side whew yonder he lives he took us for some nightprowlers why not come up fairly and ask my business smelling a flower is not worth a broken neck nor defending your premises quite deserving a hole in the pate now my lad you see what comes of dealing with cut and run blows and let this be a warning to you they took the body by head and feet and laid him at the door of his fathers house here the colour came to his cheek and they wiped off the streaks of blood that stained him guy proved he could be tender with a fallen foe and farina with an illfated rival it was who could suggest the soundest remedies or easiest postures one lent a kerchief and nursed him another ran to the city fountain and fetched him water meantime the moon had dropped and morning grey and beamless looked on the housepeaks and along the streets with steadier eye they now both discerned a body of men far down fronting gottliebs house and drawn up in some degree of order all their charity forsook them at once possess thyself of the truncheon said guy you see it can damage more work before breakfast and a fine account i must give of myself to my hostess of the three holy kings farina recovered the destructive little instrument i am ready said he but hark theres little work for us there i fancy those be lads of cologne no grunters of the wild tis the white rose club always too late for service voices singing a hunting glee popular in that age swelled up the clear morning air and gradually the words became distinct the kaiser went ahunting ahunting trara with his buglehorn at springing morn the kaiser trampled bud and thorn trara and the dew shakes green as the horsemen rear and a thousand feathers they flutter with fear and a pang drives quick to the heart of the deer for the kaisers out ahunting trara ta ta ta ta trara trara tata trara trara the owner of the truncheon awoke to these reviving tones and uttered a faint responsive trara hark again said farina in reply to the commendation of the goshawk whose face was dimpled over with the harmony the wild boar lay agrunting agrunting trara and boom comes the kaiser to hunt up me or queak the small birdie that hops on the tree trara o birdie and boar and deer lie tame for a maiden in bloom or a fullblown dame are the daintiest prey and the windingest game when kaisers go ahunting trara ha ha ha ha trara trara haha trara trara the voices held long on the last note and let it die in a forest cadence fore gad well done hurrah trara haha trara thats a trick were not half alive to at home said guy i feel friendly with these german lads the goshawks disposition toward german lads was that moment harshly tested by a smart rap on the shoulder from an end of german oak and a proclamation that he was prisoner of the hand that gave the greeting in the name of the white rose club following that his staff was wrested from him by a dozen stout young fellows who gave him no time to get his famous distance for defence against numbers and he and farina were marched forthwith to the chorusing body in front of gottlieb groschens house the missives of all the inmates gottlieb had slept most with the day on his eyelids for werner hung like a nightmare over him margarita lay and dreamed in rosecolour and if she thrilled on her pillowed silken couch like a tensestrung harp and fretted drowsily in little leaps and starts it was that a bird lay in her bosom panting and singing through the night and that he was not to be stilled but would musically utter the sweetest secret thoughts of a lovebewitched maiden farinas devotion she knew his tenderness she divined his courage she had that day witnessed the young girl no sooner felt that she could love worthily than she loved with her whole strength muffed and remote came the huntingsong under her pillow and awoke dreamy delicate curves in her fair face as it thinned but did not banish her dream aunt lisbeth also heard the song and burst out of her bed to see that the door and window were secured against the wanton kaiser despite her trials she had taken her spell of sleep but being possessed of some mystic maiden belief that in cases of apprehended peril from man bed was a rock of refuge and fortified defence she crept back there and allowed the sun to rise without her gottliebs voice could not awaken her to the household duties she loved to perform with such a doleful visage she heard him open his window and parley in angry tones with the musicians below decoys muttered aunt lisbeth be thou alive to them gottlieb he went downstairs and opened the street door whereupon the scolding and railing commenced anew thou hast given them vantage gottlieb brother mine she complained and the good heavens only can say what may result from such indiscreetness a silence combustible with shuffling of feet in the passage and on the stairs dinned horrors into aunt lisbeths head it was just that sound in the left wing of hollenbogenblitz she said only then it was night and not morning ursula preserve me why lisbeth lisbeth cried gottlieb from below come down tis full five o the morning heres company and what are we to do without the woman ah gottlieb that is like men they do not consider how different it is for us which mysterious sentence being uttered to herself alone enjoyed a meaning it would elsewhere have been denied aunt lisbeth dressed and met margarita descending they exchanged the goodmorning of young maiden and old go thou first said aunt lisbeth margarita gaily tripped ahead girl cried aunt lisbeth whats that thing in thy back hair i have borrowed lieschens arrow aunt mine has had an accident lieschens arrow an accident now i will see to that after breakfast margarita trara tata trara trara sang margarita the wild boar lay agrunting agrunting trara a maidens true and proper ornament look at mine child i have worn it fifty years may i deserve to wear it till i am called o margarita trifle not with that symbol o birdie and boar and deer lie tame i am so happy aunty nice times to be happy in margarita be happy in spring sweet maidens all for autumns chill will early fall so sings the minnesinger aunty and a maiden in the wintry leaf will spread her own disease of grief i love the minnesingers dear sweetmannered men they are such lovers and men of deeds as well as song sword on one side and harp on the other they fight till set of sun and then slacken their armour to waft a ballad to their beloved by moonlight covered with stains of battle as they are and weary what a girl minnesingers yes i know stories of those minnesingers they came to the castlemargarita a bead of thy cross is broken i will attend to it wear the pearl one till i mend this mayst thou never fall in the way of minnesingers they are not like werners troop they do not batter at doors they slide into the house like snakes lisbeth lisbeth they heard gottlieb calling impatiently we come gottlieb and in a low murmur margarita heard her say may this day pass without trouble and shame to the pious and the chaste margarita knew the voice of the stranger before she had opened the door and on presenting herself the hero gave her a guardianlike salute one may see he said that it requires better men than those of werner to drive away the rose from that cheek gottlieb pressed the rosy cheek to his shoulder and patted her what do you think grete you have now forty of the best lads in cologne enrolled to protect you and keep guard over the house night and day there what more could a pfalzgrafin ask now and voluntary service all to be paid with a smile which i daresay my lady wont refuse them lisbeth you know our friend fear him not good lisbeth and give us breakfast well sweet chuck youre to have royal honours paid you i warrant theyve begun good work already in locking up that idle moony vagabond farina him what for my father how dared they what has he done o start not my fairy maid a small matter of breakage pet he tried to enter cunigonde schmidts chamber and knocked down her pot of lilies for which berthold schmidt knocked him down and our friend here out of good fellowship knocked down berthold however the chief offender is marched off to prison by your trusty guard and there let him cool himself berthold shall tell you the tale himself hell be here to breakfast and receive your orders mistress commanderinchief the goshawk had his eye on margarita her teeth were tight down on her nether lip and her whole figure had a strange look of awkwardness she was so divided with anger as witness of the affair i think i shall make a clearer statement fair maiden he interposed in the first place i am the offender we passed under the window of the fraulein schmidt and twas i mounted to greet the lilies one shoot of them is in my helm and here let me present them to a worthier holder he offered the flowers with a smile and margarita took them radiant with gratitude our friend berthold he continued thought proper to aim a blow at me behind my back and then ran for his comrades he was caught and by my gallant young hero farina concerning whose character i regret that your respected father and i differ for on the faith of a soldier and true man hes the finest among the fine fellows ive yet met in germany trust me so to cut the story short execution was done upon berthold by my hand for an act of treachery he appears to be a sort of captain of one of the troops and not affectionately disposed to farina for the version of the affair you have heard from your father is a little invention of master bertholds own to do him justice he seemed equally willing to get me under the cold stone but a word from your good father changed the current and as i thought i could serve our friend better free than behind bars i accepted liberty pshaw i should have accepted it any way to tell the truth for your german dungeons are mortal shivering ratty places so rank me no hero fair mistress margarita though the temptation to seem one in such sweet eyes was beginning to lead me astray and now as to our business in the streets at this hour believe the best of us i will i do said margarita lisbeth lisbeth called gottlieb breakfast little sister our champion is starving he asks for wurst milkloaves wine and all thy rarest conserves haste then for the honour of cologne is at stake aunt lisbeth jingled her keys in and out and soon that harmony drew a number of domestics with platters of swine flesh rolls of white wheaten bread the perpetual worst milk wine barleybread and household stores of dainties in profusion all sparkling on silver relieved by spotless white cloth gottlieb beheld such a sunny twinkle across the goshawks face at this hospitable array that he gave the word of onset without waiting for berthold and his guest immediately fell to and did not relax in his exertions for a full halfhour by the cathedral clock eschewing the beer with a wry look made up of scorn and ruefulness and drinking a wellbrimmed health in rhine wine all round margarita was pensive aunt lisbeth on her guard gottlieb remembered charles the greats counsel to archbishop turpin and did his best to remain on earth one of its lords dominant poor berthold said he tis a good lad and deserves his seat at my table oftener i suppose the flowerpot business has detained him well drink to him eh grete drink to him dear fatherbut here he is to thank you in person margarita felt a twinge of pity as berthold entered the livid stains of his bruise deepened about his eyes and gave them a wicked light whenever they were fixed intently but they looked earnest and spoke of a combat in which he could say that he proved no coward and was used with some cruelty she turned on the goshawk a mute reproach yet smiled and loved him well when she beheld him stretch a hand of welcome and proffer a brotherly glass to berthold the rich goldsmiths son was occupied in studying the horoscope of his fortunes in margaritas eyes but when margarita directed his attention to guy he turned to him with a glance of astonishment that yielded to cordial greeting well done berthold my brave boy all are friends who sit at table said gottlieb in any case at my table tis a worthy foe forgives the blow was dealt him full and fairly says the song and the proverb takes it up with a generous enemy is a friend on the wrong side and no ones to blame for that save old dame fortune so now a bumper to this jovial makeup between you lisbeth you must drink it the little woman bowed melancholy obedience why did you fling and run whispered guy to berthold because you were two against one two against one man why have you no such thing as fair play in this land of yours did you think i should have taken advantage of that how could i tell who you were or what you would do muttered berthold somewhat sullenly truly no friend so you ran to make yourself twenty to two but dont be down on the subject i was going to say that though i treated you in a manner upright twas perhaps a trifle severe considering your youth but an examples everything and i must let you know in confidence that no rascal truncheon had i flung in my life before so you see i gave you all the chances berthold moved his lips in reply but thinking of the figure of defeat he was exhibiting before margarita caused him to estimate unfavourably what chances had stood in his favour the health was drunk aunt lisbeth touched the smoky yellow glass with a mincing lip and beckoned margarita to withdraw the tapestry child she said dangerous things are uttered after the third glass i know margarita do you call my champion handsome aunt i was going to speak to you about him margarita if i remember he has rough good looks as far as they go yes but thou maiden art thou thinking of him i have thrice watched him wink and that as we know is a habit of them that have sold themselves and what is frail womankind to expect from such a brawny animal and oh to lace his armour up and speed him to the field to pledge him in a kissingcup the knight that will not yield i am sure he is tender aunt notice how gentle he looks now and then thou girl yes i believe she is madly in love with him tender and gentle so is the bear when youre outside his den but enter it maiden and try thou good ursula preserve me from such a fate fear not dear aunt have not a fear of it besides it is not always the men that are bad you must not forget dalilah and lots wife and pfalzgrafin jutta and the baroness who asked for a piece of poor kraut but let us work let us work margarita sat down before siegfried and contemplated the hero for the first time she marked a resemblance in his features to farina the same long yellow hair scattered over his shoulders as that flowing from under siegfrieds helm the blue eyes square brows and regular outlines this is a marvel thought margarita and farina it was to watch over me that he roamed the street last night my best one is he not beautiful and she looked closer at siegfried aunt lisbeth had begun upon the dragon with her usual method and was soon wandering through skeleton halls of the old palatial castle in bohemia the woolly tongue of the monster suggested fresh horrors to her and if margarita had listened she might have had fair excuses to forget her lovers condition but her voice only did service like a piece of clockwork and her mind was in the prison with farina she was long debating how to win his release and meditated so deeply and exclaimed in so many bursts of impatience that aunt lisbeth found her heart melting to the maiden now said she that is a wellknown story about the electress dowager of bavaria when she came on a visit to the castle and my dear child be it a warning terrible too and the little woman shivered pleasantly she hadi may tell you this margaritayes she had been false to her wedded husbandyou understand maiden or no you do not understand i understand it only partly mind false i say falsenot true go on dear aunty said margarita catching the word i believe she knows as much as i do ejaculated aunt lisbeth such are girls nowadays when i was youngoh for a maiden to know anything thenoh it was general reprobation no one thought of confessing it we blushed and held down our eyes at the very idea well the electress she wasyou must guess so she called for her caudle at eleven oclock at night what do you think that was well there was spirit in it not to say nutmeg and lemon and peach kernels she wanted me to sit with her but i begged my mistress to keep me from the naughty woman and no friend of hilda of bayern was bertha of bohmen you may be sure oh the things she talked while she was drinking her caudle isentrude sat with herand said it was fearfulbeyond blasphemy and that she looked like a bible witch sitting up drinking and swearing and glaring in her nightclothes and nightcap she was on a journey into hungary and claimed the hospitality of the castle on her way there both were widows well it was a quarter to twelve the electress dropped back on her pillow as she always did when she had finished the candle isentrude covered her over heaped up logs on the fire wrapped her dressinggown about her and prepared to sleep it was winter and the wind howled at the doors and rattled the windows and shook the arraslord help us outside was all snow and nothing but forest as you saw when you came to me there gretelchen twelve struck isentrude was dozing but she says that after the last stroke she woke with cold a foggy chill hung in the room she looked at the electress who had not moved the fire burned feebly and seemed weighed upon herr jeshe thought she heard a noise no quite quiet as heaven preserve her says slip the smell in that room grew like an open grave clammily putrid holy virgin this time she was certain she heard a noise but it seemed on both sides of her there was the great door leading to the first landing and stateroom and opposite exactly there was the panel of the secret passage the noises seemed to advance as if step by step and grew louder in each ear as she stood horrified on the marble of the hearth she looked at the electress again and her eyes were wide open but for all isentrudes calling she would not wake only think now the noise increased and was a regular trampgrate trampscrew soundcoming nearer and nearer saints of mercy the apartment was choking with vapours isentrude made a dart and robed herself behind a curtain of the bed just as the two doors opened she could see through a slit in the woven work and winked her eyes which she had shut close on hearing the scream of the doorhingeswinked her eyes to catch a sight for momentwe are such sinful curious creatureswhat she saw then she says she shall never forget nor i as she was a living woman there she saw the two dead princes the prince palatine of bohemia and the elector of bavaria standing front to front at the foot of the bed all in white armour with drawn swords and attendants holding pinetorches neither of them spoke their vizors were down but she knew them by their arms and bearing both tall stately presences good knights in their day and had fought against the infidel so one of them pointed to the bed and then a torch was lowered and the fight commenced isentrude saw the sparks fly and the steel struck till it was shattered but they fought on not caring for wounds and snorting with fury as they grew hotter they fought a whole hour the poor girl was so eaten up with looking on that she let go the curtain and stood quite exposed among them so to steady herself she rested her hand on the bedside andthink what she felta hand as cold as ice locked hers and get from it she could not that instant one of the princes fell it was bohmen bayern sheathed his sword and waved his hand and the attendants took up the slaughtered ghost feet and shoulders and bore him to the door of the secret passage while bayern strode after shameful exclaimed margarita i will speak to berthold as he descends i hear him coming he shall do what i wish call it dreadful grete dreadful it was if berthold would like to sit and hearah she is gone a good girl and of a levity only on the surface aunt lisbeth heard margaritas voice rapidly addressing berthold his reply was low and brief refuses to listen to anything of the sort aunt lisbeth interpreted it then he seemed to be pleading and margarita uttering short answers i trust tis nothing a maiden should not hear the little lady exclaimed with a sigh the door opened and lieschen stood at the entrance for fraulein margarita she said holding a letter halfway out give it aunt lisbeth commanded the woman hesitatedtis for the fraulein give it i tell thee and aunt lisbeth eagerly seized the missive and subjected it to the ordeal of touch it was heavy and contained something hard long pensive pressures revealed its shape on the paper it was an arrow go said she to the woman and once alone began beelike to buzz all over it and finally entered it contained margaritas silver arrow the art of that girl and the writing said sweetest maiden by this arrow of our betrothal i conjure thee to meet me in all haste without the western gate where burning to reveal to thee most urgent tidings that may not be confided to paper now waits petitioning the saints thy farina aunt lisbeth placed letter and arrow in a drawer locked it and always thought so she ascended the stairs to consult with gottlieb roars of laughter greeted her just as she lifted the latch and she retreated abashed there was no time to lose farina must be caught in the act of waiting for margarita and by gottlieb or herself gottlieb was revelling may this be a warning to thee gottlieb murmured lisbeth as she hooded her little body in margaritas furcloak and determined that she would be the one to confound farina five minutes later margarita returned aunt lisbeth was gone the dragon still lacked a tip to his forked tongue and a stream of fiery threads dangled from the jaws of the monster another letter was brought into the room by lieschen for aunt lisbeth said margarita reading the address who can it be from she does not stand pressing about your letters said the woman and informed margarita of the foregoing missive you say she drew an arrow from it said margarita with burning face who brought this tell me and just waiting to hear it was farinas mother she tore the letter open and read dearest lisbeth thy old friend writes to thee she that has scarce left eyes to see the words she writes thou knowest we are a fallen house through the displeasure of the emperor on my dead husband my son farina is my only stay and well returns to me the blessings i bestow upon him some call him idle some think him too wise i swear to thee lisbeth he is only good his hours are devoted to the extraction of essencesto no black magic now he is in troublein prison the shadow that destroyed his dead father threatens him now by our old friendship beloved lisbeth intercede with gottlieb that he may plead for my son before the emperor when he comes margarita read no more she went to the window and saw her guard marshalled outside she threw a kerchief over her head and left the house by the garden gate the monk by this time the sun stood high over cologne the marketplaces were crowded with buyers and sellers mixed with a loitering swarm of soldiery for whose thirsty natures winestalls had been tumbled up barons and knights of the empire bravely mounted and thickly followed poured hourly into cologne from south germany and north here staring suabians and roundfeatured warriors of the east kingdom swaggered up and down patting what horses came across them for lack of occupation for their hands yonder huge pomeranians with bosks of beard stiffened out square from the chin hurtled mountainous among the peaceable inhabitants troopers dismounted went straddling in tight hose and loose prepared to drink goodwill to whomsoever would furnish the best quality liquor for that solemn pledge and equally ready to pick a quarrel with them that would not it was a scene of flaring feathers wideflapped bonnets flaunting hose blue and battered steel plates slashed woollen haunchbags leatherleggings ensigns and imperious boots and shoulders margarita was too hurried in her mind to be conscious of an imprudence but her limbs trembled and she instinctively quickened her steps when she stood under the sign of the three holy kings where dwelt farinas mother she put up a fervent prayer of thanks and breathed freely i had expected a message from lisbeth said frau farina but thou good heart thou wilt help us all that may be done by me i will do replied margarita but his mother yearns to see him and i have come to bear her company the old lady clasped her hands and wept has he found so good a friend my poor boy and trust me dear maiden he is not unworthy for better son never lived and good son good all surely we will go to him but not as thou art i will dress thee such throngs are in the streets i heard them clattering in early this morning rest dear heart till i return margarita had time to inspect the single sittingroom in which her lover lived it was planted with bottles and vases and pipes and cylinders piling on floor chair and table she could not suppress a slight surprise of fear for this display showed a dealing with hidden things and a summoning of scattered spirits it was this that made his brow so pale and the round of his eye darker than youth should let it be she dismissed the feeling and assumed her own bright face as dame farina reappeared bearing on her arm a convent garb and other apparel margarita suffered herself to be invested in the white and black robes of the denial of life there said the frau farina and to seal assurance i have engaged a guard to accompany us he was sorely bruised in a street combat yesterday and was billeted below where i nursed and tended him and he is grateful as man should bethough i did little doing my utmostand with him near us we have nought to fear good said margarita and they kissed and departed the guard was awaiting them outside come my little lady and with thee the holy sister tis no step from here and i gage to bring ye safe as sure as my names schwartz thierhey the good sisters dropping look now ill carry her margarita recovered her selfcommand before he could make good this offer only let us hasten there she gasped the thier strode on and gave them safeconduct to the prison where farina was confined being near one of the outer forts of the city thank and dismiss him whispered margarita nay he will waitwilt thou not friend we shall not be long though it is my son i visit here said frau farina till tomorrow morning my little lady the lion thanked him that plucked the thorn from his foot and the thier may be black but hes not ungrateful nor a worse beast than the lion they entered the walls and left him for the first five minutes schwartz thier found employment for his faculties by staring at the shaky smallpaned windows of the neighbourhood he persevered in this after all novelty had been exhausted from an intuitive dread of weariness there was nothing to see an old woman once bobbed out of an attic and doused the flints with water harassed by increasing dread of the foul nightmare of nothingtodo the thier endeavoured to establish amorous intelligence with her she responded with an indignant projection of the underjaw evanishing rapidly there was no resource left him but to curse her with extreme heartiness the thier stamped his right leg and then his left and remembered the old woman as a grievance five minutes longer when she was clean forgotten he yawned another spouse of the moment was wanted to be wooed objurgated and regretted the prisongate was in a secluded street few passengers went by and those who did edged away from the ponderous wantoneyed figure of lazy mischief lounging there as neatly as they well could the thier hailed two or three one took to his legs another bowed smirked gave him a kindly goodday and affected to hear no more having urgent business in prospect the thier was a faithful dog but the temptation to betray his trust and pursue them was mighty he began to experience an equal disposition to cry and roar he hummed a ballad i swore of her id have my will and with him id have my way i learnd my crossbow over the hill now what does my lady say give me the good old crossbow after all and none of these lumbering puffandbangs that knock you down oftener than your man a cross stands in the forest still and a cross in the churchyard grey my curse on him who had his will and on him who had his way good beginning bad ending tisnt so always many a cross has the crossbow built they say i wish i had mine now to peg off that old woman or somebody id swear shes peeping at me over the gable or behind some cranny theyre curious the old women curse em and the young for that matter devil a young one here when im in for the sack of a town what think ye i poke after up and down silver and gold i pocket in plenty but the sweet titbit is my lass under twenty i should like to be in for the sack of this cologne id nose out that pretty girl i was cheated of yesterday take the gold and silver and give me the maiden her necks silver and her hair gold ah and her cheeks roses and her mouthsay no more im half thinking werner the hungry animal has cast wolfs eyes on her they say he spoke of her last night dont let him thwart me thunderblast him i owe him a grudge hes beginning to forget my plan o life a flight of pigeons across the blue top of the street abstracted the thier from these reflections he gaped after them in despair and fell to stretching and shaking himself rattling his lungs with loud reports as he threw his eyes round again they encountered those of a monk opposite fastened on him in penetrating silence the thier hated monks as a wild beast shuns fire but now even a monk was welcome halloo he sung out the monk crossed over to him friend said he weariness is teaching thee wantonness wilt thou take service for a nights work where the danger is little the reward lasting as for that replied the thier danger comes to me like greenwood to the deer and good pay never yet was given in promises but im bound for the next hour to womankind within there theyre my masters as theyve been of tough fellows before me i will seek them and win their consent said the monk and so left him quick dealing thought the thier and grew brisker the baron wont want me tonight and what if he does let him hang himselfthough if he should twill be a pity im not by to help him he paced under the wall to its farthest course turning back he perceived the monk at the gateway a sharp hand thought the thier intrude no question on me the monk began but hold thy peace and follow the women release thee and gladly thats not my plan o life now money down and then command me and schwartz thier stood with one foot forward and hand stretched out a curl of scorn darkened the cold features of the monk he slid one hand into a side of his frock above the girdle and tossed a bag of coin take it if tis in thee to forfeit the greater blessing he cried contemptuously the thier peeped into the bag and appeared satisfied i follow said he lead on good father and ill be in the track of holiness for the first time since my mother was quit of me the monk hurried up the street and into the marketplace oblivious of the postures and reverences of the people who stopped to stare at him and his gaunt attendant as they crossed the square schwartz thier spied henker rothhals starting from a winestall on horseback and could not forbear hailing him before the monk had time to utter a reproach they were deep together in a doubleshot of query and reply whirr cried the thier breaking on some communication got her have they and swung her across stream im one with ye for my share or call me sheep he waved his hand to the monk and taking hold of the horses rein ran off beside his mounted confederate heavily shod as he was the monk frowned after him and swelled with a hard sigh gone he exclaimed and the accursed gold with him well did a voice warn me that such service was never to be bought he did not pause to bewail or repent but returned toward the prison with rapid footsteps muttering i with the prisonpass for two why was i beguiled by that bandit saw i not the very youth given into my hands there he that was with the damsel and the aged woman the ride and the race late in the noon a horseman in the livery of the kaisers bodyguard rode dry and dusty into cologne with tidings that the kaiser was at hammerstein castle and commanding all convocated knights barons counts and princes to assemble and prepare for his coming on a certain bare space of ground within two leagues of cologne thence to swell the train of his triumphal entry into the ancient city of his empire guy the goshawk broadset on a flemish mare and a packhorse beside him shortly afterward left the hotel of the three holy kings and trotted up to gottliebs door tentpitching is now my trade said he as gottlieb came down to him my lord is with the kaiser i must say farewell for the nonce is the young lady visible nor young nor old good friend replied gottlieb with a countenance somewhat ruffled i dined alone for lack of your company secret missives came i hear to each of them and both are gadding now what think you of this after the scene of yesterdaylisbeth too preaches from the old text master groschen never reckon on womankind for a wise act but farewell and tell mistress margarita that i take it ill of her not giving me her maiden hand to salute before parting my gravest respects to frau lisbeth i shall soon be sitting with you over that prime vintage of yours or fortunes dead against me so with a wring of the hand guy put the spur to his roundflanked beast and was quickly out of cologne on the rough roadway he was neither the first nor the last of the menatarms hastening to obey the kaisers mandate a string of horse and foot in serpentine knots stretched along the flat land flashing colours livelier than the springmeadows bordering their line of passage guy with a nod for all and a greeting for the bestdisposed pushed on toward the van till the gathering block compelled him to adopt the snails pace of the advance party and gave him work enough to keep his two horses from being jammed with the mass now and then he cast a weathereye on the heavens and was soon confirmed in an opinion he had repeatedly ejaculated that the first nights camping would be a drencher in the west a black bank of cloud was blotting out the sun before his time northeast shone bare fields of blue lightly touched with loosefloating strips and flakes of crimson vapour the furrows were growing purpledark and gradually a low moaning obscurity enwrapped the whole line and mufed the noise of hoof oath and waggonwheel in one sullen murmur guy felt very much like a chopped worm as he wriggled his way onward in the dusk impelled from the rear and reduced to grope after the main body frequent and deep counsel he took with a trusty flask suspended at his belt it was no pleasant reflection that the rain would be down before he could build up anything like shelter for horse and man still sadder the necessity of selecting his post on strange ground and in darkness he kept an anxious lookout for the moon and was presently rejoiced to behold a broad fire that twinkled branchy beams through an easthill orchard my lord calls her goddess said guy wistfully the titles outlandish and more the style of these foreigners but she may have it tonight an she ll just keep the storm from shrouding her bright eye a matter of two hours she rose with a boding lustre drifts of thin pale uppercloud leaned down ladders pure as virgin silver for her to climb to her highest seat on the unrebellious halfcircle of heaven my minds made up quoth guy to the listening part of himself out of this ill get by the clearer ray he had discerned a narrow track running a white parallel with the general route at the expense of dislocating a mile of the cavalcade he struck into it a dyke had to be taken some heavy fallows crossed and the way was straight before him he began to sneer at the slow jogtrot and absence of enterprise which made the fellows he had left shine so poorly in comparison with the goshawk but a sight of two cavaliers in advance checked his vanity and now to overtake them he tasked his fat flemish mare with unwonted pricks of the heel that made her fling out and show more mettle than speed the objects of this fiery chase did not at first awake to a sense of being pursued both rode with mantled visages and appeared profoundly inattentive to the world outside their meditations but the goshawk was not to be denied and by dint of alternately roaring at them and upbraiding his two stumping beasts he at last roused the younger of the cavaliers who called to his companion loudly without effect it seemed for he had to repeat the warning guy was close up with them when the youth exclaimed father holy father tis sathanas in person the other rose and pointed trembling to a dark point in the distance as he vociferated not here not here but yonder guy recognized the voice of the first speaker and cried stay halt a second have you forgotten the goshawk never came the reply and forget not farina spur and fleeter steeds carried them out of hearing ere guy could throw in another syllable farina gazed back on him remorsefully but the monk now rated his assistant with indignation thou weak one nothing less than fool to betray thy name on such an adventure as this to soul save the saints farina tossed back his locks and held his forehead to the moon all the monks ghostly wrath was foiled by the one little last sweet word of his beloved which made music in his ears whenever annoyance sounded and herein say the old writers are lovers who love truly truly recompensed for their toils and pains in that love for which they suffer is ever present to ward away suffering not sprung of love but the disloyal who serve not love faithfully are a race given over to whatso this base world can wreak upon them without consolation or comfort of their mistress love whom sacrificing not all to they know not to delight in the soul of a lover lives through every member of him in the joy of a moonlight ride sorrow and grief are slow distempers that crouch from the breeze and nourish their natures far from swiftmoving things a true lover is not one of those melancholy flies that shoot and maze over muddy stagnant pools he must be up in the great air he must strike all the strings of life swiftness is his rapture in his wide arms he embraces the whole form of beauty eaglelike are his instincts dovelike his desires then the fair moon is the very presence of his betrothed in heaven so for hours rode farina in a silverfleeting glory while the monk as a shadow galloped stern and silent beside him so crowning them in the sky one half was all love and light one blackness and fell purpose the combat on drachenfels not to earth was vouchsafed the honour of commencing the great battle of that night by an expiring blueshot beam of moonlight farina beheld a vast realm of gloom filling the hollow of the west and the moon was soon extinguished behind sluggish scraps of iron scud detached from the swinging bulk of ruin as heavily it ground on the atmosphere in the first thunderlaunch of motion the heart of the youth was strong but he could not view without quicker fawning throbs this manifestation of immeasurable power which seemed as if with a stroke it was capable of destroying creation and the works of man the bare aspect of the tempest lent terrors to the adventure he was engaged in and of which he knew not the aim nor might forecast the issue now there was nothing to illumine their path but such forked flashes as lightning threw them at intervals touching here a hill with clustered cottages striking into day there a mayblossom a patch of weed a single tree by the wayside suddenly a more vivid and continuous quiver of violet fire met its reflection on the landscape and farina saw the rhinestream beneath him on such a night thought he siegfried fought and slew the dragon a blast of light as from the jaws of the defeated dragon in his throes made known to him the country he traversed crimsoned above the water glimmered the monsterhaunted rock itself and midchannel beyond flat and black to the stream stretched the nuns isle in cloistral peace halt cried the monk and signalled with a peculiar whistle to which he seemed breathlessly awaiting an answer they were immediately surrounded by longrobed veiled figures not too late the monk hoarsely asked of them yet an hour was the reply in soft clear tones of a womans voice great strength and valour more than human be mine exclaimed the monk dismounting he passed apart from them and they drew in a circle while he prayed kneeling presently he returned and led farina to a bank drawing from some hidingplace a book and a bell which he gave into the hands of the youth for thy soul no word said the monk speaking down his throat as he took in breath nay not in answer to me be faithful and more than earthly fortune is thine for i say unto thee i shall not fail having grace to sustain this combat thereupon he commenced the ascent of drachenfels farina followed he had no hint of the monks mission nor of the part himself was to play in it such a load of silence gathered on his questioning spirit that the outcry of the rageing elements alone prevented him from arresting the monk and demanding the end of his service there that outcry was enough to freeze speech on the very lips of a mortal for scarce had they got footing on the winding path of the crags when the whole vengeance of the storm was hurled against the mountain huge boulders were loosened and came bowling from above trees torn by their roots from the fissures whizzed on the eddies of the wind torrents of rain foamed down the iron flanks of rock and flew off in hoar feathers against the short pauses of darkness the mountain heaved and quaked and yawned a succession of hideous chasms theres a devil in this thought farina he looked back and marked the river imaging lurid abysses of cloud above the mountainsummityea and on the summit a flaming shape was mirrored two nervous hands stayed the cry on his mouth have i not warned thee said the husky voice of the monk i may well watch and think for thee as for a dog be thou as faithful he handed a flask to the youth and bade him drink farina drank and felt richly invigorated the monk then took bell and book but half an hour he muttered for this combat that is to ring through centuries crossing himself he strode wildly upward farina saw him beckon back once and the next instant he was lost round an incline of the highest peak the wind that had just screamed a thousand deathscreams was now awfully dumb albeit farina could feel it lifting hood and hair in the unnatural stillness his ear received tones of a hymn chanted below now sinking now swelling as though the voices faltered between prayer and inspiration farina caught on a projection of crag and fixed his eyes on what was passing on the height there was the monk in his brown hood and wrapper confrontingif he might trust his balls of sightthe redhot figure of the prince of darkness as yet no mortal tussle had taken place between them they were arguing angrily it was true yet with the first mutual deference of practised logicians latin and german was alternately employed by both it thrilled farinas fervid love of fatherland to hear the german satan spoke but his latin was good and his command over that tongue remarkable for getting the worst of the argument as usual he revenged himself by parodying one of the church canticles with a point that discomposed his adversary and caused him to retreat a step claiming support against such shrewd assault the use of an unexpected weapon in warfare is in itself half a victory induce your antagonist to employ it as a match for you and reckon on completely routing him says the old military chronicle come said the demon with easy raillery you know your gamei mine i really want the good people to be happy dancing kissing propagating what you will we quite agree you can have no objection to me but a foolish old prejudicenot personal but class an antipathy of the cowl for which i pardon you what i should find in you to complain ofi have only to mention it i am sureis that perhaps you do speak a little too much through your nose the monk did not fall into the jocular trap by retorting in the same strain laugh with the devil and you wont laugh longest says the proverb keeping to his own arms the holy man frowned avaunt fiend he cried to thy kingdom below thou halt raged over earth a month causing blights hurricanes and epidemics of the deadly sins parley no more begone the demon smiled the corners of his mouth ran up to his ears and his eyes slid down almost into one still through the nose said he reproachfully i give thee five minutes cried the monk i had hoped for a longer colloquy sighed the demon jogging his left leg and trifling with his tail one minute exclaimed the monk truly so said the demon i know old time and his habits better than you really can we meet every saturday night and communicate our best jokes i keep a book of them down there and as if he had reason to remember the pavement of his halls he stood tiptoe and whipped up his legs two minutes the demon waved perfect acquiescence and continued we understand each other he and i all old ones do as long as he lasts i shall the thing that surprises me is that you and i cannot agree similar as we are in temperament and playing for the long odds both of us my failure is perhaps too great a passion for sport aha well tis a pity you wont try and live on the benevolent principle i am indeed kind to them who commiserate my condition i give them all they want aha hem try and not believe in me now aha ho cant you what are eyes persuade yourself youre dreaming you can do anything with a mind like yours father gregory and consider the luxury of getting me out of the way so easily as many do it is my finest suggestion aha generally i myself nudge their ribs with the capital ideayoure above

fog and owe me a trifle patronage they call it i hook the high and the low toolittle and toomuch serve me better than beelzebub a weak stomach is certainly more carnally virtuous than a full one

that makes them forget my smell which is i confess abominable displeasing to myself and my worst curse your sort father gregory are somewhat unpleasant in that particularif i may judge by their legate here well try small talk they would fall desperately in love with polecats and skunks if endowed with small talk why they have become enamoured of monks before now if skunks why not monks and again five having solemnly bellowed this tremendous number the holy man lifted his arms to begin the combat farina felt his nerves prick with admiration of the ghostly warrior daring the second power of creation on that lonely mountaintop he expected and shuddered at thought of the most awful fight ever yet chronicled of those that have taken place between heroes and the hounds of evil but his astonishment was great to hear the demon while bell was in air and book aloft retreat shouting hold i surrender said he sullenly what terms instantaneous riddance of thee from face of earth goodnow said the demon did you suppose i was to be trapped into a fight no doubt you wish to become a saint and have everybody talking of my last defeat pictures poems processions with the devil downmost no youre more than a match for me silence darkness thundered the monk and think not to vanquish thy victor by flatteries begone and again he towered in his wrath the demon drew his tail between his legs and threw the forked fleshy quivering end over his shoulder he then nodded cheerfully pointed his feet and finicked a few steps away saying i hope we shall meet again upon that he shot out his wings that were like the fins of the wyverfish sharpened in venomous points commands for your people below he inquired leering with chin awry desperate ruffians some of those cowls you are right not to acknowledge them farina beheld the holy man in no mood to let the enemy tamper with him longer the demon was influenced by a like reflection for saying cologne is the city your holiness inhabits i think he shot up rocketlike over rhineland striking the entire length of the stream and its roughbearded castlecrests slateledges brambleclefts vineslopes and haunted valleys with one brimstone flash frankfort and the far main saw him and reddened ancient trier and mosel heidelberg and neckar limberg and lahn ran guilty of him and the swift artery of these shining veins rhine from his snow cradle to his salt decease glimmered stygian horrors as the infernal comet sprung over bonn sparkled a fiery minute along the face of the stream and vanished leaving a seam of ragged flame trailed on the midnight heavens farina breathed hard through his teeth the last of him was awful said he coming forward to where the monk knelt and grasped his breviary but he was vanquished easily easily exclaimed the holy man gasping satisfaction thou weakling is it for thee to measure difficulties or estimate powers easily thou worldling and so are great deeds judged when the dangers past and what am i but the humble instrument that brought about this wondrous conquest the poor tool of this astounding triumph shall the sword say this is the battle i won yonder the enemy i overthrow bow to me ye lords of earth and worshippers of mighty acts not so nay but the sword is honoured in the heros grasp and if it break not it is accounted trusty this then this little i may claim that i was trusty trusty in a heroic encounter trusty in a battle with earths terror oh but this must not be said this is to think too much this is to be more than aught yet achieved by man the holy warrior crossed his arms and gently bowed his head take me to the sisters he said the spirit has gone out of me i am faint and as a child farina asked and had his blessing and with it my thanks said the monk thou hast witnessed how he can be overcome thou hast looked upon a scene that will be the glory of christendom thou hast beheld the discomfiture of darkness before the voice of light yet think not much of me account me little in this matter i am but an instrument but an instrumentand again but an instrument farina drew the arms of the holy combatant across his shoulders and descended drachenfels the tempest was as a forgotten anguish bright with maiden splendour shone the moon and the old rocks cherished in her beams put up their horns to blue heaven once more all the leafage of the land shook as to shake off a wicked dream and shuddered from time to time whispering of old fears quieted and present peace the heart of the river fondled with the image of the moon in its depths this is much to have won for earth murmured the monk and what is life or who would not risk all to snatch such loveliness from the talons of the fiend the archfoe yet not i not i say not twas i did this soft praises of melody ascended to them on the moist fragrance of air it was the hymn of the sisters how sweet murmured the monk put it from me away with it rising on farinas back and stirruping his feet on the thighs of the youth he cried aloud i charge ye whoso ye be sing not this deed before the emperor by the breath of your nostrils pause ere ye whisper aught of the combat of saint gregory with satan and his victory and the marvel of it while he liveth for he would die the humble monk he is he resumed his seat and farina brought him into the circle of the sisters those pure women took him and smoothed him lamenting and filling the night with triumphing tones farina stood apart the breeze tells of dawn said the monk we must be in cologne before broad day they mounted horse and the sisters grouped and reverenced under the blessings of the monk no word of it said the monk warningly we are silent father they answered cologneward was then his cry and away he and farina flew the goshawk leads morning was among the grey eastern clouds as they rode upon the camp hastily formed to meet the kaiser all there was in a wallow of confusion fierce struggles for precedence still went on in the neighbourhood of the imperial tent ground where under the standard of germany lounged some veterans of the kaisers guard calmly watching the scramble up to the edge of the cultivated land nothing was to be seen but brawling clumps of warriors asserting the superior claims of their respective lords variously and hotly disputed were these claims as many red coxcombs testified across that point where the green field flourished not a foot was set for the kaisers care of the farmer and affection for good harvests made itself respected even in the heat of those jealous rivalries it was said of him that he would have camped in a bog or taken quarters in a cathedral rather than trample down a green blade of wheat or turn over one vinepole in the empire hence the presence of kaiser heinrich was never hailed as egypts plague by the peasantry but welcome as the may month wherever he went father gregory and farina found themselves in the centre of a group ere they drew rein and a cry rose the good father shall decide and alls fair followed by agreed hail and tempest hes dropped down o purpose father said one here it is i say i saw the devil himself fly off drachenfels and flop into cologne fritz here and frankenbauch saw him too theyll swear to him so ll i hells thunder will we yonder fellows will have it twas a flash o lightning as if i didnt see him horns tail and claws and a mighty sight twas as im a sinner a clash of voices for the devil and against him burst on this accurate description of the evil spirit the monk sank his neck into his chest gladly would i hold silence on this my sons said he in a supplicating voice speak father cried the first spokesman gathering courage from the looks of the monk father gregory appeared to commune with himself deeply at last lifting his head and murmuring it must be he said aloud twas verily satan o my sons him this night in mortal combat i encountered and overcame on the summit of drachenfels before the eyes of this youth and from satan i this night deliver ye an instrument herein as in all other shouts and a farspreading buzz resounded in the camp hundreds had now seen satan flying off the drachenstein father gregory could no longer hope to escape from the importunate crowds that beset him for particulars the muchcontested point now was as to the exact position of satans tail during his airy circuit before descending into cologne it lashed like a lions twas cocked for certain he sneaked it between his legs like a lurcher he made it stumpy as a brown bears he carried it upright as a pike o my sons have i sown dissension have i not given ye peace exclaimed the monk but they continued to discuss it with increasing frenzy farina cast a glance over the tumult and beheld his friend guy beckoning earnestly he had no difficulty in getting away to him as the fetters of all eyes were on the monk alone the goshawk was stamping with excitement not a moment to be lost my lad said guy catching his arm here ive had halfadozen fights already for this bit of ground do you know that fellow squatting there farina beheld the thier at the entrance of a tumbledown tent he was ruefully rubbing a broken head now continued guy to mount him is the thing and then after the wolves of werner as fast as horseflesh can carry us no questions bound are you and what am i but this is life and death lad hark the goshawk whispered something that sucked the blood out of farinas cheek look youwhats your lockjaw name keep good faith with me and you shall have your revenge and the shiners i promise besides my lords interest for a better master but sharp we wont mount till were out of sight o the hellscum you horde with the thier stood up and staggered after them through the camp there was no difficulty in mounting him horses were loose and scampering about the country not yet delivered from their terrors of the last nights tempest here be we three good men exclaimed guy when they were started and farina had hurriedly given him the heads of his adventure with the monk three good men one has helped to kick the devil one has served an apprenticeship to his limb and one is ready to meet him foot to foot any day which last should be myself not a man more do we want though it were to fish up that treasure you talk of being under the rhine there and guarded by i dont know how many tricksy little villains horses can be ferried across at linz you say ay thereabout grunted the thier we re on the right road then said guy thanks to you both ive had no sleep for two nightsnot a wink and must snatch it goingnot the first time the goshawk bent his body and spoke no more farina could not get a word further from him by the mastery he still had over his rein the goshawk alone proved that he was of the world of the living schwartz thier rendered either sullen or stunned by the latest cracked crown he had received held his jaws close as if they had been nailed at linz the horses were well breathed the goshawk who had been snoring an instant before examined them keenly and shook his calculating head punch that beast of yours in the ribs said he to farina ah not a yard of wind in him and theres the coming back when we shall have more to carry well this is my lords money but i faith its going in a good cause and master groschen will make it all right no doubt not a doubt of it the goshawk had seen some excellent beasts in the stables of the kaisers krone but the landlord would make no exchange without an advance of silver this done the arrangement was prompt schwartz thierive got your name now said guy as they were ferrying across youre stiff certain they left cologne with the maiden yesternoon now ah did they and shes at the eck safe enow by this time and away from the eck this night she shall come trust me or there will i die with her cried farina fifteen men at most he has you said continued guy two not sound five true as steel and the rest shillyshally slife one lock loose serves us but two saves us five were a match for throwing in bluff baron the remainder go with victory can we trust this fellow whispered farina trust him roared guy why ive thumped him lad pegged and pardoned him trust him trust me if werner catches a sight of that snout of his within halfamile of his hold hell roast him alive he lowered his voice trust him we can do nothing without him i knocked the devil out of him early this morning no chance for his highness anywhere now this eck of werners would stand a siege from the kaiser in person i hear we must into it like weasels and out as we can dismissing the ferrybarge with stern injunctions to be in waiting from noon to noon the three leapt on their fresh nags stop at the first village said guy we must lay in provision as master groschen says nothings to be done turpin without provender goshawk cried farina you have time tell me how this business was done the only reply was a soft but decided snore that spoke like a voluptuous trumpet of dreamland and its visions at sinzig the thier laid his hand on guys bridle with the words feed here a brief but effective form of signal which aroused the goshawk completely the sign of the trauben received them here wurst reeking with garlic eggs black bread and sour wine was all they could procure farina refused to eat and maintained his resolution in spite of guys sarcastic chiding rub down the beasts then and water them said the latter made a vow i suppose muttered guy thats the way of those fellows no upright manly takethethingasitcomes but flyskyhigh whenever theres a dash on their heaven what has his belly done to offend him it will be crying out just when we want all quiet i wouldnt pay werner such a compliment as go without a breakfast for him not i would you schwartz thier henker not i growled the thier hell lose one sooner first snatch his prey or hell be making god save us a meal for a kaiser the brute guy called in the landlady clapped down the score and abused the wine sir said the landlady ours is but a poor inn and we do our best so you do replied the goshawk softened and i say that a civil tongue and rosy smiles sweeten even sour wine the landlady a summer widow blushed and as he was stepping from the room called him aside i thought you were one of that dreadful werners band and i hate him guy undeceived her he took my sister she went on and his cruelty killed her he persecuted me even in the lifetime of my good man last night he came here in the middle of the storm with a young creature bright as an angel and sorrowful hes gone youre sure broke in guy gone oh yes soon as the storm abated he dragged her on oh the way that young thing looked at me and i able to do nothing for her now the lord bless you for a rosy christian cried guy and in his admiration he flung his arm round her and sealed a ringing kiss on each cheek no good man defrauded by that and let me see the fellow that thinks evil of it if i ever told a woman a secret i d tell you one now trust me but i never do so farewell not another hasty times keep the feelings in a ferment and the landlady was extremely angry with guy and heartily forgave him all within a minute no more said she laughing but wait i have something for you the goshawk lingered on a fretting heel she was quickly under his elbow again with two flasks leaning from her bosom to her arms there i seldom meet a man like you and when i do i like to be remembered this is a true good wine real liebfrauenmilch which i only give to choice customers welcome it is sang guy to her arch looks but i must pay for it not a pfennig said the landlady not one not one she repeated with a stamp of the foot in other coin then quoth guy and folding her waist which did not this time back away the favoured goshawk registered rosy payment on a very fresh red mouth receiving in return such lively discount that he felt himself bound in conscience to make up the full sum a second time what a man sighed the landlady as she watched the goshawk lead off along the banks courtly as a knight open as a squire and gentle as a page werners eck a league behind andernach and more in the wintry circle of the sun than laach its convenient monastic neighbour stood the castle of werner the robber baron far into the south hazy with afternoon light a yellow succession of sandhills stretched away spouting fire against the blue sky of an elder world but now dead and barren of herbage around is a dusty plain where the green blades of spring no sooner peep than they become grimed with sand and take an aged look in accordance with the ungenerous harvests they promise the aridity of the prospect is relieved on one side by the lofty woods of laach through which the sun setting burns goldenred and on the other by the silver sparkle of a narrow winding stream bordered with poplars and seen but a glistening mile of its length by all the thirsty hills the eck or corner itself is thickset with wood but of a stunted growth and lying like a dark patch on the landscape it served however entirely to conceal the castle and mask every movement of the wary and terrible master a trained eye advancing on the copse would hardly mark the glimmer of the turrets over the topmost leaves but to every loophole of the walls lies bare the circuit of the land werner could rule with a glance the rhines course down from the broad rock over coblentz to the white tower of andernach he claimed that march as his right but the mosel was no hard rides distance and he gratified his thirst for rapine chiefly on that river delighting in it consequently as much as his robber nature boiled over the bound of his feudal privileges often had the baron held his own against sieges and restrictions bans and impositions of all kinds he boasted that there was never a knight within twenty miles of him that he had not beaten nor monk of the same limit not in his pay this braggadocio received some warrant from his yearly increase of licence and his craft and his castle combined made him a notable pest of the region a scandal to the abbey whose countenance he had and a frightful infliction on the poorer farmers and peasantry the sun was beginning to slope over laach and threw the shadows of the abbey towers halfway across the blue lakewaters as two men in the garb of husbandmen emerged from the wood their feet plunged heavily and their heads hung down as they strode beside a wain mounted with straw whistling an air of stupid unconcern but a close listener might have heard that the lumbering vehicle carried a human voice giving them directions as to the road they were to take and what sort of behaviour to observe under certain events the land was solitary a boor passing asked whether toll or tribute they were conveying to werner tribute they were advised to reply which caused him to shrug and curse as he jogged on hearing him the voice in the wain chuckled grimly their next speech was with a trooper who overtook them and wanted to know what they had in the wain for werner tribute they replied and won the title of brave pigs for their trouble but whats the dish made of said the trooper stirring the straw with his swordpoint tribute came the answer ha youve not been to werners school and the trooper swung a swordstroke at the taller of the two sending a tremendous shudder throughout his frame but he held his head to the ground and only seemed to betray animal consciousness in leaning his ear closer to the wain blood and storm will ye speak cried the trooper never talk much but an ye say nothing to the baronthrusting his hand into the strawheres whats better than speaking well saideh liebfrauenmilch ho ho a rare bleed striking the neck of the flask on a wheel the trooper applied it to his mouth and ceased not deeply ingurgitating till his face was broad to the sky and the bottle reversed he then dashed it down sighed and shook himself rare news the kaisers come hell be in cologne by night but first he must see the baron and im post with the order thats to show you how high he stands in the kaisers grace dont be thinking of upsetting werner yet any of you mind now thats blassgesell said the voice in the wain as the trooper trotted on adding gainst us makes six responded the driver within sight of the eck they descried another trooper coming toward them this time the driver was first to speak tribute provender bread and wine for the high baron werner from his vassals over tonnistein and im out of it fasting like a winter wolf howled the fellow he was in the act of addressing himself to an inspection of the wains contents when a second flask lifted in air gave a sop to his curiosity this flask suffered the fate of the former a swabian blockhead arent you ay that country said the driver may be henker rothhals happens to be with the baron to hell with him i wish he had my job and i his of watching the yellowbird in her new cage till shes taken out tonight and then a jolly bumper to the baron all round the driver wished him a fortunate journey strongly recommending him to skirt the abbey westward and go by the ahr valley as there was something stirring that way and mumbling makes five again as he put the wheels in motion goshawk said his visible companion what do you say now i say bless that widow oh bring me face to face with this accursed werner quickly my god gasped the youth tusk tis not werner we wanttheres the thier speaking no no schwartz thier i trust you no doubt but the badger smells at a hole before he goes inside it were strangers and are allowed to miss our way leaving the wain in farinas charge he pushed through a dense growth of shrub and underwood and came crouching on a precipitous edge of shrouded crag which commanded a view of the stronghold extending round it as if scooped clean by some natural action about a stonesthrow distant and nearly level with the lookout tower sheer from a deep circular basin clothed with wood and bottomed with grass and bubbling water rose a naked mossstained rock on whose peak the castle firmly perched like a spying hawk the only means of access was by a narrow natural bridge of rock flung from this insulated pinnacle across to the mainland one man well disposed might have held it against forty our ways the best thought guy as he meditated every mode of gaining admission a hundred men an hour might be lost cutting steps up that steep slate and once at the top we should only have to be shoved down again while thus engaged he heard a summons sounded from the castle and scrambled back to farina the thier leads now said he and who leads is captain it seems easier to get out of that than in theres a square tower and a round i guess the maiden to be in the round now lad no crying outyou dont come in with us but back you go for the horses and have them ready and fresh in yon watered meadow under the castle the path down winds easy man cried farina what do you take me forgo you for the horses not for a fool guy rejoined tightening his lip but now is your time to prove yourself one with you or without you i enter that castle oh if you want to be served up hot for the barons suppermess by all means thunder growled schwartz thier arent ye moving the goshawk beckoned farina aside act as i tell you or im for cologne traitor muttered the youth swearing this that if we fail the baron shall need a leech sooner than a bride that stroke must be mine the goshawk griped the muscle of farinas arm till the youth was compelled to slacken it with pain could you drive a knife through a sixinch woodwall i doubt this wild boar wants a harder hit than many a best man could give sblood obey sirrah how shall we keep yon fellow true if he sees were at points i yield exclaimed farina with a fall of the chest but hear i nothing of you by midnightoh then think not i shall leave another minute to chance farewell haste heaven prosper you you will see her and die under her eyes that may be denied to me what have i done to be refused that last boon gone without breakfast and dinner said guy in abhorrent tones a whistle from the wain following a noise of the castlegates being flung open called the goshawk away and he slouched his shoulders and strode to do his part without another word farina gazed after him and dropped into the covert the waterlady bird of lovers voice of the passion of love sweet deep disastertoning nightingale sings the old minnesinger who that has not loved hearing thee is touched with the wand of loves mysteries and yearneth to he knoweth not whom humbled by overfulness of heart but who listening already loveth heareth the language he would speak yet faileth in feeleth the great tongueless sea of his infinite desires stirred beyond his narrow bosom is as one stript of wings whom the angels beckon to their silver homes and he leaneth forward to ascend to them and is mocked by his effort then is he of the fallen and of the fallen would he remain but that tears lighten him and through the tears stream jewelled shafts dropt down to him from the sky precious ladders inlaid with amethyst sapphire blended jasper beryl roseruby ether of heaven flushed with softened bloom of the insufferable presences and lo the ladders dance and quiver and waylay his eyelids and a second time he is mocked aspiring and after the third swoon standeth hope before him with folded arms and eyes dry of the delusions of tears saying thou hast seen thou hast felt thy strength hath reached in thee so far now shall i never die in thee for surely says the minstrel hope is not born of earth or it were perishable rather know her the offspring of that embrace strong love straineth the heavens with this owe we to thy music bridal nightingale and the difference of this celestial spirit from the smirking phantasy of whom all stand soon or late forsaken is the difference between painted day with its poor ambitious snares and night lifting its myriad tapers round the throne of the eternal the prophet stars of everlasting time and the one dieth and the other liveth and the one is unregretted and the other walketh in thoughtspun raiment of divine melancholy her ears crowded with the pale surges that wrap this shifting shore in her eyes a shape of beauty floating dimly that she will not attain this side the water but broodeth on evermore therefore hold on thy cherished four long notes which are as the very edge where exultation and anguish melt meet and are sharpened to one ecstasy deathdividing bird fill the woods with passionate chuckle and sob sweet chaplain of the marriage service of a soul with heaven pour out thy holy wine of song upon the softfooted darkness till like a priest of the inmost temple tis drunken with fair intelligences thus the old minstrels and minnesingers strong and full sang the nightingales that night farina held watch by the guilty castle that entombed his living beloved the castle looked itself a denser shade among the moonthrown shadows of rock and tree the meadow spread like a green courtyard at the castles foot it was of lush deep emerald grass softly mixed with grey in the moons light and showing like jasper where the shadows fell thickest there was yet a mist of colour all about ran a brook and babbled to itself the spring crocus lifted its head in moist midgrasses of the meadow rejoiced with freshness the rugged heights seemed to clasp this one innocent spot as their only gardentreasure and a bank of hazels hid it from the castle with a lovers arm the moon will tell me mused farina the moon will signal me the hour when the moon hangs over the round tower i shall know tis time to strike the song of the nightingales was a full unceasing throb it went like the outcry of one heart from branch to branch the four long notes and the short fifth which leads off to that hurried gush of music gurgling rich with passion came thick and constant from under the tremulous leaves at first farina had been deaf to them his heart was in the dungeon with margarita or with the goshawk in his dangers forming a thousand desperate plans among the redhot ploughshares of desperate action finally without a sense of being wooed it was won the tenderness of his love then mastered him god will not suffer that fair head to come to harm he thought and with the thought a load fell off his breast he paced the meadows and patted the three pasturing steeds involuntarily his sight grew on the moon she went so slowly she seemed not to move at all a little wing of vapour flew toward her it whitened passed and the moon was slower than before oh were the heavens delaying their march to look on this iniquity again and again he cried patience it is not time he flung himself on the grass the next moment he climbed the heights and was peering at the mass of gloom that fronted the sky it reared such a mailed head of menace that his heart was seized with a quivering as though it had been struck behind lay scattered some small faintwinkling stars on sapphire fields and a stain of yellow light was in a breach of one wall he descended what was the goshawk doing was he betrayed it was surely now time no the moon had not yet smitten the face of the castle he made his way through the hazelbank among flitting nightmoths and glanced up to measure the moons distance as he did so a first touch of silver fell on the hoary flint oh young bird of heaven in that devils clutch sounds like the baying of boarhounds alarmed him they whined into silence he fell back the meadow breathed peace and more and more the nightingales volumed their notes as in a charmed circle of palpitating song he succumbed to languor the brook rolled beside him fresh as an infant toying with the moonlight he leaned over it and thrice waywardly dipped his hand in the clear translucence was it his own face imaged there farina bent close above an eddy of the water it whirled with a strange tumult breaking into lines and lights a face not his own nor the moons nor was it a reflection the agitation increased now a wreath of bubbles crowned the pool and a pure waterlily but larger ascended wavering he started aside and under him a bright head garlanded with gemmed roses appeared no fairer figure of woman had farina seen her visage had the lustrous white of moonlight and all her shape undulated in a dress of flashing silverwhite wonderful to see the lady of the water smiled on him and ran over with ripples and dimples of limpid beauty then as he retreated on the meadow grass she swam toward him and taking his hand pressed it to her after her touch the youth no longer feared she curved her finger and beckoned him on all that she did was done flowingly the youth was a shadow in her silver track as she passed like a harmless wave over the closed crocuses but the crocuses shivered and swelled their throats of streaked purple and argent as at delicious rare sips of a wine breath of violet and ladysmock and valleylily mingled and fluttered about her farina was as a man working the days intent in a dream he could see the heart in her translucent hanging like a cold dingy ruby by the purity of his nature he felt that such a presence must have come but to help it might be margaritas guardian fairy they passed the hazelbank and rounded the castlecrag washed by the brook and beneath the advancing moon standing in a ring of brawling silver the youth with his fervid eyes marked the old weatherstains and scars of long defiance coming into colour that mystery of wickedness which the towers had worn in the dusk was dissolved and he endured no more the almost abashed sensation of competing littleness that made him think there was nought to do save die combating singlehanded such massive power the moon shone calmly superior like the prowess of maiden knights and now the harsh frown of the walls struck resolution to his spirit and nerved him with hate and the contempt true courage feels when matched against fraud and villany on a fallen block of slate cushioned with rich brown moss and rusted weatherstains the waterlady sat and pointed to farina the path of the moon toward the round tower she did not speak and if his lips parted put her cold finger across them then she began to hum a soft sweet monotony of song vague and careless very witching to hear farina caught no words nor whether the song was of days in dust or in flower but his mind bloomed with legends and sad splendours of story while she sang on the slateblock under sprinkled shadows by the water he had listened long in trance when the waterlady hushed and stretched forth a slender forefinger to the moon it stood like a dot over the round tower farina rose in haste she did not leave him to ask her aid but took his hand and led him up the steep ascent halfway to the castle she rested there concealed by brambletufts she disclosed the low portal of a secret passage and pushed it open without effort she paused at the entrance and he could see her trembling seeming to wax taller till she was like a fountain glittering in the cold light then she dropped as drops a dying bet and cowered into the passage darkness thick with earthdews oppressed his senses he felt the clammy walls scraping close on him not the dimmest lamp or guiding sound was near but the lady went on as one who knew her way passing a lowvaulted dungeonroom they wound up stairs hewn in the rock and came to a door obedient to her touch which displayed a chamber faintly misted by a solitary bar of moonlight farina perceived they were above the foundation of the castle the walls gleamed pale with knightly harness habergeons gaping for heads breastplates of blue steel halbert and handaxe greaves glaives boarspears and polished spurfixed heelpieces he seized a falchion hanging apart but the lady stayed his arm and led to another flight of stone ending in a kind of corridor noises of laughter and high feasting beset him at this point the lady of the water sidled her head as to note a familiar voice and then drew him to a looped aperture farina beheld a scene that first dazzled but as it grew into shape sank him with dismay below and level with the chamber he had left a rude banquetinghall glowed under the light of a dozen flambeaux with smoking boars flesh deers flesh stoneflagons and hornbeakers at the head of this board sat werner scarlet with furious feasting and on his right hand margarita bloodless as a beautiful martyr bound to the fire retainers of werner occupied the length of the hall chorusing the barons speeches and drinking their own healths when there was no call for another farina saw his beloved alone she was dressed as when he parted with her last the dear cameo lay on her bosom but not heaving proudly as of old her shoulders were drooped forward and contracted her bosom in its heaving she would have had a humbled look but for the marble sternness of her eyes they were fixed as eyes that see the way of death through all earthly objects now dogs cried the baron the health of the night and swell your lungs for ill have no cats cry when werners bride is the toast monk or no monks leave shes mine ay my pretty one it shall be made right in the morning if i lead all the laach rats here by the nose thunder no disrespect to werners bride from pope or abbot now sing outor wait these fellows shall drink it first he stretched and threw a beaker of wine right and left behind him and farinas despair stiffened his limbs as he recognized the goshawk and schwartz thier strapped to the floor their beards were already moist with previous libations similarly bestowed and they received this in sullen stillness but farina thought he observed a rapid glance of encouragement dart from beneath the goshawks bent brows as margarita momentarily turned her head halfway on him lick your chaps ye beasts and dont say werner stints vermin good cheer his nuptialnight now continued the baron growing huskier as he talked louder short and ringing my devils pupswerner and his bride and may she soon give you a young baron to keep you in better order than i can as if she does her duty she will the baron stood up and lifted his huge arm to lead the toast werner and his bride not a voice followed him there was a sudden intimation of the call being echoed but it snapped and ended in shuffling tones as if the halldoor had closed on the response what s this roared the baron in that caged wild beast voice margarita remembered she had heard in the cathedral square no one replied speak or ill rot you a fathom in the rock curs herr baron said henker rothhals impressively the matter is that theres something unholy among us the barons goblet flew at his head before the words were uttered ill make an unholy thing of him that says it and werner lowered at them one by one then i say it herr baron pursued henker rothhals wiping his frontispiece the devil has turned against you at last look up thereah its gone now but wheres the man sitting this side saw it not the baron made one spring and stood on the board now will any rascal here please to say so something in the cruel hang of his threatening hatchet jaw silenced many in the act of confirming the assertion stand out henker rotthals rotthals slid a huntingknife up his wrist and stepped back from the board beast roared the baron i said i wouldnt shed blood tonight i spared a traitor and an enemy look again said rothhals will any fellow say he saw nothing there while all heads including werners were directed to the aperture which surveyed them rothhals tossed his knife to the goshawk unperceived this time answers came to his challenge but not in confirmation the baron spoke with a gasping gentleness so you trifle with me im dangerous for that game mind you of blassgesell i made a better beast of him by sending him threequarters of the road to hell for trial bellowing take that he discharged a broad blade hitherto concealed in his right hand straight at rothhals it fixed in his cheek and jaw wringing an awful breath of pain from him as he fell against the wall theres a lesson for you not to cross me children said werner striding his stumpy legs up and down the crashing board and puffing his monstrous girth of chest and midriff let him stop there awhile to show what comes of thwarting wernerfiredevils before the baroness toosomething unholy is there something unholy in his jaw i thinkleave it sticking hes against meat last is he ill teach you who hes forwho speaks all hung silent these men were animals dominated by a mightier brute he clasped his throat and shook the board with a jump as he squeaked rather than called a second time who spoke he had not again to ask in this pause as the baron glared for his victim a song so softly sung that it sounded remote but of which every syllable was clearly rounded swelled into his ears and froze him in his angry posture the blood of the barons shall turn to ice and their castle fall to wreck when a true lover dips in the water thrice that runs round werners eck round werners eck the water runs the hazels shiver and shake the walls that have blotted such happy suns are seized with the ruinquake and quake with the ruin and quake with rue thou last of werners race the hearts of the barons were cold that knew the waterdames embrace for a sin was done and a shame was wrought that water went to hide and those who thought to make it nought they did but spread it wide hold ready hold ready to pay the price and keep thy bridal cheer a hand has dipped in the water thrice and the waterdame is here the rescue the goshawk was on his feet now lass said he to margarita now is the time he took her hand and led her to the door schwartz thier closed up behind her not a man in the hall interposed werners head moved round after them like a dog on the watch but he was dumb the door opened and farina entered he bore a sheaf of weapons under his arm the familiar sight relieved werners senses from the charm he shouted to bar the prisoners passage his men were ranged like statues in the hall there was a start among them as if that terrible noise communicated an instinct of obedience but no more they glanced at each other and remained quiet the goshawk had his eye on werner stand back lass he said to margarita she took a sword from farina and answered with white lips and flashing eyes i can fight goshawk and shall if need be but leave it to me now returned guy his eye never left the baron suddenly a shriek of steel rang all fell aside and the combatants stood opposed on clear ground farina took margaritas left hand and placed her against the wall between the thier and himself werners men were well content to let their master fight it out the words spoken by henker rothhals that the devil had forsaken him seemed in their minds confirmed by the weird song which every one present could swear he heard with his ears let him take his chance and try his own luck they said and shrugged the battle was between guy as margaritas champion and werner in schwartz thiers judgement the two were well matched and he estimated their diverse qualities from sharp experience for short work the baron and my new mate for tough standing to t farinas summary in favour of the goshawk was a stouter heart harder sinews and a good cause the combat was generally regarded with a professional eye and few prayers margarita solely there asked aid from above and knelt to the virgin but her too the clash of arms and dire earnest of mortal fight aroused to eager eyes she had not dallied with heroes in her dreams she was as ready to second siegfried on the crimson field as tend him in the silken chamber it was well that a womans heart was there to mark the grace and glory of manhood in upright foottofoot encounter for the others it was a mere calculation of lucky hits even farina in his anxiety for her saw but the brightening and darkening of the prospect of escape in every attitude and hardringing blow margarita was possessed with a painful exaltation in her eyes the bestial baron now took a nobler form and countenance but the goshawk assumed the sovereign aspect of old heroes who whether persecuted or favoured of heaven still maintained their stand remembering of what stuff they were and who made them never say the old writers with a fervour honourable to their knowledge of the elements that compose our being never may this bright privilege of fair fight depart from us nor advantage of it fail to be taken man against man or beast singly keeping his ground is as fine rapture to the breast as beauty in her softest hour affordeth for if woman taketh loveliness to her when she languisheth so surely doth man in these fierce moods when steel and iron sparkle opposed and their breath is fire and their lips white with the lock of resolution all their faculties knotted to a point and their energies alive as the daylight to prove themselves superior according to the laws and under the blessing of chivalry for all they go on to improve the comparison may admire and delight in fair blossoming dales under the blue dome of peace but tis the rare lofty heart alone comprehendeth and is heightened by terrific splendours of tempest when cloud meets cloud in skies black as the sepulchre and glory sits like a flame on the helm of ruin for a while the combatants aired their dexterity contenting themselves with cunning cuts and flicks of the swordedge in which werner first drew blood by a keen sweep along the forehead of the goshawk guy had allowed him to keep his position on the board and still fought at his face and neck he now jerked back his body from the hip and swung a round stroke at werners knee sending him in retreat with a snort of pain before the baron could make good his ground guy was level with him on the board werner turned an upbraiding howl at his men they were not disposed to second him yet they one and all approved his personal battle with fate and never more admired him and felt his power but the affair was exciting and they were not the pillars to prop a falling house werner clenched his two hands to his ponderous glaive and fell upon guy with heavier fury he was becoming not unworth the little womanly appreciation margarita was brought to bestow on him the voice of the waterlady whispered at her heart that the baron warred on his destiny and that ennobles all living souls bareheaded the combatants engaged and the headpiece was the chief point of attack no swerving from blows was possible for either ward or take a false step would have ensured defeat this also induced caution many a double stamp of the foot was heard as each had to retire in turn not at his head so much hell bear battering there all night long said henker rothhals in a breathing interval knocks had been pretty equally exchanged but the barons head certainly looked the least vulnerable whereas guy exhibited several dints that streamed freely yet he looked eye and bearing as fresh as when they began and the calm regular heave of his chest contrasted with werners quick gasps his smile too renewed each time the baron paused for breath gave margarita heart it was not a taunting smile but one of entire confidence and told all the more on his adversary as werner led off again and the choice was always left him every expression of the goshawks face passed to full light in his broad eyes the barons play was a reckless fury there was nothing to study in it guy became the chief object of speculation he was evidently trying to wind his man he struck wildly some thought others judged that he was a random hitter and had no mortal point in aim schwartz thiers opinion was frequently vented too round a strokedown on him chopnot slice guy persevered in his own fashion according to schwartz thier he brought down by his wilfulness the blow that took him on the left shoulder and nigh broke him it was a weighty blow followed by a thump of sound the swordedge swerved on his shoulderblade or he must have been disabled but werners crow was short and he had no time to push success one of the goshawks swooping underhits half severed his right wrist and the blood spirted across the board he gasped and seemed to succumb but held to it still though with slackened force guy now attacked holding to his round strokes he accustomed werner to guard the body and stood to it so briskly right and left that werner grew bewildered lost his caution and gave ground suddenly the goshawks glaive flashed in air and chopped sheer down on werners head so shrewd a blow it was against a halfformed defence that the baron dropped without a word right on the edge of the board and there hung feebly grasping with his fingers who bars the way now sang out guy no one accepted the challenge success clothed him with terrors and gave him giant size then fare you well my merry men all said guy bear me no illwill for this a little doctoring will right the bold baron he strode jauntily to the verge of the board and held his finger for margarita to follow she stepped forward the men put their beards together muttering she could not advance farina doubled his elbow and presented swordpoint three of the ruffians now disputed the way with bare steel margarita looked at the goshawk he was smiling calmly curious as he leaned over his sword and gave her an encouraging nod she made another step in defiance one fellow stretched his hand to arrest her all her maidenly pride stood up at once what a glorious girl murmured the goshawk as he saw her face suddenly flash and she retreated a pace and swung a sharp cut across the knuckles of her assailant daring him or one of them with hard bright eyes beautifully vindictive to lay hand on a pure maiden you have it barenleib cried the others and then to margarita look young mistress we are poor fellows and ask a trifle of ransom and then part friends not an ace the goshawk pronounced from his post two to one remember the odds are ours replied the goshawk confidently they ranged themselves in front of the halldoor instead of accepting this challenge guy stepped to werner and laid his moaning foe lengthwise in an easier posture he then lifted margarita on the board and summoned them with cry of free passage they answered by a sullen shrug and taunt schwartz thier rothhals farina buckle up and make ready then sang guy he measured the length of his sword and raised it the goshawk had not underrated his enemies he was tempted to despise them when he marked their gradually lengthening chaps and eyeballs not one of them moved all gazed at him as if their marrows were freezing with horror whats this cried guy they knew as little as he but a force was behind them irresistible against their efforts the groaning oak slipped open pushing them forward and an apparition glided past soft as the pallid silver of the moon she slid to the baron and put her arms about him and sang to him had the waterlady laid an iron hand on all those ruffians she could not have held them faster bound than did the fear of her presence the goshawk drew his fair charge through them followed by farina the thier and rothhals a last glimpse of the hall showed them still as old cathedral sculpture staring at white light on a fluted pillar of the wall the passage of the rhine low among the swarthy sandhills behind the abbey of laach dropped the round red moon soft lengths of misty yellow stole through the glens of rhineland the nightingales still sang closer and closer the moon came into the hushed valleys there is a dell behind hammerstein castle a ring of basking sward girdled by a silver slatebrook and guarded by four highpeaked hills that slope down four long wooded corners to the grassy base here it is said the elves and earthmen play dancing in circles with laughing feet that fatten the mushroom they would have been fulfilling the tradition now but that the place was occupied by a sturdy group of mortals armed with staves the intruders were sleepy and lay about on the inclines now and then two got up and there rang hard echoes of oak again all were calm as cudchewing cattle and the white water ran pleased with quiet it may be that the elves brewed mischief among them for the oaken blows were becoming more frequent one complained of a kick another demanded satisfaction for a pinch go to drawled the accused drowsily in both cases too much beer last night within three minutes the company counted a pair of broken heads the east was winning on the west in heaven and the dusk was thinning they began to mark each whom he had cudgelled a noise of something swiftly in motion made them alert a roebuck rushed down one of the hills and scampered across the sward the fine beast went stretching so rapidly away as to be hardly distinct sathanas once more they murmured and drew together the name passed through them like a watchword not he this time cried the two newcomers emerging from the foliage hes safe under colognethe worse for all good men who live there but come follow to the rhine there s work for us on the yonder side and sharp work why answered several we ve our challenge with the lads of leutesdorf and wied today d ye see this said the foremost of the others pointing to a carved ivory white rose in his cap brothers he swelled his voice follow with a will for the white rose is in danger immediately they ranked and followed zealously through the buds of young bushes and over heaps of damp dead leaves a halfhours scramble when they defiled under hammerstein and stood before the rhine their leader led up the river and after a hasty walk stopped loosened his hood and stripped now said he strapping the bundle to his back let me know the hound that refuses to follow his leader when the white rose is in danger long live dietrich they shouted he dropped from the bank and waded in he was soon supported by the remainder of the striplings and all struck out boldly into midstream never heard history of a nobler passage of the rhine than this made between andernach and hammerstein by members of the white rose club bundle on back to relieve the white rose of germany from thrall and shame they were taken far down by the rapid current and arrived panting to land the dressing done they marched up the pass of tonnistein and took a deep draught at the spring of pleasant waters there open to wayfarers arrived at the skirts of laach they beheld two farmer peasants lashed back to back against a hazel they released them but could gain no word of information as the fellows after a yawn and a wink started off all heels to make sure of liberty on the shores of the lake the brotherhood descried a body of youths whom they hailed and were welcomed to companionship wheres berthold asked dietrich he was not present the more glory for us then dietrich said it was here seriously put to the captain whether they should not halt at the abbey and reflect seeing that great work was in prospect truly quoth dietrich dying on an empty stomach is heathenish and cold blood makes a green wound gape kaiser conrad should be hospitable and the monks honour numbers here be we thirty and nine let us go the west was dark blue with fallen light the lakewaters were growing grey with twilight the abbey stood muffled in shadows already the youths had commenced battering at the convent doors when they were summoned by the voice of the goshawk on horseback to their confusion they beheld the white rose herself on his right hand chapfallen dietrich bowed to his sweet mistress we were coming to the rescue he stammered a laugh broke from the goshawk you thought the lady was locked up in the ghostly larder eh dietrich seized his sword and tightened his belt the club allows no jesting with the white rose sir stranger margarita made peace i thank you all good friends but quarrel not i pray you with them that save me at the risk of their lives our service is equal said the goshawk flourishing only we happen to be beforehand with the club for which farina and myself heartily beg pardon of the entire brotherhood farina exclaimed dietrich then we make a prisoner instead of uncaging a captive what s this said guy so much responded dietrich yonders a runaway from two masters the law of cologne and the conqueror of satan and all good citizens are empowered to bring him back dead or alive dietrich dietrich dare you talk thus of the man who saved me cried margarita dietrich sullenly persisted then look said the white rose reddening under the pale dawn he shall not he shall not go with you one of the club was here on the point of speaking to the white rosea breach of the captains privilege dietrich felled him unresisting to earth and resumed it must be done beauty of cologne the monk father gregory is now enduring shame and scorn for lack of this truant witness enough i go said farina you leave me margarita looked tender reproach weariness and fierce excitement had given a liquid flame to her eyes and an endearing darkness round their circles that matched strangely with her plump youth her features had a soft white flush she was less radiant but never looked so bewitching an aspect of sweet human languor caught at the heart of love and raised tumults it is a duty said farina then go she beckoned and held her hand for him to kiss he raised it to his lips this was seen of all the club as they were departing with farina and guy prepared to demand admittance into the convent dietrich chanced to ask how fared dame lisbeth schwartz thier was by and answered with a laugh that he had quite forgotten the little lady we took her in mistake for you mistress she was a one to scream the moment she was kissedmum as a cloister we kissed her all of us for the fun of it no harmno harm we should have dropped her when we found we had the old bird stead of the young one but reckoned ransom ye see shes at the eck rattling is wager like last years nut in the shell lisbeth lisbeth poor lisbeth we will return to her instantly cried margarita not you said guy yes i no said guy gallant goshawk best of birds let me go without me or farina never i see i shall have no chance with my lord now come then come fair irresistible come lads farina can journey back alone you shall have the renown of rescuing dame lisbeth farina forget not to comfort my father said margarita between margaritas society and farinas there was little dispute in the captains mind which choice to make farina was allowed to travel single to cologne and dietrich petted by margarita and gently jeered by guy headed the club from laach waters to the castle of the robber baron the backblows of sathanas monk gregory was pacing the high road between the imperial camp and suffering cologne the sun had risen through interminable distances of cloud that held him remote in a succession of receding mounds and thinner veils realm beyond realm till he showed fireless like a phantom king in a phantom land the lark was in the breast of morning the fieldmouse ran along the furrows dews hung red and grey on the weedy banks and wayside trees at times the nostril of the good father was lifted and he beat his breast relapsing into sorrowful contemplation passedany citizen of cologne the ghostly head sunk into its cowl theres a black raven said many monk gregory heard them and murmured thou hast me evil one thou hast me it was noon when farina came clattering down from the camp father said he i have sought thee my son exclaimed monk gregory with silencing hand thou didst not well to leave me contending against the tongues of doubt answer me not the maiden and what weighed she in such a scaleno more i am punished well speaks the ancient proverb beware the backblows of sathanas i that thought to have vanquished him vanity has wrecked me in this world and the next i am the victim of selfincense i hear the demons shouting their chorushere comes monk gregory who called himself conqueror of darkness in the camp i am discredited and a scoff in the city i am spat upon abhorred satan my son fights not with his foreclaws tis with his tail he fights o farinalisten my son he entered to his kingdom below through cologne even under the stones of the cathedral square and the stench of him abominably remaineth challenging the nostrils of holy and unholy alike the kaiser cannot approach for him the citizens are outraged oh had i held my peace in humbleness i had truly conquered him but he gave me easy victory to inflate me i shall not last now this only is left my son that thou bear living testimony to the truth of my statement as i bear it to the folly farina promised in the face of all he would proclaim and witness to his victory on drachenfels that i may not be ranked an impostor continued the monk and how great must be the virtue of them that encounter that dark spirit valour availeth nought but if virtue be not in ye soon will ye be puffed to bursting with that devils poison selfincense surely my son thou art faithful and for this service i can reward thee follow me yet again on the road they met gottlieb groschen hastening to the camp dismay rumpled the old merchants honest jowl farina drew rein before him your daughter is safe worthy master groschen said he safe cried gottlieb where is she my grete farina briefly explained gottlieb spread out his arms and was going to thank the youth he saw father gregory and his whole frame narrowed with disgust are you in company with that pestilent animal that curse of cologne the good monk said farina you are leagued with him then sirrah expect no thanks from me cologne i say is cursed meddling wretches could ye not leave satan alone he hurt us not we were free of him cologne i say is cursed the enemy of mankind is brought by you to be the deadly foe of cologne so saying gottlieb departed seest thou my son quoth the monk they reason not farina was dejected willingly would he for his part have left the soul of evil a loose rover for the sake of some brighter horizon to his hope no twinge of remorse accompanied gottlieb the kaiser had allotted him an encampment and a guard of honour for his household while the foulness raged and there gottlieb welcomed back margarita and aunt lisbeth on the noon after his meeting with farina the white rose had rested at laach and was blooming again she and the goshawk came trotting in advance of the club through the woods of laach startling the deer with laughter and sending the hare with her ears laid back all across country in vain dietrich menaced guy with the terrors of the club aunt lisbeth begged of margarita not to leave her with the footmen in vain the joyous couple galloped over the country and sprang the ditches and leapt the dykes up and down the banks glad as morning hawks entering andernach at a round pace where they rested at a hostel as capable of producing good rhine and mosel wine then as now here they had middays meal laid out in the garden for the angry club and somewhat appeased them on their arrival with bumpers of the best scharzhofberger after a refreshing halt three boats were hired on their passage to the river they encountered a procession of monks headed by the archbishop of andernach bearing a small figure of christ carved in blackthorn and varnished said to work miracles and a present to the good town from two hungarian pilgrims are ye for cologne the monks inquired of them direct down stream they answered send then hither to us gregory the conqueror of darkness that he may know there is gratitude on earth and gratulation for great deeds said the monks so with genuflexions the travellers proceeded and entered the boats by the archbishops white tower hammerstein castle and rheineck they floated under salzig and the ahr confluence rolandseck and nonnenwerth drachenfels and bonn hills green with young vines dells waving fresh foliage margarita sang as they floated ancient ballads she sang that made the goshawk sigh for home and affected the club with delirious love for the grand old water that was speeding them onward aunt lisbeth was not to be moved she alone held down her head she looked not gottlieb in the face as he embraced her nor to any questioning would she vouchsafe reply from that time forth she was charity to woman and the exuberant cheerfulness and familiarity of the men toward her soon grew kindly and respectful the dragon in aunt lisbeth was destroyed she objected no more to margaritas cameo the goshawk quickly made peace with his lord and enjoyed the commendation of the kaiser dietrich schill thought of challenging him but the club had graver business and this was to pass sentence on berthold schmidt for the crime of betraying the white rose into the hands of werner they had found berthold at the eck and there consented to let him remain until ransom was paid for his traitorous body berthold in his mad passion was tricked by werner and on his release by payment of the ransom submitted to the judgement of the club which condemned him to fight them all in turn and then endure banishment from rhineland the goshawk for his sisters sake interceding before a harsher tribunal the entry into cologne seven days kaiser heinrich remained camped outside cologne six times in six successive days the kaiser attempted to enter the city and was foiled beard of barbarossa said the kaiser this is the first stronghold that ever resisted me the warrior bishops electors pfalzgrafs and knights of the empire all swore it was no shame not to be a match for the demon if said the reflective kaiser we are to suffer below what poor cologne is doomed to undergo now let us by all that is savoury reform and do penance the wind just then setting on them dead from cologne made the courtiers serious many thought of their souls for the first time this is recorded to the honour of monk gregory on the seventh morning the kaiser announced his determination to make a last trial it was dawn and a youth stood before the kaisers tent praying an audience conducted into the presence of the kaiser the youth they say succeeded in arousing him from his depression for brave as he was kaiser heinrich dreaded the issue forthwith order was given for the cavalcade to set out according to the rescript kaiser heinrich retaining the youth at his right hand but the youth had found occasion to visit gottlieb and margarita each of whom he furnished with a flash flask curiously shaped and charged with a distillation as the head of the procession reached the gates of cologne symptoms of wavering were manifest kaiser heinrich commanded an advance at all cost pfalzgraf nase as the old chronicles call him in their humour but assuredly a great noble led the van and pushed across the drawbridge hesitation and signs of horror were manifest in the assemblage round the kaisers person the kaiser and the youth at his right hand were cheery not a whit drooped they several of the heroic knights begged the kaisers permission to fall back follow pfalzgraf nase the kaiser is reported to have said great was the wonderment of the people of cologne to behold kaiser heinrich riding in perfect stateliness up the main street toward the cathedral while right and left of him bishops and electors were dropping incapable the kaiser advanced till by his side the youth rode sole thy name said the kaiser he answered a poor youth unconquerable kaiser farina i am called thy recompense said the kaiser he answered the hand of a maiden of cologne most gracious kaiser and master she is thine said the kaiser kaiser heinrich looked behind him and among a host grasping the pommels of their saddles and reeling vanquished were but two erect a maiden and an old man that is she unconquerable kaiser farina continued bowing low it shall be arranged on the spot said the kaiser a word from kaiser heinrich sealed gottliebs compliance said he gracious kaiser and master though such a youth could of himself never have aspired to the possession of a groschen yet when the kaiser pleads for him objection is as the rock of moses and streams consent truly he has done cologne good service and if margarita my daughter can be persuaded the kaiser addressed her with his blazing brows margarita blushed a ready autumn of rosyripe acquiescence a marriage registered yonder said the kaiser pointing upward i am thine murmured margarita as farina drew near her seal it seal it quoth the kaiser in hearty good humour take no consent from man or maid without a seal farina tossed the contents of a flask in air and saluted his beloved on the lips this scene took place near the charred round of earth where the foulest descended to his kingdom below men now pervaded cologne with flasks purifying the atmosphere it became possible to breathe freely we germans said kaiser heinrich when he was again surrounded by his courtiers may go wrong if we always follow pfalzgraf nase but this time we have been well led whereat there was obsequious laughter the pfalzgraf pleaded a susceptible nostril thou art i fear but a timid mortal said the kaiser never have i been found so on the german field imperial majesty returned the pfalzgraf i take glory to myself that this nether reek overcomes me even that we must combat you see exclaimed kaiser heinrich but come all to a marriage this night and take brides as soon as you will all of you increase and give us loyal subjects in plenty i count prosperity by the number of marriages in my empire the white rose club were invited by gottlieb to the wedding and took it in vast wrath until they saw the kaiser and such excellent stout german fare present when immediately a battle raged as to who should do the event most honour and was in dispute till dawn dietrich schill being the man he having consumed wurst the length of his arm and wine sufficient to have floated a st goar salmon which was long proudly chronicled in his family and is now unearthed from among the ancient honourable records of cologne the goshawk was farinas bridesman and a very spiriting bridesman was he aunt lisbeth sat in a corner faintly smiling child said the little lady to margarita when they kissed at parting your courage amazes me do you think do you know poor sweet bird delivered over hand and foot i love him i love him aunty thats all i know said margarita love love love him heaven help you ejaculated aunt lisbeth pray with me said margarita the two knelt at the foot of the bridebed and prayed very different prayers but to the same end that done aunt lisbeth helped undress the white rose and trembled and told a sad nuptial anecdote of the castle and put her little shrivelled hand on margaritas heart and shrieked child it gallops she cried tis happiness said margarita standing in her hair may it last only exclaimed aunt lisbeth it will aunty i am humble i am true and the fair girl gathered the frill of her nightgown look not in the glass said lisbeth not tonight look if you can tomorrow she smoothed the white rose in her bed tucked her up and kissed her leaving her as a bud that waits for sunshine conclusion the shadow of monk gregory was seen no more in cologne he entered the calendar and ranks next st anthony for three successive centuries the towns of rhineland boasted his visits in the flesh and the conqueror of darkness caused dire rhenish feuds the tailed infernal repeated his famous backblow on farina the youth awoke one morning and beheld warehouses the exact pattern of his own displaying flasks shaped even as his own and a farina to right and left of him in a week they were doubled a month quadrupled them they increased fame and fortune mused farina come from man and the world love is from heaven we may be worthy and lose the first we lose not love unless unworthy would ye know the true farina look for him who walks under the seal of bliss whose darling is for ever his young sweet bride leading him from snares priming his soul with celestial freshness there is no hypocrisy can ape that aspect least of all the creatures of the damned by this i may be known seven years after when the goshawk came into cologne to see old friends and drink some of gottliebs oldest rudesheimer he was waylaid by false farinas and only discovered the true one at last by chance in the musicgardens near the rhine where farina sat having on one hand margarita and at his feet three boys and one girl over whom both bent lovingly like the parent vine fondling its grape bunches in summer light etext editors bookmarks a generous enemy is a friend on the wrong side all are friends who sit at table be what you seem my little one bed was a rock of refuge and fortified defence civil tongue and rosy smiles sweeten even sour wine dangerous things are uttered after the third glass everywhere the badge of subjection is a poor stomach face betokening the perpetual smack of lemon gratitude never was a womans gift it was harder to be near and not close loving in this land they all go mad straight off never reckon on womankind for a wise

witness sweet treasure before which lies a dragon sleeping we like well whatso we have done good work for weak reeds who are easily vanquished and never overcome weak stomach is certainly more carnally virtuous than a full one wins everywhere back a reflection of its own kindliness the case of general ople and lady camper by george meredith chapter i an excursion beyond the immediate suburbs of london projected long before his ponycarriage was hired to conduct him in fact ever since his retirement from active service led general ople across a famous common with which he fell in love at once to a lofty highway along the borders of a park for which he promptly exchanged his heart and so gradually within a stonesthrow or so of the riverside where he determined not solely to bestow his affections but to settle for life it may be seen that he was of an adventurous temperament though he had thought fit to loosen his swordbelt the ponycarriage however had been hired for the very special purpose of helping him to pass in review the lines of what he called country houses cottages or even sites for building not too remote from sweet london and as when coelebs goes forth intending to pursue and obtain there is no doubt of his bringing home a wife the circumstance that there stood a house to let in an airy situation at a certain distance in hail of the metropolis he worshipped was enough to kindle the generals enthusiasm he would have taken the first he saw had it not been for his daughter who accompanied him and at the age of eighteen was about to undertake the management of his house fortune under elizabeth oples guiding restraint directed him to an epitome of the comforts the place he fell upon is only to be described in the tongue of auctioneers and for the first week after taking it he modestly followed them by terming it bijou in time when his own imagination instigated by a state of something more than mere contentment had been at work on it he chose the happy phrase a gentlemanly residence for it was he declared a small estate there was a lodge to it resembling two sentryboxes forced into union where in one half an old couple sat bent in the other half lay compressed there was a backdrive to discoverable stables there was a bit of grass that would have appeared a meadow if magnified and there was a wall round the kitchengarden and a strip of wood round the flowergarden the prying of the outside world was impossible comfort fortification and gentlemanliness made the place as the general said an ideal english home the compass of the estate was half an acre and perhaps a perch or two just the size for the hugging love general ople was happiest in giving he wisely decided to retain the old couple at the lodge whose members were used to restriction and also not to purchase a cow that would have wanted pasture with the old man while the old woman attended to the bell at the handsome front entrance with its giltspiked gates he undertook to do the gardening a business he delighted in so long as he could perform it in a gentlemanly manner that is to say so long as he was not overlooked he was perfectly concealed from the road only one house and curiously indeed only one window of the house and further to show the protection extended to douro lodge that window an attic overlooked him and the house was empty the house for who can hope and who should desire a commodious house with conservatories aviaries pond and boatshed and other joys of wealth to remain unoccupied was taken two seasons later by a lady of whom fame rolling like a dustcloud from the place she had left reported that she was eccentric the word is uninstructive it does not frighten in a lady of a certain age it is rather a characteristic of aristocracy in retirement and at least it implies wealth general ople was very anxious to see her he had the sentiment of humble respectfulness toward aristocracy and there was that in riches which aroused his admiration london for instance he was not afraid to say he thought the wonder of the world he remarked in addition that the sacking of london would suffice to make every common soldier of the foreign army of occupation an independent gentleman for the term of his natural days but this is a nightmare said he startling himself with an abhorrent dream of envy of those enriched invading officers for booty is the one lovely thing which the military mind can contemplate in the abstract his habit was to go off in an explosion of heavy sighs when he had delivered himself so far like a man at war with himself the lady arrived in time she received the cards of the neighbourhood and signalized her eccentricity by paying no attention to them excepting the card of a mrs baerens who had audience of her at once by express arrangement the card of general wilson ople as her nearest neighbour followed the card of the rector the social head of the district and the rector was granted an interview but lady camper was not at home to general ople she is of superior station to me and may not wish to associate with me the general modestly said nevertheless he was wounded for in spite of himself and without the slightest wish to obtrude his own person as he explained the meaning that he had in him his rank in the british army forced him to be the representative of it in the absence of any one of a superior rank so that he was professionally hurt and his heart being in his profession it may be honestly stated that he was wounded in his feelings though he said no and insisted on the distinction once a day his walk for constitutional exercise compelled him to pass before lady campers windows which were not bashfully withdrawn as he said humorously of douro lodge in the seclusion of halfpay but bowed out imperiously militarily like a generalissimo on horseback and had full command of the road and levels up to the swelling parkfoliage he went by at a smart stride with a delicate depression of his upright bearing as though hastening to greet a friend in view whose hand was getting ready for the shake this much would have been observed by a housemaid and considering his fine figure and the peculiar shining silveriness of his hair the acceleration of his gait was noticeable when he drove by the ponys right ear was flicked to the extreme indignation of a mettlesome little animal it ensued in consequence that the general was borne flying under the eyes of lady camper and such pace displeasing him he reduced it invariably at a step or two beyond the corner of her grounds but neither he nor his daughter elizabeth attached importance to so trivial a circumstance the general punctiliously avoided glancing at the windows during the passage past them whether in his wild career or on foot elizabeth took a sideshot as one looks at a wayside tree their speech concerning lady camper was an exchange of commonplaces over her loneliness and this condition of hers was the more perplexing to general ople on his hearing from his daughter that the lady was very finelooking and not so very old as he had fancied eccentric ladies must be the rectors account of her too excited the mind she had informed him bluntly that she now and then went to church to save appearances but was not a churchgoer finding it impossible to support the length of the service might however be reckoned in subscriptions for all the charities and left her pew open to poor people and none but the poor she had travelled over europe and knew the east sketches in watercolours of the scenes she had visited adorned her walls and a pair of pistols that she had found useful she affirmed lay on the writingdesk in her drawingroom general ople gathered from the rector that she had a great contempt for men yet it was curiously varied with lamentations over the weakness of women really she cannot possibly be an example of that said the general thinking of the pistols now we learn from those who have studied women on the chessboard and know what ebony or ivory will do along particular lines or hopping that men much talked about will take possession of their thoughts and certainly the fact may be accepted for one of their moves but the whole fabric of our knowledge of them which we are taught to build on this originally acute perception is shattered when we hear that it is exactly the same in the same degree in proportion to the amount of work they have to do exactly the same with men and their thoughts in the case of women much talked about so it was with general ople and nothing is left for me to say except that there is broader ground than the chessboard i am earnest in protesting the similarity of the singular couples on common earth because otherwise the general is in peril of the accusation that he is a feminine character and not simply was he a gallant officer and a veteran in gunpowder strife he was also and it is an extraordinary thing that a genuine humility did not prevent it and did survive it a lord and conqueror of the sex he had done his pretty bit of mischief all in the way of honour of course but hearts had knocked and now with his bright white hair his closebrushed white whiskers on a face burnt brown his clearcut features and a winning droop of his eyelids there was powder in him still if not shot there was a lamentable susceptibility to ladies charms on the other hand for the protection of the sex a remainder of shyness kept him from active enterprise and in the state of suffering so long as indications of encouragement were wanting he had killed the soft ones who came to him attracted by the softness in him to be killed but clever women alarmed and paralyzed him their aptness to question and require immediate sparkling answers their demand for fresh wit of a kind that is not furnished by publications which strike it into heads with a hammer and supply it wholesale their various reading their power of ridicule too made them awful in his contemplation supposing for the inflammable officer was now thinking and deeply thinking of a clever woman supposing that lady campers pistols were needed in her defence one night at the first report proclaiming her extremity valour might gain an introduction to her upon easy terms and would not be expected to be witty she would perhaps after the excitement admit his masculine superiority in the beautiful old fashion by fainting in his arms such was the reverie he passingly indulged and only so could he venture to hope for an acquaintance with the formidable lady who was his next neighbour but the proud society of the burglarious denied him opportunity meanwhile he learnt that lady camper had a nephew and the young gentleman was in a cavalry regiment general ople met him outside his gates received and returned a polite salute liked his appearance and manners and talked of him to elizabeth asking her if by chance she had seen him she replied that she believed she had and praised his horsemanship the general discovered that he was an excellent sculler his daughter was rowing him up the river when the young gentleman shot by with a splendid stroke in an outrigger backed and floating alongside presumed to enter into conversation during which he managed to express regrets at his aunts turn for solitariness as they belonged to sister branches of the same service the general and mr reginald roller had a theme in common and a passion elizabeth told her father that nothing afforded her so much pleasure as to hear him talk with mr roller on military matters general ople assured her that it pleased him likewise he began to spy about for mr roller and it sometimes occurred that they conversed across the wall it could hardly be avoided a hint or two an undefinable flying allusion gave the general to understand that lady camper had not been happy in her marriage he was pained to think of her misfortune but as she was not over forty the disaster was perhaps not irremediable that is to say if she could be taught to extend her forgiveness to men and abandon her solitude if he said to his daughter lady camper should by any chance be induced to contract a second alliance she would one might expect be humanized and we should have highly agreeable neighbours elizabeth artlessly hoped for such an event to take place she rarely differed with her father up to whom taking example from the world around him she looked as the pattern of a man of wise conduct and he was one and though modest he was in good humour with himself approved himself and could say that without boasting of success he was a satisfied man until he met his touchstone in lady camper chapter ii this is the pathetic matter of my story and it requires pointing out because he never could explain what it was that seemed to him so cruel in it for he was no brilliant son of fortune he was no great pretender none of those who are logically displaced from the heights they have been raised to manifestly created to show the moral in providence he was modest retiring humbly contented a gentlemanly residence appeased his ambition popular he could own that he was but not meteorically rather by reason of his willingness to receive light than his desire to shed it why then was the terrible test brought to bear upon him of all men he was one of us no worse and not strikingly or perilously better and he could not but feel in the bitterness of his reflections upon an inexplicable destiny that the punishment befalling him unmerited as it was looked like absence of design in the scheme of things above it looked as if the blow had been dealt him by reckless chance and to believe that was for the mind of general ople the having to return to his alphabet and recommence the ascent of the laborious mountain of understanding to proceed the generals introduction to lady camper was owing to a message she sent him by her gardener with a request that he would cut down a branch of a wychelm obscuring her view across his grounds toward the river the general consulted with his daughter and came to the conclusion that as he could hardly despatch a written reply to a verbal message yet greatly wished to subscribe to the wishes of lady camper the best thing for him to do was to apply for an interview he sent word that he would wait on lady camper immediately and betook himself forthwith to his toilette she was the niece of an earl elizabeth commended his appearance passed him as he would have said and well she might for his hat surtout trousers and boots were worthy of an introduction to royalty a touch of scarlet silk round the neck gave him bloom and better than that the blooming consciousness of it you are not to be nervous papa elizabeth said not at all replied the general i say not at all my dear he repeated and so betrayed that he had fallen into the nervous mood i was saying i have known worse mornings than this he turned to her and smiled brightly nodded and set his face to meet the future he was absent an hour and a half he came back with his radiance a little subdued by no means eclipsed as when experience has afforded us matter for thought we cease to shine dazzlingly yet are not clouded the rays have merely grown serener the sum of his impressions was conveyed in the reflective utteranceit only shows my dear how different the reality is from our anticipation of it lady camper had been charming full of condescension neighbourly friendly willing to be satisfied with the sacrifice of the smallest branch of the wychelm and only requiring that much for complimentary reasons elizabeth wished to hear what they were and she thought the request rather singular but the general begged her to bear in mind that they were dealing with a very extraordinary woman highly accomplished really exceedingly handsome he said to himself aloud the reasons were her liking for air and view and desire to see into her neighbours grounds without having to mount to the attic elizabeth gave a slight exclamation and blushed so my dear we are objects of interest to her ladyship said the general he assured her that lady campers manners were delightful strange to tell she knew a great deal of his antecedent history things he had not supposed were known little matters he remarked by which his daughter faintly conceived a reference to the conquests of his dashing days lady camper had deigned to impart some of her own incidentally that she was of welsh blood and born among the mountains she has a romantic look was the generals comment and that her husband had been an insatiable traveller before he became an invalid and had never cared for art quite an extraordinary circumstance with such a wife the general said he fell upon the wychelm with his own hands under cover of the leafage and the next day he paid his respects to lady camper to inquire if her ladyship saw any further obstruction to the view none she replied and now we shall see what the two birds will do apparently then she entertained an animosity to a pair of birds in the tree yes yes i say they chirp early in the morning said general ople at all hours the song of birds he pleaded softly for nature if the nest is provided for them but i dont like vagabond chirping the general perfectly acquiesced this in an engagement with a clever woman is what you should do or else you are likely to find yourself planted unawares in a high wind your hat blown off and your coattails anywhere in other words you will stand ridiculous in your bewilderment and general ople ever footed with the utmost caution to avoid that quagmire of the ridiculous the extremer quags he had hitherto escaped the smaller into which he fell in his agile evasions of the big he had hitherto been blest in finding none to notice he requested her ladyships permission to present his daughter lady camper sent in her card elizabeth ople beheld a tall handsomelymannered lady with good features and penetrating dark eyes an easy carriage of her person and an agreeable voice but the vision of her age flashed out under the compelling eyes of youth fifty if a day the rich colouring confessed to it but she was very pleasing and elizabeths perception dwelt on it only because her fathers manly chivalry had defended the lady against one year more than forty the richness of the colouring elizabeth feared was artificial and it caused her ingenuous young blood a shudder for we are so devoted to nature when the dame is flattering us with her gifts that we loathe the substitute omitting to think how much less it is an imposition than a form of practical adoration of the genuine our young detective however concealed her emotion of childish horror lady camper remarked of her she seems honest and that is the most we can hope of girls she is a jewel for an honest man the general sighed some day let us hope it will be a distant day yet said the general girls expect to marry lady camper fixed her black eyes on him but did not speak he told elizabeth that her ladyships eyes were exceedingly searching only said he as i have nothing to hide i am able to submit to inspection and he laughed slightly up to an arresting cough and made the mantelpiece ornaments pass muster general ople was the hero to champion a lady whose airs of haughtiness caused her to be somewhat backbitten he assured everybody that lady camper was much misunderstood she was a most remarkable woman she was a most affable and highly intelligent lady building up her attributes on a splendid climax he declared she was pious charitable witty and really an extraordinary artist he laid particular stress on her artistic qualities describing her power with the brush her watercolour sketches and also some immensely clever caricatures as he talked of no one else his friends heard enough of lady camper who was anything but a favourite the pollingtons the wilders the wardens the baerens the goslings and others of his acquaintance talked of lady camper and general ople rather maliciously they were all city people and they admired the general but mourned that he should so abjectly have fallen at the feet of a lady as red with rouge as a railway bill his not seeing it showed the state he was in the sister of mrs pollington an amiable widow relict of a large city warehouse named barcop was chilled by a falling off in his attentions his apology for not appearing at garden parties was that he was engaged to wait on lady camper and at one time her not condescending to exchange visits with the obsequious general was a topic fertile in irony but she did condescend lady camper came to his gate unexpectedly rang the bell and was let in like an ordinary visitor it happened that the general was gardeningnot the pretty occupation of pruninghe was diggingand of necessity his coat was off and he was hot dusty unpresentable from adoring earth as the mother of roses you may pass into a ladys presence without purification you cannot or so the general thought when you are caught in the act of adoring the mother of cabbages and though he himself loved the cabbage equally with the rose in his heart respected the vegetable yet more than he esteemed the flower for he gloried in his kitchen garden this was not a secret for the world to know and he almost heeled over on his beam ends when word was brought of the extreme honour lady camper had done him he worked his arms hurriedly into his fatigue jacket trusting to get away to the house and spend a couple of minutes on his adornment and with any other visitor it might have been accomplished but lady camper disliked sitting alone in a room she was on the square of lawn as the general stole along the walk had she kept her back to him he might have rounded her like the shadow of a dial undetected she was frightfully acute of hearing she turned while he was in the agony of hesitation in a queer attitude one leg on the march projected by a frenzied tiptoe of the hinder leg the very fatallest moment she could possibly have selected for unveiling him of course there was no choice but to surrender on the spot he began to squander his dizzy wits in profuse apologies lady camper simply spoke of the nice little nest of a garden smelt the flowers accepted a niel rose and a rohan a cline a falcot and la france a beautiful rose indeed she said of the latter only it smells of macassar oil really it never struck me i say it never struck me before rejoined the general smelling it as at a pinch of snuff i was saying i always and he tacitly with the absurdest of smiles begged permission to leave unterminated a sentence not in itself particularly difficult i have a nose observed lady camper like the noblybred person she was according to general oples version of the interview on his estate when he stood before her in his gardening costume she put him at his ease or she exerted herself to do so and if he underwent considerable anguish it was the fault of his excessive scrupulousness regarding dress propriety appearance he conducted her at her request to the kitchen garden and the handful of paddock the stables and coachhouse then back to the lawn it is the home for a young couple she said i am no longer young the general bowed with the sigh peculiar to this confession i say i am no longer young but i call the place a gentlemanly residence i was saying i yes yes lady camper tossed her head half closing her eyes with a contraction of the brows as if in pain he perceived a similar expression whenever he spoke of his residence perhaps it recalled happier days to enter such a nest perhaps it had been such a home for a young couple that she had entered on her marriage with sir scrope camper before he inherited his title and estates the general was at a loss to conceive what it was it recurred at another mention of his idea of the nature of the residence it was almost a paroxysm he determined not to vex her reminiscences again and as this resolution directed his mind to his residence thinking it preeminently gentlemanly his tongue committed the error of repeating it with gentlemanlike for a variation elizabeth was outhe knew not where the housemaid informed him that miss elizabeth was out rowing on the water is she alone lady camper inquired of him i fancy so the general replied the poor child has no mother it has been a sad loss to us both lady camper no doubt she is too pretty to go out alone i can trust her girls she has the spirit of a man that is well she has a spirit it will be tried the general modestly furnished an instance or two of her spiritedness lady camper seemed to like this theme she looked graciously interested still you should not suffer her to go out alone she said i place implicit confidence in her said the general and lady camper gave it up she proposed to walk down the lanes to the riverside to meet elizabeth returning the general manifested alacrity checked by reluctance lady camper had told him she objected to sit in a strange room by herself after that he could hardly leave her to dash upstairs to change his clothes yet how attired as he was in a fatigue jacket that warned him not to imagine his back view and held him constantly a little to the rear of lady camper lest she should be troubled by itand he knew the habit of the second rank to criticise the fronthow consent to face the outer world in such style side by side with the lady he admired come said she and he shot forward a step looking as if he had missed fire are you not coming general he advanced mechanically not a soul met them down the lanes except a little one to whom lady camper gave a small silverpiece because she was a picture the act of charity sank into the generals heart as any pretty performance will do upon a warm waxen bed lady camper surprised him by answering his thoughts no its for my own pleasure presently she said here they are general ople beheld his daughter by the riverside at the end of the lane under escort of mr reginald rolles it was another picture and a pleasing one the young lady and the young gentleman wore boating hats and were both dressed in white and standing by or just turning from the outrigger and light skiff they were about to leave in charge of a waterman elizabeth stretched a finger at armslength issuing directions which mr rolles took up and worded further to the man for the sake of emphasis and he rather than elizabeth was guilty of the halfstart at sight of the persons who were approaching my nephew you should know is intended for a working soldier said lady camper i like that sort of soldier best general ople drooped his shoulders at the personal compliment she resumed his pay is a matter of importance to him you are aware of the smallness of a subalterns pay i said the general i say i feel my poor halfpay having always been a working soldier myself very important i was saying very important to me why did you retire her interest in him seemed promising he replied conscientiously beyond the duties of general of brigade i could not i say i could not dare to aspire i can accept and execute orders i shrink from responsibility it is a pity said she that you were not like my nephew reginald entirely dependent on your profession she laid such stress on her remark that the general who had just expressed a very modest estimate of his abilities was unable to reject the flattery of her assuming him to be a man of some fortune he coughed and said very little the thought came to him that he might have to make a statement to her in time and he emphasized very little indeed sufficient he assured her for a gentlemanly appearance i have given you your warning was her inscrutable rejoinder uttered within earshot of the young people to whom especially to elizabeth she was gracious the damsels boating uniform was praised and her sunny flush of exercise and exposure lady camper regretted that she could not abandon her parasol i freckle so easily the general puzzling over her strange words about a warning gazed at the red rose of art on her cheek with an air of profound abstraction i freckle so easily she repeated dropping her parasol to defend her face from the calculating scrutiny i burn brown said elizabeth lady camper laid the bud of a falcot rose against the young girls cheek but fetched streams of colour that overwhelmed the momentary comparison of the sunswarthed skin with the rich dusky yellow of the rose in its deepening inward to soft brown reginald stretched his hand for the privileged flower and she let him take it then she looked at the general but the general was looking with his usual air of satisfaction nowhere chapter iii lady camper is no common enigma general ople observed to his daughter elizabeth inclined to be pleased with her for at her suggestion the general had bought a couple of horses that she might ride in the park accompanied by her father or the little groom still the great lady was hard to read she tested the resources of his income by all sorts of instigation to expenditure which his gallantry could not withstand she encouraged him to talk of his deeds in arms she was friendly almost affectionate and most bountiful in the presents of fruit peaches nectarines grapes and hothouse wonders that she showered on his table but she was an enigma in her evident dissatisfaction with him for something he seemed to have left unsaid and what could that be at their last interview she had asked him are you sure general you have nothing more to tell me and as he remarked when relating it to elizabeth one might really be tempted to misapprehend her ladyships i say one might commit oneself beyond recovery now my dear what do you think she intended elizabeth was burning brown or darkly blushing as her manner was she answered i am certain you know of nothing that would interest her nothing unless well the general urged her how can i speak it papa you really cant mean papa what could i mean if i were fool enough he murmured no no i am an old man i was saying i am past the age of folly one day elizabeth came home from her ride in a thoughtful mood she had not further than has been mentioned incited her father to think of the age of folly but voluntarily or not lady camper had by an excess of graciousness amounting to downright invitation as thus will you persist in withholding your confidence from me general she added i am not so difficult a person these prompting speeches occurred on the morning of the day when elizabeth sat at his table after a long ride into the country profoundly meditative a note was handed to general ople with the request that he would step in to speak with lady camper in the course of the evening or next morning elizabeth waited till his hat was on then said papa on my ride today i met mr rolles i am glad you had an agreeable escort my dear i could not refuse his company certainly not and where did you ride to a beautiful valley and there we met her ladyship yes she always admires you on horseback so you know it papa if she should speak of it and i am bound to tell you my child said the general that this morning lady campers manner to me was if i were a fool i say this morning i beat a retreat but apparently she i see no way out of it supposing she i am sure she esteems you dear papa said elizabeth you take to her my dear the general inquired anxiously a littlea little afraid of her a little elizabeth replied only a little dont be agitated about me no papa you are sure to do right but you are trembling oh no i wish you success general ople was overjoyed to be reinforced by his daughters good wishes he kissed her to thank her he turned back to her to kiss her again she had greatly lightened the difficulty at least of a delicate position it was just like the imperious nature of lady camper to summon him in the evening to terminate the conversation of the morning from the visible pitfall of which he had beaten a rather precipitate retreat but if his daughter cordially wished him success and lady camper offered him the crown of it why then he had only to pluck up spirit like a good commander who has to pass a fordable river in the enemys presence a dash a splash a rattling volley or two and you are over established on the opposite bank but you must be positive of victory otherwise with the river behind you your new position is likely to be ticklish so the general entered lady campers drawingroom warily watching the fair enemy he knew he was captivating his old conquests whispered in his ears and her reception of him all but pointed to a footstool at her feet he might have fallen there at once had he not remembered a hint that mr reginald rolles had dropped concerning lady campers amazing variability lady camper began general you ran away from me this morning let me speak and by the way i must reproach you you should not have left it to me things have now gone so far that i cannot pretend to be blind i know your feelings as a father your daughters happiness my lady the general interposed i have her distinct assurance that it is i say it is wrapt up in mine let me speak young people will say anything well they have a certain excuse for selfishness we have not i am in some degree bound to my nephew he is my sisters son assuredly my lady i would not stand in his light be quite assured if i am i was saying if i am not mistaken i and he is or has the making of an excellent soldier in him and is likely to be a distinguished cavalry officer he has to carve his own way in the world general all good soldiers have my lady and if my position is not after a considerable term of service i say if to continue said lady camper i never have liked early marriages i was married in my teens before i knew men now i do know them and now the general plunged forward the honour you do us nowa mature experience is worthmy dear lady camper i have admired youand your objection to early marriages cannot apply to indeed madam vigour they say though youth of course yet young people as you observe and i have though perhaps my reputation is against it i was saying i have a natural timidity with your sex and i am greyheaded whiteheaded but happily without a single malady lady campers brows showed a trifling bewilderment i am speaking of these young people general ople i consent to everything beforehand my dear lady he should be i say mr rolles should be provided for so should she general so should elizabeth she shall be she will dear madam what i have with your permission ifgood heaven lady camper i scarcely know where i am she would i shall not like to lose her you would not wish it in time she will she has every quality of a good wife there stay there and be intelligible said lady camper she has every quality money should be one of them has she money oh my lady the general exclaimed we shall not come upon your purse when her time comes has she ten thousand pounds elizabeth she will have at her fathers death but as for my income it is moderate and only sufficient to maintain a gentlemanly appearance in proper selfrespect i make no show i say i make no show a wealthy marriage is the last thing on earth i should have aimed at i prefer quiet and retirement personally i mean that is my personal taste but if the lady i say if it should happen that the lady and indeed i am not one to press a suit but if she who distinguishes and honours me should chance to be wealthy all i can do is to leave her wealth at her disposal and that i do i do that unreservedly i feel i am very confused alarmingly confused your ladyship merits a superior i trust i have not i am entirely at your ladyships mercy are you prepared if your daughter is asked in marriage to settle ten thousand pounds on her general ople the general collected himself in his heart he thoroughly appreciated the moral beauty of lady campers extreme solicitude on behalf of his daughters provision but he would have desired a postponement of that and other material questions belonging to a distant future until his own fate was decided so he said your ladyships generosity is very marked i say it is very marked how my good general ople how is it marked in any degree cried lady camper i am not generous i dont pretend to be and certainly i dont want the young people to think me so i want to be just i have assumed that you intend to be the same then will you do me the favour to reply to me the general smiled winningly and intently to show her that he prized her and would not let her escape his eulogies marked in this way dear madam that you think of my daughters future more than i i say more than her father himself does i know i ought to speak more warmly i feel warmly i was never an eloquent man and if you take me as a soldier i am as i have ever been in the service i was saying i am wilson ople of the grade of general to be relied on for executing orders and madam you are lady camper and you command me i cannot be more precise in fact it is the feeling of the necessity for keeping close to the business that destroys what i would say i am in fact lamentably incompetent to conduct my own case lady camper left her chair dear me this is very strange unless i am singularly in error she said the general now faintly guessed that he might be in error for his part but he had burned his ships blown up his bridges retreat could not be thought of he stood his head bent and appealing to her sideface like one pleadingly in pursuit and very deferentially with a courteous vehemence he entreated first her ladyships pardon for his presumption and then the gift of her ladyships hand as for his language it was the tongue of general ople but his bearing was fine if his clipped white silken hair spoke of age his figure breathed manliness he was a picture and she loved pictures for his own sake she begged him to cease she dreaded to hear of something gentlemanly this is a new idea to me my dear general she said you must give me time people at our age have to think of fitness of course in a sense we are both free to do as we like perhaps i may be of some aid to you my preference is for absolute independence and i wished to talk of a different affair come to me tomorrow do not be hurt if i decide that we had better remain as we are the general bowed his efforts and the wavering of the fair enemys flag had inspired him with a positive reawakening of masculine passion to gain this fortress he said well i have then the happiness madam of being allowed to hope until tomorrrow she replied i would not deprive you of a moment of happiness bring good sense with you when you do come the general asked eagerly i have your ladyships permission to come early consult your happiness she answered and if to his mind she seemed returning to the state of enigma it was on the whole deliciously she restored him his youth he told elizabeth that night he really must begin to think of marrying her to some worthy young fellow though said he with an air of frank intoxication my opinion is the young ones are not so lively as the old in these days or i should have been besieged before now the exact substance of the interview he forbore to relate to his inquisitive daughter with a very honourable discretion chapter iv elizabeth came riding home to breakfast from a gallop round the park and passing lady campers gates received the salutation of her parasol lady camper talked with her through the bars there was not a sign to tell of a change or twist in her neighbourly affability she remarked simply enough that it was her nephews habit to take early gallops and possibly elizabeth might have seen him for his quarters were proximate but she did not demand an answer she had passed a rather restless night she said how is the general papa must have slept soundly for he usually calls to me through his door when he hears i am up said elizabeth lady camper nodded kindly and walked on early in the morning general ople was ready for battle his forces were the anticipation of victory a carefully arranged toilet and an unaccustomed spirit of enterprise in the realms of speech for he was no longer in such awe of lady camper you have slept well she inquired excellently my lady yes your daughter tells me she heard you as she went by your door in the morning for a ride to meet my nephew you are i shall assume prepared for business elizabeth to meet general oples impression of anything extraneous to his emotion was feeble and passed instantly prepared oh certainly and he struck in a compliment on her ladyships fresh morning bloom it can hardly be visible she responded i have not painted yet does your ladyship proceed to your painting in the very early morning rouge i rouge dear me i should not have supposed it you have speculated on it very openly general i remember your trying to see a freckle through the rouge but the truth is i am of a supernatural paleness if i do not rouge so i do you understand therefore i have a false complexion now to business if your ladyship insists on calling it business i have little to offermyself you have a gentlemanly residence it is my lady it is it is a bijou ah lady camper sighed dejectedly it is a perfect bijou oblige me general by not pronouncing the french word as if you were swearing by something in english like a trooper general ople started admitted that the word was french and apologized for his pronunciation her variability was now visible over a corner of the battlefield like a thundercloud the business we have to discuss concerns the young people general yes brightened by this he assented yes dear lady camper it is a part of the business it is a secondary part it has to be discussed i say i subscribe beforehand i may say that honouring esteeming you as i do and hoping ardently for your consent they must have a home and an income general i presume dearest lady that elizabeth will be welcome in your home i certainly shall never chase reginald out of mine lady camper threw back her head then you are not yet awake or you practice the art of sleeping with open eyes now listen to me i rouge i have told you i like colour and i do not like to see wrinkles or have them seen therefore i rouge i do not expect to deceive the world so flagrantly as to my age and you i would not deceive for a moment i am seventy the effect of this noble frankness on the general was to raise him from his chair in a sitting posture as if he had been blown up her countenance was inexorably imperturbable under his alternate blinking and gazing that drew her close and shot her distant like a mysterious toy but said she i am an artist i dislike the look of extreme age so i conceal it as well as i can you are very kind to fall in with the deception an innocent and i think a proper one before the world though not to the gentleman who does me the honour to propose to me for my hand you desire to settle our business first you esteem me i suppose you mean as much as young people mean when they say they love do you let us come to an understanding i can the melancholy general gasped i say i cani cannoti cannot credit your ladyships you are at liberty to call me angela ange he tried it and in shame relapsed madam yes thanks ah cried lady camper do not use these vulgar contractions of decent speech in my presence i abhor the word thanks it is fit for fribbles dear me i have used it all my life groaned the general then for the remainder be it understood that you renounce it to continue my age is oh impossible impossible the general almost wailed there was really a crack in his voice advancing to seventy but like you i am happy to say i have not a malady i bring no invalid frame to a union that necessitates the leaving of the front door open day and night to the doctor my belief is i could follow my husband still on a campaign if he were a warrior instead of a pensioner general ople winced he was about to say humbly as general of brigade yes yes you want a commanding officer and that i have seen and that has caused me to meditate on your proposal she interrupted him while he studying her countenance hard with the painful aspect of a youth who lashes a donkey memory in an examination by word of mouth attempted to marshal her signs of younger years against her awful confession of the extremely ancient the witheringly ancient but for the manifest rouge manifest in spite of her declaration that she had not yet that morning proceeded to her paintbrush he would have thrown down his glove to challenge her on the subject of her age she had actually charms her mouth had a charm her eyes were lively her figure mature if you like was at least full and good she stood upright she had a queenly seat his mental ejaculation was what a wonderful constitution by a lapse of politeness he repeated it to himself half aloud he was shockingly nervous yes i have finer health than many a younger woman she said an ordinary calculation would give me twenty good years to come i am a widow as you know and by the way you have a leaning for widows have you not i thought i had heard of a widow barcop in this parish do not protest i assure you i am a stranger to jealousy my income the general raised his hands well then said the cool and selfcontained lady before i go farther i may ask you knowing what you have forced me to confess are you still of the same mind as to marriage and one moment general i promise you most sincerely that your withdrawing a step shall not as far as it touches me affect my neighbourly and friendly sentiments not in any degree shall we be as we were lady camper extended her delicate hand to him he took it respectfully inspected the aristocratic and unshrunken fingers and kissing them said i never withdraw from a position unless i am beaten back lady camper i my name is angela the general tried again he could not utter the name to call a lady of seventy angela is difficult in itself it is it seems thrice difficult in the way of courtship angela said she yes i say there is not a more beautiful female name dear lady camper spare me that word female as long as you live address me by that name if you please the general smiled the smile was meant for propitiation and sweetness it became a brazen smile unless you wish to step back said she indeed no i am happy lady camper my life is yours i say my life is devoted to you dear madam angela general ople was blushingly delivered of the name that will do said she and as i think it possible one may be admired too much as an artist i must request you to keep my number of years a secret to the death madam said the general and now we will take a turn in the garden wilson ople and beware of one thing for a commencement for you are full of weeds and i mean to pluck out a few never call any place a gentlemanly residence in my hearing nor let it come to my ears that you have been using the phrase elsewhere dont express astonishment at present it is enough that i dislike it but this only lady camper added this only if it is not your intention to withdraw from your position madam my lady i was sayinghemangela i could not wish to withdraw lady camper leaned with some pressure on his arm observing you have a curious attachment to antiquities my dear lady it is your mind i say it is your mind i was saying i am in love with your mind the general endeavoured to assure her and himself too or is it my powers as an artist your mind your extraordinary powers of mind well said lady camper a veteran general of brigade is as good a crutch as a childless old grannam can have and as a crutch general ople parading her grounds with the aged woman found himself used and treated the accuracy of his perceptions might be questioned he was like a man stunned by some great tropical fruit which responds to the longing of his eyes by falling on his head but it appeared to him that she increased in bitterness at every step they took as if determined to make him realize her wrinkles he was even so inconsequent or so little recognized his position as to object in his heart to hear himself called wilson it is true that she uttered wilsonople as if the names formed one word and on a second occasion when he inclined to feel hurt she remarked i fear me wilsonople if we are to speak plainly thou art but a fool he perhaps naturally objected to that he was however giddy and barely knew yet once more the magical woman changed all semblance of harshness and harridanlike spiketonguedness vanished when she said adieu the astronomer looking at the crusty jag and scoria of the magnified moon through his telescope and again with naked eyes at the softbeaming moon when the craterridges are faint as eyebrowpencillings has a similar sharp alternation of prospect to that which mystified general ople but between watching an orb that is only variable at our caprice and contemplating a woman who shifts and quivers ever with her own how vast the difference and consider that this woman is about to be ones wife he could have believed if he had not known full surely that such things are not he was in the hands of a witch lady campers adieu was perfectly beautifula kind cordial intimate above all to satisfy his present craving it was a ladylike adieuthe adieu of a delicate and elegant woman who had hardly left her anchorage by forty to sail into the fifties alas he had her word for it that she was not less than seventy and worse she had betrayed most melancholy signs of sourness and agedness as soon as he had sworn himself to her fast and fixed the road is open to you to retreat were her last words my road he answered gallantly is forward he was drawing backward as he said it and something provoked her to smile chapter v it is a noble thing to say that your road is forward and it befits a man of battles general ople was too loyal a gentleman to think of any other road still albeit not gifted with imagination he could not avoid the feeling that he had set his face to winter he found himself suddenly walking straight into the heart of winter and a nipping winter for her ladyship had proved acutely nipping his little customary phrases to which lady camper objected he could see no harm in whatever conversing with her in the privacy of domestic life would never be the flowing business that it is for other men it would demand perpetual vigilance hop skip jump flounderings and apologies this was not a pleasing prospect on the other hand she was the niece of an earl she was wealthy she might be an excellent friend to elizabeth and she could be when she liked both commandingly and bewitchingly ladylike good but he was a general officer of not more than fiftyfive in his full vigour and she a woman of seventy the prospect was bleak it resembled an outlook on the steppes in point of the discipline he was to expect he might be compared to a raw recruit and in his own home however she was a woman of mind one would be proud of her but did he know the worst of her a dreadful presentiment that he did not know the worst of her rolled an ocean of gloom upon general ople striking out one solitary thought in the obscurity namely that he was about to receive punishment for retiring from active service to a life of ease at a comparatively early age when still in marching trim and the shadow of the thought was that he deserved the punishment he was in his garden with the dawn hard exercise is the best of opiates for dismal reflections the general discomposed his daughter by offering to accompany her on her morning ride before breakfast she considered that it would fatigue him i am not a man of eighty he cried he could have wished he had been he led the way to the park where they soon had sight of young rolles who checked his horse and spied them like a vedette but perceiving that he had been seen came cantering and hailing the general with hearty wonderment and whats this the world says general said he but we all applaud your taste my aunt angela was the handsomest woman of her time the general murmured in confusion dear me and looked at the young man thinking that he could not have known the time is all arranged my dear general nothing is arranged and i begi say i beg i came out for fresh air and pace the general rode frantically in spite of the fresh air he was unable to eat at breakfast he was bound of course to present himself to lady camper in common civility immediately after it and first what were the phrases he had to avoid uttering in her presence he could remember only the gentlemanly residence and it was a gentlemanly residence he thought as he took leave of it it was one neatly named to fit the place lady camper is indeed a most eccentric person he decided from his experience of her he was rather astonished that young rolles should have spoken so coolly of his aunts leaning to matrimony but perhaps her exact age was unknown to the younger members of her family this idea refreshed him by suggesting the extremely honourable nature of lady campers uncomfortable confession he himself had an uncomfortable confession to make he would have to speak of his income he was living up to the edges of it she is an upright woman and i must be the same he said fortunately not in her hearing the subject was disagreeable to a man sensitive on the topic of money and feeling that his prudence had recently been misled to keep up appearances lady camper was in her garden reclining under her parasol a chair was beside her to which acknowledging the salutation of her suitor she waved him you have met my nephew reginald this morning general curiously in the park this morning before breakfast i did yes hem i i say i did meet him has your ladyship seen him no the park is very pretty in the early morning sweetly pretty lady camper raised her head and with the mildness of assured dictatorship pronounced never say that before me i submit my lady said the poor scourged man why naturally you do vulgar phrases have to be endured except when our intimates are guilty and then we are not merely offended we are compromised by them you are still of the mind in which you left me yesterday you are one day older but i warn you so am i yes my lady we cannot i say we cannot check time decidedly of the same mind quite so oblige me by never saying quite so my lawyer says it it reeks of the city of london and do not look so miserable i madam my dear lady the general flashed out in a radiance that dulled instantly well said she cheerfully and youre for the old woman for lady camper you are seductive in your flatteries general well then we have to speak of business my affairs general ople was beginning with perturbed forehead but lady camper held up her finger we will touch on your affairs incidentally now listen to me and do not exclaim until i have finished you know that these two young ones have been whispering over the wall for some months they have been meeting on the river and in the park habitually apparently with your consent my lady i did not say with your connivance you mean my daughter elizabeth and my nephew reginald we have named them if that advances us now the end of such meetings is marriage and the sooner the better if they are to continue i would rather they should not i do not hold it good for young soldiers to marry but if they do it is very certain that their pay will not support a family and in a marriage of two healthy young people we have to assume the existence of the family you have allowed matters to go so far that the boy is hot in love i suppose the girl is too she is a nice girl i do not object to her personally but i insist that a settlement be made on her before i give my nephew one penny hear me out for i am not fond of business and shall be glad to have done with these explanations reginald has nothing of his own he is my sisters son and i loved her and rather like the boy he has at present four hundred a year from me i will double it on the condition that you at once make over ten thousandnot less and let it be yes or noto be settled on your daughter and go to her children independent of the husbandcela va sans dire now you may speak general the general spoke with breath fetched from the deeps ten thousand pounds hem ten hem franklyten my lady ones incomei am quite taken by surprise i say elizabeths conductthough poor child it is natural to her to seek a mate i mean to accept a mate and an establishment and reginald is a very hopeful fellowi was saying they jump on me out of an ambush and i wish them every happiness and she is an ardent soldier and a soldier she must marry but ten thousand it is to secure the happiness of your daughter general pounds my lady it would rather cripple me you would have my house general you would have the moiety as the lawyers say of my purse you would have horses carriages servants i do not divine what more you would wish to have but madama pensioner on the government i can look back on past services i say old services and i accept my position but madam a pensioner on my wife bringing next to nothing to the common estate i fear my selfrespect would i say would well and what would it do general ople i was saying my selfrespect as my wifes pensioner my lady i could not come to her emptyhanded do you expect that i should be the person to settle money on your daughter to save her from mischances a rakish husband for example for reginald is young and no one can guess what will be made of him undoubtedly your ladyship is correct we might try absence for the poor girl i have no female relation but i could send her to the seaside to a ladyfriend general ople i forbid you as you value my esteem everand i repeat i forbid you everto afflict my ears with that phrase ladyfriend the general blinked in a state of insurgent humility these incessant whippings could not but sting the humblest of men and ladyfriend he was sure was a very common term used he was sure in the very best society he had never heard her majesty speak at levees of a ladyfriend but he was quite sure that she had one and if so what could be the objection to her subjects mentioning it as a term to suit their own circumstances he was harassed and perplexed by old lady campers treatment of him and he resolved not to call her angela even upon supplicationnot that day at least she said you will not need to bring property of any kind to the common estate i neither look for it nor desire it the generous thing for you to do would be to give your daughter all you have and come to me but lady camper if i denude myself or curtail my incomea man at his wifes discretion i was saying a man at his wifes mercy general ople was really forced by his manly dignity to make this protest on its behalf he did not see how he could have escaped doing so he was more an agent than a principal my wifes mercy he said again but simply as a herald proclaiming superior orders lady campers brows were wrathful a deep bloodcrimson overcame the rouge and gave her a terrible stormy look the congress now ceases to sit and the treaty is not concluded was all she said she rose bowed to him good morning general and turned her back he sighed he was a free man but this could not be deniedwhatever the ladys age she was a grand woman in her carriage and when looking angry she had a queenlike aspect that raised her out of the reckoning of time so now he knew there was a worse behind what he had previously known he was precipitate in calling it the worst now said he to himself i know the worst no man should ever say it least of all one who has entered into relations with an eccentric lady chapter vi politeness required that general ople should not appear to rejoice in his dismissal as a suitor and should at least make some show of holding himself at the beck of a reconsidering mind he was guilty of running up to london early next day and remaining absent until nightfall and he did the same on the two following days when he presented himself at lady campers lodgegates the astonishing intelligence that her ladyship had departed for the continent and egypt gave him qualms of remorse which assumed a more definite shape in something like awe of her triumphant constitution he forbore to mention her age for he was the most honourable of men but a habit of teatable talkativeness impelled him to say and repeat an idea that had visited him to the effect that lady camper was one of those wonderful women who are comparable to brilliant generals and defend themselves from the siege of time by various aggressive movements fearful of not being understood owing to the rarity of the occasions when the squat plain squad of honest saxon regulars at his command were called upon to explain an idea he recast the sentence but as it happened that the regulars of his vocabulary were not numerous and not accustomed to work upon thoughts and images his repetitions rather succeeded in exposing the piece of knowledge he had recently acquired than in making his meaning plainer so we need not marvel that his acquaintances should suppose him to be secretly aware of an extreme degree in which lady camper was a veteran general ople entered into the gaieties of the neighbourhood once more and passed through the winter cheerfully in justice to him however it should be said that to the intent dwelling of his mind upon lady camper and not to the festive life he led was due his entire ignorance of his daughters unhappiness she lived with him and yet it was in other houses he learnt that she was unhappy after his last interview with lady camper he had informed elizabeth of the ruinous and preposterous amount of money demanded of him for a settlement upon her and elizabeth like the girl of good sense that she was had replied immediately it could not be thought of papa he had spoken to reginald likewise the young man fell into a dramatic tearingofhair and longstride fury not ill becoming an enamoured dragoon but he maintained that his aunt though an eccentric was a cordially kind woman he seemed to feel if he did not partly hint that the general might have accepted lady campers terms the young officer could no longer be welcome at douro lodge so the general paid him a morning call at his quarters and was distressed to find him breakfasting very late tapping eggs that he forgot to openone of the surest signs of a young man downright and deep in love as the general knew from experienceand surrounded by uncut sporting journals of past weeks which dated from the day when his blow had struck him as accurately as the watch of the drowned man marks his minute lady camper had gone to italy and was in communication with her nephew reginald was not further explicit his legs were very prominent in his despair and his fingers frequently performed the part of blunt combs consequently the general was impressed by his passion for elizabeth the girl who if she was often meditative always met his eyes with a smile and quietly said yes papa and no papa gave him little concern as to the state of her feelings yet everybody said now that she was unhappy mrs barcop the widow raised her voice above the rest so attentive was she to elizabeth that the general had it kindly suggested to him that some one was courting him through his daughter he gazed at the widow now she was not much past thirty and it was really singularhe could have laughedthinking of mrs barcop set him persistently thinking of lady camper that is to say his mad fancy reverted from the lady of perhaps thirtyfive to the lady of seventy such thought he is genius in a woman of his neighbours generally mrs baerens the wife of a german merchant an exquisite player on the pianoforte was the most inclined to lead him to speak of lady camper she was a kind prattling woman and was known to have been a governess before her charms withdrew the gastronomic gottfried baerens from his devotion to the wellserved city club where as he exclaimed ever turning fondly to his wife as he vocalized the compliment he had found every necessity every luxury in life as you cannot have dem out of londonall save de female mrs baerens a lady of teutonic extraction was distinguishable as of that sex at least she was not masculine she spoke with great respect of lady camper and her family and seemed to agree in the generals eulogies of lady campers constitution still he thought she eyed him strangely one april morning the general received a letter with the italian postmark opening it with his usual calm and happy curiosity he perceived that it was composed of penandink drawings and suddenly his heart sank like a scuttled ship he saw himself the victim of a caricature the first sketch had merely seemed picturesque and he supposed it a clever play of fancy by some travelling friend or perhaps an actual scene slightly exaggerated even on reading a distant view of the city of wilsonople he was only slightly enlightened his heart beat still with befitting regularity but the second and the third sketches betrayed the terrible hand the distant view of the city of wilsonople was fair with glittering domes which in the succeeding near view proved to have been soapbubbles for a place of extreme flatness begirt with crazy oldfashioned fortifications was shown and in the third view representing the interior stood for sole place of habitation a sentrybox most minutely drawn and alas with fearful accuracy a military gentleman in undress occupied the box not a doubt could exist as to the person it was meant to be the general tried hard to remain incredulous he remembered too well who had called him wilsonople but here was the extraordinary thing that sent him over the neighbourhood canvassing for exclamations on the fourth page was the outline of a lovely feminine hand holding a pen as in the act of shading and under it these words what i say is i say i think it exceedingly unladylike now consider the generals feelings when turning to this fourth page having these very words in his mouth as the accurate expression of his thoughts he discovered them written an enemy who anticipates the actions of our mind has a quality of the malignant divine that may well inspire terror the senses of general ople were struck by the aspect of a lurid goddess who penetrated him read him through and had both power and will to expose and make him ridiculous for ever the loveliness of the hand too in a perplexing manner contested his denunciation of her conduct it was ladylike eminently and it involved him in a confused mixture of the moral and material as great as young people are known to feel when they make the attempt to separate them in one of their frenzies with a petty bitter laugh he folded the letter put it in his breastpocket and sallied forth for a walk chiefly to talk to himself about it but as it absorbed him entirely he showed it to the rector whom he met and what the rector said is of no consequence for general ople listened to no remarks calling in succession on the pollingtons the goslings the baerens and others early though it was and the lords of those houses absent amassing hoards and to the ladies everywhere he displayed the sketches he had received observing that wilsonople meant himself and there he was he said pointing at the capped fellow in the sentrybox done unmistakably the likeness indeed was remarkable she is a woman of genius he ejaculated with utter melancholy mrs baerens by the aid of a magnifying glass assisted him to read a line under the sentrybox that he had taken for a mere trembling dash it ran a gentlemanly residence what eyes she has the general exclaimed i say it is miraculous what eyes she has at her time of i was saying i should never have known it was writing he sighed heavily his shuddering sensitiveness to caricature was increased by a certain evident dread of the hand which struck the knowing that he was absolutely bare to this woman defenceless open to exposure in his little whims foibles tricks incompetencies in what lay in his heart and the words that would come to his tongue he felt like a man haunted so deeply did he feel the blow that people asked how it was that he could be so foolish as to dance about assisting lady camper in her efforts to make him ridiculous he acted the parts of publisher and agent for the fearful caricaturist in truth there was a strangely double reason for his conduct he danced about for sympathy he had the intensest craving for sympathy but more than this or quite as much he desired to have the powers of his enemy widely appreciated in the first place that he might be excused to himself for wincing under them and secondly because an awful admiration of her that should be deepened by a corresponding sentiment around him helped him to enjoy luxurious recollections of an hour when he was near making her his ownhis own in the holy abstract contemplation of marriage without realizing their probable relative conditions after the ceremony i say that is the very image of her ladyships hand he was especially fond of remarking i say it is a beautiful hand he carried the letter in his pocketbook and beginning to fancy that she had done her worst for he could not imagine an inventive malignity capable of pursuing the theme he spoke of her treatment of him with compassionate regret not badly assumed from being partly sincere two letters dated in france the one dijon the other fontainebleau arrived together and as the general knew lady camper to be returning to england he expected that she was anxious to excuse herself to him his fingers were not so confident for he tore one of the letters to open it the city of wilsonople was recognizable immediately so likewise was the sole inhabitant general oples petty bitter laugh recurred like a weakchested patients cough in the shifting of our winds eastward a faceless womans shadow kneels on the ground near the sentrybox weeping a faceless shadow of a young man on horseback is beheld galloping toward a gulf the sole inhabitant contemplates his largely substantial full fleshed face and figure in a glass next we see the standard of great britain furled next unfurled and borne by a troop of shadows to the sentrybox the officer within says i say i should be very happy to carry it but i cannot quit this gentlemanly residence next the standard is shown assailed by popguns several of the shadows are prostrate i was saying i assure you that nothing but this gentlemanly residence prevents me from heading you says the gallant officer general ople trembled with protestant indignation when he saw himself reclining in a magnified sentrybox while detachments of shadows hurry to him to show him the standard of his country trailing in the dust and he is maliciously made to say i dislike responsibility i say i am a fervent patriot and very fond of my comforts but i shun responsibility the second letter contained scenes between wilsonople and the moon he addresses her as his neighbour and tells her of his triumphs over the sex he requests her to inform him whether she is a female that she may be triumphed over he hastens past her window on foot with his head bent just as the general had been in the habit of walking he drives a mousepony furiously by he cuts down a tree that she may peep through then from the moons point of view wilsonople a silenus is discerned in an armchair winking at a couple too plainly pouting their lips for a doubt of their intentions to be entertained a fourth letter arrived bearing date of paris this one illustrated wilsonoples courtship of the moon and ended with his saying in his peculiar manner in spite of her paint i could not have conceived her age to be so enormous how break off his engagement with the lady moon consent to none of her terms little used as he was to read behind a veil acuteness of suffering sharpened the generals intelligence to a degree that sustained him in animated dialogue with each succeeding sketch or poisoned arrow whirring at him from the moment his eyes rested on it and here are a few samples wilsonople informs the moon that she is sweetly pretty he thanks her with thanks for a handsome piece of lunar green cheese he points to her apparently telling some one my ladyfriend he sneezes bijou bijou bijou they were trifles but they attacked his habits of speech and he began to grow more and more alarmingly absurd in each fresh caricature of his person he looked at himself as the malicious womans hand had shaped him it was unjust it was no resemblanceand yet it was there was a corner of likeness left that leavened the lump henceforth he must walk abroad with this distressing image of himself before his eyes instead of the satisfactory reflex of the man who had and was happy in thinking that he had done mischief in his time such an end for a conquering man was too pathetic the general surprised himself talking to himself in something louder than a hum at neighbours dinnertables he looked about and noticed that people were silently watching him chapter vii lady campers return was the subject of speculation in the neighbourhood for most people thought she would cease to persecute the general with her preposterous and unwarrantable penandink sketches when living so closely proximate and how he would behave was the question those who made a hero of him were sure he would treat her with disdain others were uncertain he had been so severely hit that it seemed possible he would not show much spirit he for his part had come to entertain such dread of the post that lady campers return relieved him of his morning apprehensions and he would have forgiven her though he feared to see her if only she had promised to leave him in peace for the future he feared to see her because of the too probable furnishing of fresh matter for her ladyships hand of course he could not avoid being seen by her and that was a particular misery a gentlemanly humility or demureness of aspect when seen would he hoped disarm his enemy it should he thought he had borne unheardof things no one of his friends and acquaintances knew they could not know what he had endured it has caused him fits of stammering it had destroyed the composure of his gait elizabeth had informed him that he talked to himself incessantly and aloud she poor child looked pale too she was evidently anxious about him young rolles whom he had met now and then persisted in praising his aunts good heart so perhaps having satiated her revenge she might now be inclined for peace on the terms of distant civility yes poor elizabeth sighed the general in pity of the poor girls disappointment poor elizabeth she little guesses what her father has gone through poor child i say she hasnt an idea of my sufferings general ople delivered his card at lady campers lodgegates and escaped to his residence in a state of prickly heat that required the brushing of his hair with hard brushes for several minutes to comfort and reestablish him he had fallen to working in his garden when lady campers card was brought to him an hour after the delivery of his own a pleasing promptitude showing signs of repentance and suggesting to the general instantly some sharp sarcasms upon women which he had come upon in quotations in the papers and the pulpit his two main sources of information instead of handing back the card to the maid he stuck it in his hat and went on digging the first of a series of letters containing shameless realistic caricatures was handed to him the afternoon following they came fast and thick not a days interval of grace was allowed niobe under the shafts of diana was hardly less violently and mortally assailed the deadliness of the attack lay in the ridicule of the daily habits of one of the most sensitive of men as to his personal appearance and the opinion of the world he might have concealed the sketches but he could not have concealed the bruises and people were perpetually asking the unhappy general what he was saying for he spoke to himself as if he were repeating something to them for the tenth time i say said he i say that for a lady really an educated lady to sit as she musti was saying she must have sat in an attic to have the right view of me and there you seethis is what she has done this is the last this is the afternoons delivery her ladyship has me correctly as to costume but i could not exhibit such a sketch to ladies a back view of the general was displayed in his act of digging i say i could not allow ladies to see it he informed the gentlemen who were suffered to inspect it freely but you see i have no means of escape i am at her mercy from morning to night the general said with a quivering tongue unless i stay at home inside the house and that is death to me or unless i abandon the place and my lease and i shalli say i shall find nowhere in england for anything like the money or conveniences such a genta residence you would call fit for a gentleman i call it a bi it is in short a gem but i shall have to go young rolles offered to expostulate with his aunt angela the general said tha i thank you very much i would not have her ladyship suppose i am so susceptible i hardly know he confessed pitiably what it is right to say and what notwhat not iii never know when i am not looking a fool i hurry from tree to tree to shun the light i am seriously affected in my appetite i say i shall have to go reginald gave him to understand that if he flew the shafts would follow him for lady camper would never forgive his running away and was quite equal to publishing a book of the adventures of wilsonople sunday afternoon walking in the park with his daughter on his arm general ople met mr rolles he saw that the young man and elizabeth were mortally pale and as the very idea of wretchedness directed his attention to himself he addressed them conjointly on the subject of his persecution giving neither of them a chance of speaking until they were constrained to part a sketch was the consequence in which a withered cupid and a fading psyche were seen divided by wilsonople who keeps them forcibly asunder with policemans fists while courteously and elegantly entreating them to hear him meet he tells them as often as you like in my company so long as you listen to me and the pathos of his aspect makes hungry demand for a sympathetic audience now this and not the series representing the martyrdom of the old couple at douro lodge gates whose rigid frames bore witness to the close packing of a gentlemanly residence this was the sketch general ople in his madness from the pursuing bite of the gadfly handed about at mrs pollingtons lawnparty some have said that he should not have betrayed his daughter but it is reasonable to suppose he had no idea of his daughters being the psyche or if he had it was indistinct owing to the violence of his personal emotion assuming this to have been the very sketch he handed it to two or three ladies in turn and was heard to deliver himself at intervals in the following snatches as you like my lady as you like strike i say strike i bear it i say i bear it if her ladyship is unforgiving i say i am enduring i may go i was saying i may go mad but while i have my reason i walk upright i walk upright mr pollington and certain city gentlemen hearing the poor generals renewed soliloquies were seized with disgust of lady campers conduct and stoutly advised an application to the law courts he gave ear to them abstractedly but after pulling out the whole chapter of the caricatures which it seemed that he kept in a case of morocco leather in his breastpocket showing them with comments on them and observing there will be more there must be more i say i am sure there are things i do that her ladyship will discover and expose he declined to seek redress or simple protection and the miserable spectacle was exhibited soon after of this courtly man listening to mrs barcop on the weather and replying in acquiescence it is hotif your ladyship will only abstain from colours very hot as you say madami do not complain of pen and ink but i would rather escape colours and i dare say you find it hot too mrs barcop shut her eyes and sighed over the wreck of a handsome military officer she asked him what is your objection to colours his hand was at his breastpocket immediately as he said have you not seenthough but a few minutes back he had shown her the contents of the packet including a hurried glance of the famous digging scene by this time the entire district was in fervid sympathy with general ople the ladies did not as their lords did proclaim astonishment that a man should suffer a woman to goad him to a state of semilunacy but one or two confessed to their husbands that it required a great admiration of general ople not to despise him both for his susceptibility and his patience as for the men they knew him to have faced the balls in bellowing battlestrife they knew him to have endured privation not only cold but downright want of food and drinkan almost unimaginable horror to these brave daily feasters so they could not quite look on him in contempt but his want of sense was offensive and still more so his submission to a scourging by a woman not one of them would have deigned to feel it would they have allowed her to see that she could sting them they would have laughed at her or they would have dragged her before a magistrate it was a sunday in early summer when general ople walked to morning service unaccompanied by elizabeth who was unwell the church was of the considerate oldfashioned order with deaf square pews permitting the mind to abstract itself from the sermon or wrestle at leisure with the difficulties presented by the preacher as general ople often did feeling not a little in love with his sincere attentiveness for grappling with the knotty point and partially allowing the struggle to be seen the church was besides a sanctuary for him hither his enemy did not come he had this one place of refuge and he almost looked a happy man again he had passed into his hat and out of it which he habitually did standing when who should walk up to within a couple of yards of him but lady camper her pew was full of poor people who made signs of retiring she signified to them that they were to sit then quietly took her seat among them fronting the general across the aisle during the sermon a low voice sharp in contradistinction to the monotone of the preachers was heard to repeat these words i say i am not sure i shall survive it considerable muttering in the same quarter was heard besides after the customary ceremonious game when all were free to move of nobody liking to move first lady camper and a charity boy were the persons who took the lead but lady camper could not quit her pew owing to the sticking of the door she smiled as with her pretty hand she twice or thrice essayed to shake it open general ople strode to her aid he pulled the door gave the shadow of a respectful bow and no doubt he would have withdrawn had not lady camper while acknowledging the civility placed her prayerbook in his hands to carry at her heels there was no choice for him he made a sort of slipping dance back for his hat and followed her ladyship all present being eager to witness the spectacle the passage of lady camper dragging the victim general behind her was observed without a stir of the welldressed members of the congregation until a desire overcame them to see how lady camper would behave to her fish when she had him outside the sacred edifice none could have imagined such a scene lady camper was in her carriage general ople was holding her prayerbook hat in hand at the carriage step and he looked as if he were toasting before the bars of a furnace for while he stood there lady camper was rapidly pencilling outlines in a small pocket sketchbook there are dogs whose shyness is put to it to endure human observation and a direct address to them even on the part of their masters and these dear simple dogs wag tail and turn their heads aside waveringly as though to entreat you not to eye them and talk to them so general ople in the presence of the sketchbook was much like the nervous animal he would fain have run away he glanced at it and round about and again at it and at the heavens her ladyships cruelty and his inexplicable submission to it were witnessed of the multitude the generals friends walked very slowly lady campers carriage whirled by and the general came up with them accosting them and himself alternately they asked him where elizabeth was and he replied poor child yes i am told she is pale but i cannot believe i am so perfectly i say so perfectly ridiculous when i join the responses he drew forth half a dozen sheets and showed them sketches that lady camper had taken in church caricaturing him in the sitting down and the standing up she had torn them out of the book and presented them to him when driving off i was saying worship in the ordinary sense will be interdicted to me if her ladyship said the general woefully shuffling the sketchpaper sheets in which he figured he made the following odd confession to mr and mrs gosling on the roadthat he had gone to his chest and taken out his swordbelt to measure his girth and found himself thinner than when he left the service which had not been the case before his attendance at the last levee of the foregoing season so the deduction was obvious that lady camper had reduced him she had reduced him as effectually as a harassing siege but why do you pay attention to her why exclaimed mr gosling a gentleman of the city whose roundness would have turned a rifleshot to allow her to wound you so seriously exclaimed mrs gosling madam if she were my wife the general explained i should feel it i say it is the fact of it i feel it if i appear so extremely ridiculous to a human eye to any one eye to lady campers eye he admitted it might be that he had not thought of ascribing the acuteness of his pain to the miserable image he presented in this particular ladys eye no it really was true curiously true another ladys eye might have transformed him to a pumpkin shape exaggerated all his foibles fiftyfold and he though not liking it of course not would yet have preserved a certain manly equanimity how was it lady camper had such power over hima lady concealing seventy years with a rougebox or paintpot it was witchcraft in its worst character he had for six months at her bidding been actually living the life of a beast degraded in his own esteem scorched by every laugh he heard running pursued overtaken and as it were scored or branded and then let go for the process to be repeated chapter viii our young barbarians have it all their own way with us when they fall into loveliking they lead us whither they please and interest us in their wishings their weepings and that fine performance their kissings but when we see our veterans tottering to their fall we scarcely consent to their having a wish as for a kiss we halloo at them if we discover them on a byway to the sacred grove where such things are supposed to be done by the venerable and this piece of rank injustice not to say impoliteness is entirely because of an unsound opinion that nature is not in it as though it were our esteem for nature which caused us to disrespect them they in truth show her to us discreet civilized in a decent moral aspect vistas of real life views of the minds eye are opened by their touching little emotions whereas those bully youngsters who come bellowing at us and catch us by the senses plainly prove either that we are no better than they or that we give our attention to nature only when she makes us afraid of her if we cared for her we should be up and after her reverentially in her sedater steps deeply studying her in her slower paces she teaches them nothing when they are whirling our closest instructors the true philosophersthe storytellers in shortwill learn in time that nature is not of necessity always roaring and as soon as they do the world may be said to be enlightened meantime in the contemplation of a pair of white whiskers fluttering round a pair of manifestly painted cheeks be assured that nature is in it not that hectoring wantonbut let the young have their fun let the superior interest of the passions of the aged be conceded and not a word shall be said against the young if then nature is in it how has she been made active the reason of her launch upon this last adventure is that she has perceived the person who can supply the virtue known to her by experience to be wanting thus in the broader instance many who have journeyed far down the road turn back to the worship of youth which they have lost some are for the graceful worldliness of wit of which they have just share enough to admire it some are captivated by hands that can wield the rod which in earlier days they escaped to their cost in the case of general ople it was partly her whippings of him partly her penetration her ability that sat so finely on a wealthy woman her indifference to conventional manners that so well beseemed a noblyborn one and more than all her correction of his little weaknesses and incompetencies in spite of his dislike of it won him he began to feel a sort of nibbling pleasure in her grotesque sketches of his person a tendency to recur to the old ones while dreading the arrival of new you hear old gentlemen speak fondly of the swish and they are not attached to pain but the instrument revives their feeling of youth and general ople half enjoyed while shrinking lady campers foregone outlines of him for in the distance the whipsend may look like a clinging caress instead of a stinging flick but this craven melting in his heart was rebuked by a very worthy pride that flew for support to the injury she had done to his devotions and the offence to the sacred edifice after thinking over it he decided that he must quit his residence and as it appeared to him in the light of duty he with an unspoken anguish commissioned the houseagent of his town to sell his lease or let the house furnished without further parley from the houseagents shop he turned into the chemists for a tonica foolish proceeding for he had received bracing enough in the blow he had just dealt himself but he had been cogitating on tonics recently imagining certain valiant effects of them with visions of a former careless happiness that they were likely to restore so he requested to have the tonic strong and he took one glass of it over the counter fifteen minutes after the draught he came in sight of his house and beholding it he could have called it a gentlemanly residence aloud under lady campers windows his insurgency was of such violence he talked of it incessantly but forbore to tell elizabeth as she was looking pale the reason why its modest merits touched him so he longed for the hour of his next dose and for a caricature to follow that he might drink and defy it a caricature was really due to him he thought otherwise why had he abandoned his bijou dwelling lady camper however sent none he had to wait a fortnight before one came and that was rather a likeness and a handsome likeness except as regarded a certain disorderliness in his dress which he knew to be very unlike him still it despatched him to the lookingglass to bring that verifier of facts in evidence against the sketch while sitting there he heard the housemaids knock at the door and the strange intelligence that his daughter was with lady camper and had left word that she hoped he would not forget his engagement to go to mrs baerens lawnparty the general jumped away from the glass shouting at the absent elizabeth in a fit of wrath so foreign to him that he returned hurriedly to have another look at himself and exclaimed at the pitch of his voice i say i attribute it to an indigestion of that tonic do you hear the housemaid faintly answered outside the door that she did alarming him for there seemed to be confusion somewhere his hope was that no one would mention lady campers name for the mere thought of her caused a rush to his head i believe i am in for a touch of apoplexy he said to the rector who greeted him in advance of the ladies on mr baerens lawn he said it smilingly but wanting some show of sympathy instead of the whisper and meaningless hand at his clerical band with which the rector responded he cried apoplexy and his friend seemed then to understand and disappeared among the ladies several of them surrounded the general and one inquired whether the series was being continued he drew forth his pocketbook handed her the latest and remarked on the gross injustice of it for as he requested them to take note her ladyship now sketched him as a person inattentive to his dress and he begged them to observe that she had drawn him with his necktie hanging loose and that i say that has never been known of me since i first entered society the ladies exchanged looks of profound concern for the fact was the general had come without any necktie and any collar and he appeared to be unaware of the circumstance the rector had told them that in answer to a hint he had dropped on the subject of neckties general ople expressed a slight apprehension of apoplexy but his careless or merely partial observance of the laws of buttonment could have nothing to do with such fears they signified rather a disorder of the intelligence elizabeth was condemned for leaving him to go about alone the situation was really most painful for a word to so sensitive a man would drive him away in shame and for good and still to let him parade the ground in the state compared with his natural self of scarecrow and with the dreadful habit of talking to himself quite rageing was a horrible alternative mrs baerens at last directed her husband upon the general trembling as though she watched for the operations of a fish torpedo and other ladies shared her excessive anxiousness for mr baerens had the manner and the look of artillery and on this occasion carried a surcharge of powder the general bent his ear to mr baerens whose germanenglish and repeated remark i am to do it wid delicassy did not assist his comprehension and when he might have been enlightened he was petrified by seeing lady camper walk on the lawn with elizabeth the great lady stood a moment beside mrs baerens she came straight over to him contemplating him in silence then she said your arm general ople and she made one circuit of the lawn with him barely speaking at her request he conducted her to her carriage he took a seat beside her obediently he felt that he was being sketched and comported himself like a childs flat man that jumps at the pulling of a string where have you left your girl general before he could rally his wits to answer the question he was asked and what have you done with your necktie and collar he touched his throat i am rather nervous today i forgot elizabeth he said sending his fingers in a dotting run of wonderment round his neck lady camper smiled with a triumphing humour on her closedrawn lips the verified absence of necktie and collar seemed to be choking him never mind you have been abroad without them said lady camper and that is a victory for me and you thought of elizabeth first when i drew your attention to it and that is a victory for you it is a very great victory pray do not be dismayed general you have a handsome campaigning air and no apologies if you please i like you well enough as you are there is my hand general ople understood her last remark he pressed the ladys hand in silence very nervously but do not shrug your head into your shoulders as if there were any possibility of concealing the thunderingly evident said lady camper electrifying him what with her cordial squeeze her kind eyes and her singular language you have omitted the collar well the collar is the fatal finishing touch in mens dress it would make apollo look bourgeois her hand was in his and watching the play of her features a spark entered general oples brain causing him in forgetfulness of collar and caricatures to ejaculate seventy did your ladyship say seventy utterly impossible you trifle with me we will talk when we are free of this accompaniment of carriagewheels general said lady camper i will beg permission to go and fetch elizabeth madam rightly thought of fetch her in my carriage and by the way mrs baerens was my old musicmistress and is i think one year older than i she can tell you on which side of seventy i am i shall not require to ask my lady he said sighing then we will send the carriage for elizabeth and have it out together at once i am impatient yes general impatient for whatforgiveness of me my lady the general breathed profoundly of whom else do you know what it isi dont think you do you english have the smallest experience of humanity i mean this to strike so hard that in the end you soften your heart to the victim well that is my weakness and we of our blood put no restraint on the blows we strike when we think them wanted so we are always overdoing it general ople assisted lady camper to alight from the carriage which was forthwith despatched for elizabeth he prepared to listen to her with a disconnected smile of acute attentiveness she had changed she spoke of money ten thousand pounds must be settled on his daughter and now said she you will remember that you are wanting a collar he acquiesced he craved permission to retire for ten minutes simplest of men what will cover you she exclaimed and peremptorily bidding him sit down in the drawingroom she took one of the famous pair of pistols in her hand and said if i put myself in a similar position and make myself decodletee too will that satisfy you you see these murderous weapons well i am a coward i dread firearms they are laid there to impose on the world and i believe they do they have imposed on you now you would never think of pretending to a moral quality you do not possess but silly simple man that you are you can give yourself the airs of wealth buy horses to conceal your nakedness and when you are taken upon the standard of your apparent income you would rather seem to be beating a miserly retreat than behave frankly and honestly i have a little overstated it but i am near the mark your ladyship wanting courage cried the general refresh yourself by meditating on it said she and to prove it to you i was glad to take this house when i knew i was to have a gallant gentleman for a neighbour no visitors will be admitted general ople so you are barethroated only to me sit quietly one day you speculated on the paint in my cheeks for the space of a minute and a halfi had said that i freckled easily your look signified that you really could not detect a single freckle for the paint i forgave you or i did not but when i found you on closer acquaintance as indifferent to your daughters happiness as you had been to her reputation my daughter her reputation her happiness general ople raised his eyes under a wave half uttering the outcries so indifferent to her reputation that you allowed a young man to talk with her over the wall and meet her by appointment so reckless of the girls happiness that when i tried to bring you to a treaty on her behalf you could not be dragged from thinking of yourself and your own affair when i found that perhaps i was predisposed to give you some of what my sisters used to call my spice you would not honestly state the proportions of your income and you affected to be faithful to the woman of seventy most preposterous could any caricature of mine exceed in grotesqueness your sketch of yourself you are a brave and a generous man all the same and i suspect it is more hoodwinking than egotismor extreme egotismthat blinds you a certain amount you must have to be a man you did not like my paint still less did you like my sincerity you were annoyed by my corrections of your habits of speech you were horrified by the age of seventy and you were credulousgeneral ople listen to me and remember that you have no collar onyou were credulous of my statement of my great age or you chose to be so or chose to seem so because i had brushed your cats coat against the fur and then full of yourself not thinking of elizabeth but to withdraw in the chivalrous attitude of the man true to his word to the old woman only stickling to bring a certain independence to the common stock becausei quote you and you have no collar on mindyou could not be at your wifes mercy you broke from your proposal on the money question where was your consideration for elizabeth then well general you were fond of thinking of yourself and i thought i would assist you i gave you plenty of subject matter i will not say i meant to work a homoeopathic cure but if i drive you to forget your collar is it or is it not a triumph no added lady camper it is no triumph for me but it is one for you if you like to make the most of it your fault has been to quit active service general and love your ease too well it is the fault of your countrymen you must get a militia regiment or inspectorship of militia you are ten times the man in exercise why do you mean to tell me that you would have cared for those drawings of mine when marching i think so i say i think so remarked the general seriously i doubt it said she but to the point here comes elizabeth if you have not much money to spare for her according to your prudent calculation reflect how this money has enfeebled you and reduced you to the level of the people round about us herewho are what inhabitants of gentlemanly residences yes but what kind of creature they have no mental standard no moral aim no native chivalry you were rapidly becoming one of them only fortunately for you you were sensitive to ridicule elizabeth shall have half my money settled on her said the general though i fear it is not much and if i can find occupation my lady something worthier than that said lady camper pencilling outlines rapidly on the margin of a book and he saw himself lashing a pony or that and he was plucking at a cabbage or that and he was bowing to three petticoated posts the likeness is exact general ople groaned so you may suppose i have studied you said she but there is no real likeness slight exaggerations do more harm to truth than reckless violations of it you would not have cared one bit for a caricature if you had not nursed the absurd idea of being one of our conquerors it is the very tragedy of modesty for a man like you to have such notions my poor dear good friend the modest are the most easily intoxicated when they sip at vanity and reflect whether you have not been intoxicated for these young people have been wretched and you have not observed it though one of them was living with you and is the child you love there i have done pray show a good face to elizabeth the general obeyed as well as he could he felt very like a sheep that has come from a shearing and when released he wished to run away but hardly had he escaped before he had a desire for the renewal of the operation she sees me through she sees me through he was heard saying to himself and in the end he taught himself to say it with a secret exultation for as it was on her part an extraordinary piece of insight to see him through it struck him that in acknowledging the truth of it he made a discovery of new powers in human nature general ople studied lady camper diligently for fresh proofs of her penetration of the mysteries in his bosom by which means as it happened that she was diligently observing the two betrothed young ones he began to watch them likewise and took a pleasure in the sight their meetings their partings their rides out and home furnished him themes of converse he soon had enough to talk of and previously as he remembered he had never sustained a conversation of any length with composure and the beneficent sense of fulness five thousand pounds to which sum lady camper reduced her stipulation for elizabeths dowry he signed over to his dear girl gladly and came out with the confession to her ladyship that a wellinvested twelve thousand comprised his fortune she shrugged she had left off pulling him this way and that so his chains were enjoyable and he said to himself if ever she should in the dead of night want a man to defend her he mentioned it to reginald who had been the repository of elizabeths lamentations about her father being left alone forsaken and the young man conceived a scheme for causing his aunts great bell to be rung at midnight which would certainly have led to a dramatic issue and the happy reestablishment of our masculine ascendancy at the close of this history but he forgot it in his bridegrooms delight until he was making his miserable official speech at the weddingbreakfast and set elizabeth winking over a tear as she stood in the hall ready to depart a great van was observed in the road at the gates of douro lodge and this the men in custody declared to contain the goods and knickknacks of the people who had taken the house furnished for a year and were coming in that very afternoon i remember i say now i remember i had a notice the general said cheerily to his troubled daughter but where are you to go papa the poor girl cried close on sobbing i shall get employment of some sort said he i was saying i want it i need it i require it you are saying three times what once would have sufficed for said lady camper and she asked him a few questions frowned with a smile and offered him a lodgement in his neighbours house really dearest aunt angela said elizabeth what else can i do child i have it seems driven him out of a gentlemanly residence and i must give him a ladylike one true i would rather have had him at call but as i have always wished for a policeman in the house i may as well be satisfied with a soldier but if you lose your character my lady said reginald then i must look to the general to restore it general ople immediately bowed his head over lady campers fingers an odd thing to happen to a woman of fortyone she said to her great people and they submitted with the best grace in the world while the generals ears tingled till he felt younger than reginald this his reflections ran or it would be more correct to say waltzed this is the result of paintingthat you can believe a woman to be any age when her cheeks are tinted as for lady camper she had been floated accidentally over the ridicule of the bruit of a marriage at a time of life as terrible to her as her fiction of seventy had been to general ople she resigned herself to let things go with the tide she had not been blissful in her first marriage she had abandoned the chase of an ideal man and she had found one who was tunable so as not to offend her ears likely ever to be a fund of amusement for her humour good impressible and above all very picturesque there is the secret of her and of how it came to pass that a simple man and a complex woman fell to union after the strangest division etext editors bookmarks can believe a woman to be any age when her cheeks are tinted modest are the most easily intoxicated when they sip at vanity nature is not of necessity always roaring only to be described in the tongue of auctioneers respected the vegetable yet more than he esteemed the flower she seems honest and that is the most we can hope of girls spare me that word female as long as you live the mildness of assured dictatorship when we see our veterans tottering to their fall the tale of chloe an episode in the history of beau beamish by george meredith fair chloe we toasted of old as the queen of our festival meeting now chloe is lifeless and cold you must go to the grave for her greeting her beauty and talents were framed to enkindle the proudest to win her then let not the memry be blamed of the purest that eer was a sinner captain chanters collection chapter i a proper tenderness for the peerage will continue to pass current the illustrious gentleman who was inflamed by cupids darts to espouse the milkmaid or dairymaid under his ballad title of duke of dewlap nor was it the smallest of the services rendered him by beau beamish that he clapped the name upon her rustic grace the young duchess the very first day of her arrival at the wells this happy inspiration of a wit never failing at a pinch has rescued one of our princeliest houses from the assaults of the vulgar who are ever too rejoiced to bespatter and disfigure a brilliant coatofarms insomuch that the ballad to which we are indebted for the narrative of the meeting and marriage of the ducal pair speaks of dewlap in good faith o the ninth duke of dewlap i am susie dear without a hint of a domino title so likewise the pictorial historian is merry over dewlap alliances in his description of the society of that period he has read the ballad but disregarded the memoirs of the beau writers of pretension would seem to have an animus against individuals of the character of mr beamish they will treat of the habits and manners of highwaymen and quote obscure broadsheets and songs of the people to colour their story yet decline to bestow more than a passing remark upon our domestic kings because they are not hereditary we may suppose the ballad of the duke and the dairymaid ascribed with questionable authority to the pen of mr beamish himself in a freak of his gaiety was once popular enough to provoke the moralist to animadversions upon an order of composition that tempted every bouncing country lass to sidle an eye in a blowsy cheek in expectation of a coronet for her painsand a wet ditch as the result we may doubt it to have been such an occasion of mischief but that mischief may have been done by it to a nobilityloving people even to the love of our nobility among the people must be granted and for the particular reason that the hero of the ballad behaved so handsomely we perceive a susceptibility to adulteration in their worship at the sight of one of their number a young maid suddenly snatched up to the gaping heights of luxury and fashion through sheer good looks remembering that they are accustomed to a totally reverse effect from that possession it is very perceptible how a breach in their reverence may come of the change otherwise the ballad is innocent certainly it is innocent in design a fresher national song of a beautiful incident of our country life has never been written the sentiments are natural the imagery is apt and redolent of the soil the music of the verse appeals to the dullest ear it has no smell of the lamp nothing foreign and farfetched about it but is just what it pretends to be the carol of the native bird a sample will show for the ballad is much too long to be given entire sweet susie she tripped on a shiny may morn as blithe as the lark from the greenspringing corn when hard by a stile twas her luck to behold a wonderful gentleman covered with gold there was gold on his breeches and gold on his coat his shirtfrill was grand as a fiftypound note the diamonds glittered all up him so bright she thought him the milky way clothing a sprite fear not pretty maiden he said with a smile and pray let me help you in crossing the stile she bobbed him a curtsey so lovely and smart it shot like an arrow and fixed in his heart as light as a robin she hopped to the stone but fast was her hand in the gentlemans own and guess how she stared nor her senses could trust when this creamy gentleman knelt in the dust with a rhapsody upon her beauty he informs her of his rank for a flourish to the proposal of honourable and immediate marriage he cannot wait this is the fatal condition of his love apparently a characteristic of amorous dukes we read them in the signs extended to us the minds of these august and solitary men have not yet been sounded they are too distant standing upon their lofty pinnacles they are as legible to the rabble below as a line of cuneiform writing in a page of old copybook roundhand by their deeds we know them as heathendom knows of its gods and it is repeatedly on record that the moment they have taken fire they must wed though the ladys finger be circled with nothing closer fitting than a ring of the bedcurtain vainly as becomes a candid country lass blueeyed susan tells him that she is but a poor dairymaid he has been a student of women at courts in which furnace the sex becomes a transparency so he recounts to her the catalogue of material advantages he has to offer finally after his assurances that she is to be married by the parson really by the parson and a real parson sweet susie is off for her parents consent and long must the old folk debate what it meant she left them the eve of that happy may morn to shine like the blossom that hangs from the thorn apart from its historical value the ballad is an example to poets of our day who fly to mythological greece or a fanciful and morbid mediaevalism orsave the markabstract ideas for themes of song of what may be done to make our english life poetically interesting if they would but pluck the treasures presented them by the wayside and nature being now as then the passport to popularity they have themselves to thank for their little hold on the heart of the people a living native duke is worth fifty phoebus apollos to englishmen and a buxom young lass of the fields mounting from a pair of pails to the estate of duchess a more romantic object than troops of your visionary yseults and guineveres chapter ii a certain time after the marriage his grace alighted at the wells and did himself the honour to call on mr beamish addressing that gentleman to whom he was no stranger he communicated the purport of his visit sir and my very good friend he said first let me beg you to abate the severity of your countenance for if i am here in breach of your prohibition i shall presently depart in compliance with it i could indeed deplore the loss of the passion for play of which you effectually cured me i was then armed against a crueller that allows of no interval for a man to make his vow to recover the disease which is all crisis i apprehend mr beamish remarked which sir when it takes hold of dry wood burns to the last splinter it is nowthe duke fetched a tender groanthree years ago that i had a caprice to marry a grandchild of adams mr beamish said cheerfully there was no legitimate bar to the union unhappily none yet you are not to suppose i regret it a most admirable creature mr beamish a real divinity and the better known the more adored there is the misfortune at my season of life when the greater and the minor organs are in a conspiracy to tell me i am mortal the passion of love must be welcomed as a calamity though one would not be free of it for the renewal of youth you are to understand that with a little awakening taste for dissipation she is the most innocent of angels hitherto we have lived to her it has been a new world but she is beginning to find it a narrow one no no she is not tired of my society very far from that but in her present station an inclination for such gatherings as you have here for example is like a desire to take the air and the healthy habits of my duchess have not accustomed her to be immured and in fine devote ourselves as we will a term approaches when the enthusiasm for serving as your wifes playfellow all day running round tables and flying along corridors before a knotted handkerchief is mightily relaxed yet the dread of a separation from her has kept me at these pastimes for a considerable period beyond my relish of them not that i acknowledge fatigue i have it seems a taste for reflection i am now much disposed to read and meditate which cannot be done without repose i settle myself and i receive a worsted ball in my face and i am expected to return it i comply and then you would say a nursery in arms it would else be the deplorable spectacle of a beautiful young woman yawning earthquake and saltpetre threaten us less terribly said mr beamish in fine she has extracted a promise that this summer she shall visit the wells for a month and i fear i cannot break my pledge of my word i fear i cannot very certainly i would not said mr beamish the duke heaved a sigh there are reasons family reasons why my company and protection must be denied to her here i have no wish indeed my name for the present until such time as she shall have found her feet and there is ever a penalty to pay for that ah mr beamish pictures are ours when we have bought them and hung them up but who insures us possession of a beautiful work of nature i have latterly betaken me to reflect much and seriously i am tempted to side with the divines in the sermons i have read the flesh is the habitation of a rebellious devil to whom we object in proportion as we ourselves become quit of him mr beamish acquiesced but this mania of young people for pleasure eternal pleasure is one of the wonders it does not pall on them they are insatiate there is the cataract and there is the cliff potentate to potentate dukeso long as you are on my territory be it understood upon my way to a place of worship once i passed a puritan who was complaining of a butterfly that fluttered prettily abroad in desecration of the day of rest friend said i to him conclusively you prove to me that you are not a butterfly surly did no more than favour me with the anathema of his countenance cousin beamish my complaint of these young people is that they miss their pleasure in pursuing it i have lectured my duchess ha foolish i own said the duke but suppose now you had caught your butterfly and you could neither let it go nor consent to follow its vagaries that poses you young people said mr beamish come under my observation in this poor realm of mineyoung and old i find them prodigiously alike in their love of pleasure differing mainly in their capacity to satisfy it that is no uncommon observation the young have an edge which they are desirous of blunting the old contrariwise the cry of the young for pleasure is actuallyi have studied their languagea cry for burdens curious and the old ones cry for having too many on their shoulders which is not astonishing between them they make an agreeable concert both to charm the ears and guide the steps of the philosopher whose wisdom it is to avoid their tracks good but i have asked you for practical advice and you give me an essay for the reason duke that you propose a case that suggests hanging you mention two things impossible to be done the alternative is a garter and the bedpost when we have come upon crossways and we can decide neither to take the right hand nor the left neither forward nor back the index of the board which would direct us points to itself and emphatically says gallows beamish i am distracted if i refuse her the visit i foresee dissensions tears games at ball romps not one day of rest remaining to me i could be of a mind with your puritan positively if i allow it so innocent a creature in the atmosphere of a place like this must suffer some corruption you should know that the station i took her from was it was modest she was absolutely a buttercup of the fields she has had various masters she dances she dances prettily i could say bewitchingly and so she is now for airing her accomplishments such are women have you heard of chloe said mr beamish there you have an example of a young lady uncorrupted by this placeof which i would only remark that it is best unvisited but better tasted than longed for chloe a lady who squandered her fortune to redeem some illrequiting rascal i remember to have heard of her she is here still and ruined of course in purse that cannot be without the loss of reputation chloes champion will grant that she is exposed to the evils of improvidence the more brightly shine her native purity her goodness of heart her trustfulness she is a lady whose exaltation glows in her abasement she has i see preserved her comeliness observed the duke with a smile despite the flying of the roses which had not her hearts patience tis now the lily that reigns so then chloe shall be attached to the duchess during her stay and unless the devil himself should interfere i guarantee her grace against any worse harm than experience and that mr beamish added as the duke raised his arms at the fearful word that shall be mild play she will she is sure to play put it down at a thousand we map her out a course of permissible follies and she plays to lose the thousand by degrees with as telling an effect upon a connubial conscience as we can produce a thousand said the duke will be cheap indeed i think now i have had a description of this fair chloe and from an enthusiast a brune elegantly mannered and of a good landed family though she has thought proper to conceal her name and that will be our difficulty cousin beamish she was under my dominion miss martinsward mr beamish pursued she came here very young and at once her suitors were legion in the way of women she chose the worst among them and for the fellow caseldy she sacrificed the fortune she had inherited of a maternal uncle to release him from prison she paid all his debts a mountain of bills with the lawyers piled abovepelion upon ossa to quote our poets in fact obeying the dictates of a soul steeped in generosity she committed the indiscretion to strip herself scandalizing propriety this was immediately on her coming of age and it was the deathblow to her relations with her family since then honoured even by rakes she has lived impoverished at the wells i dubbed her chloe and man or woman disrespectful to chloe packs from being the victim of her generous disposition i could not save her i can protect her from the shafts of malice she has no passion for play inquired the duke she nourishes a passion for the man for whom she bled to the exclusion of the other passions she lives and i believe i may say that it is the motive of her rising and dressing daily in expectation of his advent he may be dead the dog is alive and he has not ceased to be handsome caseldy they say between ourselves duke there is matter to break her heart he has been the count caseldy of continental gaming tables and he is recently sir martin caseldy settled on the estate she made him free to take up intact on his fathers decease pah a villain with a blacker brand upon him every morning that he looks forth across his property and leaves her to languish she stilli say it to the redemption of our sexhas offers her incomparable attractions of mind and person exercise the natural empire of beauty but she will none of them i call her the fair suicide she has died for love and she is a ghost a good ghost and a pleasing ghost but an apparition a taper the duke fidgeted and expressed a hope to hear that she was not of melancholy conversation and again that the subject of her discourse was not confined to love and lovers happy or unhappy he wished his duchess he said to be entertained upon gayer topics love being a theme he desired to reserve to himself this month he said prognostically shaking and moaning i would this month were over and that we were well purged of it mr beamish reassured him the wit and sprightliness of chloe were so famous as to be considered medical he affirmed she was besieged for her company she composed and sang impromptu verses she played harp and harpsichord divinely and touched the guitar and danced danced like the silvery moon on the waters of the mill pool he concluded by saying that she was both humane and wise humbleminded and amusing virtuous yet not a tartar the best of companions for her grace the young duchess moreover he boldly engaged to carry the duchess through the term of her visit under a name that should be as good as a masquerade for concealing his graces while giving her all the honours due to her rank you strictly interpret my wishes said the duke all honours the foremost place and my wrath upon man or woman gainsaying them mine if you please duke said mr beamish a thousand pardons i leave it to you cousin i could not be in safer hands i am heartily bounders to you chloe then by the way she has a decent respect for age she is reverentially inclined not that she is i would ask no wanton prattler of the charms and advantages of youth she has a young adorer that i have dubbed alonzo whom she scarce notices nothing could be better alonzo hm a faithful swain life is his tree upon which unceasingly he carves his mistresss initials she should not be too cruel i recollect myself formerly i was young men will when long slighted transfer their affections and be warmer to the second flame than to the first i put you on your guard he follows her much these lovers paintings and puffings in the neighbourhood of the most innocent of women are contagious her grace will be running home all the sooner or offmay she forgive me i am like a king johns jew forced to lend his treasure without security what a world is ours nothing beamish nothing desirable will you have which is not coveted catch a prize and you will find you are at war with your species you have to be on the defensive from that moment there is no such thing as peaceable procession on earth let it be a beautiful young womanah mr beamish replied bracingly the champion wrestler challenges all comers while he wears the belt the duke dejectedly assented true or he is challenged say is there any tale we could tell her of this alonzo you could deport him for the month my dear beamish i commit no injustice unless with sufficient reason it is an estimable youth as shown by his devotion to a peerless woman to endow her with his name and fortune is his only thought i perceive an excellent young fellow i have an incipient liking for this young alonzo you must not permit my duchess to laugh at him encourage her rather to advance his suit the silliness of a young man will be no bad spectacle chloe then you have set my mind at rest beamish and it is but another obligation added to the heap so if i do not speak of payment the reason is that i know you would not have me bankrupt the remainder of the colloquy of the duke and mr beamish referred to the date of her graces coming to the wells the lodgement she was to receive and other minor arrangements bearing upon her state and comfort the duke perpetually observing but i leave it all to you beamish when he had laid down precise instructions in these respects even to the specification of the shopkeepers the confectioner and the apothecary who were to balance or cancel one another in the opposite nature of their supplies and the haberdasher and the jeweller with whom she was to make her purchases for the duke had a recollection of giddy shops and of giddy shopmen too and it was by serving as one for a day that a certain great nobleman came to victory with a jealously guarded dame beautiful as venus i would have challenged the goddess he cried and subsided from his enthusiasm plaintively like a weak wind instrument so there you see the prudence of a choice of shops but i leave it to you beamish similarly the great military commander having done whatsoever a careful prevision may suggest to insure him victory casts himself upon providence with the hope of propitiating the unanticipated and darkly possible chapter iii the splendid equipage of a coach and six with footmen in scarlet and green carried beau beamish five miles along the road on a sunny day to meet the young duchess at the boundary of his territory and conduct her in state to the wells chloe sat beside him receiving counsel with regard to her prospective duties he was this day the consummate beau suave but monarchical and his manner of speech partook of his external grandeur spy me the horizon and apprise me if somewhere you distinguish a chariot he said as they drew up on the rise of a hill of long descent where the dusty roadway sank between its brown hedges and crawled mounting from dry rushspotted hollows to corn fields on a companion height directly facing them at a remove of about threequarters of a mile chloe looked forth while the beau passingly raised his hat for coolness and murmured with a glance down the sultry track it sweats the eye to see presently chloe said now a dust blows something approaches now i discern horses now a vehicle and it is a chariot orders were issued to the outriders for horns to be sounded both chloe and beau beamish wrinkled their foreheads at the disorderly notes of triple horns whose pealing made an acid in the air instead of sweetness you would say kennel dogs that bay the moon said the wincing beau yet as you know these fellows have been exercised i have had them out in a meadow for hours baked and drenched to get them rid of their native cacophony but they love it as they love bacon and beans the musical taste of our people is in the stage of the primitive appetite for noise and for that they are gluttons it will be pleasant to hear in the distance chloe replied ay the extremer the distance the pleasanter to hear are they advancing they stop there is a cavalier at the window now he doffs his hat sweepingly chloe described a semicircle in the grand manner the beaus eyebrows rose powers divine he muttered she is let loose from hand to hand and midway comes a cavalier we did not count on the hawks so i have to deal with a cavalier it signifies my dear chloe that i must incontinently affect the passion if i am to be his match nothing less he has flown said chloe whom she encounters after meeting me i care not quoth the beau snapping a finger but there has been an interval for damage with a lady innocent as eve is she advancing the chariot is trotting down the hill he has ridden back she has no attendant horseman they were dismissed at my injunction ten miles off particularly to the benefit of the cavaliering horde it would appear in the case of a woman chloe one blink of the eyelids is an omission of watchfulness that is an axiom fit for the harem of the grand signior the grand signior might give us profitable lessons for dealing with the sex distrust us and it is a declaration of war trust you and the stopper is out of the smellingbottle mr beamish we are women but we have souls the pip in the apple whose ruddy cheek allures little tommy to rob the orchard is as good a preservative you admit that men are our enemies i maintain that they carry the banner of virtue oh mr beamish i shall expire i forbid it in my lifetime chloe for i wish to die believing in one woman no flattery for me at the expense of my sisters then fly to a hermitage for all flattery is at somebodys expense child tis an essenceextract of humanity to live on it in the fashion of some people is badit is downright cannibal but we may sprinkle our handkerchiefs with it and we should if we would caress our noses with an air society my chloe is a recommencement upon an upper level of the savage system we must have our sacrifices as for instance what say you of myself beside our booted bumpkin squires hundreds of them mr beamish that is a holocaust of squires reduced to make an incense for me though you have not performed druid rites and packed them in gigantic osier ribs be philosophical but accept your personal dues grant us ours too i have a serious intention to preserve this young duchess and i expect my task to be severe i carry the banner aforesaid verily and penitentially i do it is an error of the vulgar to suppose that all is dragon in the dragons jaws men are his fangs and claws ay but the passion for his fiery breath is in woman she will take her leap and have her jump will and will and at the point where she will and she wont the dragon gulps and down she goes however the business is to keep our buttercup duchess from that same point is she near i can see her said chloe beau beamish requested a sketch of her and chloe began she is ravishing upon which he commented every woman is ravishing at forty paces and still more so in imagination beautiful auburn hair and a dazzling red and white complexion set in a blue coif her eyes melting blue tis an english witch exclaimed the beau and he compassionately invoked her absent lord chloes optics were no longer tasked to discern the fair ladys lineaments for the chariot windows came flush with those of the beau on the broad plateau of the hill his coach door was opened he sat upright levelling his privileged stare at duchess susan until she blushed ay madam quoth he i am not the first la sir said she who are you the beau deliberately raised his hat and bowed he madam of whose approach the gentleman who took his leave of you on yonder elevation informed you she looked artlessly over her shoulder and at the beau alighting from his carriage a gentleman on horseback the duchess popped her head through the window on an impulse to measure the distance between the two hills never she cried why madam did he deliver no message to announce me said the beau ruffling goodness gracious you must be mr beamish she replied he laid his hat on his bosom and invited her to quit her carriage for a seat beside him she stipulated if you are really mr beamish he frowned and raised his head to convince her but she would not be impressed and he applied to chloe to establish his identity hearing chloes name the duchess called out oh there now thats enough for chloes my maid here and i know shes a lady born and were going to be friends hand me to chloe and you are chloe she said after a frank stride from step to step of the carriages and dont mind being my maid you do look a nice kind creature and i see youre a lady born i know in a minute youre dark im fair we shall suit and tell mehushwhat dreadful long eyes he has i shall ask you presently what you think of me i was never at the wells before dear me the coach has turned how far off shall we hear the bells to say im coming i know im to have bells mr beamish mr beamish i must have a chatter with a woman and im in awe of you sir that i am but men and men i see to talk to for a lift of my finger by the dozen in my dukes palacethough theyre old ones thats truebut a woman whos a lady and kind enough to be my maid i havent met yet since i had the right to wear a coronet there ill hold chloes hand and thatll do you would tell me at once chloe if i was not dressed to your taste now wouldnt you as for talkative thats a sign with me of my liking people i really dont know what to say to my duke sometimes i sit and think it so funny to be having a duke instead of a husband youre off the duchess laughed at chloes laughter chloe excused herself but was informed by her mistress that it was what she liked for the first two years she resumed i could hardly speak a syllable i stammered i reddened i longed to be up in my room brushing and curling my hair and was ready to curtsey to everybody now im quite at home for ive plenty of courageexcept about death and im worse about death than i was when i was a simple body with a gawks lawks in her round eyes and mouth for an egg i wonder why that is but isnt death horrible and skeletons the duchess shuddered it depends upon the skeleton said beau beamish who had joined the conversation yours madam i would rather not meet because she would precipitate me into transports of regret for the loss of the flesh i have however met mine own and had reason for satisfaction with the interview your own skeleton sir said the duchess wonderingly and appalled unmistakably mine i will call you to witness by an account of him duchess susan gaped and oh dont she cried out but added it s broad day and ive got some one to sleep anigh me after dark with which she smiled on chloe who promised her there was no matter for alarm i encountered my gentleman as i was proceeding to my room at night said the beau along a narrow corridor where it was imperative that one of us should yield the pas and i must confess it we are all so amazingly alike in our bones that i stood prepared to demand place of him for indubitably the fellow was an obstruction and at the first glance repulsive i took him for anybodys skeleton deaths ensign with his cachinnatory skull and the numbered ribs and the extraordinary splay feetin fact the whole ungainly and shaky hobbledehoy which man is built on and by whose image in his weaker moments he is haunted i had to be frank been dancing on a supper with certain of our choicest wits and beauties it is a recipe for conjuring apparitions now then thinks i my fine fellow i will bounce you and without a salutation i pressed forward madam i give you my word he behaved to the full pitch as i myself should have done under similar circumstances retiring upon an inclination of his structure he draws up and fetches me a bow of the exact middle nick between dignity and service i advance he withdraws and again the bow devoid of obsequiousness majestically condescending these thinks i be royal manners i could have taken him for the sable king in person stripped of his mantle on my soul he put me to the blush and is that all asked the duchess relieving herself with a sigh why madam quoth the beau do you not see that he could have been none other than mine own who could comport himself with that grand air and gracefulness when wounded by his closest relative upon his opening my door for me and accepting the pas which i now right heartily accorded him i recognized at once both him and the reproof he had designedly dealt meor the wine supper i had danced on perhaps i should say and i protest that by such a display of supreme good breeding he managed to convey the highest compliment ever received by man namely the assurance that after the withering away of this mortal garb i shall still be noted for urbanity and elegancy nay and more immortally without the slip i was guilty of when i carried the bag of wine duchess susan fanned herself to assist her digestion of the anecdote well its not so frightful a story and i know you are the great mr beamish she said he questioned her whether the gentleman had signalled him to her on the hill what can he mean about a gentleman she turned to chloe my duke told me you would meet me sir and you are to protect me and if anything happens it is to be your fault entirely said the beau i shall therefore maintain a vigilant guard except leaving me free oof ive been boxed up so long i declare chloe i feel like a best dress out for a holiday and a bit afraid of spoiling im a real child more than i was when my duke married me i seemed to go in and grow up again after i was raised to fortune and nobody to tell of it fancy that for you cant talk to old gentlemen about whats going on in your heart how of young gentlemen she was asked by the beau and she replied they find it out not if you do not assist them said he duchess susan let her eyelids and her underlie half drop as she looked at him with the simple shyness of one of natures thoughts in her head at peep on the pastures of the world the melting blue eyes and the cherry lip made an exceedingly quickening picture now i wonder if that is true she transferred her slyness to speech beware the middleaged he exclaimed she appealed to chloe and im sure theyre the nicest chloe agreed that they were the duchess measured chloe and the beau together with a mind swift in apprehending all that it hungered for she would have pursued the pleasing theme had she not been directed to gaze below upon the towers and roofs of the wells shining sleepily in a siesta of afternoon summer sunlight with a spread of her silken robe she touched the edifice of her hair murmuring to chloe i cant abide that powder you shall see me walk in a hoop i can ive done it to slow music till my duke clapped hands im nothing sitting to what i am on my feet thats because i havent got fine language yet i shall it seems to come last so there s the place and whereabouts do all the great people meet and prommy they promenade where you see the trees madam said chloe and where is it where the ladies sit and eat jam tarts with whipped cream on em while the gentlemen stand and pay compliments chloe said it was at a shop near the pump room duchess susan looked out over the housetops beyond the dusty hedges oh and that powder she cried i hate to be out of the fashion and a spectacle but i do love my own hair and i have such a lot and i like the colour and so does my duke only dont let me be fingered at if once i begin to blush before people my courage is gone my singing inside me is choked and ive a real lark going on in me all day long rain or sunshinehush all about love and amusement chloe smiled and duchess susan said just like a bird for i dont know what it is she looked for chloe to say that she did at the moment a pair of mounted squires rode up and the coach stopped while beau beamish gave orders for the church bells to be set ringing and the band to meet and precede his equipage at the head of the bath avenue in honour of the arrival of her grace the duchess of dewlap he delivered these words loudly to his men and turned an effulgent gaze upon the duchess so that for a minute she was fascinated and did not consult her hearing but presently she fell into an uneasiness the signs increased she bit her lip and after breathing short once or twice was it meaning me mr beamish she said you madam are the person whom we delight to honour he replied duchess of what she screwed uneasy features to hear duchess of dewlap said he its not my title sir it is your title on my territory madam she made her pretty nose and upper lip ugly with a sneer of dew and enter that town before all those people as duchess of oh no i wont i just wont call back those men now please now if you please pray mr beamish youll offend me sir im not going to be a mock youll offend my duke sir hed die rather than have my feelings hurt heres all my pleasure spoilt i wont and i shant enter the town as duchess of that stupid name so call em back call em back this instant i know who i am and what i am and i know whats due to me i do beau beamish rejoined i too chloe will tell you i am lord here then ill go home i will i wont be laughed at for a great lady ninny im a real lady of high rank and such ill appear what s a duchess of dewlap one might as well be duchess of cowstail duchess of mopsend and those people but i wont be that i wont be played with i see them staring no i can make up my mind and i beg you to call back your men or ill go back home she muttered be made fun ofmade a fool of your graces chariot is behind said the beau his despotic coolness provoked her to an outcry and weeping she repeated dewlap dewlap in sobs she shook her shoulders and hid her face you are proud of your title are you madam said he i am she came out of her hands to answer him proudly that i am she meant for a stronger affirmation then mark me he said impressively i am your dukes friend and you are under my charge here i am your guardian and you are my ward and you can enter the town only on the condition of obedience to me now mark me madam no one can rob you of your real name and title saving yourself but you are entering a place where you will encounter a thousand temptations to tarnish and haply forfeit it be warned do nothing that will then im to have my own title said she clearing up for the month of your visit you are duchess of dewlap i say i shant you shall never sir i command it she flung herself forward with a wail upon chloes bosom cant you do something for me she whimpered it is impossible to move mr beamish chloe said out of a pause composed of sobs and sighs the duchess let loose in a broken voice then i m sure i thinki think id rather have methave met his skeleton her sincerity was equal to wit beau beamish shouted he cordially applauded her and in the genuine kindness of an admiration that surprised him he permitted himself the liberty of taking and saluting her fingers she fancied there was another chance for her but he frowned at the mention of it upon these proceedings the exhilarating sound of the band was heard simultaneously a festival peal of bells burst forth and an admonishment of the necessity for concealing her chagrin and exhibiting both station and a countenance to the people combined with the excitement of the new scenes and the marching music to banish the acuter sense of disappointment from duchess susans mind so she very soon held herself erect and wore a face open to every wonder impressionable as the blue lakesurface crisped here and there by fitful breezes against a level sun chapter iv it was an axiom with mr beamish our first if not our only philosophical beau and a gentleman of some thoughtfulness that the social english require tyrannical government as much as the political are able to dispense with it and this he explained by an exposition of the character of a race possessed of the eminent virtue of individual selfassertion which causes them to insist on good elbowroom wherever they gather together society however not being tolerable where the smoothness of intercourse is disturbed by a perpetual punching of sides the merits of the free citizen in them become their demerits when a fraternal circle is established and they who have shown an example of civilization too notable in one sphere to call for eulogy are often to be seen elbowing on the ragged edge of barbarism in the other they must therefore be reduced to accept laws not of their own making and of an extreme rigidity here too is a further peril for the gallant spirits distinguishing them in the state of independence may he foresaw the melancholy experience of a later age abandon them utterly in subjection and the glorious boisterousness befitting the village green forsake them even in their haunts of liberal association should they once be thoroughly tamed by authority our merrie england will then be longfaced england an england of fallen chaps like a boars head bearing for speech a lemon in the mouth good to feast on mayhap not with mr beamish would actually seem to have foreseen the danger of a transition that he could watch over only in his time and as he said i go as i came on a flash he had neither ancestry nor descendants he was a genius he knew himself a solitary therefore in spite of his efforts to create his like within his district he did effect something enough to give him fame as one of the princely fathers of our domestic civilization though we now appear to have lost by it more than formerly we gained the chasing of the natural is ever fraught with dubious hazards if it gallops back according to the proverb it will do so at the charge commonly it gallops off quite off and then for any kind of animation our precarious dependence is upon brains we have to live on our wits which are ordinarily less productive than land and cannot be remitted in entail rightly or wrongly there are differences of opinion about it mr beamish repressed the chthonic natural with a rod of iron beneath his rule the hoyden and the bumpkin had no peace until they had given public imitations of the lady and the gentleman nor were the lady and the gentleman privileged to be what he called free flags he could be charitable to the passion but he bellowed the very word itself hauled up smoking from the brimstone lake against them that pretended to be shamelessly guilty of the peccadilloes of gallantry his famous accost of a lady threatening to sink and already performing like a vessel in that situation so madam i hear you are preparing to enrol yourself in the very ancient order he named it was a piece of insolence that involved him in some discord with the ladys husband and the rascal steward as he chose to term the third party in these affairs yet it is reputed to have saved the lady furthermore he attacked the vulgarity of persons of quality and he has told a fashionable dame who was indulging herself in a marked sneer of disdain not improving to her features that he would be pleased to have her assurance it was her face she presented to mankind a thingthanks perhaps to him chieflyno longer possible of utterance one of the sex asking him why he addressed his persecutions particularly to women because i fight your battles says he and i find you in the ranks of the enemy he treated them as traitors he was nevertheless well supported by a sex that compensates for dislike of its friend before a certain age by a cordial recognition of him when it has touched the period a phalanx of great dames gave him the terrors of olympus for all except the natively audacious the truculent and the insufferably obtuse and from the midst of them he launched decree and bolt to good effect not of course without receiving return missiles and not without subsequent question whether the work of that man was beneficial to the country who indeed tamed the bumpkin squire and his brood but at the cost of their animal spirits and their gift of speech viz by making petrifactions of them in the surgical operation of tracheotomy a successful treatment of the patient hangs we believe on the promptness and skill of the introduction of the artificial windpipe and it may be that our unhappy countrymen when cut off from the source of their breath were not neatly handled or else that there is a physical opposition in them to anything artificial and it must be nature or nothing the dispute shall be left where it stands now to venture upon parading a beautiful young duchess of dewlap with an odour of the shepherdess about her notwithstanding her acquired art of stepping conformably in a hoop and to demand full homage of respect for a lady bearing such a title who had the intoxicating attractions of the ruddy orchard apple on the tree next the roadside wall when the owner is absent was bold in mr beamish passing temerity nor would even he have attempted it had he not been assured of the support of his phalanx of great ladies they indeed after being taken into the secret had stipulated that first they must have an inspection of the transformed dairymaid and the review was not unfavourable duchess susan came out of it more scatheless than her duke she was tonguetied and her tutored walking and really admirable stature helped her to appease the critics of her sex by whom her too readily blushful innocence was praised with a reserve expressed in the remark that she was a monstrous fine toy for a dukes second childhood and should never have been let fly from his nursery her milliner was approved the duke was a notorious connoisseur of female charms and would see of course to the decorous adornment of her person by the best of modistes her smiling was pretty her eyes were soft she might turn out good if well guarded for a time but these merits of the woman are not those of the great lady and her title was too strong a beam on her character to give it a fair chance with her critics they one and all recommended powder for her hair and cheeks that odour of the shepherdess could be exorcised by no other means they declared her blushing was indecent truly the critics of the foeman sex behaved in a way to cause the blushes to swarm rosy as the troops of young loves round cytherea in her seabirth when some soaring and sinking some they flutter like her loosened zone and breast the air thick as flower petals on the summers breath weaving her net for the world duchess susan might protest her inability to keep her blushes down that the wrong was done by the insolent eyes and not by her artless cheeks ay but nature if we are to tame these men must be swathed and concealed partly stifled absolutely stifled upon occasion the natural woman does not move a foot without striking earth to conjure up the horrid apparition of the natural man who is not as she but a cannibal savage to be the light which leads it is her business to don the misty vesture of an idea that she may dwell as an idea in mens minds very dim very powerful but abstruse unseizable much wisdom was imparted to her on the subject and she understood a little and echoed hollow to the remainder willing to show entire docility as far as her intelligence consented to be awake she was in that stage of the dainty faintly tinged innocence of the amorousness of themselves when beautiful young women who have not been caught for schooling in infancy deem it a defilement to be made to appear other than the blessed nature has made them which has made them beautiful and surely therefore deserves to be worshipped the lectures of the great ladies and chloes counsels failed to persuade her to use the powder puffball perhaps too as timidity quitted her she enjoyed her distinctiveness in their midst but the distinctiveness of a duchess of dewlap with the hair and cheeks of our native fields was fraught with troubles outrunning mr beamishs calculations he had perceived that she would be attractive he had not reckoned on the homogeneousness of her particular english charms a beauty in red white and blue is our goddess venus with the apple of paris in her hand and after two visits to the pump room and one promenade in the walks about the assembly house she had as completely divided the ordinary guests of the wells into male and female in opinion as her mother nature had done in it sex and the men would not be silenced they had gazed on their divinest and it was for the women to succumb to that unwholesome state so full of thunder knights and squires military and rural threw up their allegiance right and left to devote themselves to this robust new vision and in their peculiar manner with a general viewhalloo and yoicks tallyho and away we go pelt ahead unexampled as it is in england for beauty to kindle the ardours of the scent of the fox duchess susan did moreshe turned all her followers into hounds they were madmen within a very few days of her entrance bets raged about her and there were brawls jolly flings at her character in the form of lusty encomium givings of the lie and upon one occasion a knockdown blow in public as though the place had never known the polishing touch of mr beamish he was thrown into great perplexity by that blow discountenancing the duel as much as he could an affair of the sword was nevertheless more tolerable than the brutal fist and of all men to be guilty of it who would have anticipated the young alonzo chloes quiet modest lover he it was the case came before mr beamish for his decision he had to pronounce an impartial judgement and for some time during the examination of evidence he suffered as he assures us in his memoirs a royal agony to have to strike with the glaive of justice them whom they most esteem is the greatest affliction known to kings he would have done it he deserved to reign happily the evidence against the gentleman who was tumbled mr ralph shepster excused mr augustus camwell otherwise alonzo for dealing with him promptly to shut his mouth this shepster a raw young squire reeking beau beamish writes of him one half of the soil and t other half of the town had involved chloe in his familiar remarks upon the duchess of dewlap and the personal respect entertained by mr beamish for chloe so strongly approved alonzos championship of her that in giving judgement he laid stress on young alonzos passion for chloe to prove at once the disinterestedness of the assailant and the judicial nature of the sentence which was that mr ralph shepster should undergo banishment and had the right to demand reparation the latter part of this decree assisted in effecting the execution of the former shepster declined cold steel calling it murder and was effusive of natures logic on the subject because a man comes and knocks me down im to go up to him and ask him to run me through his shake of the head signified that he was not such a noodle voluble and prolific of illustration as is no one so much as a son of nature inspired to speak her words of wisdom he defied the mandate and refused himself satisfaction until in the strangest manner possible flights of white feathers beset him and he became a mark for persecution too trying for the friendship of his friends he fled repeating his tale that he had seen beamishs duchess and chloe attending her at an assignation in the south grove where a gentleman unknown to the wells presented himself to the adventurous ladies and they walked togethera tale ending with nods shepsters banishment was one of those victories of justice upon which mankind might be congratulated if they left no commotion behind but as when a boy has been horsed before his comrades dread may visit them yet is there likewise devilry in the school and everywhere over earth a summary punishment that does not sweep the place clear is likely to infect whom it leaves remaining the great lawgivers lycurgus draco solon beamish sorrowfully acknowledge that they have had recourse to infernal agents after they have thus purified their circle of an offender doctors confess to the same of their physic the expelling agency has next to be expelled and it is a subtle poison affecting our spirits duchess susan had now the incense of a victim to heighten her charms like the treasureladen spanish galleon for whom on her voyage home from south american waters our enterprising lightcraft privateers lay in wait she had the double attraction of being desirable and an enemy to watch above her conscientiously was a harassing business mr beamish sent for chloe and she came to him at once her look was curious he studied it while they conversed so looks one who is watching the sure flight of an arrow or the happy combinations of an intrigue saying i am no inquisitor child he ventured upon two or three modest inquisitions with regard to her mistress the title he had disguised duchess susan in he confessed to rueing as the principal cause of the agitation of his principality she is courted he said less like a citadel waving a flag than a hostelry where the demand is for sitting room and a tankard these be our manners yet i must own a duchess of dewlap is a provocation and my exclusive desire to protect the name of my lord stands corrected by the perils environing his lady she is other than i supposed her she is we will hope an excellent good creature but too attractive for most and drawbridge and the customary defences to be neglected chloe met his interrogatory with a ready report of the young duchesss innocence and good nature that pacified mr beamish and you said he she smiled for answer that smile was not the common smile it was one of an eager exultingness producing as he gazed the twitch of an inquisitive reflection of it on his lips such a smile bids us guess and quickens us to guess warns us we burn and speeds our burning and so like an angel wafting us to some heavenfeasting promontory lifts us out of ourselves to see in the universe of colour what the mouth has but pallid speech to tell that is the very hearts language the years are in a look as mount and vale of the dark land spring up in lightning he checked himself he scarce dared to say it she nodded you have seen the man chloe her smiling broke up in the hard lines of an ecstasy neighbouring pain he has come he is here he is faithful he has not forgotten me i was right i knew i knew caseldy has come he has come do not ask to have him to see him mr beamish he is here at last cruel well caseldy has come then but now friend chloe you should be made aware that the man she stopped her ears as she did so mr beamish observed a thick silken skein dangling from one hand part of it was plaited and at the upper end there was a knot it resembled the commencement of her manufactory of a whip she swayed it to and fro allowing him to catch and lift the threads on his fingers for the purpose of examining her work there was no special compliment to pay so he dropped it without remark their faces had expressed her wish to hear nothing from him of caseldy and his submission to say nothing her happiness was too big she appeared to beg to lie down with it on her bosom in the manner of an outworn young mother who has now first received her infant in her arms from the nurse chapter v humouring chloe with his usual considerateness mr beamish forbore to cast a shadow on her newborn joy and even within himself to doubt the security of its foundation caseldys return to the wells was at least some assurance of his constancy seeing that here they appointed to meet when he and chloe last parted all might be well though it was unexplained why he had not presented himself earlier to the lightest inquiry chloes reply was a shiver of happiness moreover mr beamish calculated that caseldy would be a serviceable ally in commanding a proper respect for her grace the duchess of dewlap so he betook himself cheerfully to caseldys lodgings to deliver a message of welcome meeting on his way thither mr augustus camwell with whom he had a short conversation greatly to his admiration of the enamoured young gentlemans goodness and selfcompression in speaking of caseldy and chloes better fortune mr camwell seemed hurried caseldy was not at home and mr beamish proceeded to the lodgings of the duchess chloe had found her absent the two consulted mr beamish put on a serious air until chloe mentioned the pastrycooks shop for duchess susan had a sweet tooth she loved a visit to the pastrycooks whose jam tarts were dearer to her than his more famous hot mutton pies the pastry cook informed mr beamish that her grace had been in his shop earlier than usual as it happened and accompanied by a foreignlooking gentleman wearing moustachois her grace the pastrycook said had partaken of several tarts in common with the gentleman who complimented him upon his excelling the continental confectioner mr beamish glanced at chloe he pursued his researches down at the pump room while she looked round the ladies coffee house encountering again they walked back to the duchesss lodgings where a band stood playing in the road by order of her grace but the duchess was away and had not been seen since her mornings departure what sort of character would you give mistress susan of dewlap from your personal acquaintance with it said mr beamish to chloe as they stepped from the door chloe mused and said i would add good to the unkindest comparison you could find for her but accepting the comparison mr beamish nodded and revolved upon the circumstance of their being very much in natures hands with duchess susan of whom it might be said that her character was good yet all the more alive to the temptations besetting the spring season he allied chloes adjective to a number of epithets equally applicable to nature and to women according to current ideas concluding count they call your caseldy at his lodgings the count he is out for an airing he is counted out ah you will make him drop that count when he takes you from here do not speak of the time beyond the month said chloe so urgently on a rapid breath as to cause mr beamish to cast an inquiring look at her she answered it is not one month of brightness as much as we can ask for the beau clapped his elbows complacently to his sides in philosophical concord with her sentiment in the afternoon on the parade they were joined by mr camwell among groups of fashionable ladies and their escorts pacing serenely by medical prescription for an appetite as he did not comment on the absence of the duchess mr beamish alluded to it whereupon he was informed that she was about the meadows and had been there for some hours not unguarded he replied to mr beamish aha quoth the latter we have an argus and as the duchess was not on the heights and the suns rays were mild in cloud he agreed to his young friends proposal that they should advance to meet her chloe walked with them but her face was disdainful at the stiles she gave her hand to mr beamish she did not address a word to mr camwell and he knew the reason nevertheless he maintained his air of soldierly resignation to the performance of duty and held his head like a gentleman unable to conceive the ignominy of having played spy chloe shrank from him duchess susan was distinguished coming across a broad uncut meadow tirralirraing beneath a lark caseldy in attendance on her she stopped short and spoke to him then came forward crying ingenuously oh mr beamish isnt this just what you wanted me to do no madam said he you had my injunctions to the contrary la she exclaimed i thought i was to run about in the fields now and then to preserve my simplicity i know i was told so and who told me mr beamish bowed effusively to the introduction of caseldy whose fingers he touched in sign of the renewal of acquaintance and with a laugh addressed the duchess madam you remind me of a tale of my infancy i had a juvenile comrade of the tenderest age by name tommy plumston and he enjoyed the privilege of intimacy with a component urchin yclept jimmy clungeon with which adventurous roamer in defiance of his mothers interdict against his leaving the house for a minute during her absence from home he departed on a tour of the district resulting perhaps as a consequence of its completeness in this that at a distance computed at four miles from the maternal mansion he perceived his beloved mama with sufficient clearness to feel sure that she likewise had seen him tommy consulted with jimmy and then he sprang forward on a run to his frowning mama and delivered himself in these artless words which i repeat as they were uttered to give you the flavour of the innocent babe he said i frink i frought i hear you call me ma and jimmy clungeon he frought he frink so too so you see the pair of them were under the impression that they were doing right there is a delicate distinction in the tenses of each frinking where the other frought enough in itself to stamp sincerity upon the statement caseldy said the veracity of a boy possessing a friend named clungeon is beyond contest duchess susan opened her eyes four miles from home and what did his mother do to him tommys mama said mr beamish and with the resplendent licence of the period which continued still upon tolerable terms with nature under the compromise of decorous ohfie flatly declared the thing she did i fancy sir that i caught sight of your figure on the hill yonder about an hour or so earlier said caseldy to mr camwell if it was at the time when you were issuing from that wood sir your surmise is correct said the young gentleman you are longsighted sir i am sir and so am i and i said chloe our chloe will distinguish you accurately at a mile and has done it observed mr beamish one guesses tiptoe on a suspicion and if one is wrong it passes and if one is right it is a miracle she said and raised her voice on a song to quit the subject ay ay chloe so then you had a suspicion you rogue the day we had the pleasure of meeting the duchess had you mr beamish persisted duchess susan interposed such a pretty song and you to stop her sir caseldy took up the air oh you two together she cried i do love hearing music in the fields it is heavenly bands in the town and voices in the green fields i say couldnt you join chloe mr count sir before we come among the people here where it s all so nice and still music and my heart does begin so to pitapat do you sing mr alonzo poorly the young gentleman replied but the count can sing and chloes a real angel when she sings and wont you dear she implored chloe to whom caseldy addressed a prelude with a bow and a flourish of the hand chloes voice flew forth caseldys rich masculine matched it the song was gay he snapped his finger at intervals in foreign style singing bigchested with full notes and a fine abandonment and the quickest susceptibility to his fair companions cunning modulations and an eye for duchess susans rapture mr beamish and mr camwell applauded them i never can tell what to say when im brimming the duchess let fall a sigh and he can play the flute mr beamish he promised me he would go into the orchestra and play a bit at one of your nice evening delicious concerts and that will be niceoh he promised you madam did he so said the beau was it on your way to the wells that he promised you on my way to the wells she exclaimed softly why how could anybody promise me a thing before ever he saw me i call that a strange thing to ask a person no today while we were promenading and i should hear him sing he said he does admire his chloe so why no wonder is it now she can do everything knit sew sing danceand talk shes never uneasy for a word she makes whole scenes of things go round you like a picture peepshow i tell her and always cheerful she hasnt a minute of grumps and im sometimes a dish of stale milk fit only for pigs with your late hours here im sure i want tickling in the morning and chloe carols me one of her songs and i say theres my bird mr beamish added and you will remember she has a heart i should think so said the duchess a heart madam why what else nothing other the beau by his aspect was constrained to admit he appeared puzzled by this daughter of nature in a coronet and more on her remarking you know about her heart mr beamish he acquiesced for of course he knew of her lifelong devotion to caseldy but there was archness in her tone however he did not expect a woman of her education to have the tone perfectly concordant with the circumstances speaking tentatively of caseldys handsome face and figure he was pleased to hear the duchess say so i tell chloe well said he we must consider them united they are one duchess susan replied thats what i tell him she will do anything you wish he repeated these words with an interjection and decided in his mind that they were merely silly she was a real shepherdess by birth and nature requiring a strong guard over her attractions on account of her simplicity such was his reading of the problem he had conceived it at the first sight of her and always recurred to it under the influence of her artless eyes though his theories upon men and women were astute and that cavalier perceived by longsighted chloe at duchess susans coach window perturbed him at whiles habitually to be anticipating the simpleton in a particular person is the sure way of being sometimes the dupe as he would not have been the last to warn a neophyte but abstract wisdom is in need of an unappeased suspicion of much keenness of edge if we would have it alive to cope with artless eyes and our prepossessed fancy of their artlessness you talk of chloe to him he said she answered yes that i do and he does love her i like to hear him he is one of the gentlemen who dont make me feel timid with them she received a short lecture on the virtues of timidity in preserving the sex from danger after which considering that the lady who does not feel timid with a particular cavalier has had no sentiment awakened he relinquished his place to mr camwell and proceeded to administer the probe to caseldy that gentleman was communicatively candid chloe had left him and he related how summoned home to england and compelled to settle a dispute threatening a lawsuit he had regretfully to abstain from visiting the wells for a season not because of any fear of the attractions of playhe had subdued the frailty of the desire to playbut because he deemed it due to his chloe to bring her an untroubled face and he wished first to be the better of the serious annoyances besetting him for some similar reason he had not written he wished to feast on her surprise and i had my reward he said as if he had been the person principally to suffer through that abstinence i foundi may say it to you mr beamish love in her eyes divine by nature she is one of the immortals both in appearance and in steadfastness they referred to duchess susan caseldy reluctantly owned that it would be an unkindness to remove chloe from attendance on her during the short remaining term of her stay at the wells and so he had not proposed it he said for the duchess was a child an innocent not stupid by any means but of course her transplanting from an inferior to an exalted position put her under disadvantages mr beamish spoke of the difficulties of his post as guardian and also of the strange cavalier seen at her carriage window by chloe caseldy smiled and said if there was oneand chloe is rather longsightedwe can hardly expect her to confess it why not sir if she be this piece of innocence mr beamish was led to inquire she fears you sir caseldy answered you have inspired her with an extraordinary fear of you i have said the beau it had been his endeavour to inspire it and he swelled somewhat rather with relief at the thought of his possessing a power to control his delicate charge than with our vanity yet would it be audacious to say that there was not a dose of the latter he was a very human man and he had as we have seen his ideas of the effect of the impression of fear upon the hearts of women something in any case caused him to forget the cavalier they were drawn to the three preceding them by a lively dissension between chloe and mr camwell duchess susan explained it in her blunt style she wants him to go away home and he says he will if shell give him that double skein of silk she swings about and she says she wont let him ask as long as he pleases so he says he shant go and im sure i dont see why he should and she says he may stay but he shant have her necklace she calls it so mr camwell snatches and chloe fires up gracious cant she frownat him she never frowns at anybody but him caseldy attempted persuasion on mr camwells behalf with his mouth at chloes ear he said give it let the poor fellow have his memento despatch him with it i can hear and that is really kind exclaimed duchess susan rather a missymissy schoolgirl sort of necklace mr beamish observed but he might have it without the dismissal for i cannot consent to lose alonzo no madam he nodded at the duchess caseldy continued his whisper you cant think of wearing a thing like that about your neck indeed said chloe i think of it why what fashion have you over here it is not yet a fashion she said a silken circlet will not well become any precious pendant that i know of a bag of dust is not a very precious pendant she said oh a memento mori cried he and she answered yes he rallied her for her superstition pursuing surely my love tis a cheap riddance of a pestilent intrusive jaloux whip it into his hands for a mittimus does his presence distress you she asked i will own that to be always having the fellow dogging us with his dejected leer is not agreeable he watches us now because my lips are close by your cheek he should be absent he is one too many speed him on his voyage with the souvenir he asks for i keep it for a journey of my own which i may have to take said chloe with me you will follow you cannot help following me caseldy he speculated on her front she was tenderly smiling you are happy chloe i have never known such happiness she said the brilliancy of her eyes confirmed it he glanced over at duchess susan who was like a sunflower in the sun his glance lingered a moment her abundant and glowing young charms were the richest fascination an eye like his could dwell on that is right said he we will be perfectly happy till the month ends and after it but get us rid of monsieur le jeune toss him that trifle i spare him that twill be bliss to him at the cost of a bit of silk thread to us besides if we keep him to cure him of his passion here might it not bethese boys veer suddenly like the winds of albion from one fair object to t otherat the cost of the precious and simple lady you are guarding i merely hint these two affect one another as though it could be she speaks of him it shall be as you please but a trifle like that my chloe to be rid of a green eye you much wish him gone she said he shrugged the fellow is in our way you think him a little perilous for my innocent lady candidly i do she stretched the halfplaited silken rope in her two hands to try the strength of it made a second knot and consigned it to her pocket at once she wore her liveliest playfellow air in which character no one was so enchanting as chloe could be for she became the comrade of men without forfeit of her station among sage sweet ladies and was like a wellmannered sparkling boy to whom his admiring seniors have given the lead in sallies whims and fights but pleasanter than a boy the soft hues of her sex toned her frolic spirit she seemed her sexs deputy to tell the coarser where they could meet as on a bridge above the torrent separating them gaily for interchange of the best of either unfired and untempted by fire yet with all the elements which make fire burn to animate their hearts lucky the man who wins for himself that lifelong cordial mr beamish said to duchess susan she had small comprehension of metaphorical phrases but she was quick at reading faces and comparing the enthusiasm on the face of the beau with caseldys look of troubled wonderment and regret she pitied the lover conscious of not having the larger share of his mistresss affections when presently he looked at her the tenderhearted woman could have cried for very compassion so sensible did he show himself of chloes preference of the other chapter vi that evening duchess susan played at the pharaoh table and lost eight hundred pounds through desperation at the loss of twenty after encouraging her to proceed to this extremity caseldy checked her he was conducting her out of the play room when a couple of young squires of the shepster order and primed with wine intercepted her to present their condolences which they performed with exaggerated gestures intended for broad mimicry of the courtliness imported from the continent and a very dulcet harping on the popular variations of her christian name not forgetting her singular title my lovely lovely dewlap she was excited and stunned by her immediate experience in the transfer of money and she said i m sure i dont know what you want yes cried they striking their bosoms as guitars and attempting the posture of the thrummer on the instrument she knows she does know handsome susie knows what we want and one ejaculated mellifluously oh and the other ah in flagrant derision of the foreign ways they produced in boorish burlesquea selfconsolatory and a common trick of the boor caseldy was behind he pushed forward and bowed to them sirs will you mention to me what you want he said it with a look that meant steel it cooled them sufficiently to let him place the duchess under the protectorship of mr beamish then entering from another room with chloe whereupon the pair of rustic bucks retired to reinvigorate their valiant blood mr beamish had seen that there was cause for gratitude to caseldy to whom he said she has lost and he seemed satisfied on hearing the amount of the loss and commissioned caseldy to escort the ladies to their lodgings at once observing adieu count you will find my foreign title of use to you here after a bout or two was the reply no bouts if possibly to be avoided though i perceive how the flavour of your countship may spread a wholesome alarm among our rurals who will readily have at you with fists but relish not the tricky cold weapon mr beamish haughtily bowed the duchess away caseldy seized the opportunity while handing her into her sedan to say we will try the fortuneteller for a lucky day to have our revenge she answered oh dont talk to me about playing again ever im nigh on a clean pocket and never knew such a sinful place as this i feel ive tumbled into a ditch and theres mr beamish all top when he bows to me youre keeping chloe waiting sir where was she while we were at the table sure she was with mr beamish ah he groaned the poor soul is in despair over her losses tonight he turned from the boxedup duchess to remark to chloe give her a comfortable cry and a few moral maxims i will she said you love me caseldy love you i your own what assurance would you have none dear friend here was a woman easily deceived in the hearts of certain men owing to an intellectual contempt of easy dupes compunction in deceiving is diminished by the lightness of their task and that soft confidence which will often if but passingly bid betrayers reconsider the charms of the fair soul they are abandoning commends these armoured knights to pursue with redoubled earnest the fruitful ways of treachery their feelings are warm for their prey moreover and choosing to judge their victim by the present warmth of their feelings they can at will be hurt even to being scandalized by a coldness that does not waken one suspicion of them jealousy would have a chance of arresting for it is not impossible to tease them back to avowed allegiance but sheer indifference also has a stronger hold on them than a dull blind trustfulness they hate the burden it imposes the blind aspect is only touching enough to remind them of the burden and they hate if for that and for the enormous presumption of the belief that they are everlastingly bound to such an imbecile she walks about with her eyes shut expecting not to stumble and when she does am i to blame the injured man asks it in the course of his reasoning he recurs to his victims merits but only compassionately and the compassion is chilled by the thought that she may in the end start across his path to thwart him thereat he is drawn to think of the prize she may rob him of and when one woman is an obstacle the other shines desirable as life beyond death he must have her he sees her in the hue of his desire for her and the obstacle in that of his repulsion cruelty is no more than the mans effort to win the wished object she should not leave it to his imagination to conceive that in the end the blind may awaken to thwart him better for her to cast him hence or let him know that she will do battle to keep him but the pride of a love that has hardened in the faithfulness of love cannot always be wise on trial caseldy walked considerably in the rear of the couple of chairs he saw on his way what was coming his two young squires were posted at duchess susans door when she arrived and he received a blow from one of them in clearing a way for her she plucked at his hand have they hurt you she asked think of me tonight thanking them and heaven for this my darling he replied with a pressure that lit the flying moment to kindle the after hours chloe had taken help of one of her bearers to jump out she stretched a finger at the unruly intruders crying sternly there is blood on youcome not nigh me the loftiest harangue would not have been so cunning to touch their wits they stared at one another in the clear moonlight which of them had blood on him as they had not been for blood but for rough fun and something to boast of next day they gesticulated according to the first instructions of the dancing master by way of gallantry and were out of caseldys path when he placed himself at his liege ladys service take no notice of them dear she said no no said he and what is it and his hoarse accent and shaking clasp of her arm sickened her to the sensation of approaching death upstairs duchess susan made a show of embracing her both were trembling the duchess ascribed her condition to those dreadful men what makes them be at me so she said and chloe said because you are beautiful am i you are i am very beautiful young and beautiful beautiful in the bud you will learn to excuse them madam but chloe the duchess shut her mouth out of a languid reverie she sighed i suppose i must be my dukeoh dont talk of him dear man hes in bed and fast asleep long before this i wonder how he came to let me come here i did bother him i know am i very very beautiful chloe so that men cant help themselves very madam there goodnight i want to be in bed and i cant kiss you because you keep calling me madam and freeze me to icicles but i do love you chloe i am sure you do im quite certain i do i know i never mean harm but how are we women expected to behave then oh im unhappy i am you must abstain from playing its that ive lost my moneyi forgot and i shall have to confess it to my duke though he warned me old men hold their fingers upso one finger and you never forget the sight of it never its a round finger like the handle of a jug and wont point at you when theyre lecturing and the skins like an old coat on gaffers shouldersor chloe just like when you look at the nail a rumpled counterpane up to the face of a corpse i declare its just like i feel as if i didnt a bit mind talking of corpses tonight and my moneys gone and i dont much mind im a wild girl again handsomer than when thathe is a dear kind good old nobleman with his funny old finger susan susan im no worse than others everybody plays here everybody superior why you have played chloe never ive heard you say you played once and a bigger stake it was you said than anybody ever did play not money what then my life goodnessyes i understand i understand everything tonightmen too so you didtheyre not so shamefully wicked chloe because i cant see the wrong of human natureif were discreet i mean now and then a country dance and a game and home to bed and dreams theres no harm in that i vow and thats why you stayed at this place you like it chloe i am used to it but when youre married to count caseldy youll go yes then she uttered it so joylessly that duchess susan added with intense affectionateness youre not obliged to marry him dear chloe nor he me madam the duchess caught at her impulsively to kiss her and said she would undress herself as she wished to be alone from that night she was a creature inflamed chapter vii the total disappearance of the pair of heroes who had been the latest in the conspiracy to vex his delicate charge gave mr beamish a high opinion of caseldy as an assistant in such an office as he held they had gone and nothing more was heard of them caseldy confined his observations on the subject to the remark that he had employed the best means to be rid of that kind of worthies and whether their souls had fled or only their bodies was unknown but the duchess had quiet promenades with caseldy to guard her while mr beamish counted the remaining days of her visit with the impatience of a man having cause to cast eye on a clock for duchess susan was not very manageable now she had fits of insurgency and plainly said that her time was short and she meant to do as she liked go where she liked play when she liked and be an independent womanif she was so soon to be taken away and boxed in a castle that was only a bigger sedan caseldy protested he was as helpless as the beau he described the annoyance of his incessant running about at her heels in all directions amusingly and suggested that she must be beating the district to recover her strange cavalier of whom or of one that had ridden beside her carriage half a day on her journey to the wells he said she had dropped a sort of hint he complained of the impossibility of his getting an hour in privacy with his chloe and i accustomed to consult with her see too little of her said mr beamish i shall presently be seeing nothing and already i am sensible of my loss he represented his case to duchess susanthat she was for ever driving out long distances and taking chloe from him when his occupation precluded his accompanying them and as chloe soon was to be lost to him for good he deeply felt her absence the duchess flung him enigmatical rejoinders you can change all that mr beamish if you like and you know you can oh yes you can but you like being a butterfly and when youve made ladies pale youre happy and there theyre to stick and wither for you neverive that pride i may be worried but ill never sink to green and melancholy for a man she bridled at herself in a mirror wherein not a sign of paleness was reflected mr beamish meditated and he thought it prudent to speak to caseldy manfully of her childish suspicions lest she should perchance in like manner perturb the lovers mind oh make your mind easy my dear sir as far as i am concerned said caseldy but to tell you the truth i think i can interpret her creamy ladyships innuendos a little differently and quite as clearly for my part i prefer the pale to the blowsy and i stake my right hand on chloes fidelity whatever harm i may have the senseless crueltymisfortune i may rather call itto do that heavenlyminded woman in our days to come none shall say of me that i was ever for an instant guilty of the baseness of doubting her purity and constancy and sir i will add that i could perfectly rely also on your honour mr beamish bowed you do but do me justice but say what interpretation she began by fearing you said caseldy creating a stare that was followed by a frown she fancies you neglect her perhaps she has a womans suspicion that you do it to try her mr beamish frenetically cited his many occupations how can i be ever dancing attendance on her then he said pooh and tenderly fingered the ruffles of his wrist tush tush said he no no though if it came to a struggle between us i might in the interests of my old friend her lord whom i have reasons for esteeming interpose an influence that would make the exercise of my authority agreeable hitherto i have seen no actual need of it and i watch keenly her eye has been on colonel poltermore once or twice his on her the woman is a rose in june sir and i forgive the whole world for lookingand for longing too but i have observed nothing serious he is of our party to the beaconhead tomorrow said caseldy she insisted that she would have him and at least it will grant me furlough for an hour do me the service to report to me said mr beamish in this fashion he engaged caseldy to supply him with inventions and prepared himself to swallow them it was poltermore and poltermore the colonel here the colonel there until the chase grew so hot that mr beamish could no longer listen to young mr camwells fatiguing drone upon his one theme of the doubledealing of chloes betrothed he became of her way of thinking and treated the young gentleman almost as coldly as she in time he was ready to guess of his own acuteness that the strange cavalier could have been no other than colonel poltermore when caseldy hinted it mr beamish said i have marked him he added in highly selfsatisfied style with all your foreign training my friend you will learn that we english are not so far behind you in the art of unravelling an intrigue in the dark to which caseldy replied that the continental world had little to teach mr beamish poor colonel poltermore as he came to be called was clearly a victim of the sudden affability of duchess susan the transformation of a stiff military officer into a nimble puck a runner of errands and a sprightly attendant could not pass without notice the first effect of her discriminating condescension on this unfortunate gentleman was to make him the champion of her claims to breeding she had it by nature she was natures great lady he would protest to the noble dames of the circle he moved in and they admitted that she was different in every way from a bourgeoise elevated by marriage to lofty rank she was not vulgar but they remained doubtful of the perfect simplicity of a young woman who worked such changes in men as to render one of the famous conquerors of the day her agitated humble servant by rapid degrees the colonel had fallen to that when not by her side he was ever marching with sharp strides hurrying through rooms and down alleys and groves until he had discovered and attached himself to her skirts and curiously the object of his jealousy was the devoted alonzo mr beamish laughed when he heard of it the ladys excitement and giddy mien however accused poltermore of a stage of success requiring to be combated immediately there was mention of duchess susans mighty wish to pay a visit to the popular fortuneteller of the hut on the heath and mr beamish put his veto on the expedition she had obeyed him by abstaining from play of late so he fully expected that his interdict would be obeyed and besides the fortuneteller was a rogue of a sham astrologer known to have foretold to certain tender ladies things they were only too desirous to imagine predestined by an extraordinary indication of the course of planets through the zodiac thus causing them to sin by the example of celestial conjunctionsa piece of wanton impiety the beau took high ground in his objections to the adventure nevertheless duchess susan did go she drove to the heath at an early hour of the morning attended by chloe colonel poltermore and caseldy they subsequently breakfasted at an inn where gipsy repasts were occasionally served to the fashion and they were back at the wells as soon as the world was abroad their surprise then was prodigious when mr beamish accosting them full in assembly inquired whether they were satisfied with the report of their fortunes and yet more when he positively proved himself acquainted with the fortunes which had been recounted to each of them in privacy you colonel poltermore are to be in lucks way up to the tenth milestonewhere your chariot will overset and you will be lamed for life not quite so bad said the colonel cheerfully he having been informed of much better and you count caseldy are to have it all your own way with good luck after committing a deed of slaughter with the solitary penalty of undergoing a visit every night from the corpse ghost caseldy smilingly corrected him and chloe would not have her fortune told because she knew it mr beamish cast a paternal glance at her and you madam he bent his brows on the duchess received the communication that all for love will sink you as it raised you put you down as it took you up furnish the feast to the raven gentleman which belongs of right to the golden eagle nothing of the sort and i dont believe in any of their stories cried the duchess with a burning face you deny it madam i do there was never a word of a raven or an eagle that ill swear now you deny that there was ever a word of all for love speak madam their conjurors rigmarole she murmured huffing as if i listened to their nonsense does the duchess of dewlap dare to give me the lie said mr beamish thats not my title and you know it she retorted whats this the angry beau sang out what stuff is this you wear he towered and laid hand on a border of lace of her morning dress tore it furiously and swung a length of it round him and while the duchess panted and trembled at an outrage that won for her the sympathy of every lady present as well as the championship of the gentlemen he tossed the lace to the floor and trampled on it making his big voice intelligible over the uproar hear what she does tis a felony she wears the stuff with betty worcesters yellow starch on it for mock antique and let who else wears it strip it off before the town shall say we are disgracedwhen i tell you that betty worcester was hanged at tyburn yesterday morning for murder there were shrieks hardly had he finished speaking before the assembly began to melt he stood in the centre like a pole unwinding streamers amid a confusion of hurrying dresses the sound and whirl and drift whereof was as that of the autumnal strewn leaves on a wind rising in november the troops of ladies were off to bereave themselves of their fashionable imitation old lace adornment which denounced them in some sort abettors and associates of the sanguinary loathed wretch mrs elizabeth worcester their benefactress of the previous day now hanged and dangling on the gallowstree those ladies who wore not imitation lace or any lace in the morning were scarcely displeased with the beau for his exposure of them that did the gentlemen were confounded by his exhibition of audacious power the two gentlemen nighest upon violently resenting his brutality to duchess susan led her from the room in company with chloe the woman shall fear me to good purpose mr beamish said to himself chapter viii mr camwell was in the anteroom as chloe passed out behind the two incensed supporters of duchess susan i shall be by the firtrees on the mount at eight this evening she said i will be there he replied drive mr beamish into the country that these gentlemen may have time to cool he promised her it should be done close on the hour of her appointment he stood under the firtrees admiring the sunset along the western line of hills and when chloe joined him he spoke of the beauty of the scene though nothing seems more eloquently to say farewell he added with a sinking voice we could say it now and be friends she answered later than now you think it unlikely that you could forgive me chloe in truth sir you are making it hard for me i have stayed here to keep watch for no pleasure of my own said he mr beamish is an excellent protector of the duchess excellent and he is cleverly taught to suppose she fears him greatly and when she offends him he makes a display of his jupiters awfulness with the effect on woman of natural spirit which you have seen and others had foreseen that she is exasperated and grows reckless tie another knot in your string chloe she looked away saying were you not the cause you were in collusion with that charlatan of the heath who told them their fortunes this morning i see far both in the dark and in the light but not through a curtain i was present hateful hateful business of the spy you have worked a great mischief mr camwell and how can you reconcile it to your conscience that you should play so base a part i have but performed my duty dear madam you pretend that it is your devotion to me i might be flattered if i saw not so abject a figure in my service now have i but four days of my month of happiness remaining and my request to you is leave me to enjoy them i beseech you to go very humbly most earnestly i beg your departure grant it to me and do not stay to poison my last days here leave us tomorrow i will admit your good intentions i give you my hand in gratitude adieu mr camwell he took her hand adieu i foresee an early separation and this dear hand is mine while i have it in mine adieu it is a word to be repeated at a parting like ours we do not blow out our light with one breath we let it fade gradually like yonder sunset speak so said she ah chloe to give ones life and it is your happiness i have sought more than your favor i believe it but i have not liked the means you leave us tomorrow it seems to me that tomorrow is the term her face clouded that tells me a very uncertain promise you looked forth to a month of happinessmeaning a month of delusion the delusion expires tonight you will awaken to see your end of it in the morning you have never looked beyond the month since the day of his arrival let him not be named i supplicate you then you consent that another shall be sacrificed for you to enjoy your state of deception an hour longer i am not deceived sir i wish for peace and crave it and that is all i would have and you make her your peaceoffering whom you have engaged to serve too surely your eyes have been open as well as mine knot by knoti have watched youwhere is ityou have marked the points in that silken string where the confirmation of a just suspicion was too strong for you i did it and still i continued merry she subsided from her scornfulness on an involuntary ah that was a shudder you acted light heart madam and too well to hoodwink me meanwhile you allowed that mischief to proceed rather than have your crazy lullaby disturbed indeed mr camwell you presume the time and my knowledge of what it is fraught with demand it and excuse it you and i my dear and one only love on earth stand outside of ordinary rules we are between life and death we are so always listen further to the preacher we have them close on us with the question which it shall be tomorrow you are for sleeping on but i say no nor shall that iniquity of double treachery be committed because of your desire to be rocked in a cradle hear me out the drug you have swallowed to cheat yourself will not bear the shock awaiting you tomorrow with the first light hear these birds when next they sing you will be broad awake and of me and the worship and service i would have dedicated to you i do not it is a spectral sunset of a day that was never to beawake and looking on what back from a monstrous villainy to the forlorn wretch who winked at it with knots in a string count them then and where will be your answer to heaven i begged it of you to save you from those blows of remorse yes terrible oh no terrible i say you are mistaken mr camwell it is my soother i tell my beads on it see how a persistent residence in this place has made a pagan of the purest soul among us had you but that day was not to lighten me more adorable in your errors that you are than others by their virtues you have sinned through excess of the qualities men prize oh you have a boundless generosity unhappily enwound with a pride as great there is your fault that is the cause of your misery too generous too proud you have trusted and you will not cease to trust you have vowed yourself to love never to remonstrate never to seem to doubt it is too much your religion rare verily but bethink you of that inexperienced and most silly good creature who is on the rapids to her destruction is she notyou will cry it aloud tomorrowyour victim you hear it within you now friend my dear true friend chloe said in her deeper voice of melody set your mind at ease about tomorrow and her her safety is assured i stake my life on it she shall not be a victim at the worst she will but have learnt a lesson so then adieu the west hangs like a garland of unwatered flowers neglected by the mistress they adorned remember the scene and that here we parted and that chloe wished you the happiness it was out of her power to bestow because she was of another world with her history written out to the last red streak before ever you knew her adieu this time adieu for good mr camwell stood in her path blind eyes if you like he said but you shall not hear blind language i forfeit the poor consideration for me that i have treasured hate me better hated by you than shun my duty your duchess is away at the first dawn this next morning it has come to that i speak with full knowledge question her chloe threw a faltering scorn of him into her voice as much as her hearts sharp throbs would allow i question you sir how you came to this full knowledge you boast of i have it let that suffice nay i will be particular his coach is ordered for the time i name to you her maid is already at a station on the road of the flight you have their servants in your pay for the minethe countermine we must grub dirt to match deceivers you madam have chosen to be delicate to excess and have thrown it upon me to be gross and if you please abominable in my means of defending you it is not too late for you to save the lady nor too late to bring him to the sense of honour i cannot think colonel poltermore so dishonourable poor colonel poltermore the office he is made to fill is an old one are you not ashamed chloe i have listened too long she replied then if it is your pleasure depart he made way for her she passed him taking two hurried steps in the gloom of the twilight she stopped held at her heart and painfully turning to him threw her arms out and let herself be seized and kissed on his asking pardon of her which his long habit of respect forced him to do in the thick of rapture and repetitions she said you rob no one oh he cried there is a reward then for faithful love but am i the man i was a minute back i have you i embrace you and i doubt that i am i or is it chloes ghost she has died and visits you and will again chloe could not speak for languor the intensity of the happiness she gave by resting mutely where she was charmed her senses but so long had the frost been on them that their awakening to warmth was haunted by speculations on the sweet taste of this reward of faithfulness to him and the strange taste of her own unfaithfulness to her and reflecting on the cold act of speculation while strong arm and glowing mouth were pressing her she thought her senses might really be dead and she a ghost visiting the good youth for his comfort so feel ghosts she thought and what we call happiness in love is a match between ecstasy and compliance another thought flew through her like a mortal shot not so with those two with them it will be ecstasy meeting ecstasy they will take and give happiness in equal portions a pang of jealousy traversed her frame she made the shrewdness of it help to nerve her fervour in a last strain of him to her bosom and gently releasing herself she said no one is robbed and now dear friend promise me that you will not disturb mr beamish chloe said he have you bribed me i do not wish him to be troubled the duchess i have told you i know but you have chloes word that she will watch over the duchess and die to save her it is an oath you have heard of some arrangements i say they shall lead to nothing it shall not take place indeed my friend i am awake i see as much as you see and those after being where i have been can you suppose i have a regret but she is my dear and peculiar charge and if she runs a risk trust to me that there shall be no catastrophe i swear it so now adieu we sup in company tonight they will be expecting some of chloes verses and she must sing to herself for a few minutes to stir the bed her songs take wing from therefore we will part and for her sake avoid her do not be present at our table or in the room or anywhere there yes you rob no one she said in a voice that curled through him deliciously by wavering but i think i may blush at recollections and i would rather have you absent adieu i will not ask for obedience from you beyond tonight your word he gave it in a stupor of felicity and she fled chapter ix chloe drew the silken string from her bosom as she descended the dim pathway through the furies and set her fingers travelling along it for the number of the knots i have no right to be living she said seven was the number seven years she had awaited her lovers return she counted her age and completed it in sevens fatalism had sustained her during her lovers absence it had fast hold of her now thereby had she been enabled to say he will come and saying he has come her touch rested on the first knot in the string she had no power to displace her fingers and the cause of the tying of the knot stood across her brain marked in dull red characters legible neither to her eye nor to her understanding but a reviving of the hour that brought it on her spirit with human distinctness except of the light of day she had a sense of having forfeited light and seeing perhaps more clearly everything assured her that she saw more clearly than others she saw too when it was good to cease to live hers was the unhappy lot of one gifted with poetimagination to throb with the woman supplanting her and share the fascination of the man who deceived at their first meeting in her presence she had seen that they were not strangers she pitied them for speaking falsely and when she vowed to thwart this course of evil it to save a younger creature of her sex not in rivalry she treated them both with a proud generosity surpassing gentleness all that there was of selfishness in her bosom resolved to the enjoyment of her one month of strongly willed delusion the kiss she had sunk to robbed no one not even her bodys purity for when this knot was tied she consigned herself to her end and had become a bag of dust the other knots in the string pointed to verifications this first one was a suspicion and it was the more precious she felt it to be more a certainty it had come from the dark world beyond us where all is known her belief that it had come thence was nourished by testimony the space of blackness wherein she had lived since exhausting her last vitality in a simulation of infantile happiness which was nothing other than the carrying on of her emotion of the moment of sharp sour sweetsuch as it may be the doomed below attain for their knowledge of joywhen at the first meeting with her lover the perception of his treachery to the soul confiding in him told her she had lived and opened out the cherishable kingdom of insensibility to her for her heritage she made her tragic humility speak thankfully to the wound that slew her had it not been so i should not have seen him she saidher lover would not have come to her but for his pursuit of another woman she pardoned him for being attracted by that beautiful transplant of the fields pardoned her likewise he when i saw him first was as beautiful to me for him i might have done as much far away in a lighted hall of the west her family raised hands of reproach they were minute objects keenly discerned as diminished figures cut in steel feeling could not be very warm for them they were so small and a sea that had drowned her ran between and looking that way she had scarce any warmth of feeling save for a white rhaiadr leaping out of broken cloud through branched rocks where she had climbed and dreamed when a child the dream was then of the coloured days to come now she was more infant in her mind and she watched the scattered water broaden and tasted the spray sat there drinking the scene untroubled by hopes as a lamb different only from an infant in knowing that she had thrown off life to travel back to her home and be refreshed she heard her people talk they were unending babblers in the waterfall truth was with them and wisdom how then could she pretend to any right to live already she had no name she was less living than a tombstone for who was chloe her family might pass the grave of chloe without weeping without moralizing they had foreseen her ruin they had foretold it they noised it in the waters and on they sped to the plains telling the world of their prophecy and making what was untold as yet a lighter thing to do the lamps in an irregularly dotted line underneath the hill beckoned her to her task of appearing as the gayest of them that draw their breath for the day and have pulses for the morrow chapter x at midnight the great supper party to celebrate the reconciliation of mr beamish and duchess susan broke up and beneath a soft fair sky the ladies with their silvery chatter of gratitude for amusement caught chloe in their arms to kiss her rendering it natural for their cavaliers to exclaim that chloe was blest above mortals the duchess preferred to walk her spirits were excited and her language smelt of her origin but the superb fleshly beauty of the woman was aglow and crying i declare i should burst in one of those boxesjust as if youd stalled me she fanned a wind on her face and sumptuously spread her spherical skirts attended by the vanquished and captive colonel poltermore a gentleman manifestly bent on insinuating sly slips of speech to serve for here a pinch of powder there a match am i she was heard to say she blew prodigious deepchested sighs of a coquette that has taken to roaring presently her voice tossed out as if i would these vivid illuminations of the colonels proceedings were a pasture to the rearward groups composed of two very grand ladies caseldy mr beamish a lord and chloe you man oh sprang from the duchess what do i hear i wont listen i cant i mustnt i oughtnt so she said but her head careened she gave him her coy reluctant ear with total abandonment to the seductions of his whispers and the lord let fly a peal of laughter it had been a supper of copious wine and the songs which rise from wine nature was excused by our midnight naturalists the two great dames admonished by the violence of the noblemans laughter laid claim on mr beamish to accompany them at their parting with chloe and duchess susan in the momentary shuffling of couples incident to adieux among a company the duchess murmured to caseldy have i done it well he praised her for perfection in her acting i am at your door at three remember my hearts in my mouth said she colonel poltermore still had the privilege of conducting her the few farther steps to her lodgings caseldy walked beside chloe and silently until he said if i have not yet mentioned the subject if it is an allusion to money let me not hear it tonight she replied i can only say that my lawyers have instructions but my lawyers cannot pay you in gratitude do not think me in your hardest review of my misconduct ungrateful i have ever esteemed you above all women i do and i shall you are too much above me i am afraid i am a composition of bad stuff i did not win a very particularly good name on the continent i begin to know myself and in comparison with you dear catherine you speak to chloe she said catherine is a buried person she died without pain she is by this time dust the man heaved his breast women have not an idea of our temptations you are excused by me for all your errors caseldy always remember that he sighed profoundly ay you have a christians heart she answered i have come to the conclusion that it is a pagans as for me he rejoined i am a fatalist through life i have seen my destiny what is to be will be we can do nothing i have heard of one who expired of a surfeit that he anticipated nay proclaimed when indulging in the last desired morsel said chloe he was driven to it from within caseldy acquiesced his wits were clouded and an illustration even coarser and more grotesque would have won a serious nod and a sigh from him yes we are moved by other hands it is pleasant to think so and think it of me tomorrow will you said chloe he promised it heartily to induce her to think the same of him their separation was in no way remarkable the pretty formalities were executed at the door and the pair of gentlemen departed its quite dark still duchess susan said looking up at the sky and she ran upstairs and sank complaining of the weakness of her legs in a chair of the antechamber of her bedroom where chloe slept then she asked the time of the night she could not suppress her hushed oh of heavy throbbing from minute to minute suddenly she started off at a quick stride to her own room saying that it must be sleepiness which affected her so her bedroom had a door to the sittingroom and thence as also from chloes room the landing on the stairs was reached for the room ran parallel with both bedchambers she walked in it and threw the window open but closed it immediately opened and shut the door and returned and called for chloe she wanted to be read to chloe named certain composing books the duchess chose a book of sermons but were all such dreadful sinners its better not to bother ourselves late at night she dismissed that suggestion chloe proposed books of poetry only i dont understand them except about larks and buttercups and hayfields and thats no comfort to a woman burning was the answer are you feverish madam said chloe and the duchess was sharp on her yes madam i am she reproved herself in a change of tone no chloe not feverish only this air of yours here is such an exciting air as the doctor says and they made me drink wine and i played before supperoh my money i used to say i could get more but now she sighedbut theres better in the world than money you know that dont you you dear tell me and i want you to be happy that youll find i do wish we could all be she wept and spoke of requiring a little music to compose her chloe stretched a hand for her guitar duchess susan listened to some notes and cried that it went to her heart and hurt her everything we like a lot has a fence and a board against trespassers because of such a lot of people in the world she moaned dont play put down that thing please dear youre the cleverest creature anybody has ever met they all say so i wish ilovely women catch men and clever women keep them ive heard that said in this wretched place and it s a nice prospect for me next door to a fool i know i am the duke adores you madam poor duke do let him besleeping so woebegone with his mouth so and that chin of a baby like as if he dreamed of a penny whistle he shouldnt have let me come here talk of mr beamish how he will miss you chloe he will chloe said sadly if you go dear i am going why should you leave him chloe i must and there the thought of it makes you miserable it does you neednt im sure chloe looked at her the duchess turned her head why cant you be gay as you were at the suppertable chloe youre out to him like a flower when the sun jumps over the hill youre up like a lark in the dews as i used to be when i thought of nothing oh the early morning and im sleepy what a beast i feel with my grandeur and the time in an hour or two for the birds to sing and me ready to drop i must go and undress she rushed on chloe kissed her hastily declaring that she was quite dead of fatigue and dismissed her i dont want help i can undress myself as if susan barley couldnt do that for herself and you may shut your door i shant have any frights tonight im so tired out another kiss chloe said tenderly yes take itthe duchess leaned her cheekbut im so tired i dont know what im doing it will not be on your conscience chloe answered kissing her warmly will those words she withdrew and the duchess closed the door she ran a bolt in it immediately im too tired to know anything im doing she said to herself and stood with shut eyes to hug certain thoughts which set her bosom heaving there was the bed there was the clock she had the option of lying down and floating quietly into the day all peril past it seemed sweet for a minute but it soon seemed an old a worn an endofautumn life chill without aim like a something that was hungry and toothless the bed proposing innocent sleep repelled her and drove her to the clock the clock was awful the hand at the hour the finger following the minute commanded her to stir actively and drove her to gentle meditations on the bed she lay down dressed after setting her light beside the clock that she might see it at will and considering it necessary for the bed to appear to have been lain on considering also that she ought to be heard moving about in the process of undressing she rose from the bed to make sure of her reading of the guilty clock an hour and twenty minutes she had no more time than that and it was not enough for her various preparations though it was true that her maid had packed and taken a box of the things chiefly needful but the duchess had to change her shoes and her dress and run at bopeep with the changes of her mind a sedative preface to any fatal step among women of her complexion for so they invite indecision to exhaust their scruples and they let the blood have its way having so short a space of time she thought the matter decided and with some relief she flung despairing on the bed and lay down for good with her duke in a little while her head was at work reviewing him sternly estimating him not less accurately than the male moralist charitable to her sex would do she quitted the bed with a spring to escape her imagined lord and as if she had felt him to be there she lay down no more a quiet life like that was flatter to her idea than a handsomely bound big book without any print on the pages and without a picture her contemplation of it contrasted with the life waved to her view by the timepiece set her whole system rageing she burned to fly providently nevertheless she thumped a pillow and threw the bedclothes into proper disorder to inform the world that her limbs had warmed them and that all had been impulse with her she then proceeded to disrobe murmuring to herself that she could stop now and could stop now at each stage of the advance to a fresh dressing of her person and moralizing on her singular fate in the mouth of an observer she was shot up suddenly over everybodys head and suddenly down she went susan whispered to herself but it was for love possessed by the rosiness of love she finished her business with an attention to everything needed that was equal to perfect serenity of mind after which there was nothing to do save to sit humped in a chair cover her face and count the clocktickings that said yesno dodont flystay flyfly it seemed to her she heard a moving well she might with that dreadful heart of hers chloe was asleep at peace by this time she thought and how she envied chloe she might be as happy if she pleased why not but what kind of happiness was it she likened it to that of the corpse underground and shrank distastefully susan stood at her glass to have a look at the creature about whom there was all this disturbance and she threw up her arms high for a languid not unlovely yawn that closed in blissful shuddering with the sensation of her lovers arms having wormed round her waist and taken her while she was defenceless for surely they would she took a jewelled ring his gift from her purse and kissed it and drew it on and off her finger leaving it on now she might wear it without fear of inquiries and virtuous eyebrows o heavenly nowif only it were an hour hence and going behind galloping horses the clock was at the terrible moment she hesitated internally and hastened once her feet stuck fast and firmly she said no but the clock was her lord the clock was her lover and her lord and obeying it she managed to get into the sittingroom on the pretext that she merely wished to see through the front window whether daylight was coming how well she knew that halflight of the ebb of the wave of darkness strange enough it was to see it showing houses regaining their solidity of the foregone day instead of still fields black hedges familiar shapes of trees the houses had no wakefulness they were but seen to stand and the light was a revelation of emptiness susans heart was cunning to reproach her duke for the difference of the scene she beheld from that of the innocent openbreasted land yes it was dawn in a wicked place that she never should have been allowed to visit but where was he whom she looked for there the cloaked figure of a man was at the corner of the street it was he her heart froze but her limbs were strung to throw off the house and reach air breathe and as her thoughts ran swoon wellprotected to her senses the house was a house on fire and crying to her to escape yet she stepped deliberately to be surefooted in a dusky room she touched along the wall and came to the door where a footstool nearly tripped her here her touch was at fault for though she knew she must be close by the door she was met by an obstruction unlike wood and the door seemed neither shut nor open she could not find the handle something hung over it thinking coolly she fancied the thing must be a gown or dressinggown it hung heavily her fingers were sensible of the touch of silk she distinguished a depending bulk and she felt at it very carefully and mechanically saying within herself in her anxiety to pass it without noise if i should awake poor chloe of all people her alarm was that the door might creak before any other alarm had struck her brain the hand she felt with was in a palsy her mouth gaped her throat thickened the dustball rose in her throat and the effort to swallow it down and get breath kept her from acute speculation while she felt again pinched plucked at the thing ready to laugh ready to shriek above her head all on one side the thing had a round white top could it be a hand that her touch had slid across an arm too this was an arm she clutched it imagining that it clung to her she pulled it to release herself from it desperately she pulled and a lump descended and a flash of all the torn nerves of her body told her that a dead human body was upon her at a quarter to four oclock of a midsummer morning as mr beamish relates of his last share in the tale of chloe a womans voice in piercing notes of anguish rang out three shrieks consecutively which were heard by him at the instant of his quitting his front doorstep in obedience to the summons of young mr camwell delivered ten minutes previously with great urgency by that gentlemans lacquey on his reaching the street of the house inhabited by duchess susan he perceived many nightcapped heads at windows and one window of the house in question lifted but vacant his first impression accused the pair of gentlemen whom he saw bearing drawn swords in no friendly attitude of an ugly brawl that had probably affrighted her grace or her personal attendant a woman capable of screaming for he was well assured that it could not have been chloe the least likely of her sex to abandon herself to the use of their weapons either in terror or in jeopardy the antagonists were mr camwell and count caseldy on his approaching them mr camwell sheathed his sword saying that his work was done caseldy was convulsed with wrath to such a degree as to make the part of an intermediary perilous there had been passes between them and caseldy cried aloud that he would have his enemys blood the nightwatch was nowhere soon however certain shopmen and their apprentices assisted mr beamish to preserve the peace despite the fury of caseldy and the provocationsnot easy to withstand says the chronicleroffered by him to young camwell the latter said to mr beamish i knew i should be no match so i sent for you causing his friend astonishment inasmuch as he was assured of the youths natural valour mr beamish was about to deliver an allocution of reproof to them in equal shares being entirely unsuspicious of any other reason for the alarum than this palpable outbreak of a rivalry that he would have inclined to attribute to the charms of chloe when the housedoor swung wide for them to enter and the landlady of the house holding clasped hands at full stretch implored them to run up to the poor lady oh shes dead shes dead dead caseldy rushed past her how dead good woman mr beamish questioned her most incredulously halfsmiling she answered among her moans dead by the neck off the dooroh young camwell pressed his forehead with a call on his makers name as they reached the landing upstairs caseldy came out of the sittingroom which said camwell to the speaking of his face she said the other the duchess mr beamish exclaimed but camwell walked into the room he had nothing to ask after that reply the figure stretched along the floor was covered with a sheet the young man fell at his length beside it and his face was downward mr beamish relates to this day when i write at an interval of fifteen years i have the tragic ague of that hour in my blood and i behold the shrouded form of the most admirable of women whose heart was broken by a faithless man ere she devoted her wreck of life to arrest one weaker than herself on the descent to perdition therein it was beneficently granted her to be of the service she prayed to be through her death she died to save in a last letter found upon her pincushion addressed to me under seal of secrecy toward the parties principally concerned she anticipates the whole confession of the unhappy duchess nay she prophesies the duchess will tell you truly she has had enough of love those actual words were reiterated to me by the poor lady daily until her lord arrived to head the funeral procession and assist in nursing back the shattered health of his wife to a state that should fit her for travelling to me at least she was constant in repeating no more of love by her behaviour to her duke i can judge her to have been sincere she spoke of feeling chloes eyes go through her with every word of hers that she recollected nor was the end of chloe less effective upon the traitor he was in the procession to her grave he spoke to none there is a line of the verse bearing the superscription my reasons for dying that shows her to have been apprehensive to secure the safety of mr camwell i die because my heart is dead to warn a soul from sin i die i die that blood may not be shed etc she feared he would be somewhere on the road to mar the fugitives and she knew him as indeed he knew himself no match for one trained in the foreign tricks of steel ready though he was to dispute the traitors way she remembers mr camwells petition for the knotted silken string in her request that it shall be cut from her throat and given to him mr beamish indulges in verses above the grave of chloe they are of a character to cool emotion but when we find a man who is commonly of the quickest susceptibility to ridicule as well as to what is befitting careless of exposure we may reflect on the truthfulness of feeling by which he is drawn to pass his own guard and come forth in his nakedness something of the poets tongue may breathe to us through his mortal stammering even if we have to acknowledge that a quotation would scatter pathos etext editors bookmarks all flattery is at somebodys expense be philosophical but accept your personal dues but i leave it to you distrust us and it is a declaration of war happiness in love is a match between ecstasy and

realistic tale chapter i the experience of great officials who have laid down their dignities before death or have had the philosophic mind to review themselves while still wielding the deputy sceptre teaches them that in the exercise of authority over men an eccentric behaviour in trifles has most exposed them to hostile criticism and gone farthest to jeopardize their popularity it is their achilles heel the place where their mother nature holds them as she dips them in our waters the eccentricity of common persons is the entertainment of the multitude and the maternal hand is perceived for a cherishing and endearing sign upon them but rarely can this be found suitable for the august in station only indeed when their sceptre is no more fearful than a grandmothers birch and these must learn from it sooner or later that they are uncomfortably mortal when herrings are at auction on a beach for example the man of chief distinction in the town should not step in among a poor fraternity to take advantage of an occasion of cheapness though it be done as he may protest to relieve the fishermen of a burden nor should such a dignitary as the bailiff of a cinque port carry home the spoil of victorious bargaining on his arm in a basket it is not that his conduct is in itself objectionable so much as that it causes him to be popularly weighed and during life until the best of all advocates can plead before our fellow englishmen that we are out of their way it is prudent to avoid the process mr tinman however this highstepping person in question happened to have come of a marketing mother she had started him from a small shop to a big one he by the practice of her virtues had been enabled to start himself as a gentleman he was a man of this ambition and prouder behind it but having started himself precipitately he took rank among independent incomes as they are called only to take fright at the perils of starvation besetting one who has been tempted to abandon the source of fifty per cent so if noble imagery were allowable in our time in prose might alarms and partial regrets be assumed to animate the splendid pumpkin cut loose from the suckers deprived of that prodigious nourishment of the shop in the fashionable seaport of helmstone he retired upon his native town the cinque port of crikswich where he rented the cheapest residence he could discover for his habitation the house on the beach and lived imposingly though not in total disaccord with his old mothers principles his income as he observed to his widowed sister and solitary companion almost daily in their privacy was respectable the descent from an altitude of fifty to five per cent cannot but be felt nevertheless it was a comforting midnight bolster reflection for a man turning over to the other side between a dream and a wink that he was making no bad debts and one must pay to be addressed as esquire once an esquire you are off the ground in england and on the ladder an esquire can offer his hand in marriage to a lady in her own right plain esquires have married duchesses they marry baronets daughters every day of the week thoughts of this kind were as the rise and fall of waves in the bosom of the new esquire how often in his helmstone shop had he not heard titled ladies disdaining to talk a whit more prettily than ordinary women and he had been a match for the subtlety of their pridehe understood it he knew well that at the hint of a proposal from him they would have spoken out in a manner very different to that of ordinary women the lightning only to be warded by an esquire was in them he quitted business at the age of forty that he might pretend to espousals with a born lady or at least it was one of the ideas in his mind and here i think is the moment for the epitaph of anticipation over him and the exclamation alas i would not be premature but it is necessary to create some interest in him and no one but a foreigner could feel it at present for the englishman who is bursting merely to do like the rest of his countrymen and rise above them to shake them class by class as the dust from his heels alas then anundertakers pathos is better than none at allhe was not a singleminded aspirant to our social honours the old marketing mother to whom he owed his fortunes was in his blood to confound his ambition and so contradictory was the mans nature that in revenge for disappointments there were times when he turned against the saving spirit of parsimony readers deep in greek dramatic writings will see the fatal sisters behind the chair of a man who gives frequent and bigger dinners that he may become important in his neighbourhood while decreasing the price he pays for his wine that he may miserably indemnify himself for the outlay a sip of his wine fetched the breath as when men are in the presence of the tremendous elements of nature it sounded the constitution more darklyawful and with a profounder testimony to stubborn health than the physicians instruments most of the guests at mr tinmans table were so constructed that they admired him for its powerful quality the more at his announcement of the price of it the combined strength and cheapness probably flattering them as by another mystic instance of the national energy it must have been so since his townsmen rejoiced to hail him as head of their town here and there a solitary esquire fished out of the bathing season to dine at the house on the beach was guilty of raising one of those clamours concerning subsequent headaches which spread an evil reputation as a pall a resident esquire or two in whom a reminiscence of tinmans table may be likened to the hook which some old trout has borne away from the angler as the most vivid of warnings to him to beware for the future caught up the black report and propagated it the lieutenant of the coastguard hearing the latest conscious victim or hearing of him would nod his head and say he had never dined at tinmans table without a headache ensuing and a visit to the chemists shop which he was assured was good for trade and he acquiesced as it was right to do in a man devoted to his country he dined with tinman again we try our best to be social for eight months in our year he had little choice but to dine with tinman or be a hermit attached to a telescope where are you going lieutenant his frank reply to the question was i am going to be killed and it grew notorious that this meant tinmans table we get on together as well as we can perhaps if we were an acutely calculating people we should find it preferable both for trade and our physical prosperity to turn and kill tinman in contempt of consequences but we are not and so he does the business gradually for us a generous people we must be for tinman was not detested the recollection of next morning caused him to be dimly feared tinman meanwhile was awake only to the circumstance that he made no progress as an esquire except on the envelopes of letters and in his own esteem that broad region he began to occupy to the exclusion of other inhabitants and the result of such a state of princely isolation was a plunge of his whole being into deep thoughts from the hour of his investiture as the towns chief man thoughts which were long shots took possession of him he had his wits about him he was alive to ridicule he knew he was not popular below or on easy terms with people above him and he meditated a surpassing stroke as one of the band of esq that had nothing original about it to perplex and annoy the native mind yet was dazzling few members of the privileged band dare even imagine the thing it will hardly be believed but it is historical fact that in the act of carrying fresh herrings home on his arm he entertained the idea of a visit to the first person and head of the realm and was indulging in pleasing visions of the charms of a personal acquaintance nay he had already consulted with brother jurats for you must know that one of the princesses had recently suffered betrothal in the newspapers and supposing her to deign to ratify the engagement what so reasonable on the part of a cinque port chieftain as to congratulate his liege mistress her illustrious mother these are thoughts and these are deeds which give emotional warmth and colour to the ejecter members of a population wretchedly befogged they are our sunlight and our brighter theme of conversation they are necessary to the climate and the saxon mind and it would be foolish to put them away as it is foolish not to do our utmost to be intimate with terrestrial splendours while we have themas it may be said of wardens mayors and bailiffsat command tinman was quite of this opinion they are there to relieve our dulness we have them in the place of heavenly and he would have argued that we have a right to bother them too he had a notion up in the clouds of a sailors convalescent hospital at crikswich to seduce a prince with hand him the trowel make him lay the stone and then poor prince refresh him at table but that was a matter for by and by his purchase of herrings completed mr tinman walked across the mound of shingle to the house on the beach he was rather a freshfaced man of the saxon colouring and at a distance looking goodhumoured that he should have been able to make such an appearance while doing daily battle with his wine was a proof of great physical vigour his pace was leisurely as it must needs be over pebbles where half a step is subtracted from each whole one in passing and besides he was aware of a general breath at his departure that betokened a censorious assembly why should he not market for himself he threw dignity into his retreating figure in response to the internal interrogation the moment was one when conscious rectitude pliers man should have a tail for its just display philosophers have drawn attention to the power of the human face to express pure virtue but no sooner has it passed on than the spirit erect within would seem helpless the breadth of our shoulders is apparently presented for our critics to write on poor duty is done by the simple sense of moral worth to supplant that absence of feature in the plain flat back we are below the animals in this how charged with language behind him is a dog everybody has noticed it let a dog turn away from a hostile circle and his crisp and wary tail not merely defends him it menaces it is a weapon man has no choice but to surge and boil or stiffen preposterously knowing the popular sentiment about his marketingfor men can see behind their backs though they may have nothing to speak withtinman resembled those persons of principle who decline to pay for a bless your honour from a voluble beggarwoman and obtain the reverse of it after they have gone by he was sufficiently sensitive to feel that his back was chalked as on a slate the only remark following him was there he goes he went to the seaward gate of the house on the beach made practicable in a low flint wall where he was met by his sister martha to whom he handed the basket apparently he named the cost of his purchase per dozen she touched the fish and pressed the bellies of the topmost it might be to question them tenderly concerning their roes then the couple passed out of sight herrings were soon after this despatching their odours through the chimneys of all crikswich and there was that much of concord and festive union among the inhabitants the house on the beach had been posted where it stood one supposes for the sake of the seaview from which it turned right about to face the town across a patch of grass and salt scurf looking like a square and scornful corporal engaged in the perpetual review of an awkward squad of recruits sea delighted it not nor land either marine parade fronting it to the left shaded sickly eyes under a worn green verandah from a sun that rarely appeared as the traducers of

publichouse calling itself newly hotel fell backward a step villas with the titles of royalty and bloody battles claimed five feet of garden and swelled in bowwindows beside other villas which drew up firmly commending to the attention a decent straightness and unintrusive decorum in preference on an elevated meadow to the right was the crouch the hall of elba nestled among weatherbeaten dwarf woods further toward the cliff shavenness featurelessness emptiness clamminess scurfiness formed the outward expression of a town to which people were reasonably glad to come from london in summertime for there was nothing in crikswich to distract the naked pursuit of health the sea tossed its renovating brine to the determinedly sniffing animal who went to his meals with an appetite that rendered him cordially eulogistic of the place in spite of certain frank whiffs of sewerage coming off an open deposit on the common to mingle with the brine tradition told of a french lady and gentleman entering the town to take lodgings for a month and that on the morrow they took a boat from the shore saying in their faint english to a sailor veteran of the coastguard whom they had consulted about the weather it is better zis zan zat as they shrugged between rough sea and corpselike land and they were not seen again their meaning none knew having paid their bill at the lodginghouse their conduct was ascribed to systematic madness english people came to crikswich for the pure salt sea air and they did not expect it to be cooked and dressed and decorated for them if these things are done to nature it is nature no longer that you have but something frenchified those french are for trimming neptunes beard only wait and you are sure to find variety in nature more than you may like you will find it in neptune what say you to a breach of the seawall and an inundation of the aromatic grassflat extending from the house on the beach to the tottering terraces villas cottages and publichouse transformed by its ensign to hotel along the frontage of the town such an event had occurred of old and had given the house on the beach the serious shaking great neptune in his wrath alone can give but many years had intervened groynes had been run down to intercept him and divert him he generally did his winter mischief on a mill and salt marshes lower westward mr tinman had always been extremely zealous in promoting the expenditure of what moneys the town had to spare upon the protection of the shore as it were for the propitiation or defiance of the seagod there was a kindly joke against him an that subject among brother jurats he retorted with the joke that the first thing for englishmen to look to were englands defences but it will not do to be dwelling too fondly on our eras of peace for which we make such splendid sacrifices peace saving for the advent of a german band which troubled the repose of the town at intervals had imparted to the inhabitants of crikswich within and without the likeness to its most perfect image together it must be confessed with a degree of nervousness that invested common events with some of the terrors of the last trump when one night just upon the passing of the vernal equinox something happened chapter ii a carriage stopped short in the ray of candlelight that was fitfully and feebly capering on the windy blackness outside the open workshop of crickledon the carpenter fronting the seabeach mr tinnnans house was inquired for crickledon left off planing at halfsprawl over the board he bawled out turn to the right right ahead cant mistake it he nodded to one of the cronies intent on watching his labours not unless they mean to be bait for whitingpout whos that for tinman i wonder the speculations of crickledons friends were lost in the scream of the plane one cast an eye through the door and observed that the carriage was there still gentlemans got out and walked said crickledon he was informed that somebody was visible inside gentlemans wife mayhap he said his friends indulged in their privilege of thinking what they liked and there was the usual silence of tongues in the shop he furnished them sound and motion for their amusement and now and then a scrap of conversation and the sedater spirits dwelling in his immediate neighbourhood were accustomed to step in and see him work up to suppertime instead of resorting to the more turbid and costly excitement of the publichouse crickledon looked up from the measurement of a thumbline in the doorway stood a bearded gentleman who announced himself with the startling exclamation heres a pretty pickle and bustled to make way for a man well known to them as ned crummins the upholsterers man on whose back hung an article of furniture the condition of which with a condensed brevity of humour worthy of literary admiration he displayed by mutely turning himself about as he entered smashed was the general outcry i ran slap into him said the gentleman who the deuceno bones broken thats one thing the fellowthere look at him hes like a glass tortoise its a chiwal glass crickledon remarked and laid finger on the star in the centre gentleman ran slap into me said crummins depositing the frame on the floor of the shop never had such a shock in my life continued the gentleman upon my soul i took him for a door i did indeed a kind of light flashed from one of your houses here and in the pitch dark i thought i was at the door of old mart tinmans house and dash me if i did nt go incrash but what the deuce do you do carrying that great big lookingglass at night man and look here tell me how was it you happened to be going glass foremost when youd got the glass on your back well t aint my fault i knows that rejoined crummins i came along as careful as a man could i was just going to bawl out to master tinman i knows the way never fear me for i thinks i hears him call from his house do ye see the way and into me this gentleman runs all his might and smash goes the glass i was just ten steps from master tinmans gate and that careful i reckoned every foot i put down that i was i knows i did though why it was me calling im sure i cant see the way you heard me you donkey retorted the bearded gentleman what was the good of your turning that glass against me in the very nick when i dashed on you well t aint my fault i swear said crummins the wind catches voices so on a pitch dark night you never can tell whether they be on one shoulder or the other and if im to go and lose my place through no fault of mine have nt i told you sir im going to pay the damage here said the gentleman fumbling at his waistcoat here take this card read it for the first time during the scene in the carpenters shop a certain pomposity swelled the gentlemans tone his delivery of the card appeared to act on him like the flourish of a trumpet before great men van diemen smith he proclaimed himself for the assistance of ned crummins in his task the latters look of sad concern on receiving the card seeming to declare an unscholarly conscience an anxious feminine voice was heard close beside mr van diemen smith oh papa has there been an accident are you hurt not a bit netty not a bit walked into a big lookingglass in the dark thats all a matter of eight or ten pound and that wont stump us but these are what i call queer doings in old england when you cant take a step in the dark on the seashore without plunging bang into a glass and it looks like bad luck to my visit to old mart tinman can you he addressed the company tell me of a clean wholesome lodginghouse i was thinking of flinging myself body and baggage on your mayor or whatever he ismy old schoolmate but i dont so much like this beginning a couple of bedrooms and sittingroom clean sheets well aired good food well cooked payment per week in advance the pebble dropped into deep water speaks of its depth by the tardy arrival of bubbles on the surface and in like manner the very simple question put by mr van diemen smith pursued its course of penetration in the assembled mind in the carpenters shop for a considerable period with no sign to show that it had reached the bottom surely papa we can go to an inn there must be some hotel said his daughter theres good accommodation at the cliff hotel hard by said crickledon but said one of his friends if you dont want to go so far sir theres master crickledons own house next door and his wife lets lodgings and theres not a better cook along this coast then why did nt the man mention it is he afraid of having me asked mr smith a little thunderingly i may nt be known much yet in england but ill tell you you inquire the route to mr van diemen smith over there in australia yes papa interrupted his daughter only you must consider that it may not be convenient to take us in at this hourso late its not that miss begging your pardon said crickledon i make a point of never recommending my own house thats where it is otherwise youre welcome to try us i was thinking of falling bounce on my old schoolmate and putting old english hospitality to the proof mr smith meditated but its late yes and that confounded glass no well bide with you mr carpenter ill send my card across to mart tinman tomorrow and set him agog at his breakfast mr van diemen smith waved his hand for crickledon to lead the way hereupon ned crummins looked up from the card he had been turning over and over more and more like one arriving at a condemnatory judgment of a fish i cant go and give my master a card instead of his glass he remarked yes that reminds me and i should like to know what you meant by bringing that glass away from mr tinmans house at night said mr smith if im to pay for it ive a right to know whats the meaning of moving it at night eh lets hear nights not the time for moving big glasses like that im not so sure i havent got a case if youll step round to my master along o me sir said crummins perhaps hell explain crummins was requested to state who his master was and he replied phippun and company but mr smith positively refused to go with him but here said he is a crown for you for youre a civil fellow youll know where to find me in the morning and mind i shall expect phippun and company to give me a very good account of their reason for moving a big lookingglass on a night like this there be off the crownpiece in his hand effected a genial change in crummins disposition to communicate crickledon spoke to him about the glass two or three of the others present jogged him what did mr tinman want by having the glass moved so late in the day ned your master wasnt nervous about his property was he not he said crummins and began to suck down his upper lip and agitate his eyelids and stand uneasily glimmering signs of the setting in of the tide of narration he caught the eye of mr smith then looked abashed at miss crickledon saw his dilemma say whats uppermost ned never mind how you says it english is english mr tinman sent for you to take the glass away now did nt he he did said crummins and you went to him ay that i did and he fastened the chiwal glass upon your back he did that thats all plain sailing had he bought the glass no he had nt bought it hed hired it as when upon an enforced visit to the dentist people have had one tooth out the remaining offenders are more willingly submitted to the operation insomuch that a poetical licence might hazard the statement that they shed them like leaves of the tree so crummins who had shrunk from speech now volunteered whole sentences in succession and how important they were deemed by his fellowtownsman mr smith and especially miss annette smith could perceive in their ejaculations before they themselves were drawn into the strong current of interest and this was the matter tinman had hired the glass for three days latish on the very first day of the hiring close upon dark he had despatched imperative orders to phippun and company to take the glass out of his house on the spot and why because as he maintained there was a fault in the glass causing an incongruous and absurd reflection and he was at that moment awaiting the arrival of another chiwalglass cut along ned said crickledon what the deuce does he want with a chiwalglass at all cried mr smith endangering the flow of the story by suggesting to the narrator that he must hark back which to him was equivalent to the jumping of a chasm hindward happily his brain had seized a picture mr tinman hes astandin in his best court suit mr tinmaus old schoolmate gave a jump and no wonder standing he cried and as the act of standing was really not extraordinary he fixed upon the suit court so mrs cavely told me it was what he was standin in and as i found m i left m said crummins hes standing in it now said mr van diemen smith with a great gape crummins doggedly repeated the statement many would have ornamented it in the repetition but he was for bare flat truth he must be precious proud of having a court suit said mr smith and gazed at his daughter so glassily that she smiled though she was impatient to proceed to mrs crickledons lodgings oh theres where it is interjected the carpenter with a funny frown at a low word from ned crummins practicing is he mr tinmans practicing before the glass preparatory to his going to the palace in london he gave me a shillin said crummins crickledon comprehended him immediately we shant speak about it ned what did you see was thus cautiously suggested the shilling was on crummins tongue to check his betrayal of the secret scene but remembering that he had only witnessed it by accident and that mr tinman had not completely taken him into his confidence he thrust his hand down his pocket to finger the crownpiece lying in fellowship with the coin it multiplied five times and was inspired to think himself at liberty to say all i saw was when the door opened not the housedoor it was the parlourdoor i saw him walk up to the glass and walk back from the glass and when hed got up to the glass he bowed he did and he went backards just so doubtless the presence of a lady was the active agent that prevented crummins from doubling his body entirely and giving more than a rapid indication of the posture of mr tinman in his retreat before the glass but it was a glimpse of broad burlesque and though it was received with becoming sobriety by the men in the carpenters shop annette plucked at her fathers arm she could not get him to depart that picture of his old schoolmate martin tinman practicing before a chiwal glass to present himself at the palace in his court suit seemed to stupefy his australian intelligence what right has he got to go to court mr van diemen smith inquired like the foreigner he had become through exile mr tinmans bailiff of the town said crickledon and what was his objection to that glass i smashed hes rather an irritable gentleman crickledon murmured and turned to crummins crummins growled he said it was misty and gave him a twist what a big fool he must be eh mr smith glanced at crickledon and the other faces for the verdict of tinmans townsmen upon his character they had grounds for thinking differently of tinman hes no fool said crickledon another shook his head sharp at a bargain that he be said the chorus mr smith was informed that mr tinman would probably end by buying up half the town then said mr smith he can afford to pay half the money for that glass and pay he shall a serious view of the recent catastrophe was presented by his declaration in the midst of a colloquy regarding the cost of the glass during which it began to be seen by mr tinmans townsmen that there was laughingstuff for a year or so in the scene witnessed by crummins if they postponed a bit their right to the laugh and took it in doses annette induced her father to signal to crickledon his readiness to go and see the lodgings no sooner had he done it than he said what on earth made us wait all this time here im hungry my dear i want supper that is because you have had a disappointment i know you papa said annette yes its rather a damper about old mart tinman her father assented or else i have nt recovered the shock of smashing that glass and visit it on him but upon my honour hes my only friend in england i have nt a single relative that i know of and to come and find your only friend making a donkey of himself is enough to make a man think of eating and drinking annette murmured reproachfully we can hardly say he is our only friend in england papa can we do you mean that young fellow youll take my appetite away if you talk of him hes a stranger i dont believe hes worth a penny he owns hes what he calls a journalist these latter remarks were hurriedly exchanged at the threshold of crickledons house it dont look promising said mr smith i didnt recommend it said crickledon why the deuce do you let your lodgings then people who have come once come again oh i am in england annette sighed joyfully feeling at home in some trait she had detected in crickledon chapter iii the story of the shattered chiwalglass and the visit of tinmans old schoolmate fresh from australia was at many a breakfasttable before tinman heard a word of it and when he did he had no time to spare for such incidents for he was reading to his widowed sister martha in an impressive tone at a tolerably high pitch of the voice and with a suppressed excitement that shook away all things external from his mind as violently as it agitated his body not the waves without but the engine within it is which gives the shock and tremor to the crazy steamer forcing it to cut through the waves and scatter them to spray and so did martin tinman make light of the external attack of the card of van diemen smith and its pencilled line an old chum of yours eh matey even the communication of phippun co concerning the chiwalglass failed to divert him from his particular task it was indeed a public duty and the chiwalglass though pertaining to it was a private business he that has broken the glass let that man pay for it he pronouncedno doubt in simpler fashion being at his ease in his home but with the serenity of one uplifted as to the name van diemen smith he knew it not and so he said to himself while accurately recollecting the identity of the old chum who alone of men would have thought of writing eh matey mr van diemen smith did not present the card in person at crickledons he wrote apparently expecting the bailiff of the town to rush over to him before knowing who he was tinman was far too busy anybody can read plain penmanship or print but ask anybody not a cabinet minister or a lordinwaiting to read out loud and clear in a palace before a throne oh the nature of reading is distorted in a trice and as tinman said to his worthy sister i can do it but i must lose no time in preparing myself again at a reperusal he informed her i must habituate myself for this purpose he had put on the suit overnight the articulation of faultless english was his object his sister martha sat viceregally to receive his loyal congratulations on the illustrious marriage and she was pensive less nervous than her brother from not having to speak continuously yet somewhat perturbed she also had her task and it was to avoid thinking herself the person addressed by her suppliant brother while at the same time she took possession of the scholarly training and perfect knowledge of diction and rules of pronunciation which would infallibly be brought to bear on him in the terrible hour of the delivery of the address it was no small task moreover to be compelled to listen right through to the end of the address before the very gentlest word of criticism was allowed she did not exactly complain of the renewal of the rehearsal a fatigue can be endured when it is a joy what vexed her was her failing memory for the points of objection as in her imagined high seat she conceived them for in painful truth the instant her brother had finished she entirely lost her acuteness of ear and with that her recollection so there was nothing to do but to say excellent quite unobjectionable dear martin quite so she said and emphatically but the addition of the word only was printed on her contracted brow and every faculty of tinmans mind and nature being at strain just then he asked her testily what now whats the fault now she assured him with languor that there was not a fault its not your way of talking said he and what he said was true his discernment was extraordinary generally he noticed nothing not only were his perceptions quickened by the preparations for the day of great splendour day of a great furnace to be passed through likewisehe was learning english at an astonishing rate into the bargain a pronouncing dictionary lay open on his table to this he flew at a hint of a contrary method and disputes verifications and triumphs on one side and the other ensued between brother and sister in his heart the agitated man believed his sister to be a misleading guide he dared not say it he thought it and previous to his african travel through the dictionary he had thought his sister infallible on these points he dared not say it because he knew no one else before whom he could practice and as it was confidence that he chiefly wantedabove all things confidence and confidence comes of practice he preferred the going on with his practice to an absolute certainty as to correctness at midday came another card from mr van diemen smith bearing the superscription alias phil r can it be possible tinman asked his sister that philip ribstone has had the audacity to return to this country i think he added i am right in treating whoever sends me this card as a counterfeit marthas advice was that he should take no notice of the card i am seriously engaged said tinman with a now then dear he resumed his labours messages had passed between tinman and phippun and in the afternoon phippun appeared to broach the question of payment for the chiwalglass he had seen mr van diemen smith had found him very strange rather impracticable he was obliged to tell tinman that he must hold him responsible for the glass nor could he send a second until payment was made for the first it really seemed as if tinman would be compelled by the force of circumstances to go and shake his old friend by the hand otherwise one could clearly see the man might be off he might be off at any minute leaving a legal contention behind him on the other hand supposing he had come to crikswich for assistance in money friendship is a good thing and so is hospitality which is an essentially english thing and consequently one that it behoves an englishman to think it his duty to perform but we do not extend it to paupers but should a pauper get so close to us as to lay hold of us vowing he was once our friend how shake him loose tinman foresaw that it might be a matter of five pounds thrown to the dogs perhaps ten counting the glass he put on his hat full of melancholy presentiments and it was exactly halfpast five oclock of the spring afternoon when he knocked at crickledons door had he looked into crickledons shop as he went by he would have perceived van diemen smith astride a piece of timber smoking a pipe van diemen saw tinman his eyes cocked and watered it is a disgraceful fact to record of him without periphrasis in truth the bearded fellow was almost a woman at heart and had come from the antipodes throbbing to slap martin tinman on the back squeeze his hand run over england with him treat him and talk of old times in the presence of a trotting regiment of champagne that affair of the chiwalglass had temporarily damped his enthusiasm the absence of a reply to his double transmission of cards had wounded him and something in the look of tinman disgusted his rough taste but the wellknown features recalled the days of youth tinman was his one living link to the country he admired as the conqueror of the world and imaginatively delighted in as the seat of pleasures and he could not discard the feeling of some love for tinman without losing his grasp of the reason why he had longed so fervently and travelled so breathlessly to return hither in the days of their youth van diemen had been tinmans cordial spirit at whom he sipped for cheerful visions of life and a good honest glow of emotion now and then whether it was odd or not that the sipper should be oblivious and the cordial spirit heartily reminiscent of those times we will not stay to inquire their meeting took place in crickledons shop tinman was led in by mrs crickledon his voice made a sound of metal in his throat and his air was that of a man buttoned up to the palate as he read from the card glancing over his eyelids mr van diemen smith i believe phil ribstone if you like said the other without rising oh ah indeed tinman temperately coughed yes dear me so it is it strikes you as odd the change of name said tinman not nature though ah have you been long in england time to run to helmstone and on here youve been lucky in business i hear thank you as things go do you think of remaining in england ive got to settle about a glass i broke last night ah i have heard of it yes i fear there will have to be a settlement i shall pay half of the damage youll have to stump up your part van diemen smiled roguishly we must discuss that said tinman smiling too as a patient in bed may smile at a doctors joke for he was as crickledon had said of him no fool on practical points and van diemens mention of the halfpayment reassured him as to his old friends position in the world and softly thawed him will you dine with me today i dont mind if i do ive a girl you remember little netty shes walking out on the beach with a young fellow named fellingham whose acquaintance we made on the voyage and has nt left us long to ourselves will you have her as well and i suppose you must ask him hes a newspaper man been round the world seen a lot tinman hesitated an electrical idea of putting sherry at fifteen shillings per dozen on his table instead of the ceremonial wine at twentyfive shillings assisted him to say hospitably oh ah yes any friend of yours and now perhaps youll shake my fist said van diemen with pleasure said tinman it was your change of name you know philip look here martin van diemen smith was a convict and my benefactor why the deuce he was so fond of that name i cant tell you but his dying wish was for me to take it and carry it on he left me his fortune for van diemen smith to enjoy life as he never did poor fellow when he was alive the money was got honestly by hard labour at a store he did evil once and repented after but by heavenvan diemen jumped up and thundered out of a broad chestthe man was one of the finest hearts that ever beat he was and im proud of him when he died i turned my thoughts home to old england and you martin oh said tinman and reminded by van diemens way of speaking that cordiality was expected of him he shook his limbs to some briskness and continued well yes we must all die in our native land if we can i hope youre comfortable in your lodgings ill give you one of mrs crickledons dinners to try youre as good as mayor of this town i hear i am the bailiff of the town said mr tinman youre going to court im told the appointment replied mr tinman will soon be made i have not yet an appointed day on the great highroad of life there is expectation and there is attainment and also there is envy mr tinmans posture stood for attainment shadowing expectation and sunning itself in the glass of envy as he spoke of the appointed day it was involuntary and naturally evanescent a momentary view of the spirit he unbent and begged to be excused for the present that he might go and apprise his sister of guests coming all right i daresay we shall see enough of one another said van diemen and almost before the creak of tinmans heels was deadened on the road outside the shop he put the funny question to crickledon do you box i make em crickledon replied because i should like to have a go in at something my friend van diemen stretched and yawned crickledon recommended the taking of a walk i think i will said the other and turned back abruptly how long do you work in the day generally all the hours of light crickledon replied and always up to suppertime youre healthy and happy nothing to complain of good appetite pretty regular you never take a holiday except sundays youd like to be working then i wont say that but youre glad to be up monday morning it feels cheerfuller in the shop and carpenterings your joy i think i may say so van diemen slapped his thigh theres life in old england yet crickledon eyed him as he walked away to the beach to look for his daughter and conceived that there was a touch of the soldier in him chapter iv annette smiths delight in her native england made her see beauty and kindness everywhere around her it put a halo about the house on the beach and thrilled her at tinmans table when she heard the thunder of the waves hard by she fancied it had been a most agreeable dinner to her father and mr herbert fellinghamespecially to the latter who had laughed very much and she was astonished to hear them at breakfast both complaining of their evening in answer to which she exclaimed oh i think the situation of the house is so romantic the situation of the host is exceedingly so said mr fellingham but i think his wine the most unromantic liquid i have ever tasted it must be that cried van diemen puzzled by novel pains in the head old martin woke up a little like his old self after dinner he drank sparingly said mr fellingham i am sure you were satirical last night annette said reproachfully on the contrary i told him i thought he was in a romantic situation but i have had a french mademoiselle for my governess and an oxford gentleman for my tutor and i know you accepted french and english from mr tinman and his sister that i should not have approved netty said van diemen has had the best instruction money could procure and if she says you were satirical you may depend on it you were oh in that case of course mr fellingham rejoined who could help it he thought himself warranted in giving the rein to his wicked satirical spirit and talked lightly of the accidental character of the letter h in tinmans pronunciation of how like somebody elses hat in a high wind it descended on somebody elses head and of how his words walked about asking one another who they were and what they were doing danced together madly snapping their fingers at signification and so forth he was flippant annette glanced at her father and dropped her eyelids mr fellingham perceived that he was enjoined to be on his guard he went one step farther in his fun upon which van diemen said with a frown if you please nothing could withstand that hang old mart tinmans wine van diemen burst out in the dead pause my heads a bullet im in a shocking bad temper i can hardly see im bilious mr fellingham counselled his lying down for an hour and he went grumbling complaining of mart tinmans incredulity about the towering beauty of a place in australia called gippsland annette confided to mr fellingham as soon as they were alone the chivalrous nature of her father in his friendships and his indisposition to hear a satirical remark upon his old schoolmate the moment he understood it to be satire fellingham pleaded the mans a perfect burlesque hes as distinctly made to be laughed at as a mask in a pantomime papa will not think so said annette and papa has been told that he is not to be laughed at as a man of business do you prize him for that i am no judge i am too happy to be in england to be a judge of anything you did not touch his wine you men attach so much importance to wine they do say that powders is a good thing after mr tinmans wine observed mrs crickledon who had come into the sittingroom to take away the breakfast things mr fellingham gave a peal of laughter but mrs crickledon bade him be hushed for mr van diemen smith had gone to lay down his poor aching head on his pillow annette ran upstairs to speak to her father about a doctor during her absence mr fellingham received the popular portrait of mr tinman from the lips of mrs crickledon he subsequently strolled to the carpenters shop and endeavoured to get a confirmation of it my wife talks too much said crickledon when questioned by a gentleman however he was naturally bound to answer to the extent of his knowledge what a funny old country it is mr fellingham said to annette on their walk to the beach she implored him not to laugh at anything english i dont i assure you said he i love the country too but when one comes back from abroad and plunges into their daily life its difficult to retain the real figure of the old country seen from outside and one has to remember half a dozen great names to right oneself and englishmen are so funny your father comes here to see his old friend and begins boasting of the gippsland he has left behind tinman immediately brags of helvellyn and they fling mountains at one another till on their first evening together theres earthquake and rupturethey were nearly at fisticuffs at one time oh surely no said annette i did not hear them they were good friends when you came to the drawingroom perhaps the wine did affect poor papa if it was bad wine i wish men would never drink any how much happier they would be but then there would cease to be social meetings in england what should we do i know that is a sneer and you were nearly as enthusiastic as i was on board the vessel annette said sadly quite true i was but see what quaint creatures we have about us tinman practicing in his court suit before the chiwalglass and that good fellow the carpenter crickledon who has lived with the sea fronting him all his life and has never been in a boat and he confesses he has only once gone inland and has never seen an acorn i wish i could see oneof a real english oak said annette and after being in england a few months you will be sighing for the continent never you think you will be quite contented here i am sure i shall be may papa and i never be exiles again i did not feel it when i was three years old going out to australia but it would be like death to me now oh annette shivered as with the exiles chill on my honour said mr fellingham as softly as he could with the wind in his teeth i love the old country ten times more from your love of it that is not how i want england to be loved returned annette the love is in your hands she seemed indifferent on hearing it he should have seen that the way to woo her was to humour her prepossession by another passion he could feel that it ennobled her in the abstract but a latent spite at tinman on account of his wine to which he continued angrily to attribute as unwonted dizziness of the head and slight irascibility made him urgent in his desire that she should separate herself from tinman and his sister by the sharp division of derision annette declined to laugh at the most risible caricatures of tinman in her antagonism she forced her simplicity so far as to say that she did not think him absurd and supposing mr tinman to have proposed to the titled widow lady ray as she had heard and to other ladies young and middleaged in the neighbourhood why should he not if he wished to marry if he was economical surely he had a right to manage his own affairs her dread was lest mr tinman and her father should quarrel over the payment for the broken chiwalglass that she honestly admitted and fellingham was so indiscreet as to roar aloud not so very cordially annette thought him unkindly satirical and his thoughts of her reduced her to the condition of a commonplace girl with expressive eyes she had to return to her father mr fellingham took a walk on the springy turf along the cliffs and certainly she is a commonplace girl he began by reflecting with a side eye at the fact that his meditations were excited by tinmans poisoning of his bile a girl who cant see the absurdity of tinman must be destitute of common intelligence after a while he sniffed the fine sharp air of mingled earth and sea delightedly and he strode back to the town late in the afternoon laughing at himself in scorn of his wretched susceptibility to bilious impressions and really all but hating tinman as the cause of his weaknessin the manner of the criminal hating the detective perhaps he cast it altogether on tinman that annettes complexion of character had become discoloured to his mind for in spite of the physical freshness with which he returned to her society he was incapable of throwing off the idea of her being commonplace and it was with regret that he acknowledged he had gained from his walk only a higher opinion of himself her father was the victim of a sick headache migrainedwand lay a groaning man on his bed ministered to by mrs crickledon chiefly annette had to conduct the business with mr phippun and mr tinman as to payment for the chiwalglass she was commissioned to offer half the price for the glass on her fathers part more he would not pay tinman and phippun sat with her in crickledons cottage and mrs crickledon brought down two messages from her invalid each positive to the effect that he would fight with all the arms of english law rather than yield his point tinman declared it to be quite out of the question that he should pay a penny phippun vowed that from one or the other of them he would have the money annette naturally was in deep distress and fellingham postponed the discussion to the morrow even after such a taste of tinman as that annette could not be induced to join in deriding him privately she looked pained by mr fellinghams cruel jests it was monstrous fellingham considered that he should draw on himself a second reprimand from van diemen smith while they were consulting in entire agreement upon the case of the chiwalglass i must tell you this mister sir said van diemen i like you but ill be straightforward and truthful or im not worthy the name of englishman and i do like you or i should nt have given you leave to come down here after us two you must respect my friend if you care for my respect thats it there it is now you know my conditions i m afraid i cant sign the treaty said fellingham heres more said van diemen im a chilly man myself if i hear a laugh and think i know the aim of it ill meet what you like except scorn i cant stand contempt so i feel for another and now you know it puts a stopper on the play of fancy and checks the throwing off of steam fellingham remonstrated i promise to do my best but of all the men ive ever met in my lifetinmanthe ridiculous pray pardon me but the donkey and his lookingglass the glass was misty heas particular about his reflection in the glass as a poet with his verses advance retire bow and such murder of the queens english in the very presence if i thought he was going to take his wine with him id have him arrested for high treason youve chosen and you know what you best like said van diemen pointing his accentsby which is produced the awkward pause the pitfall of conversation and sometimes of amity thus it happened that mr herbert fellingham journeyed back to london a day earlier than he had intended and without saying what he meant to say chapter v a month later after a night of sharp frost on the verge of the warmer days of spring mr fellingham entered crikswich under a sky of perfect blue that was in brilliant harmony with the green downs the white cliffs and sparkling sea and no doubt it was the beauty before his eyes which persuaded him of his delusion in having taken annette for a commonplace girl he had come in a merely curious mood to discover whether she was one or not who but a commonplace girl would care to reside in crikswich he had asked himself and now he was full sure that no commonplace girl would ever have had the idea exquisitely simple she certainly was but that may well be a distinction in a young lady whose eyes are expressive the sound of sawing attracted him to crickledons shop and the industrious carpenter soon put him on the tide of affairs crickledon pointed to the house on the beach as the place where mr van diemen smith and his daughter were staying dear me and how does he look said fellingham our town seems to agree with him sir well i must not say any more i suppose fellingham checked his tongue how have they settled that dispute about the chiwalglass mr tinman had to give way really but crickledon stopped work mr tinman sold him a meadow i see mr smith has been buying a goodish bit of ground here they tell me hes about purchasing elba he has bought the crouch he and mr tinman are always out together theyre over at helmstone now theyve been to london are they likely to be back today certain i should think mr tinman has to be in london tomorrow crickledon looked he was not the man to look artful but there was a lighted corner in his look that revived fellinghams recollections and the latter burst out the address i d half forgotten it thats not over yet has he been practicing much no more glasses ha been broken and how is your wife crickledon shes at home sir ready for a talk if youve a mind to try her mrs crickledon proved to be very ready that tinman was her theme he had taken away her lodgers and she knew his objects mr smith repented of leaving her she knew though he dared not say it in plain words she knew miss smith was tired to death of constant companionship with mrs cavely tinmans sister she generally came once in the day just to escape from mrs cavely who would not bless you step into a cottagers house where she was not allowed to patronize fortunately miss smith had induced her father to get his own wine from the merchants a happy resolution said fellingham and a saving one he heard further that mr smith would take possession of the crouch next month and that mrs cavely hung over miss smith like a kite and that old tinman old enough to be her father said mrs crickledon she dealt in the flashes which connect ideas fellingham though a man and an englishman was nervously wakeful enough to see the connection theyll have to consult the young lady first maam if its her fathers nod shell bow to it now mark me mrs crickledon said with emphasis shes a young lady who thinks for herself but she takes her start from her father where its feeling and hes gone stoneblind over that tinman while they were speaking annette appeared i saw you she said to fellingham gladly and openly in the most commonplace manner are you going to give me a walk along the beach said he she proposed the country behind the town and that was quite as much to his taste but it was not a happy walk he had decided that he admired her and the notion of having tinman for a rival annoyed him he overflowed with ridicule of tinman and this was distressing to annette because not only did she see that he would not control himself before her father but he kindled her own satirical spirit in opposition to her fathers friendly sentiments toward his old schoolmate mr tinman has been extremely hospitable to us she said a little coldly may i ask you has he consented to receive instruction in deportment and pronunciation annette did not answer if practice makes perfect he must be near the mark by this time she continued silent i dare say in domestic life hes as amiable as he is hospitable and it must be a daily gratification to see him in his court suit i have not seen him in his court suit that is his coyness people talk of those things the common people scandalize the great about whom they know nothing you mean i am sure that is true and living in courts one must be keenly aware of it but what a splendid sky andsea is it not annette echoed his false rapture with a candour that melted him he was preparing to make up for lost time when the wild waving of a parasol down a road to the right coming from the town caused annette to stop and say i think that must be mrs cavely we ought to meet her fellingham asked why she is so fond of walks anisette replied with a tooth on her lip fellingham thought she seemed fond of runs mrs cavely joined them breathless my dear the pace you go at she shouted i saw you starting i followed i ran i tore along i feared i never should catch you and to lose such a morning of english scenery is it not heavenly one cant say more fellingham observed bowing i am sure i am very glad to see you again sir you enjoy crikswich once visited always desired like venice maam may i venture to inquire whether mr tinman has presented his address the day after tomorrow the appointment is made with him said mrs cavely more officially in manner for the day after tomorrow he is excited as you may well believe but mr smith is an immense relief to himthe very distraction he wanted we have become one family you know indeed maam i did not know it said fellingham the communication imparted such satiric venom to his further remarks that annette resolved to break her walk and dismiss him for the day he called at the house on the beach after the dinnerhour to see mr van diemen smith when there was literally a duel between him and tinman for van diemens contribution to the table was champagne and that had been drunk but tinmans sherry remained tinman would insist on fellinghams taking a glass fellingham parried him with a sedate gravity of irony that was painfully perceptible to anisette van diemen at last backed tinmans hospitable intent and to fellinghams astonishment he found that he had been supposed by these two men to be bashfully retreating from a seductive offer all the time that his tricks of fence and transpiercings of one of them had been marvels of skill tinman pushed the glass into his hand you have spilt some said fellingham it wont hurt the carpet said tinman wont it fellingham gazed at the carpet as if expecting a flame to arise he then related the tale of the magnanimous alexander drinking off the potion in scorn of the slanderer to show faith in his friend alexanderwho was that said tinman foiled in his historical recollections by the absence of the surname general alexander said fellingham alexander philipson or he declared it was joveson and very fond of wine but his sherry did for him at last ah he drank too much then said tinman of his own anisette admonished the vindictive young gentleman by saying how long do you stay in crikswich mr fellingham he had grossly misconducted himself but an adversary at once offensive and helpless provokes brutality anisette prudently avoided letting her father understand that satire was in the air and neither he nor tinman was conscious of it exactly yet both shrank within themselves under the sensation of a devilish blast blowing fellingham accompanied them and certain jurats to london next day yes if you like when a mayor visits majesty it is an important circumstance and you are at liberty to argue at length that it means more than a desire on his part to show his writing power and his reading power it is full of comfort the people as an exhibition of their majesty likewise and it is an encouragement to men to strive to become mayors bailiffs or prime men of any sort but a stress in the reporting of itthe making it appear too important a circumstancewill surely breathe the intimation to a politicallyminded people that satire is in the air and however dearly they cherish the privilege of knocking at the first door of the kingdom and walking ceremoniously in to read their writings they will if they are not in one of their moods for prostration laugh they will laugh at the report all the greater reason is it that we should not indulge them at such periods and i say woes me for any brother of the pen and one in some esteem who dressed the report of that presentation of the address of congratulation by mr bailiff tinman of crikswich herbert fellingham wreaked his personal spite on tinman he should have bethought him that it involved another than tinman that is to say an officewhich the fitful beast rejoices to paw and play with contemptuously now and then one may think as a solace to his pride and an indemnification for those caprices of abject worship so strongly recalling the days we see through mr darwins glasses he should not have written the report it sent a titter over england he was so unwise as to despatch a copy of the newspaper containing it to van diemen smith van diemen perused it with satisfaction so did tinman both of these praised the able young writer but they handed the paper to the coastguard lieutenant who asked tinman how he liked it and visitors were beginning to drop in to crikswich who made a point of asking for a sight of the chief man and then came a comic publication all in the republican tone of the time with mans dignity for the standpoint and the wheezy laughter residing in old puns to back it in eulogy of the satiric report of the famous address of congratulation of the bailiff of crikswich annette van diemen said to his daughter youll not encourage that newspaper fellow to come down here any more he had his warning chapter vi one of the most difficult lessons for spirited young men to learn is that good jokes are not always good policy they have to be paid for like good dinners though dinner and joke shall seem to have been at somebody elses expense young fellingham was treated rudely by van diemen smith and with some cold reserve by annette in consequence of which he thought her more than ever commonplace he wrote her a letter of playful remonstrance followed by one that appealed to her sentiments but she replied to neither of them so his visits to crikswich came to an end shall a girl who has no appreciation of fun affect us her expressive eyes and her quaint simplicity and her enthusiasm for england haunted mr fellingham being conjured up by contrast with what he met about him but shall a girl who would impose upon us the task of holding in our laughter at tinman be much regretted there could be no companionship between us fellingham thought on an excursion to the english lakes he saw the name of van diemen smith in a visitors book and changed his ideas on the subject of companionship among mountains or on the sea or reading history annette was one in a thousand he happened to be at a public ball at helmstone in the winter season and who but annette herself came whirling before him on the arm of an officer fellingham did not miss his chance of talking to her she greeted him gaily and speaking with the excitement of the dance upon her appeared a stranger to the serious emotions he was willing to cherish she had been to the lakes and to scotland next summer she was going to wales all her experiences were delicious she was insatiable but satisfied i wish i had been with you said fellingham i wish you had said she mrs cavely was her chaperon at the ball and he was not permitted to enjoy a lengthened conversation sitting with annette what was he to think of a girl who could be submissive to mrs cavely and danced with any number of officers and had no idea save of running incessantly over england in the pursuit of pleasure her tone of saying i wish you had was that of the most ordinary of wishes distinctly if not designedly different from his own melodious depth she granted him one waltz and he talked of her father and his whimsical vagrancies and feeling he had a positive liking for van diemen and he sagaciously said so annettes eyes brightened then why do you never go to see him he has bought elba we move into the hall after christmas we are at the crouch at present papa will be sure to make you welcome do you not know that he never forgets a friend or breaks a friendship i do and i love him for it said fellingham if he was not greatly mistaken a gentle pressure on the fingers of his left hand rewarded him this determined him it should here be observed that he was by birth the superior of annettes parentage and such is the sentiment of a better blood that the flattery of her warm touch was needed for him to overlook the distinction two of his visits to crikswich resulted simply in interviews and conversations with mrs crickledon van diemen and his daughter were in london with tinman and mrs cavely purchasing furniture for elba hall mrs crickledon had no scruple in saying that mrs cavely meant her brother to inhabit the hall though mr smith had outbid him in the purchase according to her tinman and mr smith had their differences for mr smith was a very outspoken gentleman and had been known to call tinman names that no man of spirit would bear if he was not scheming fellingham returned to london where he roamed the streets famous for furniture warehouses in the vain hope of encountering the new owner of elba failing in this endeavour he wrote a loveletter to annette it was her first she had liked him her manner of thinking she might love him was through the reflection that no one stood in the way the letter opened a world to her broader than great britain fellingham begged her if she thought favourably of him to prepare her father for the purport of his visit if otherwise she was to interdict the visit with as little delay as possible and cut him adrift a decided line of conduct was imperative yet you have seen that she was not in love she was only not unwilling to be in love and fellingham was just a trifle warmed now mark what events will do to light the fires van diemen and tinman old chums reunited and both successful in life had nevertheless as mrs crickledon said their differences they commenced with an opposition to tinmans views regarding the expenditure of town moneys tinman was ever for devoting them to the patriotic defence of our shores whereas van diemen pointing in detestation of the town sewerage reeking across the common under the beach loudly called on him to preserve our lives by way of commencement then van diemen precipitately purchased elba at a high valuation and tinman had expected by waiting to buy it at his own valuation and sell it out of friendly consideration to his friend afterwards for a friendly consideration van diemen had joined the hunt tinman could not mount a horse they had not quarrelled but they had snapped about these and other affairs van diemen fancied tinman was jealous of his wealth tinman shrewdly suspected van diemen to be contemptuous of his dignity he suffered a loss in a loan of money and instead of pitying him van diemen had laughed him to scorn for expecting security for investments at ten per cent the bitterness of the pinch to tinman made him frightfully sensitive to strictures on his discretion in his anguish he told his sister he was ruined and she advised him to marry before the crash she was aware that he exaggerated but she repeated her advice she went so far as to name the person this is known because she was overheard by her housemaid a gossip of mrs crickledons the subsequently famous little jane now annette had shyly intimated to her father the nature of herbert fellinghams letter at the same time professing a perfect readiness to submit to his directions and her fathers perplexity was very great for annette had rather fervently dramatized the young mans words at the ball at helmstone which had pleasantly tickled him and besides he liked the young man on the other hand he did not at all like the prospect of losing his daughter and he would have desired her to be a lady of title he hinted at her right to claim a high position annette shrank from the prospect saying never let me marry one who might be ashamed of my father i shouldnt stomach that said van diemen more disposed in favour of the present suitor annette was now in a tremor she had a lover he was coming and if he did not come did it matter not so very much except to her pride and if he did what was she to say to him she felt like an actress who may in a few minutes be called on the stage without knowing her part this was painfully unlike love and the poor girl feared it would be her conscientious duty to dismiss himmost gently of course and perhaps should he be impetuous and picturesque relent enough to let him hope and so bring about a happy postponement of the question her father had been to a neighbouring town on business with mr tinman he knocked at her door at midnight and she in dread of she knew not whatchiefly that the hour of the scene had somehow struckstepped out to him trembling he was alone she thought herself the most childish of mortals in supposing that she could have been summoned at midnight to declare her sentiments and hardly noticed his gloomy depression he asked her to give him five minutes then asked her for a kiss and told her to go to bed and sleep but annette had seen that a great present affliction was on him and she would not be sent to sleep she promised to listen patiently to bear anything to be brave is it bad news from home she said speaking of the old home where she had not left her heart and where his money was invested its this my dear netty said van diemen suffering her to lead him into her sittingroom we shall have to leave the shores of england then we are ruined were not the rascal cant do that we might be off to the continent or we might go to america weve money but we cant stay here ill not live at any mans mercy the continent america exclaimed the enthusiast for england oh papa you love living in england so not so much as all that my dear you do that i know but i dont see how its to be managed mart tinman and i have been at tooth and claw today and half the night and he has thrown off the mask or hes dashed something from my sight i dont know which i knocked him down papa i picked him up oh cried annette has mr tinman been hurt he called me a deserter anisette shuddered she did not know what this thing was but the name of it opened a cabinet of horrors and she touched her father timidly to assure him of her constant love and a little to reassure herself of his substantial identity and i am one van diemen made the confession at the pitch of his voice i am a deserter im liable to be branded on the back and its in mart tinmans power to have me marched away tomorrow morning in the sight of crikswich and all i can say for myself as a man and a briton is i did not desert before the enemy that i swear i never would have done death if deaths in front but your poor mother was a handsome woman my child and therei could not go on living in barracks and leaving her unprotected i cant tell a young woman the tale a hundred pounds came on me for a legacy as plump in my hands out of open heaven and your poor mother and i saw our chance we consulted and we determined to risk it and i got on board with her and you and over the seas we went first to shipwreck ultimately to fortune van diemen laughed miserably they noticed in the huntingfield here i had a soldierlike seat a soldierlike seat itll be with a brand on it i shant be asked to take a soldierlike seat at any of their tables again i may at mart tinmans out of pity after ive undergone my punishment theres a year still to run out of the twenty of my term of service due he knows it hes been reckoning he has me but the worst catoninetails for me is the disgrace to have myself pointed at there goes the deserter he was a private in the carbineers and he deserted no onell say ay but he clung to the idea of his old schoolmate when abroad and came back loving him and trusted him and was deceived van diemen produced a spasmodic cough with a blow on his chest anisette was weeping there now go to bed said he i wish you might have known no more than you did of our flight when i got you on board the ship with your poor mother but youre a young woman now and you must help me to think of another cut and run and what baggage we can scrape together in a jiffy for i wont live here at mart tinmans mercy drying her eyes to weep again annette said when she could speak will nothing quiet him i was going to bother you with all sorts of silly questions poor dear papa but i see i can understand if i try will nothingis he so very angry can we not do something to pacify him he is fond of money heoh the thought of leaving england papa it will kill you you set your whole heart on england we couldi couldcould i not do you not thinkstep between you as a peacemaker mr tinman is always very courteous to me at these words of annettes van diemen burst into a short snap of savage laughter but thats far away in the background mr mart tinman he said you stick to your game i know that but youll find me flown though i leave a name to stink like your common behind me and he added as a chill reminder that name the name of my benefactor poor old van diemen he thought it a safe bequest to make it was it is we will stay we will not be exiled said annette i will do anything what was the quarrel about papa the fact is my dear i just wanted to show himand take down his prideim by my australian education a shrewder hand than his old country i bought the house on the beach while he was chaffering and then i sold it him at a rise when the town was looking uponly to make him see then he burst up about something i said of australia i will have the common clean let him live at the crouch as my tenant if he finds the house on the beach in danger papa i am sure annette repeatedsure i have influence with mr tinman there are those lips of yours shutting tight said her father just listen and they make a big o the donkey he owns youve got influence and he offers hell be silent if youll pledge your word to marry him im not sure he didnt say within the year i told him to look sharp not to be knocked down again mart tinman for my soninlaw thats an upside down of my expectations as good as being at the antipodes without a second voyage back i let him know you were engaged annette gazed at her father openmouthed as he had predicted now with a little chilly dimple at one corner of the mouth now at anotheras a breeze curves the leaden winter lake here and there she could not get his meaning into her sight and she sought by looking hard to understand it better much as when some solitary maiden lady passing into her bedchamber in the hours of darkness beholdstradition telling us she has absolutely beheld foot of burglar under bed and lo she stares and cunningly to moderate her horror doubts yet cannot but believe that there is a leg and a trunk and a head and two terrible arms bearing pistols to follow sick she palpitates she compresses her trepidation she coughs perchance she sings a bar or two of an aria glancing down again thrice horrible to her is it to discover that there is no foot for had it remained it might have been imagined a harmless empty boot but the withdrawal has a deadly significance of animal life in like manner our stricken annette perceived the object so did she gradually apprehend the fact of her being asked for tinmans bride and she could not think it credible she half scented she devised her plan of escape from another single mention of it but on her fathers remarking with a shuffle frightened by her countenance dont listen to what i said netty i wont paint him blacker than he isthen annette was sure she had been proposed for by mr tinman and she fancied her father might have revolved it in his mind that there was this means of keeping tinman silent silent for ever in his own interests it was not true when you told mr tinman i was engaged papa she said no i know that mart tinman only halfkind of hinted come i say wheres the unmarried man wouldnt like to have a girl like you netty they say hes been rejected all round a circuit of fifteen miles and hes not badlooking neitherhe looks fresh and fair but i thought it as well to let him know he might get me at a disadvantage but he couldnt you now dont think about it my love not if it is not necessary papa said annette and employed her familiar sweetness in persuading him to go to bed as though he were the afflicted one requiring to be petted chapter vii round under the cliffs by the sea facing south are warm seats in winter the sun that shines there on a day of frost wraps you as in a mantle here it was that mr herbert fellingham found annette a chalkblock for her chair and a mound of chalkrubble defending her from the keentipped breath of the east now and then shadowing the smooth blue water faintly like reflections of a flight of gulls infants are said to have their ideas and why not young ladies those who write of their perplexities in descriptions comical in their length are unkind to them by making them appear the simplest of the creatures of fiction and most of us i am sure would incline to believe in them if they were only some bit more lightly touched those troubled sentiments of our young lady of the comfortable classes are quite worthy of mention her poor little eye poring as little fishlike as possible upon the intricate which she takes for the infinite has its place in our history nor should we any of us miss the pathos of it were it not that so large a space is claimed for the exposure as it is one has almost to fight a battle to persuade the world that she has downright thoughts and feelings and really a superhuman delicacy is required in presenting her that she may be credible even thenso much being accomplished the thousands accustomed to chapters of her when she is in the situation of annette will be disappointed by short sentences just as of old the continental eater of oysters would have been offended at the offer of an exchange of two live for two dozen dead ones annette was in the grand crucial position of english imaginative prose i recognize it and that to this the streamlets flow thence pours the flood but what was the plain truth she had brought herself to think she ought to sacrifice herself to tinman and her evasions with herbert manifested in tricks of coldness alternating with tones of regret ended as they had commenced in a mysterious halfsullenness she had hardly a word to say let me step in again to observe that she had at the moment no pointed intention of marrying tinman to her mind the circumstances compelled her to embark on the idea of doing so and she saw the extremity in an extreme distance as those who are taking voyages may see death by drowning still she had embarked at all events i have your word for it that you dont dislike me said herbert oh no she sighed she liked him as emigrants the land they are leaving and you have not promised your hand no she said but sighed in thinking that if she could be induced to promise it there would not be a word of leaving england then as you are not engaged and dont hate me i have a chance he said in the semiwailful interrogative of an organ making a mere windy conclusion ocean sent up a tiny wave at their feet a day like this in winter is rarer than a summer day herbert resumed encouragingly annette was replying people abuse our climate but the thought of having to go out away from this climate in the darkness of exile with her father to suffer under it worse than herself overwhelmed her and fetched the reality of her sorrow in the form of tinman swimming before her soul with the velocity of a telegraphpole to the window of the flying train it was past as soon as seen but it gave her a desperate sensation of speed she began to feel that this was life in earnest and herbert should have been more resolute fierier she needed a strong will but he was not on the rapids of the masterful passion for though going at a certain pace it was by his own impulsion and i am afraid i must with many apologies compare him to the skaterto the skater on easy slippery ice be it understood but he could perform gyrations as he went and he rather sailed along than dashed he was careful of his figuring some lovers right honest lovers never get beyond this quaint skatingstage and some ladies a right goodly number in a foggy climate deceived by their occasional runs ahead take them for vessels on the very torrent of love let them take them and let the race continue only we perceive that they are skating they are careering over a smooth icy floor and they can stop at a signal with just halfayard of grating on the heel at the outside ice and not fire nor falling water has been their medium of progression whether a man should unveil his own sex is quite another question if we are detected not solely are we done for but our lovetales too however there is not much ground for anxiety on that head each member of the other party is blind on her own account to annette the figuring of herbert was graceful but it did not catch her up and carry her it hardly touched her he spoke well enough to make her sorry for him and not warmly enough to make her forget her sorrow for herself herbert could obtain no explanation of the singularity of her conduct from annette and he went straight to her father who was nearly as inexplicable for a time at last he said if you are ready to quit the country with us you may have my consent why quit the country herbert asked in natural amazement van diemen declined to tell him but seeing the young man look stupefied and wretched he took a turn about the room and said i have nt robbed and after more turns i have nt murdered he growled in his menagerie trot within the four walls but im in a mans power will that satisfy you youll tell me because im rich to snap my fingers i cant ive got feelings im in his power to hurt me and disgrace me its the disgraceto my disgrace i say iti dread most youd be up to my reason if you had ever served in a regiment i mean disciplineif ever youd known disciplinein the police if you likeanythinganywhere where theres what we used to call spiny de cor i mean at school and im said van diemen a rank idiot double d dolt and flat as a pancake and transparent as a pane of glass you see through me anybody could i cant talk of my botheration without betraying myself what good am i among you sharp fellows in england language of this kind by virtue of its unintelligibility set mr herbert fellinghams acute speculations at work he was obliged to lean on van diemens assertion that he had not robbed and had not murdered to be comforted by the belief that he was not once a notorious bushranger or a defaulting manager of mines or any other thing that is naughtily australian and kangarooly he sat at the dinnertable at elba eating like the rest of mankind and looking like a starved beggarman all the while annette in pity of his bewilderment would have had her father take him into their confidence she suggested it covertly and next she spoke of it to him as a prudent measure seeing that mr fellingham might find out his exact degree of liability van diemen shouted he betrayed himself in his weakness as she could not have imagined him he was ready to go he saidgo on the spot give up elba fly from old england what he could not do was to let his countrymen know what he was and live among them afterwards he declared that the fact had eternally been present to his mind devouring him and annette remembered his kindness to the artillerymen posted along the shore westward of crikswich though she could recall no sign of remorse van diemen said we have to do with martin tinman thats one who has a hold on me and ones enough leak out my secret to a second fellow you double my risks he would not be taught to see how the second might counteract the first the singularity of the action of his character on her position was that though she knew not a soul to whom she could unburden her wretchedness and stood far more isolated than in her australian home fever and chill struck her blood in contemplation of the necessity of quitting england deep then was her gratitude to dear good mrs cavely for stepping in to mediate between her father and mr tinman and well might she be amazed to hear the origin of their recent dispute it was mrs cavely said that gippsland annette cried what that gippsland of yours my dear your father will praise gippsland whenever my martin asks him to admire the beauties of our neighbourhood many a time has martin come home to me complaining of it we have no doubt on earth that gippsland is a very fine place but my brother has his ideas of dignity you must know and i only wish he had been more used to contradiction you may believe me he is a lamb by nature and as he says why underrate ones own country he cannot bear to hear boasting well i put it to you dear annette is he so unimportant a person he asks to be respected and especially by his dearest friend from that to blows its the way with men they begin about trifles they drink they quarrel and one does what he is sorry for and one says more than he means all my martin desires is to shake your dear fathers hand forgive and forget to win your esteem darling annette he would humble himself in the dust will you not help me to bring these two dear old friends together once more it is unreasonable of your dear papa to go on boasting of gippsland if he is so fond of england now is it not my brother is the offended party in the eye of the law that is quite certain do you suppose he dreams of taking advantage of it he is waiting at home to be told he may call on your father rank dignity wounded feelings is nothing to him in comparison with friendship annette thought of the blow which had felled him and spoke the truth of her heart in saying he is very generous you understand him mrs cavely pressed her hand we will both go to your dear father he may she added not without a gleam of feminine archness praise gippsland above the himalayas to me what my martin so much objected to was the speaking of gippsland at all when there was mention of our lake scenery as for me i know how men love to boast of things nobody else has seen the two ladies went in company to van diemen who allowed himself to be melted he was reserved nevertheless his reception of mr tinman displeased his daughter annette attached the blackest importance to a blow of the fist in her mind it blazed fiendlike and the man who forgave it rose a step or two on the sublime especially did he do so considering that he had it in his power to dismiss her father and herself from bright beaming england before she had looked on all the cathedrals and churches the seashores and spots named in printed poetry to say nothing of the nobility papa you were not so kind to mr tinman as i could have hoped said annette mart tinman has me at his mercy and hell make me know it her father returned gloomily he may let me off with the commanderinchief hell blast my reputation some day though i shall be hanging my head in society through him van diemen imitated the disconsolate appearance of a gallows body in one of those rapid flashes of spontaneous verisimilitude which spring of an inborn horror painting itself on the outside a deserter he moaned he succeeded in impressing the terrible nature of the stigma upon annettes imagination the guest at elba was busy in adding up the sum of his own impressions and dividing it by this and that new circumstance for he was totally in the dark he was attracted by the mysterious interview of mrs cavely and annette tinmans calling and departing set him upon new calculations annette grew cold and visibly distressed by her consciousness of it she endeavoured to account for this variation of mood we have been invited to dine at the house on the beach tomorrow i would not have accepted but papa we seemed to think it a duty of course the invitation extends to you we fancy you do not greatly enjoy dining there the table will be laid for you here if you prefer herbert preferred to try the skill of mrs crickledon now for positive penetration the head prepossessed by a suspicion is unmatched for where there is no daylight this one at least goes about with a lantern herbert begged mrs crickledon to cook a dinner for him and then to give the right colour to his absence from the table of mr tinman he started for a winter days walk over the downs as sharpening a business as any young fellow blunt or keen may undertake excellent for men of the pen whether they be creative and produce or slaughtering and review good then for the silly sheep of letters and the butchers he sat down to mrs crickledons table at halfpast six she was as she had previously informed him a fortypoundayear cook at the period of her courting by crickledon that zealous and devoted husband had made his first excursion inland to drop over the downs to the great house and fetch her away as his bride on the death of her master sir alfred pooney who never would have parted with her in life and every day of that mans life he dirtied thirteen plates at dinner nor more nor less but exactly that number as if he believed there was luck in it and as crickledon said it was odd but it was always a pleasure to cook for him mrs crickledon could not abide cooking for a mean eater and when crickledon said he had never seen an acorn he might have seen one had he looked about him in the great park under the oaks on the day when he came to be married then its a standing compliment to you mrs crickledon that he did not said herbert he remarked with the sententiousness of enforced philosophy that no wine was better than bad wine mrs crickledon spoke of a bottle left by her summer lodgers who had indeed left two calling the wine invalids wine and she and her husband had opened one on the anniversary of their marriage day in october it had the taste of doctors shop they both agreed and as no friend of theirs could be tempted beyond a sip they were advised because it was called a tonic to mix it with the pigwash so that it should not be entirely lost but benefit the constitution of the pig herbert sipped at the remaining bottle and finding himself in the superior society of an old manzanilla refilled his glass nothing i knows of proves the difference between gentlefolks and poor persons as tastes in wine said mrs crickledon admiring him as she brought in a dish of cutletswith sir alfred pooneys favourite sauce soubise wherein rightly onion should be delicate as the idea of love in maidens thoughts albeit constituting the element of flavour something of such a dictum sir alfred pooney had imparted to his cook and she repeated it with the fresh elegance of such sweet sayings when transfused through the native mind he said i like as it was what you would call a young gals blush at a kiss round a corner the epicurean baronet had the habit of talking in that way herbert drank to his memory he was wellfilled he had no work to do and he was exuberant in spirits as mrs crickledon knew her countrymen should and would be under those conditions and suddenly he drew his hand across a forehead so wrinkled and dark that mrs crickledon exclaimed heart or stomach oh no said he im sound enough in both i hope that old tinmans up to one of his games she observed do you think so hes circumventing miss annette smith pooh crickledon a man of his age cant be seriously thinking of proposing for a young lady hes a wellkept man hes never racketed he had nt the rackets in him and she may nt care for him but we hear things drop what things have you heard drop crickledon in a profound silence you may hear pins in a hubbub you may hear cannonballs but i never believe in eavesdropping gossip he was heard to say to mr smith crickledon pursued and she lowered her voice he was heard to say it was when they were quarreling over that chiwal and they went at one another pretty hard before mr smith beat him and he sold mr smith that meadow he was heard to say there was worse than transportation for mr smith if he but lifted his finger they tinmans have awful tempers his old mother died malignant though she was a saving woman and never owed a penny to a christian a hour longer than it took to pay the money and old tinmans just such another transportation herbert ejaculated thats sheer nonsense crickledon im sure your husband would tell you so it was my husband brought me the words mrs crickledon rejoined with some triumph he did tell me i own to keep it shut but my speaking to you a friend of mr smiths wont do no harm he heard them under the battery over that chiwal glass and you shall pay says mr smith and i shant says old tinman mr smith said he would have it if he had to squeeze a deathbed confession from a sinner then old tinman fires out you he says you and he stammered mr smith my husband said and you never saw a man so shocked as my husband at being obliged to hear them at one another mr smith used the word damn you may laugh sir you say it so capitally crickledon and then old tinman said and a d to you and if i lift my finger its big d on your back and what did mr smith say then he said like a man shot my husband says he said my god herbert fellingham jumped away from the table you tell me crickledon your husband actually heard thatjust those wordsthe tones my husband says he heard him say my god just like a poor man shot or stabbed you may speak to crickledon if you speaks to him alone sir i say you ought to know for ive noticed mr smith since that day has never looked to me the same easyminded happy gentleman he was when we first knew him he would have had me go to cook for him at elba but crickledon thought id better be independent and mr smith said to me perhaps youre right crickledon for who knows how long i may be among you herbert took the solace of tobacco in crickledons shop thence with the story confirmed to him he sauntered toward the house on the beach chapter viii the moon was over sea coasting vessels that had run into the bay for shelter from the north wind lay with their shadows thrown shoreward on the cold smooth water almost to the verge of the beach where there was neither breath nor sound of wind only the lisp at the pebbles mrs crickledons dinner and the state of his heart made young fellingham indifferent to a wintry atmosphere it sufficed him that the night was fair he stretched himself on the shingle thinking of the manzanilla and annette and the fine flavour given to tobacco by a dry still air in moonlightthinking of his work too in the background as far as mental lassitude would allow of it the idea of taking annette to see his first play at the theatre when it should be performedwas very soothing the beach rather looked like a stage and the sea like a ghostly audience with if you will the broadside bulks of black sailing craft at anchor for representatives of the newspaper piers annette was a nice girl if a little commonplace and lowborn yet sweet what a subject he could make of her father the deserter offered a new complication fellingham rapidly sketched it in fancyvan diemen as a member of the parliament of great britain led away from the house of commons to be branded on the bank what a magnificent fall we have so few intensely dramatic positions in english real life that the meditative author grew enamoured of this one and laughed out a royal ha like a monarch reviewing his wellappointed soldiery there you are said van diemens voice i smelt your pipe youre a rum fellow to belying out on the beach on a cold night lord i dont like you the worse for it twas for the romance of the moon in my young days where is annette said fellingham jumping to his feet my daughter she s taking leave of her intended whats that fellingham gasped good heavens mr smith what do you mean pick up your pipe my lad girls choose as they please i suppose her intended did you say sir what can that mean my dear good young fellow dont make a fuss were all going to stay here and very glad to see you from time to time the fact is i oughtnt to have quarrelled with mart tinman as ive done im too peppery by nature the fact is i struck him and he forgave it i could nt have done that myself and i believe im in for a headache tomorrow upon my soul i do mart tinman would champagne us but poor old boy i struck him and i couldnt make amendsdidnt see my way and we joined hands over the glassto the deuce with the glassand the end of it is nettyshe did nt propose it but as im in hisi say as i had struck him sheit was rather solemn if you had seen usshe burst into tears and there was mrs cavely and old mart and me as big a foolif im not a villain fellingham perceived a more than common effect of tin mans wine he touched van diemen on the shoulder may i beg to hear exactly what has happened upon my soul were all going to live comfortably in old england and no more quarreling and decamping was the stupid rejoinder except that i did nt exactlyi think you said i exactlyi did nt bargain for old mart as mybut hes a sound man marts my junior hes rich hes eco hes eco you knowmy lord wheres my brainsbut hes uprightnomical an economical man said fellingham with sedate impatience my dear sir im heartily obliged to you for your assistance returned van diemen here she is annette had come out of the gate in the flint wall she started slightly on seeing herbert whom she had taken for a coastguard she said he bowed he kept his head bent peering at her intrusively its the air on champagne van diemen said calling on his lungs to clear themselves and right him i was nt a bit queer in the house the air on tinmans champagne said fellingham it must be like the contact of two hostile chemical elements annette walked faster they descended from the shingle to the scantbladed grasssweep running round the salted townrefuse on toward elba van diemen sniffed ejaculating ill be best man with mart tinman about this business youll stop with us mrwhats your christian name stop with us as long as you like old friends for me the joke of it is that nelson was my man and yet i went and enlisted in the cavalry if you talk of chemical substances old mart tinman was a sneak who never cared a dump for his country and im not to speak a single sybbarel about that over there australia gippsland so down he went clean over very sorry for what we have done contrite penitent now we feel the wind a little said annette fellingham murmured allow me your shawl is flying loose he laid his hands on her arms and pressing her in a tremble said one sign its not true a word do you hate me thank you very much but i am not cold she replied and linked herself to her father van diemen immediately shouted for we are jolly boys for we are jolly boys its the air on the champagne and hang me said he as they entered the grounds of elba if i dont walk over my property annette interposed she stood like a reed in his way no my lord ill see what i sold you for he cried im an owner of the soil of old england and care no more for the title of squire than napoleon bonaparty but ill tell you what mr hubbard your mother was never so astonished at her dog as old van diemen would be to hear himself called squire in old england and a convict he was for he did wrong once but he worked his redemption and the smell of my own property makes me feel my legs again and ill tell you what mr hubbard as netty calls you when she speaks of you in private mart tinmans ideas of wine are pretty much like his ideas of healthy smells and when im bailiff of crikswich mind hell find two to one against him in our town council i love my country but hang me if i dont purify it saying this with the excitement of a high resolve a upon him van diemen bored through a shrubberybrake and fellingham said to annette have i lost you i belong to my father said she contracting and disengaging her feminine garments to step after him in the cold silverspotted dusk of the winter woods van diemen came out on a fishpond here you are young ones he said to the pair this way fellowman im clearer now and its my belief ive been talking nonsense im puffed up with money and have nt the heart i once had i say fellowman fellowbird hubbardwhats your right namefancy an old carp fished out of that pond and flung into the sea thats exile and if the girl dont mind what does it matter mr herbert fellingham i think would like to go to bed papa said annette miss smith must be getting cold fellingham hinted bounce away indoors replied van diemen and he led them like a bull annette was disinclined to leave them together in the smokingroom and under the pretext of wishing to see her father to bed she remained with them though there was a novel directness and heat of tone in herbert that alarmed her and with reason he divined in hideous outlines what had happened he was no longer figuring on easy ice but desperate at the prospect of a loss to himself and a fate for annette that tossed him from repulsion to incredulity and so back van diemen begged him to light his pipe im off to london tomorrow said fellingham i dont want to go for very particular reasons i may be of more use there i have a cousin whos a general officer in the army and if i have your permissionyou see anythings better as it seems to me than that you should depend for peace and comfort on one mans tongue not wagging especially when he is not the best of tempers if i have your permissionwithout mentioning names of courseill consult him there was a dead silence you know you may trust me sir i love your daughter with all my heart your honour and your interests are mine van diemen struggled for composure netty what have you been at he said it is untrue papa she answered the unworded accusation annette has told me nothing sir i have heard it you must brace your mind to the fact that it is known what is known to mr tinman is pretty sure to be known generally at the next disagreement that scoundrel mart van diemen muttered i am positive mr tinman did not speak of you papa said annette and turned her eyes from the halfparalyzed figure of her father on herbert to put him to proof no but he made himself heard when it was being discussed at any rate its known and the thing to do is to meet it im off ill not stop a day id rather live on the continent said van diemen shaking himself as to prepare for the step into that desert mr tinman has been most generous annette protested tearfully i wont say no i think you are deceived and lend him your own generosity said herbert can you suppose it generous that even in the extremest case he should speak of the matter to your father and talk of denouncing him he did it he was provoked a gentleman is distinguished by his not allowing himself to be provoked i am engaged to him and i cannot hear it said that he is not a gentleman the first part of her sentence annette uttered bravely at the conclusion she broke down she wished herbert to be aware of the truth that he might stay his attacks on mr tinman and she believed he had only been guessing the circumstances in which her father was placed but the comparison between her two suitors forced itself on her now when the younger one spoke in a manner so selfcontained brief and full of feeling she had to leave the room weeping has your daughter engaged herself sir said herbert talk to me tomorrow dont give us up if she has we were trapped its my opinion said van diemen theres the devil in that wine ofmart tinmans i feel it still and in the morning itll be worse what can she see in him i must quit the country carry her off how he did it i dont know it was that woman the widow the fellows sister she talked till she piped her eyetalked about our lasting union on my soul i believe i egged netty on i was in a mollified way with that wine all of a sudden the woman joins their hands and ia man of spirit will despise mewhat i thought of was now my secrets safe youve sobered me young sir i see myself if thats being sober i dont ask your opinion of me i am a deserter false to my colours a breaker of his oath only mark this i was married and a common trooper married to a handsome young woman true as steel but she was handsome and we were starvation poor and she had to endure persecution from an officer day by day bear that situation in your mind providence dropped me a hundred pounds out of the sky properly speaking it popped up out of the earth for i reaped it you may say from a relatives grave rich and poor s all right if im rich and youre poor and you may be happy though youre poor but where there are many poor young women lots of rich men are a terrible temptation to them thats my dear good wife speaking and had she been spared to me i never should have come back to old england and hearts delight and heartache i should not have known she was my backbone she was my breastcomforter too why did she stick to me because i had faith in her when appearances were against her but she never forgave this country the hurt to her womans pride youll have noticed a squarish jaw in netty thats her mother and i shall have to encounter it supposing i find mart tinman has been playing me false im blown on somehow ill think of what course ill take twixt now and morning good night young gentleman good night sir said herbert adding i will get information from the horse guards as for the people knowing it about here youre not living much in society its not other peoples feelings its my own van diemen silenced him i feel it if its in the wind ever since mart tinman spoke the thing out ive felt on my skin cold and hot he flourished his lighted candle and went to bed manifestly solaced by the idea that he was the victim of his own feelings herbert could not sleep annettes monstrous choice of tinman in preference to himself constantly assailed and shook his understanding there was the squarish jaw mentioned by her father to think of it filled him with a vague apprehension but he was unable to imagine that a young girl and an english girl and an enthusiastic young english girl could be devoid of sentiment and presuming her to have it as one must there was no fear that she would persist in her loathsome choice when she knew her father was against it chapter ix annette did not shun him next morning she did not shun the subject either but she had been exact in arranging that she should not be more than a few minutes downstairs before her father herbert found that compared with her girls of sentiment are commonplace indeed she had conceived an insane idea of nobility in tinman that blinded her to his face figure and characterhis manners likewise he had forgiven a blow silly as the delusion might be it clothed her in whimsical attractiveness it was a beauty in her to dwell so firmly upon moral quality overthrown and stunned as he was and reduced to helplessness by her brief and positive replies herbert was obliged to admire the singular young lady who spoke without much shyness of her incongruous destined mate though his admiration had an edge cutting like irony while in the turn for candour she ought to have told him that previous to her decision she had weighed the case of the diverse claims of himself and tinman and resolved them according to her predilection for the peaceful residence of her father and herself in england this she had done a little regretfully because of the natural sympathy of the young girl for the younger man but the younger man had seemed to her seriouslystraightforward mind too light and airy in his wooing like one of her waltzing officersvery well so long as she stepped the measure with him and not forcible enough to take her off her feet he had changed and now that he had become persuasive she feared he would disturb the serenity with which she desired and strove to contemplate her decision tinmans magnanimity was present in her imagination to sustain her though she was aware that mrs cavely had surprised her will and caused it to surrender unconsulted by her wiser intelligence i cannot listen to you she said to herbert after listening longer than was prudent if what you say of papa is true i do not think he will remain in crikswich or even in england but i am sure the old friend we used to speak of so much in australia has not wilfully betrayed him herbert would have had to say look on us two to proceed in his baffled wooing and the very ludicrousness of the contrast led him to see the folly and shame of proposing it van diemen came down to breakfast looking haggard and restless i have nt had my mornings walki cant go out to be hooted he said calling to his daughter for tea and strong tea and explaining to herbert that he knew it to be bad for the nerves but it was an antidote to bad champagne mr herbert fellingham had previously received an invitation on behalf of a sister of his to crikswich a dull sense of genuine sagacity inspired him to remind annette of it she wrote prettily to miss mary fellingham and herbert had some faint joy in carrying away the letter of her handwriting fetch her soon for we shant be here long van diemen said to him at parting he expressed a certain dread of his next meeting with mart tinman herbert speedily brought mary fellingham to elba and left her there the situation was apparently unaltered van diemen looked worn like a man who has been feeding mainly on his reflections which was manifest in his few melancholy bits of speech he said to herbert how you feel a thing when you are found out and it doesnt do for a man with a heart to do wrong he designated the two principal roads by which poor sinners come to a conscience his own would have slumbered but for discovery and as he remarked if it had not been for his heart leading him to tinman he would not have fallen into that mans power the arrival of a young lady of fashionable appearance at elba was matter of cogitation to mrs cavely she was disposed to suspect that it meant something and van diemens behaviour to her brother would of itself have fortified any suspicion he did not call at the house on the beach he did not invite martin to dinner he was rarely seen and when he appeared at the town council he once or twice violently opposed his friend martin who came home ruffled deeply offended in his interests and his dignity have you noticed any difference in annettes treatment of you dear mrs cavely inquired no said tinman none she shakes hands she asks after my health she offers me my cup of tea i have seen all that but does she avoid privacy with you dear me no why should she i hope martha i am a man who may be confided in by any young lady in england i am sure you may dear martin she has an objection to name the the day said martin i have informed her that i have an objection to long engagements i dont like her new companion she says she has been presented at court i greatly doubt it its to give herself a style you may depend i dont believe her exclaimed mrs cavely with sharp personal asperity brother and sister examined together the court guide they had purchased on the occasion at once of their largest outlay and most thrilling gratification in it they certainly found the name of general fellingham but he cant be related to a newspaperwriter said mrs cavely to which her brother rejoined unless the young man turned scamp i hate unproductive professions i hate him martin mrs cavely laughed in scorn i should say i pity him its as clear to me as the sun at noonday he wanted annette thats why i was in a hurry how i dreaded he would come that evening to our dinner when i saw him absent i could have cried out it was providence and so be carefulwe have had everything done for us from on high as yetbut be careful of your temper dear martin i will hasten on the union for its a shame of a girl to drag a man behind her till he s old at the altar temper dear if you will only think of it is the weak point now he has begun boasting to me of his australian wines tinman ejaculated bear it bear it as you do gippsland my dear you have the retort in your heartyes but have you a court in australia ha and his australian wines cost twice the amount i pay for mine quite true we are not obliged to buy them i should hope i would thougha dozenif i thought it necessary to keep him quiet tinman continued muttering angrily over the australian wines with a word of irritation at gippsland while promising to be watchful of his temper what good is australia to us he asked if it does nt bring us money its going to my dear said mrs cavely think of that when he begins boasting his australia and though its convicts money as he confesses with his convicts money tinman interjected tremblingly how long am i expected to wait rely on me to hurry on the day said mrs cavely there is no other annoyance wherever i am going to buy that man outbids me and then says its the old countrys want of pluck and dash and doing things largehanded a man whod go on his knees to stop in england tinman vociferated in a breath and fairly reddened by the effort he may have to do it yet i cant stand insult you are less able to stand insult after honours his sister said in obedience to what she had observed of him since his famous visit to london it must be so in nature but temper is everything just now remember it was by command of temper and letting her father put himself in the wrong you got hold of annette and i would abstain even from wine for sometimes after it you have owned it disagreed and i have noticed these eruptions between you and mr smithas he calls himselfgenerally after wine always the poor the poor money for the poor tinman harped on further grievances against van diemen i say doctors have said the drain on the common is healthy its a healthy smell nourishing weve always had it and been a healthy town but the sea encroaches and i say my house and my property is in danger he buys my house over my head and offers me the crouch to live in at an advanced rent and then he sells me my house at an advanced price and i buy and then he votes against a penny for the protection of the shore and were in winter again as if he was not in my power my dear martin to elba we go and soon if you will govern your temper said mrs cavely youre an angel to let me speak of it so and its only that man that irritates you i call him sinfully ostentatious i could blow him from a gun if i spoke out and he knows it hes wanting in common gratitude let alone respect tinman snorted but he has a daughter my dear tinman slowly and crackingly subsided his main grievance against van diemen was the nonrecognition of his importance by that uncultured australian who did not seem to be conscious of the dignities and distinctions we come to in our country the moneyed daughter the prospective marriage for an economical man rejected by every lady surrounding him advised him to lock up his temper in submission to martha bring annette to dine with us he said on marthas proposing a visit to the dear young creature martha drank a glass of her brothers wine at lunch and departed on the mission annette declined to be brought her excuse was her guest miss fellingham bring her too by all meansif youll condescend i am sure mrs cavely said to mary i am much obliged to you i do not dine out at present said the london lady dear me are you ill no nothing in the family i hope my family i am sure i beg pardon said mrs cavely bridling with a spite pardonable by the severest moralist can i speak to you alone she addressed annette miss fellingham rose mrs cavely confronted her i cant allow it i cant think of it im only taking a little liberty with one i may call my future sisterinlaw shall i come out with you said annette in sheer lassitude assisting mary fellingham in her scheme to show the distastefulness of this lady and her brother not if you dont wish to i have no objection another time will do will you write by post indeed mrs cavely delivered a laugh supposed to be peculiar to the english stage it would be a penny thrown away said annette i thought you could send a messenger intercommunication with miss fellingham had done mischief to her high moral conception of the pair inhabiting the house on the beach mrs cavely saw it and could not conceal that she smarted her counsel to her brother after recounting the offensive scene to him in animated dialogue was to give van diemen a fright i wish i had not drunk that glass of sherry before starting she exclaimed both savagely and sagely its best after business and these gentlemens habits of yours of taking to dining late upset me im afraid i showed temper but you martin would not have borne onetenth of what i did how dare you say so her brother rebuked her indignantly and the house on the beach enclosed with difficulty a storm between brother and sister happily not heard outside because of loud winds raging nevertheless tinman pondered on marthas idea of the wisdom of giving van diemen a fright chapter x the english have been called a badtempered people but this is to judge of them by their manifestations whereas an examination into causes might prove them to be no worse tempered than that man is a bad sleeper who lies in a biting bed if a sagacious instinct directs them to discountenance realistic tales the realistic tale should justify its appearance by the discovery of an apology for the tormented souls once they sang madrigals once they danced on the green they revelled in their lusty humours without having recourse to the pun for fun an exhibition of hundreds of bare legs for jollity a sentimental wailing all in the throat for music evidence is procurable that they have been an artificiallyreared people feeding on the genius of inventors transposers adulterators instead of the products of nature for the last half century and it is unfair to affirm of them that they are positively this or that they are experiments they are the sons and victims of a desperate energy alluring by cheapness satiating with quantity that it may mount in the social scale at the expense of their tissues the land is in a state of fermentation to mount and the shop which has shot half their stars to their social zenith is what verily they would scald themselves to wash themselves free of nor is it in any degree a reprehensible sign that they should fly as from hue and cry the title of tradesman it is on the contrary the spot of sanity which bids us right cordially hope energy transferred to the moral sense may clear them yet meanwhile this beer this wine both are of a character to have killed more than the tempers of a less gifted people martin tinman invited van diemen smith to try the flavour of a wine that as he said he thought of laying down it has been hinted before of a strange effect upon the minds of men who knew what they were going to when they received an invitation to dine with tinman for the sake of a little social meeting at any cost they accepted it accepted it with a sigh midway as by engineering measurement between prospective and retrospective as nearly mechanical as things human may be like the mussulmans accustomed cry of kismet has it not been related of the little jew babe sucking at its mothers breast in jerusalem that this innocent long after the captivity would start convulsively relinquishing its feast and indulging in the purest hebrew lamentation of the most tenacious of races at the passing sound of a babylonian or a ninevite voice in some such manner did men unable to refuse deep in what remained to them of nature listen to tinman and so did van diemen sighing heavily under the operation of simple animal instinct you seem miserable said tinman not oblivious of his design to give his friend a fright do i no im all right van diemen replied im thinking of alterations at the hall before summer to accommodate guestsif i stay here i suppose you would not like to be separated from annette separated no i should think i shouldnt whod do it because i should not like to leave my good sister martha all to herself in a house so near the sea why not go to the crouch man thank you no thanks needed if you dont take advantage of the offer they were at the entrance to elba whither mr tinman was betaking himself to see his intended he asked if annette was at home and to his great stupefaction heard that she had gone to london for a week dissembling the spite aroused within him he postponed his very strongly fortified design and said you must be lonely van diemen informed him that it would be for a night only as young fellingham was coming down to keep him company at six oclock this evening then said tinman were not fashionable in winter hang me if i know when ever we were van diemen rejoined come though youd like to be youve got your ambition philip like other men respectable and respectedthat s my ambition mr mart tinman simpered with your wealth ay i m richfor a contented mind i m pretty sure you ll approve my new vintage said tinman its direct from oporto my winemerchant tells me on his word whats the price no no no try it first its rather a stiff price van diemen was partially reassured by the announcement what do you call a stiff price wellover thirty double that and you may have a chance now cried tinman exasperated how can a man from australia know anything about prices for port you cant divest your ideas of diggers prices youre like an intoxicating drink yourself on the tradesmen of our town you think it fineha ha i daresay philip i should be doing the same if i were up to your mark at my bankers we cant all of us be lords nor baronets catching up his temper thus cleverly he curbed that habitual runaway and retired from his old friends presence to explode in the society of the solitary martha annettes behaviour was as bitterly criticized by the sister as by the brother she has gone to those fellingham people and she may be thinking of jilting us mrs cavely said in that case i have no mercy cried her brother i have bornehe bowed with a professional spiritual humilityas i should but it may get past endurance i say i have borne enough and if the worst comes to the worst and i hand him over to the authoritiesi say i mean him no harm but he has struck me he beat me as a boy and he has struck me as a man and i say i have no thought of revenge but i cannot have him here and i say if i drive him out of the country back to his gippsland martin tinman quivered for speech probably for that which feedeth speech as is the way with angry men and whatwhat then said martha with the tender mellifluousness of sisterly reproach what good can you expect of letting temper get the better of you dear tinman did not enjoy her recent turn for usurping the lead in their consultations and he said tartly this good martha we shall get the hall at my price and be head people here which he raised his note which he a deserter has no right to pretend to give himself out to be what your feelings may be as an old inhabitant i dont know but i have always looked up to the people at elba hall and i say i dont like to have a deserter squandering convicts money therewith his fortypoundayear cook and his champagne at seventy a dozen its the luxury of sodom and gomorrah that does not prevent its being very nice to dine there said mrs cavely and it shall be our table for good if i have any management you mean me maam bellowed tinman not at all she breathed in dulcet contrast you are goodlooking martin but you have not half such pretty eyes as the person i mean i never ventured to dream of managing you martin i am thinking of the people at elba but why this extraordinary treatment of me martha shes a child having her head turned by those fellinghams but shes honourable she has sworn to me she would be honourable you do think i may as well give him a fright tinman inquired hungrily a sort of hint but very gentle martin do be gentlecasual likeas if you did nt want to say it get him on his gippsland then if he brings you to words you can always laugh back and say you will go to kew and see the fernery and fancy all that so high on helvellyn or the downs whymrs cavely at the end of her astute advices and cautionings as usual gave loose to her natural characterwhy that man came back to england at all with his boastings of gippsland i cant for the life of me find out it s a perfect mystery it is tinman sounded his voice at a great depth reflectively glad of taking the part she was perpetually assuming of late he put out his hand and said but it may have been ordained for our good martha true dear said she with an earnest sentiment of thankfulness to the power which had led him round to her way of thinking and feeling chapter xi annette had gone to the big metropolis which burns in colonial imaginations as the sun of cities and was about to see something of london under the excellent auspices of her new friend mary fellingham and a dense fog she was alarmed by the darkness a little in fear too of herbert and these feelings caused her to chide herself for leaving her father hearing her speak of her father sadly herbert kindly proposed to go down to crikswich on the very day of her coming she thanked him and gave him a taste of bitterness by smiling favourably on his offer but as he wished her to discern and take to heart the difference between one man and another in the light of a suitor he let her perceive that it cost him heavy pangs to depart immediately and left her to brood on his example mary fellingham liked annette she thought her a sensible girl of uncultivated sensibilities the reverse of thousands not commonplace therefore and that the sensibilities were expanding was to be seen in her gradual unreadiness to talk of her engagement to mr tinman though her intimacy with mary warmed daily she considered she was bound to marry the man at some distant date and did not feel unhappiness yet she had only felt uneasy when she had to greet and converse with her intended especially when the london young lady had been present herberts departure relieved her of the pressing sense of contrast she praised him to mary for his extreme kindness to her father and down in her unsounded heart desired that her father might appreciate it even more than she did herbert drove into crikswich at night and stopped at crickledons where he heard that van diemen was dining with tinman crickledon the carpenter permitted certain dry curves to play round his lips like miniature shavings at the name of tinman but herbert asked what is it now in vain and he went to crickledon the cook this union of the two crickledons male and female was an ideal one such as poor women dream of and men would do the same if they knew how poor they are each had a profession each was independent of the other each supported the fabric consequently there was mutual respect as between two pillars of a house each saw the others faults with a sly wink to the world and an occasional interchange of sarcasm that was tonic very strengthening to the wits without endangering the habit of affection crickledon the cook stood for her own opinions and directed the public conduct of crickledon the carpenter and if he went astray from the line she marked out she put it down to human nature to which she was tolerant he when she had not followed his advice ascribed it to the nature of women she never said she was the equal of her husband but the carpenter proudly acknowledged that she was as good as a man and he bore with foibles derogatory to such high stature by teaching himself to observe a neatness of domestic and general management that told him he certainly was not as good as a woman herbert delighted in them the cook regaled the carpenter with skilful tasty and economic dishes and the carpenter obedient to her supplications had promised in the event of his outliving her that no hands but his should have the making of her coffin it is so nice she said to think ones own husband will put together the box you are to lie in of his own make had they been even a doubtfully united pair the cooks anticipation of a comfortable coffin the work of the best carpenter in england would have kept them together and that which fine cookery does for the cementing of couples needs not to be recounted to those who have read a chapter or two of the natural history of the male sex crickledon my dear soul your husband is labouring with a bit of fun herbert said to her he would nt laugh loud at punch for fear of an action she replied he never laughs out till he gets to bed and has locked the door and when he does he says hush to me tinman is nt bailiff again just yet and where he has his bailiffs best court suit from you may ask he exercises in it off and on all the week at night and sometimes in the middle of the day herbert rallied her for her gossips credulity its truth she declared i have it from the maid of the house little jane whom he pays four pound a year for all the work of the house a clever little thing with her hands and her head she is and can read and write beautiful and shes a mind to leave em if they dont advance her she knocked and went in while he was full blaze and bowing his poll to his glass and now he turns the key and a child might know he was at it he cant be such a donkey and hes been seen at the window on the seaside whos your admiral staying at the house on the beach men have inquired as they come ashore my husband has heard it tinmans got it on his brain he might be cured by marriage to a soundheaded woman but he ll soon be wanting to walk about in silk legs if he stops a bachelor they tell me his old mother here had a dress value twenty pound and pomps inherited save as he may theres his leak herberts contempt for tinman was intense it was that of the young and ignorant who live in their imaginations like spendthrifts unaware of the importance of them as the food of life and of how necessary it is to seize upon the solider one among them for perpetual sustenance when the unsubstantial are vanishing the great event of his bailiffs term of office had become the sun of tinmans system he basked in its rays he meant to be again the proud official royally distinguished meantime though he knew not that his days were dull he groaned under the dulness and as cart or cab horses uncomplaining as a rule show their view of the nature of harness when they have release to frisk in a field it is possible that existence was made tolerable to the jogging man by some minutes of excitement in his bailiffs court suit really to pasture on our recollections we ought to dramatize them there is however only the testimony of a maid and a mariner to show that tinman did it and those are witnesses coming of particularly longbow classes given to magnify small items of fact on reaching the hall herbert found the fire alight in the smokingroom and soon after settling himself there he heard van diemens voice at the halldoor saying good night to tinman thank the lord there you are said van diemen entering the room i couldnt have hoped so much that rascal he turned round to the door he has been threatening me and then smoothing me hang his oil its combustible and hang the port hes for laying down as he calls it leave it to posterity says i why says he because the young ones ll be better able to take care of themselves says i and he insists on an explanation i gave it to him out he bursts like a wasps nest he may have said what he did say in temper he seemed sorry afterwardspoor old mart the scoundrel talked of horse guards and telegraph wires scoundrel but more ninny said herbert full of his contempt dare him to do his worst the general tells me they d be glad to overlook it at the guards even if they had all the facts branding s out of the question i swear it was done in my time cried van diemen all on fire its out of the question you might be advised to leave england for a few months as for the society here if i leave i leave for good my hearts broken im disappointed im deceived in my friend he and i in the old days whats come to him what on earth is it changes men who stop in england so it cant be the climate and did you mention my name to general fellingham certainly not said herbert but listen to me sir a moment why not get together halfadozen friends of the neighbourhood and make a clean breast of it englishmen like that kind of manliness and they are sure to ring sound to it i couldnt van diemen sighed its not a natural feeling i have about iti ve brooded on the word if i have a nightmare i see deserter written in sulphur on the black wall you cant remain at his mercy and be bullied as you are he makes you ill sir he wont do anything but hell go on worrying you id stop him at once id take the train tomorrow and get an introduction to the commanderinchief hes the very man to be kind to you in a situation like this the general would get you the introduction thats more to my taste but no i couldnt van diemen moaned in his weakness money has unmanned me i was nt this kind of man formerly nor more was mart tinman the traitor all the world seems changeing for the worse and england is nt what she used to be you let that man spoil it for you sir herbert related mrs crickledons tale of mr tinman adding hes an utter donkey i should defy him what i should do would be to let him know tomorrow morning that you dont intend to see him again blow for blow is the thing he requires hell be cringing to you in a week and youd like to marry annette said van diemen relishing nevertheless the advice whose origin and object he perceived so plainly of course i should said herbert franker still in his colour than his speech i dont see him my girls husband van diemen eyed the red hollow in the falling coals when i came first and found him a healthy man goodlooking enough for a trifle over forty i d have given her gladly she nodding yes now all my fear is shes in earnest upon my soul i had the notion old mart was a sort of a boy still playing man you know but how can you understand i fancied his airs and stiffness were put on thought i saw him burning true behind it who can tell he seems to be jealous of my buying property in his native town something frets him i ought never to have struck him theres my error and i repent it strike a friend i wonder he didnt go off to the horse guards at once i might have done it in his place if i found i couldnt lick him i should have tried kicking first yes shinning before peaching said herbert astonished almost as much as he was disgusted by the inveterate sentimental attachment of van diemen to his old friend martin tinman anticipated good things of the fright he had given the man after dinner he had undoubtedly yielded to temper forgetting pure policy which it is so exceeding difficult to practice but he had soothed the startled beast they had shaken hands at parting and tinman hoped that the week of annettes absence would enable him to mould her father young fellinghams appointment to come to elba had slipped mr tinmans memory it was annoying to see this intruder at all events hes not with annette said mrs cavely how long has her father to run on five months tinman replied he would have completed his term of service in five months and to think of his being a rich man because he deserted mrs cavely interjected oh i do call it immoral he ought to be apprehended and punished to be an example for the good of society if you lose time my dear martin your chance is gone hes wriggling now and if i could believe he talked us over to that young impudent who has nt a penny that he does nt get from his pen id say denounce him tomorrow i long for elba i hate this house it will be swallowed up some day i know it i have dreamt it elba at any cost depend upon it martin you have been foiled in your suits on account of the mean house you inhabit enter elba as that girls husband or go there to own it and girls will crawl to you you are a ridiculous woman martha said tinman not dissenting the mixture of an idea of public duty with a feeling of personal rancour is a strong incentive to the pursuit of a stern line of conduct and the glimmer of selfinterest superadded does not check the steps of the moralist nevertheless tinman held himself in he loved peace he preached it he disseminated it at a meeting in the town he strove to win van diemens voice in favour of a vote for further moneys to protect our shores van diemen laughed at him telling him he wanted a battery no said tinman ive had enough to do with soldiers hows that they might be more cautious i say they might learn to know their friends from their enemies thats it thats it said van diemen if you say much more my hearty youll find me bidding against you next week for marine parade and belle vue terrace ive a cute eye for property and this towns looking up you look about you before you speculate in land and house property here retorted tinman van diemen bore so much from him that he asked himself whether he could be an englishman the title of deserter was his raw wound he attempted to form the habit of stigmatizing himself with it in the privacy of his chamber and he succeeded in establishing the habit of talking to himself so that he was heard by the household and annette on her return was obliged to warn him of his indiscretion this development of a new weakness exasperated him rather to prove his courage by defiance than to baffle tinmans ambition to become the principal owner of houses in crikswich by outbidding him at the auction for the sale of marine parade and belle vue terrace van diemen ran the houses up at the auction and ultimately had belle vue knocked down to him so fierce was the quarrel that annette in conjunction with mrs cavely was called on to interpose with her sweetest grace my native place tinman said to her it is my native place i have a pride in it i desire to own property in it and your father opposes me he opposes me then says i may have it back at auction price after he has gone far to double the price i have bornei repeat i have borne too much are nt your properties to be equal to one said mrs cavely smiling motherlike from tinman to annette he sought to produce a fondling eye in a wry face and said yes i will remember that annette will bless you with her dear hand in a month or two at the outside mrs cavely murmured cherishingly she will tinman cracked his body to bend to her oh i cannot say do not distress me be friendly with papa the girl resumed moving to escape that is the essential said mrs cavely and continued when annette had gone the essential is to get over the next few months miss and then to snap your fingers at us martin i would force that man to sell you belle vue under the price he paid for it just to try your power tinman was not quite so forcible he obtained belle vue at auction price and his passion for revenge was tipped with fire by having it accorded as a friends favour the poisoned state of his mind was increased by a december high wind that rattled his casements and warned him of his accession of property exposed to the elements both he and his sister attributed their nervousness to the sinister behaviour of van diemen for the house on the beach had only in most distant times been threatened by the sea and no house on earth was better protected from manneptune in the shape of a coastguard being paid by government to patrol about it during the hours of darkness they had never had any fears before van diemen arrived and caused them to give thrice their ordinary number of dinners to guests per annum in fact before van diemen came the house on the beach looked on crikswich without a rival to challenge its anticipated lordship over the place and for some inexplicable reason it seemed to its inhabitants to have been a safer as well as a happier residence they were consoled by tinmans performance of a clever stroke in privately purchasing the cottages west of the town and including crickledons shop abutting on marine parade then from the house on the beach they looked at an entire frontage of their property they entered the month of february no further time was to be lost or we shall wake up to find that man has fooled us mrs cavely said tinman appeared at elba to demand a private interview with annette his hat was blown into the hall as the door opened to him and he himself was glad to be sheltered by the door so violent was the gale annette and her father were sitting together they kept the betrothed gentleman waiting a very long time at last van diemen went to him and said netty ll see you if you must i suppose you have no business with me not today tinman replied van diemen strode round the drawingroom with his hands in his pockets theres a disparity of ages he said abruptly as if desirous to pour out his lesson while he remembered it a man upwards of forty marries a girl under twenty hes over sixty before shes forty hes decaying when shes only mellow i ought never to have struck you i know and youre such an infernal bad temper at times and age does nt improve that they say and shes been educated tiptop shes sharp on grammar and a man may nt like that much when hes a husband see her if you must but she does nt take to the idea theres the truth disparity of ages and unsuitableness of dispositionswhat was it fellingham saidlike two barrelorgans grinding different tunes all day in a house i dont want to hear mr fellinghams comparisons tinman snapped oh hes nothing to the girl said van diemen she doesnt stomach leaving me my dear philip why should she leave you when we have interests in common as one household she says youre such a damned bad temper tinman was pursuing amicably when we are united but the frightful charge brought against his temper drew him up fiery i may be annette has seen i am forgiving i am a christian you have provoked me you have struck me i ll give you a couple of thousand pounds in hard money to be off the bargain and not bother the girl said van diemen now rejoined tinman i am offended i like money like most men who have made it you do philip but i dont come courting like a pauper not for ten thousand not for twenty money cannot be a compensation to me for the loss of annette i say i love annette because van diemen continued his speech you trapped us into that engagement mart you dosed me with the stuff you buy for wine while your sister sat sugaring and mollifying my girl and she did the trick in a minute taking netty by surprise when i was all heart and no head and since that you may have seen the girl turn her head from marriage like my woods from the wind mr van diemen smith tinman panted he mastered himself you shall not provoke me my introductions of you in this neighbourhood my patronage prove my friendship youll be a good old fellow mart when you get over your hopes of being knighted mr fellingham may set you against my wine philip let me tell youi know youyou would not object to have your daughter called lady with a spindleshanked husband capering in a court suit before he goes to bed every night that he may nt forget what a fine fellow he was one day bygone youre growing lean on it mart like a recollection fifty years old you have never forgiven me that day philip jealous am i take the money give up the girl and see what friends well be ill back your buyings ill advertise your sellings ill pay a painter to paint you in your court suit and hang up a copy of you in my diningroom annette is here said tinman who had been showing etnas tokens of insurgency he admired annette not till latterly had herbert fellingham been so true an admirer of annette as tinman was she looked sincere and she dressed inexpensively for these reasons she was the best example of womankind that he knew and her enthusiasm for england had the sympathetic effect on him of obscuring the rest of the world and thrilling him with the reassuring belief that he was blest in his blood and his birthplacepoints which her father with his boastings of gippsland and other people talking of scenes on the continent sometimes disturbed in his mind annette said he i come requesting to converse with you in private if you wish iti would rather not she answered tinman raised his head as often at helmstone when some offending shopwoman was to hear her doom he bent to her i see before your father then it isnt an agreeable bit of business to me van diemen grumbled frowning and shrugging i have come annette to ask you to beg you entreatbefore a third personlaughing philip the wrong side of my mouth my friend and ill tell you what were in for heavy seas and i m not sorry youve taken the house on the beach off my hands pray mr tinman speak at once if you please and i will do my best papa vexes you no no replied tinman he renewed his commencement van diemen interrupted him again hang your power over me as you call it eh old mart im a deserter ill pay a thousand pounds to the british army whether they punish me or not march me off tomorrow papa you are unjust unkind annette turned to him in tears no no said tinman i do not feel it your father has misunderstood me annette i am sure he has she said fervently and mr tinman i will faithfully promise that so long as you are good to my dear father i will not be untrue to my engagement only do not wish me to name any day we shall be such very good dear friends if you consent to this will you pausing for a space the enamoured man unrolled his voice in lamentation oh annette how long will you keep me there youll set her crying said van diemen now you can run upstairs netty by jingo mart tinman youve got a bass voice for love affairs annette tinman called to her and made her turn round as she was retiring i must know the day before the end of winter please in kind consideration my arrangements demand it do let the girl go said van diemen dine with me tonight and ill give you a wine to brisk your spirits old boy thank you when i have ordered dinner at home iand my wine agrees with me tinman replied i doubt it you shall not provoke me philip they parted stiffly mrs cavely had unpleasant domestic news to communicate to her brother in return for his tale of affliction and wrath it concerned the ungrateful conduct of their little housemaid jane who as mrs cavely said egged on by that woman crickledon had been hinting at an advance of wages she didnt dare speak but i saw what was in her when she broke a plate and wouldnt say she was sorry i know she goes to crickledon and talks us over shes a willing worker but she has no heart tinman had been accustomed in his shop at helmstonewhere heaven had blessed him with the patronage of the rich as visibly as rays of supernal light are seen selecting from above the heads of prophets in the illustrations to cheap holy booksto deal with willing workers that have no hearts before the application for an advance of wagesand he knew the signs of it cominghis method was to calculate how much he might be asked for and divide the estimated sum by the figure which as it seemed to come from a generous impulse and had been unsolicited was often humbly accepted and the willing worker pursued her lean and hungry course in his service the treatment did not always agree with his males women it suited because they do not like to lift up their voices unless they are in a passion and if you take from them the grounds of temper you take their words awayyou make chickens of them and as tinman said gratitude i never expect why not for the reason that he knew human nature he could record shocking instances of the ingratitude of human nature as revealed to him in the term of his tenure of the shop at helmstone blest from above human natures wickedness had from below too frequently besulphured and suffumigated him for his memory to be dim and though he was ever ready to own himself an example that heaven prevaileth he could cite instances of scandalmongering shopwomen dismissed and working him mischief in the town which pointed to him in person for a proof that the powers of good and evil were still engaged in unhappy contention witness strikes witness revolutions tell her when she lays the cloth that i advance her on account of general good conduct five shillings per annum add said tinman that i wish no thanks it is for her meritsto reward her you understand me martha quite if you think it prudent martin i do she is not to breathe a syllable to cook she will then keep your eye on cook mrs cavely promised she would do so she felt sure she was paying five shillings for ingratitude and therefore it was with humility that she owned her error when while her brother sipped his sugared acrid liquor after dinner in devotion to the doctors decree that he should take a couple of glasses rigorously as bodylashing friar she imparted to him the singular effect of the advance of wages upon little janeoh maam and me never asked you for it she informed her brother how little jane had confided to her that they were called close and how little jane had vowed she wouldthe willing little thinggo about letting everybody know their kindness yes ah tinman inhaled the praise no no i dont want to be puffed he said remember cook i have he continued meditatively rarely found my plan fail but mind i give the crickledons notice to quit tomorrow they are a pest besides i shall probably think of erecting villas how dreadful the wind is mrs cavely exclaimed i would give that girl annette one chance more try her by letter tinman despatched a business letter to annette which brought back a vague unbusinesslike reply two days afterward mrs cavely reported to her brother the presence of mr fellingham and miss mary fellingham in crikswich at her dictation he wrote a second letter this time the reply came from van diemen my dear martinplease do not go on bothering my girl she does not like the idea of leaving me and my experience tells me i could not live in the house with you so there it is take it friendly i have always wanted to be and am your friend phil tinman proceeded straight to elba that is as nearly straight as the wind would allow his legs to walk van diemen was announced to be out miss annette begged to be excused under the pretext that she was unwell and tinman heard of a dinnerparty at elba that night he met mr fellingham on the carriage drive the young londoner presumed to touch upon tinmans private affairs by pleading on behalf of the crikledons who were he said much dejected by the notice they had received to quit house and shop another time bawled tinman i cant hear you in this wind come in said fellingham the master of the house is absent was the smart retort roared at him and tinman staggered away enjoying it as he did his wine his house rocked he was backed by his sister in the assurance that he had been duped the process he supposed to be thinking which was the castigation of his brains with every sting wherewith a native touchiness could ply immediate recollection led him to conclude that he must bring van diemen to his senses and annette running to him for mercy he sat down that night amid the howling of the storm wind whistling water crashing casements rattling beach desperately dragging as by the widestretched starfish fingers of the halfengulphed he hardly knew what he wrote the man was in a state of personal terror burning with indignation at van diemen as the main cause of his jeopardy for in order to prosecute his pursuit of annette he had abstained from going to helmstone to pay moneys into his bank there and what was precious to life as well as life itself was imperilled by those twoannette and her fatherwho had they been true had they been honest to say nothing of honourable would by this time have opened elba to him as a fast and safe abode his letter was addressed on a large envelope to the adjutantgeneral horse guards but if ever consigned to the post that postoffice must be in london and tinman left the letter on his desk till the morning should bring counsel to him as to the london friend to whom he might despatch it under cover for posting if he pushed it so far sleep was impossible black night favoured the tearing fiends of shipwreck and looking through a back window over sea tinman saw with dismay huge towering ghostwhite wreaths that travelled up swiftly on his level and lit the dark as they flung themselves in ruin with a gasp across the mound of shingle at his feet he undressed his sister called to him to know if they were in danger clothed in his dressinggown he slipped along to her door to vociferate to her hoarsely that she must not frighten the servants and one fine quality in the training of the couple which had helped them to prosper a form of selfcommand kept her quiet in her shivering fears for a distraction tinman pulled open the drawers of his wardrobe his glittering suit lay in one and he thought what wonderful changes there are in the world meaning between a man exposed to the wrath of the elements and the same individual reading from vellum in that suit in a palace to the head of all of us the presumption is that he must have often done it before the fact is established that he did it that night the conclusion drawn from it is that it must have given him a sense of stability and safety at any rate that he put on the suit is quite certain probably it was a work of ingratiation and degrees a feeling of the silk a trying on to one leg then a matching of the fellow with it o you revolutionists who would have no state no ceremonial and but one order of galligaskins this man must have been wooed away in spirit to forgetfulness of the tempest scourging his mighty neighbour to a bigger and a farther leap he must have obtained from the contemplation of himself in his suit that which would be the saving of all men in especial of his countrymenimagination namely certain it is as i have said that he attired himself in the suit he covered it with his dressinggown and he lay down on his bed so garbed to await the morrows light being probably surprised by sleep acting upon fatigue and nerves appeased and soothed chapter xii elba lay more sheltered from southeast winds under the slopes of down than any other house in crikswich the southcaster struck off the cliff to a martello tower and the house on the beach leaving elba to repose so that the worst wind for that coast was one of the most comfortable for the owner of the hall and he looked from his upper window on a sea of crumbling grey chalk lashed unremittingly by the featureless piping gale without fear that his elevated grounds and walls would be open at high tide to the ravage of water van diemen had no idea of calamity being at work on land when he sat down to breakfast he told herbert that he had prayed for poor fellows at sea last night mary fellingham and annette were anxious to finish breakfast and mount the down to gaze on the sea and receiving a caution from van diemen not to go too near the cliff they were inclined to think he was needlessly timorous on their account before they were half way through the meal word was brought in of great breaches in the shingle and water covering the common van diemen sent for his head gardener whose report of the state of things outside took the comprehensive form of prophecy he predicted the fall of the town nonsense what do you mean john scott said van diemen eyeing his orderly breakfast table and the man in turns it does nt seem like that yet does it the house on the beach wont stand an hour longer sir who says so its cut off from land now and waves masthigh all about it mart tinman cried van diemen all started all jumped up and there was a scampering for hats and cloaks maids and men of the house ran in and out confirming the news of inundation some in terror for the fate of relatives others pleasantly excited glad of catastrophe if it but killed monotony for at any rate it was a change of demons the view from the outer bank of elba was of water covering the space of the common up to the stones of marine parade and belle vue but at a distance it had not the appearance of angry water the ladies thought it picturesque and the house on the beach was seen standing firm a second look showed the house completely isolated and as the party led by van diemen circled hurriedly toward the town they discerned heavy cataracts of foam pouring down the wrecked mound of shingle on either side of the house why the outer walls washed away said van diemen are they in real danger asked annette her teeth chattering and the cold and other matters at her heart precluding for the moment such warmth of sympathy as she hoped soon to feel for them she was glad to hear her father say oh theyre high and dry by this time we shall find them in the town and well take them in and comfort them ten to one they have nt breakfasted they shant go to an inn while im handy he dashed ahead followed closely by herbert the ladies beheld them talking to townsfolk as they passed along the upper streets and did not augur well of their increase of speed at the head of the town water was visible part of the way up the main street and crossing it the ladies went swiftly under the old church on the tower of which were spectators through the churchyard to a high meadow that dropped to a stone wall fixed between the meadow and a grass bank above the level of the road where now salt water beat and cast some spray not less than a hundred people were in this field among them crickledon and his wife all were in silent watch of the house on the beach which was to east of the field at a distance of perhaps three stonethrows the scene was wild continuously the torrents poured through the shingleclefts and momently a thunder sounded and high leapt a billow that topped the house and folded it weltering they tell me mart tinmans in the house van diemen roared to herbert he listened to further information and bellowed theres no boat herbert answered it must be a mistake i think heres crickledon says he had a warning before dawn and managed to move most of his things and the people over there must have been awakened by the row in time to get off i cant hear a word you say van diemen tried to pitch his voice higher than the wind did you say a boat but where crickledon the carpenter made signal to herbert they stepped rapidly up the field women feels their weakness in times like these my dear mrs crickledon said to annette what with our clothes and our cowardice it do seem were not the equals of men when winds is high annette expressed the hope to her that she had not lost much property mrs crickledon said she was glad to let her know she was insured in an accident company but said she i do grieve for that poor man tinman if alive he be and comes ashore to find his property wrecked by water bless ye he wouldnt insure against anything less common than fire and my house and crickledons shop are floating timbers by this time and marine parade and belle vue are safe to go and itll be a pretty welcome for him poor man from his investments a cry at a tremendous blow of a wave on the doomed house rose from the field back and front door were broken down and the force of water drove a round volume through the channel shaking the walls i cant stand this van diemen cried annette was too late to hold him back he ran up the field she was preparing to run after when mrs crickledon touched her arm and implored her interfere not with men but let them follow their judgements when its seasons of mighty peril my dear if any ones guilty its me for minding my husband of a boat that was launched for a lifeboat here and wouldnt answer and is at the shed by the crouchleft lying there ive often said as if it was asulking my goodness a linen sheet bad been flung out from one of the windows of the house on the beach and flew loose and flapping in sign of distress it looks as if they had gone mad in that house to have waited so long for to declare theirselves poor souls mrs crickledon said sighing she was assured right and left that signals had been seen before and some one stated that the cook of mr tinman and also mrs cavely were on shore its his furniture poor man he sticks to and nothing gets round the heart so resumed mrs crickledon there goes his bedlinen the sheet was whirled and snapped away by the wind distended doubled like a flock of winter geese changeing alphabetical letters on the clouds darted this way and that and finally outspread on the waters breaking against marine parade they cannot have thought there was positive danger in remaining said annette mr tinman was waiting for the cheapest insurance office a man remarked to mrs crickledon the least to pay is to the undertaker she replied standing on tiptoe and its to be hoped he ll pay more today if only those walls dont fall and stop the chance of the boat to save him for more outlay poor man what boats was on the beach last night high up and over the ridge as they was are planks by this time and only good for carpenters half our towns done for one old man said and another followed him in a pious tone from water we came and to water we go they talked of ancient inroads of the sea none so serious as this threatened to be for them the gallant solidity of the house on the beach had withstood heavy gales it was a brave house heaven be thanked no fishing boats were out chiefly welltodo people would be the sufferersan exceptional case for it is the mysterious and unexplained dispensation that mostly heaven chastises we a knot of excited gazers drew the rest of the field to them mrs crickledon on the edge of the crowd reported what was doing to annette and miss fellingham a boat had been launched from the town praise the lord theres none but coastguard in it she exclaimed and excused herself for having her heart on her husband annette was as deeply thankful that her father was not in the boat they looked round and saw herbert beside them van diemen was in the rear panting and straining his neck to catch sight of the boat now pulling fast across a tumbled sea to where tinman himself was perceived beckoning them wildly half out of one of the windows a pound apiece to those fellows and two if they land mart tinman dry ive promised it and theyll earn it look at that quick you rascals to the east a portion of the house had fallen melted away where it stood just below the line of shingle it was now like a structure wasting on a tormented submerged reef the whole line was given over to the waves where is his sister annette shrieked to her father safe ashore and one of the women with her but mart tinman would stop the fool topoor old boy save his papers and things and has nt a head to do it martha cavely tells me theyre at him now theyve got him in theres another oh its a girl who would nt go and leave him theyll pull to the field here brave ladsby jingo why aint englishmen always in dangereh if you want to see them shine its little jane said mrs crickledon who had been joined by her husband and now that she knew him to be no longer in peril kept her hand on him to restrain him just for comforts sake the boat held under the lee of the housewreck a minute then as if shooting a small rapid came down on a wave crowned with foam to hurrahs from the townsmen theyre all right said van diemen puffing as at a mist before his eyes theyll pull westward with the wind and land him among us i remember when old mart and i were bathing once he was younger than me and could nt swim much and i saw him going down itd have been hard to see him washed off before ones eyes thirty years afterwards here they come hes all right hes in his dressinggown the crowd made way for mr van diemen smith to welcome his friend two of the coastguard jumped out and handed him to the dry bank while herbert van diemen and crickledon took him by hand and arm and hoisted him on to the flint wall preparatory to his descent into the field in this exposed situation the wind whose pranks are endless when it is once up seized and blew martin tinmans dressinggown wide as two violently flapping wings on each side of him and finally over his head van diemen turned a pair of stupefied flat eyes on herbert who cast a sly look at the ladies tinman had sprung down but not before the world in one tempestuous glimpse had caught sight of the court suit perfect gravity greeted him from the crowd safe old mart and glad to be able to say it said van diemen we are so happy said annette house furniture property everything i possess ejaculated tinman shivering fiddle man you want some hot breakfast in you your sister has gone onto elba come you too old man and wheres that plucky little girl who stood by was there a girl said tinman yes and there was a boy wanted to help van diemen pointed at herbert tinman looked and piteously asked have you examined marine parade and belle vue it depends on the tide here is little jane sir said mrs crickledon fall in van diemen said to little jane the girl was bobbing curtseys to annette on her introduction by mrs crickledon martin you stay at my house you stay at elba till you get things comfortable about you and then you shall have the crouch for a year rent free eh netty annette chimed in anything we can do anything nothing can be too much van diemen was praising little jane for her devotion to her master master have been so kind to me said little jane now march it is cold van diemen gave the word and herbert stood by mary rather dejectedly foreseeing that his prospects at elba were darkened now then mart left leg forward van diemen linked his arm in his friends i must have a look tinman broke from him and cast a forlorn look of farewell on the last of the house on the beach youve got me left to you old mart dont forget that said van diemen tinmans chest fell yes yes he responded he was touched and i told those fellows if they landed you dry they should haveid give them double pay and i do believe theyve earned their money i dont think im very wet im cold said tinman you cant help being cold so come along but philip tinman lifted his voice ive lost everything i tried to save a little i worked hard i exposed my life and all in vain the voice of little jane was heard whats the matter with the child said van diemen annette went up to her quietly but little jane was addressing her master oh if you please i did manage to save something the last thing when the boat was at the window and if you please sir all the bundles is lost but i saved you a papercutter and a letter horse guards and here they are sir the grateful little creature drew the square letter and papercutter from her bosom and held them out to mr tinman it was a letter of the imposing size with the horse guards very distinctly inscribed on it in tinmans best round hand to strike his vindictive spirit as positively intended for transmission and give him sight of his power to wound if it pleased him as it might what cried he not clearly comprehending how much her devotion had accomplished for him a letter to the horse guards cried van diemen here give it me said little janes master and grasped it nervously whats in that letter van diemen asked let me look at that letter dont tell me its private correspondence my dear philip dear friend kind thanks its not a letter said tinman not a letter why i read the address horse guards i read it as it passed into your hands now my man one look at that letter or take the consequences kind thanks for your assistance dear philip indeed oh this oh its nothing he tore it in halves his face was of the winter seacolour with the chalk wash on it tear again and i shall know what to think of the contents van diemen frowned let me see what youve said youve sworn you would do it and there it is at last by miracle but let me see it and ill overlook it and you shall be my housemate still if not tinman tore away you mistake you mistake youre entirely wrong he said as he pursued with desperation his task of rendering every word unreadable van diemen stood fronting him the accumulation of stores of petty injuries and meannesses which he had endured from this man swelled under the whip of the conclusive exhibition of treachery he looked so black that annette called papa philip said tinman philip my best friend pooh youre a poor creature come along and breakfast at elba and you can sleep at the crouch and goodnight to you crickledon he called to the houseless couple you stop at elba till i build you a shop with these words van diemen led the way walking alone herbert was compelled to walk with tinman mary and annette came behind and mary pinched annettes arm so sharply that she must have cried out aloud had it been possible for her to feel pain at that moment instead of a personal exultation flying wildly over the clash of astonishment and horror like a seabird over the foam in the first silent place they came to mary murmured the words little jane annette looked round at mrs crickledon who wound up the procession taking little jane by the hand little jane was walking demurely with a placid face annette glanced at tinman her excited feelings nearly rose to a scream of laughter for hours after mary had only to say to her little jane to produce the same convulsion it rolled her heart and senses in a headlong surge shook her to burning tears and seemed to her ideas the most wonderful running together of opposite things ever known on this earth the young lady was ashamed of her laughter but she was deeply indebted to it for never was mind made so clear by that beneficent exercise etext editors bookmarks adversary at once offensive and helpless provokes brutality causes him to be popularly weighed distinguished by his not allowing himself to be provoked eccentric behaviour in trifles excited glad of catastrophe if it but killed monotony generally he noticed nothing good jokes

and youre poor she began to feel that this was life in earnest she dealt in the flashes which connect ideas she sought by looking hard to understand it better sunning itself in the glass of envy that which fine cookery does for the cementing of couples the intricate which she takes for the infinite tossed him from repulsion to incredulity and so back two principal roads by which poor sinners come to a conscience the gentleman of fifty and the damsel of nineteen an early uncompleted and hitherto unpublished fragment by george meredith chapter i he passing over ickleworth bridge and rounding up the heavilyshadowed river of our narrow valley i perceived a commotion as of bathers in a certain bright space immediately underneath the vicars terracegarden steps my astonishment was considerable when it became evident to me that the vicar himself was disporting in the water which reaching no higher than his waist disclosed him in the ordinary habiliments of his cloth i knew my friend to be one of the most absentminded of men and my first effort to explain the phenomenon of his appearance there suggested that he might have walked in the victim of a fit of abstraction and that he had not yet fully comprehended his plight but this idea was dispersed when i beheld the very portly lady his partner in joy and adversity standing immersed and perfectly attired some short distance nearer to the bank as i advanced along the bank opposed to them i was further amazed to hear them discoursing quite equably together so that it was impossible to say on the face of it whether a catastrophe had occurred or the great heat of a cloudless summer day had tempted an eccentric couple to seek for coolness in the directest fashion without absolute disregard to propriety i made a point of listening for the accentuation of the my dear which was being interchanged but the keynote to the harmony existing between husband and wife was neither excessively unctuous nor shrewd and the connubial shuttlecock was so well kept up on both sides that i chose to await the issue rather than speculate on the origin of this strange exhibition i therefore as i could not be accused of an outrage to modesty permitted myself to maintain what might be invidiously termed a satyrlike watch from behind a forward flinging willow whose business in life was to look at its image in a brown depth branches trunk and roots the sole indication of discomfort displayed by the pair was that the ladys hand worked somewhat fretfully to keep her dress from ballooning and puffing out of all proportion round about her person while the vicar who stood without his hat employed a spongy handkerchief from time to time in tempering the ardours of a vertical sun if you will consent to imagine a bald blackbird his neck being shrunk in apprehensively as you may see him in the first rolling of the thunder you will gather an image of my friends appearance he performed his capital ablutions with many loud poofs and a casting up of dazzled eyes an action that gave point to his recital of the invocation of chryses to smintheus which brought upon the greeks disaster and much woe between the lines he replied to his wife whose remarks increased in quantity and also as i thought in emphasis under the river of verse which he poured forth unbaffled broadening his chest to the sonorous greek music in a singular rapture of obliviousness a wise man will not squander his laughter if he can help it but will keep the agitation of it down as long as he may the simmering of humour sends a lively spirit into the mind whereas the boiling over is but a prodigal expenditure and the disturbance of a clear current for the comic element is visible to you in all things if you do but keep your mind charged with the perception of it as i have heard a great expounder deliver himself on another subject and he spoke very truly so i continued to look on with the gravity of nature herself and i could not but fancy and with less than our usual wilfulness when we fancy things about natures moods that the mother of men beheld this scene with half a smile differently from the simple observation of those cows whisking the flies from their flanks at the edge of the shorn meadow and its aspens seen beneath the curved roof of a broad oakbranch save for this happy upward curve of the branch we are encompassed by breathless foliage even the gloom was hot the little insects that are food for fish tried a flight and fell on the waters surface as if panting here and there a sullen fish consented to take them and a circle spread telling of past excitement i had listened to the vicars homeric lowing for the space of a minute or sowhat some one has called the great beastlike bellowlike roar and roll of the iliad hexameter it stopped like a cut cord one of the numerous daughters of his house appeared in the arch of white clusterroses on the lower gardenterrace and with an exclamation stood petrified at the extraordinary spectacle and then she laughed outright i had hitherto resisted but the young ladys frank and boisterous laughter carried me along and i too let loose a peal and discovered myself the vicar seeing me acknowledged a consciousness of his absurd position with a laugh as loud as for the scapegrace girl she went off into a run of highpitched shriekings like twenty woodpeckers crying i mama mama you look as if you were in jordan the vicar cleared his throat admonishingly for it was apparent that miss alice was giving offence to her mother and i presume he thought it was enough for one of the family to have done so wilt thou come out of jordan i cried i am sufficiently baptized with the water said the helpless man indeed mr amble observed his spouse you can lecture a woman for not making the best of circumstances i hope youll bear in mind that its you who are irreverent i can endure this no longer you deserve mr pollingrays ridicule upon this i interposed pray maam dont imagine that you have anything but sympathy from mebut as i was protesting having my mouth open the terrible miss alice dragged the laughter remorselessly out of me they have been trying franks new boat mr pollingray and theyve upset it oh oh and again there was the woodpeckers chorus alice i desire you instantly to go and fetch john the gardener said the angry mother mama i cant move wait a minute only a minute johns gone about the geraniums oh dont look so resigned papa youll kill me mama come and take my hand oh oh the young lady put her hands in against her waist and rolled her body like a possessed one why dont you come in through the boathouse she asked when she had mastered her fit ah said the vicar i beheld him struck by this new thought how utterly absurd you are mr amble exclaimed his wife when you know that the boathouse is locked and that the boat was lying under the camshot when you persuaded me to step into it hearing this explanation of the accident alice gave way to an ungovernable emotion you see my dear the vicar addressed his wife she can do nothing its useless if ever patience is counselled to us it is when accidents befall us for then as we are not responsible we know we are in other hands and it is our duty to be comparatively passive perhaps i may say that in every difficulty patience is a lifebelt i beg of you to be patient still mr amble i shall think you foolish said the spouse with a nod of more than emphasis my dear you have only to decide was the meek reply by this time miss alice had so far conquered the fiend of laughter that she could venture to summon her mother close up to the bank and extend a rescuing hand mrs amble waded to within reach her husband following arrangements were made for alice to pull and the vicar to push both in accordance with mrs ambles stipulations for even in her extremity of helplessness she affected rule and sovereignty unhappily at the decisive moment i chanced and i admit it was more than an inadvertence on my part it was a most illconsidered thing to do i chanced i say to call outand that i refrained from quoting voltaire is something in my favour how on earth did you manage to tumble in there can be no contest of opinion that i might have kept my curiosity waiting and possibly it may be said with some justification that i was the direct cause of my friends unparalleled behaviour but could a mortal man guess that in the very act of assisting his wifes return to dry land and while she wasif i may put it somodestly in his hands he would turn about with a quotation that compared him to old palinurus all the while allowing his worthy and admirable burden to sink lower and dispread in excess upon the surface of the water until the vantage of her daughters help was lost to her i beheld the consequences of my indiscretion dismayed i would have checked the preposterous virgilian but in contempt of my uplifted hand and averted head and regardless of the fact that his wife was then literally dependent upon him the vicar declaimed and the drenching effect produced by latin upon a lady at such a season may be thought on vix primos inopina quies laxaverat artus et super incumbens cum puppis parte revulsa cumque gubernaclo liquidas projecit in undas it is not easy when you are unacquainted with the language to retort upon latin even when the attempt to do so is made in english very few even of the uneducated ears can tolerate such anticlimax vituperative as english after sounding latin mrs amble kept down those sentiments which her vernacular might have expressed i heard but one groan that came from her as she lay huddled indistinguishably in the arms of her husband notpraecipitem i am happy to say my senseless friend remarked further and laughed cheerfully as he fortified his statement with a run of negatives no no in a way peculiar to him no no if i plant my grey hairs anywhere it will be on dry land no but now my dear he returned to his duty why youre down again come one two and up he was raising a dead weight the passion for sarcastic speech was manifestly at war with common prudence in the bosom of mrs amble prudence however overcame it she cast on him a look of a kind that makes matrimony terrific in the dreams of bachelors and then wedding her energy to the assistance given she made one of those senseless springs of the upper half of the body which strike the philosophic eye with the futility of an effort that does not arise from a solid basis owing to the want of concert between them the vicars impulsive strength was expended when his wifes came into play alice clutched her mother bravely the vicar had force enough to stay his wifes descent but alice she boasts of her muscle had not the force in the other directionand no wonder there are few young ladies who could pull fourteen stone sheer up a camshot mrs amble remained in suspense between the two oh mr pollingray if you were only on this side to help us miss alice exclaimed very piteously though i could see that she was half mad with the internal struggle of laughter at the parents and concern for them now pull alice shouted the vicar no not yet screamed mrs amble im sinking pull alice now mama oh push papa im down up maam jane woman up gently papa abraham i will not my dear but you must and that man opposite what pollingray hes fifty i found myself walking indignantly down the path even now i protest my friend was guilty of bad manners though i make every allowance for him i excuse i pass the order but whywhat justifies one mans bawling out another mans age what purpose does it serve i suppose the vicar wished to reassure his wife on the principle i have heard him enunciate it that the sexes are merged at fiftyby which he means i must presume that something which may be good or bad and is generally sillyof course i admire and respect modesty and pudeur as much as any mansomething has gone a recognition of the bounds of division there is if that is a lamentable matter a loss of certain of our young tricks at fifty we have ceased to blush readily and let me ask you to define a blush is it an involuntary truth or an ingenuous lie i know that this will sound like the language of a man not a little jealous of his youthful compeers i can but leave it to rightly judging persons to consider whether a healthy man in his prime who has enough and is not cursed by ambition need be jealous of any living soul a shriek from miss alice checked my retreating steps the vicar was staggering to support the breathing half of his partner while she regained her footing in the bed of the river their effort to scale the camshot had failed happily at this moment i caught sight of master franks boat which had floated bottom upwards against a projecting mudbank of forgetmenots i contrived to reach it and right it and having secured one of the sculls i pulled up to the rescue though not before i had plucked a flower actuated by a motive that i cannot account for the vicar held the boat firmly against the camshot while i at the imminent risk of joining them i shall not forget the combined expression of miss alices retreating eyes and the malicious corners of her mouth hoisted the lady in and the river with her from the seat of the boat she stood sufficiently high to project the step towards land without peril when she had set her foot there we all assumed an attitude of respectful attention and the vicar who could soar over calamity like a fairweather swallow acknowledged the return of his wife to the element with a series of apologetic yesses and short coughings that would furnish a good concert for the poets he remarked a parting a separation of lovers even as a body from the watertorn or from the water plucked eh do you thinkso i weep round her tearful in her track an excellent but the outraged woman dripping in grievous discomfort above him made a peremptory gesture mr amble will you come on shore instantly i have borne with your stupidity long enough i insist upon your remembering sir that you have a family dependent upon you other men may commit these follies this was a blow at myself a bachelor whom the lady had never persuaded to dream of relinquishing his freedom my dear i am coming said the vicar then come at once or i shall think you idiotic the wife retorted i have been endeavouring the vicar now addressed me to prove by a practical demonstration that women are capable of as much philosophy as men under any sudden and afflicting revolution of circumstances and if you get a sunstroke you will be rightly punished and i shall not be sorry mr amble i am coming my dear jane pray run into the house and change your things not till i see you out of the water sir you are losing your temper my love you would make a saint lose his temper mr amble there were female saints my dear the vicar mildly responded and addressed me further up to this point i assure you pollingray no conduct could have been more exemplary than mrs ambles i had got her into the boata good boat a capital boatbut getting in myself we overturned the first impulse of an ordinary woman would have been to reproach and scold but mrs amble succumbed only to the first impulse discovering that all effort unaided to climb the bank was fruitless she agreed to wait patiently and make the best of circumstances and she did and she learnt to enjoy it there is marrow in every bone my dear jane i have never admired you so much i tried her pollingray in metaphysics i talked to her of the opera we last heard i think fifty years ago and as it is less endurable for a woman to be patient in tribulationthe honour is greater when she overcomes the fleshy trial insomuch the vicar put on a bland air of abnegation of honour that i am disposed to consider any male philosopher our superior when youve found one ha hawhen youve found one o sol pulcher i am ready to sing that the day has been glorious so far pulcher ille dies mrs amble appealed to me would anybody not swear that he is mad to see him standing waistdeep in the water and the sun on his bald head i am reduced to entreat you not tothough you have no family of your ownnot to encourage him it is amusing to you pray reflect that such folly is too often fatal compel him to come on shore the logic of the appeal was no doubt distinctly visible in the ladys mind though it was not accurately worded i saw that i stood marked to be the scape goat of the day and humbly continued to deserve well notwithstanding by dint of simple signs and nods of affirmative and a constant propulsion of my friends arm i drew him into the boat and thence projected him up to the level with his wife who had perhaps deigned to understand that it was best to avoid the arresting of his divergent mind by any remark during the passage and remained silent no sooner was he established on his feet than she plucked him away your papas hat she called flashing to her daughter and streamed up the lawn into the rosetrellised pathways leading on aloft to the vicarage house behind roses the weeping couple disappeared the last i saw of my friend was a smiting of his hand upon his head in a vain effort to catch at one of the fleeting ideas sowed in him by the quick passage of objects before his vision and shaken out of him by abnormal hurry the rev abraham amble had been lord of his wife in the water but his innings was over he had evidently enjoyed it vastly and i now understood why he had chosen to prolong it as much as possible your eccentric characters are not uncommonly amateurs of petty artifice there are hours of vengeance even for henpecked men i found myself sighing over the enslaved condition of every benedict of my acquaintance when the thought came like a surprise that i was alone with alice the fair and pleasant damsel made a clever descent into the boat and having seated herself she began to twirl the scull in the rowlock and said do you feel disposed to join me in looking after the other scull and papas hat mr pollingray i suggested will you not get your feet wet i couldnt manage to empty all the water in the boat oh cried she with a toss of her head i wet feet never hurt young people there was matter for an admonitory lecture in this let me confess i was about to give it when she added but mr pollingray i am really afraid that your feet are wet you had to step into the water when you righted the boat my reply was to jump down by her side with as much agility as i could combine with a proper discretion the amateur craft rocked threateningly and i found myself grasped by and grasping the pretty damsel until by great good luck we were steadied and preserved from the same misfortune which had befallen her parents she laughed and blushed and we tottered asunder would you have talked metaphysics to me in the water mr pollingray alice was here guilty of one of those naughty sort of innocent speeches smacking of eve most strongly though of course of eve in her best days i took the rudder lines to steer against the sculling of her single scull and was adam enough to respond to temptation i should perhaps have been grateful to your charitable construction of it as being metaphysics she laughed colloquially to fill a pause it had not been coquetry merely the woman unconsciously at play a man is bound to remember the seniority of his years when this occurs for a veteran of ninety and a worn out young debauchee will equally be subject to it if they do not shun the society of the sex my long robust health and perfect selfreliance apparently tend to give me unguarded moments or lay me open to fitful impressions indeed there are times when i fear i have the heart of a boy and certainly nothing more calamitous can be conceived supposing that it should ever for one instant get complete mastery of my head this is the peril of a man who has lived soberly do we never know when we are safe i am in reflecting thereupon positively prepared to say that if there is no fool like what they call an old fool and a man in his prime who can be laughed at is the worlds old fool there is wisdom in the wild oats theory and i shall come round to my nephews way of thinking that is as far as master charles by his acting represents his thinking i shall at all events be more lenient in my judgement of him and less stern in my allocutions for i shall have no text to preach from we picked up the hat and the scull in one of the little muddy bays of our brown river forming an amphitheatre for waterrats and draped with great dockleaves nettleflowers ragged robins and other weeds for which the learned young lady gave the botanical names it was pleasant to hear her speak with the full authority of absolute knowledge of her subject she has intelligence she is decidedly too good for charles unless he changes his method of living shall we row on she asked settling her arms to work the pair of sculls you have me in your power said i and she struck out her shape is exceedingly graceful i was charmed by the occasional tightening in of her lips as she exerted her muscle while at intervals telling me of her race with one of her boastful younger brothers whom she had beaten i believe it is only when they are using physical exertion that the eyes of young girls have entire simplicitythe simplicity of nature as opposed to that other artificial simplicity which they learn from their governesses their mothers and the admiration of witlings attractive purity or the nice glaze of no comprehension of anything which is considered to be improper in a wicked world and is no doubt very useful is not to my taste french girls as a rule cannot compete with our english in the purer graces they are only incomparable when as women they have resort to art alice could look at me as she rowed without thinking it necessary to force a smile or to speak or to snigger and be foolish i felt towards the girl like a comrade we went no further than hatchards mile where the water plumps the poor sleepy river from a sidestream and as it turned the boats head quite round i let the boat go these studies of young women are very well as a pastime but they soon cease to be a recreation she forms an agreeable picture when she is rowing and possesses a musical laugh now and then she gives way to the bad trick of laughing without caring or daring to explain the cause for it she is moderately wellbred i hope that she has principle certain things a man of my time of life learns by associating with very young people which are serviceable to him what a different matter this earth must be to that girl from what it is to me i knew it before andmark the differencei feel it now chapter ii she papa never will cease to meet with accidents and adventures if he only walks out to sit for half an hour with one of his old dames as he calls them something is sure to happen to him and it is almost as sure that mr pollingray will be passing at the time and mixed up in it since mr pollingrays return from his last residence on the continent i have learnt to know him and like him charles is unjust to his uncle he is not at all the grave kind of man i expected from charless description he is extremely entertaining and then he understands the world and i like to hear him talk he is so unpretentious and uses just the right words no one would imagine his age from his appearance and he has more fun than any young man i have listened to but i am convinced i have discovered his weakness it is my fatal peculiarity that i cannot be with people ten minutes without seeing some point about them where they are tenderest mr pollingray wants to be thought quite youthful he can bear any amount of fatigue he is always fresh and a delightful companion but you cannot get him to show even a shadow of exhaustion or to admit that he ever knew what it was to lie down beaten this is really to pretend that he is superhuman i like him so much that i could wish him superior to suchit is nothing other thanvanity which is worse a young man giving himself the air of a sage orbut no one can call mr pollingray an old man he is a confirmed bachelor that puts the case charles when he says of him that he is a gentleman in a good state of preservation means to be ironical i doubt whether charles at fifty would object to have the same said of mr charles everett mr pollingray has always looked to his health he has not been disappointed i am sure he was always very good but whatever he was he is now very pleasant and he does not talk to women as if he thought them singular and feel timid i mean confused as some men show that they feelthe good ones perhaps he felt so once and that is why he is still free charless dread that his uncle will marry is most unworthy he never will but why should he not mama declares that he is waiting for a woman of intellect i can hear her depend upon it a woman of intellect will marry dayton manor should that mighty event not come to pass poor charles will have to sink the name of everett in that of pollingray mr pollingrays name is the worst thing about him when i think of his name i see him ten times older than he is my feelings are in harmony with his pedigree concerning the age of the name one would have to be a woman of profound intellect to see the advantage of sharing it mrs pollingray she must be a lady with a wig it was when we were rowing up by hatchards mill that i first perceived his weakness he was looking at me so kindly and speaking of his friendship for papa and how glad he was to be fixed at last near to us at dayton i wished to use some term of endearment in reply and said i remember yes and we are also glad godpapa i was astonished that he should look so disconcerted and went on have you forgotten that you are my godpapa he answered am i oh yesthe name of alice still he looked uncertain uncomfortable and i said do you want to cancel the past and cast me off no certainly not he i suppose thought he was assuring me i saw his lips move at the words i cancel the past though he did not speak them out he positively blushed i know the sort of young man he must have been exactly the sort of young man mama would like for a soninlaw and her daughters would accept in pure obedience when reduced to be capable of the virtue by rigorous diet or consumption he let the boat go round instantly this was enough for me it struck me then that when papa had said to mama as he did in that absurd situation he is fifty mr pollingray must have heard it across the river for he walked away hurriedly he came back it is true with the boat but i have my own ideas he is always ready to do a service but on this occasion i think it was an afterthought i shall not venture to call him godpapa again indeed if i have a desire it is that i may be blind to peoples weakness my insight is inveterate papa says he has heard mr pollingray boast of his age if so there has come a change over him i cannot be deceived i see it constantly after my unfortunate speech mr pollingray shunned our house for two whole weeks and scarcely bowed to us when coming out of church miss pollingray idolises himspoils him she says that he is worth twenty of charles nous savons ce que nous savons nous autres charles is wild but charles would be above these littlenesses how could miss pollingray comprehend the romance of charless nature my sister evelina is now mr pollingrays favourite she could not say godpapa to him if she would persons who are very much petted at home are always establishing favourites abroad for my part let them praise me or not i know that i can do any thing i set my mind upon at present i choose to be frivolous i know i am frivolous what then if there is fun in the world am i not to laugh at it i shall astonish them by and by but i will laugh while i can i am sure there is so much misery in the world it is a mercy to be able to laugh mr pollingray may think what he likes of me when charles tells me that i must do my utmost to propitiate his uncle he cannot mean that i am to refrain from laughing because that is being a hypocrite which i may become when i have gone through all the potential moods and not before it is preposterous to suppose that i am to be tied down to the views of life of elderly people i dare say i did laugh a little too much the other night but could i help it we had a dinner party present were mr pollingray mrs kershaw the wilbury people three charles my brother duncan evelina mama papa myself and mr and mrs put them last for emphasis romer pattlecombe mrs pattlecombe the same number of syllables as pollingray and a p to begin with is thirtyone years her husbands junior and she is twentysix full of fun and always making fun of him the mildest kindest goody old thing who has never distressed himself for anything and never will mrs romer not only makes fun but is fun when you have done laughing with her you can laugh at her she is the salt of society in these parts some one as we were sitting on the lawn after dinner alluded to the mishap to papa and mama and mama who has never forgiven mr pollingray for having seen her in her ridiculous plight said that men were in her opinion greater gossips than women that is indisputable maam said mr pollingray he loves to bewilder her only we never mention it there is an excuse for us said mrs romer our trials are so great we require a diversion and so we talk of others now really said charles i dont think your trials are equal to ours for which remark papa bantered him and his uncle was sharp on him and charles i know spoke half seriously though he was seeking to draw mrs romer out he has troubles from this we fell upon a comparison of sufferings and mrs romer took up the word she is a fair smallish nervous woman with delicate hands and outlines exceedingly sympathetic so much so that while you are telling her anything she makes half a face in anticipation and is ready to shriek with laughter or shake her head with uttermost grief and sometimes if you let her go too far in one direction she does both all her narrations are with ups and downs of her hands her eyes her chin and her voice taking poor good old mr romer by the roll of his coat she made as if posing him and said there now its all very well for you to say that there is anything equal to a womans sufferings in this world i do declare you know nothing of what we unhappy women have to endure its dreadful no male creature can possibly know what tortures i have to undergo mama neatly contrived after interrupting her to divert the subject i think that all the ladies imagined they were in jeopardy but i knew mrs romer was perfectly to be trusted she has wit which pleases jusquaux ongles and her sense of humour never overrides her discretion with more than a glancenever with preparation now she pursued let me tell you what excruciating trials i have to go through this man she rocked the patient old gentleman to and fro this man will be the death of me he is utterly devoid of a sense of propriety again and again i say to himcannot the tailor cut down these trowsers of yours yes mr amble you preach patience to women but this is too much for any womans endurance now do attempt to picture to yourself what an agony it must be to mehe will shave and he will wear those enormously high trowsers that when they are braced reach up behind to the nape of his neck only yesterday morning as i was lying in bed i could see him in his dressingroom i tell you he will shave and he will choose the time for shaving early after he has braced these immensely high trowsers that make such a placard of him oh my goodness my dear romer i have said to him fifty times if i have said it once my goodness me why can you not get decent trowsers such as other men wear he has but one answerhe has been accustomed to wear those trowsers and he would not feel at home in another pair and what does he say if i continue to complain and i cannot but continue to complain for it is not only moral it is physical torment to see the sight he makes of himself he says my dear you should not have married an old man what i say to him must an old man wear antiquated trowsers no nothing will turn him those are his habits but you have not heard the worst the sight of those hideous trowsers totally destroying all shape in the man is horrible enough but it is absolutely more than a woman can bear to see himfor he will shavefirst cover his face with white soap with that ridiculous centrepiece to his trowsers reaching quite up to his poll and then you can fancy a womans rage and anguish the figure lifts its nose by the extremist tip oh its degradation what respect can a woman have for her husband after that sight imagine it and i have implored him to spare me its useless you sneer at our hbops and say that you are inconvenienced by them but you gentlemen are not degradedoh unutterablyas i am every morning of my life by that cruel spectacle of a husband i have but faintly sketched mrs romers style evelina who is prudish and thinks her vulgar refused to laugh but it came upon me as the picture of your own old husband with so irresistibly comic an effect that i was overcome by convulsions of laughter i do not defend myself it was as much a fit as any other attack i did all i could to arrest it at last i ran indoors and upstairs to my bedroom and tried hard to become dispossessed i am sure i was an example of the sufferings of my sex it could hardly have been worse for mrs romer than it was for me i was drowned in internal laughter long after i had got a grave face early in the evening mr pollingray left us chapter iii he i am carried by the fascination of a musical laugh apparently i am doomed to hear it at my own expense we are secure from nothing in this life i have determined to stand for the county an unoccupied man is a prey to every hook of folly be dilettante all your days and you might as fairly hope to reap a moral harvest as if you had chased butterflies the activities created by a profession or determined pursuit are necessary to the growth of the mind heavens i find myself writing like an illegitimate son of la rochefoucauld or of vauvenargues but it is true that i am fifty years old and i am not mature i am undeveloped somewhere the question for me to consider is whether this development is to be accomplished by my being guilty of an act of egregious folly dans la cinquantaine the reflection should produce a gravity in men such a number of years will not ring like bridal bells in a mans ears i have my books about me my horses my dogs a contented household i move in the centre of a perfect machine and i am dissatisfied i rise early i do not digest badly what is wrong the calamity of my case is that i am in danger of betraying what is wrong with me to others without knowing it myself some woman will be suspecting and tattling because she has nothing else to do girls have wonderfully shrewd eyes for a weakness in the sex which they are instructed to look upon as superior but i am on my guard the fact is manifest i feel i have been living more or less uselessly it is a fat time there are a certain set of men in every prosperous country who having wherewithal and not being compelled to toil become subjected to the moral ideal most of them in the end sit down with our sixth henry or second richard and philosophise on shepherds to be no better than a simple hind am i better prime bacon and an occasional draft of shrewd beer content him and they do not me yet i am sound and can sit through the night and be ready and on the morrow i shall stand for the county i made the announcement that i had thoughts of entering parliament before i had half formed the determination at my sisters lawn party yesterday gilbert she cried and raised her hands a woman is hurt if you do not confide to her your plans as soon as you can conceive them she must be present to assist at the birth or your plans are unblessed plans i had been speaking aside in a casual manner to my friend amble whose idea is that the church is not represented with sufficient strength in the commons and who at once as i perceived grasped the notion of getting me to promote sundry measures connected with schools and clerical stipends for his eyes dilated he said well if you do i can put you up to several things and imparting the usual chorus of yesses to his own mind he continued absently pollingray might be made strong on church rates there is much to do he has lived abroad and requires schooling in these things we want a man yes yes yes its a good idea a notion my sister however was of another opinion she did me the honour to take me aside gilbert were you serious just now quite serious is it not my characteristic not on these occasions i saw the idea come suddenly upon you you were looking at charles continue and at what was he looking he was looking at alice amble and the young lady she looked at you i was here attacked by a singularly pertinacious fly and came out of the contest with a laugh did she have that condescension towards me and from the glance my resolution to enter parliament was born it is the french vaudevillistes doctrine of great events from little causes the slipper of a soubrette trips the heart of a king and changes the destiny of a nationthe history of mankind it may be true if i were but shot into the house from a little girls eye with this i took her arm gaily walked with her and had nearly overreached myself with excess of cunning i suppose we are reduced to see more plainly that which we systematically endeavour to veil from others it is best to flutter a handkerchief instead of nailing up a curtain the principal advantage is that you may thereby go on deceiving yourself for this reason few sentiments are wholly matter of fact but when they are half so you make them concrete by deliberately seeking either to crush or conceal them and you are doubly betrayedbetrayed to the besieging eye and to yourself when a sentiment has grown to be a passion mercifully may i be spared different tactics are required by that time you will have already betrayed yourself too deeply to dare to be flippant the investigating eye is aware that it has been purposely diverted knowing some things it makes sure of the rest from which you turn it away if you want to hide a very grave case you must speak gravely about itat which season be but sure of your voice and simulate a certain depth of sentimental philosophy and you may once more and for a long period bewilder the investigator of the secrets of your bosom to sum up in the preliminary stages of a weakness be careful that you do not show your own alarm or all will be suspected should the weakness turn to fever let a little of it be seen like a careless man and nothing will really be thought i can say this i can do this and is it still possible that a pins point has got through the joints of the armour of a man like me elizabeth quitted my side with the conviction that i am as considerate an uncle as i am an affectionate brother i said to her apropos i have been observing those two it seems to me they are deciding things for themselves i have been going to speak to you about them gilbert said she and i the girl must be studied the family is good while charles is in wales you must have her at dayton she laughs rather vacantly dont you think but the sound of it has the proper wholesome ring i will give her what attention i can while she is here but in the meantime i must have a bride of my own and commence courting parliament you mean said elizabeth with a frank and tender smile the hostess was summoned to welcome a new guest and she left me pleased with her successful effort to reach my meaning and absorbed by it i would not have challenged machiavelli but i should not have encountered the florentine ruefully i feel the same keen delight in intellectual dexterity on some points my sister is not a bad match for me she can beat me seven games out of twelve at chess but the five i win sequently for then i am awake there is natural art and artificial art and the last beats the first fortunately for us women are strangers to the last they have had to throw off a mask before they have got the schooling so when they are thus armed we know what we meet and what are the weapons to be used alice if she is a fine fencer at all will expect to meet the ordinary english squire in me i have seen her at the baptismal font it is inconceivable she will fancy that at least she is ten times more subtle than i when i get the masteryit is unlikely to make me the master what may happen is that the nature of the girl will declare itself under the hard light of intimacy vulgar charles i cause to be absent for six weeks so there will be time enough for the probation i do not see him till he returns if by chance i had come earlier to see him and he to allude to her he would have had my conscience on his side and that is what a scrupulous man takes care to prevent i wonder whether my friends imagine me to be the same man whom they knew as gilbert pollingray a month back i see the change i feel the change but i have no retrospection no remorse no looking forward no feeling none for others very little for myself i am told that i am losing fluency as a dinnertable talker there is now more savour to me in a silvery laugh than in a spiced wit and this is the man who knows women and is far too modest to give a decided opinion upon any of their merits search myself through as i may i cannot tell when the change began or what the change consists of or what is the matter with me or what charm there is in the person who does the mischief she is the counterpart of dozens of girls lively browneyed brownhaired underbredit is not too harsh to say sounderbred slightly halfeducated whether quickwitted i dare not opine she is undoubtedly the last whom i or another person would have fixed upon as one to work me this unmitigated evil i do not know her and i believe i do not care to know her and i am thirsting for the hour to come when i shall study her is not this to have the poison of a bite in ones blood the wrath of venus is not a fable i was a hard reader and i despised the sex in my youth before the family estates fell to me since when i have playfully admired the sex i have dallied with a passion and not read at all save for diversion her anger is not a fable you may interpret many a mythic tale by the facts which lie in your own blood my emotions have lain altogether dormant in sentimental attachment i have i suppose boasted of python slain and cupid has touched me up with an arrow i trust to my own skill rather than to his mercy for avoiding a second from his quiver i will understand this girl if i have to submit to a close intimacy with her for six months there is no doubt of the elegance of her movements charles might as well take his tour and let us see him again next year yes her movements are or will be gracious in a years time she will have acquired the fuller tones and poetry of womanliness perhaps then too her smile will linger instead of flashing i have known infinitely lovelier women than she one i have known but let her be louise and i have long since said adieu chapter iv she behold me installed in dayton manor house and brought here for the express purpose so charles has written me word of my being studied that it may be seen whether i am worthy to be on some august future occasionpossiblya member oh so much to mumble of this great family had i known it when i was leaving home i should have countermanded the cording of my boxes if you please i do the packing and not the cording i must practise being polite or i shall be horrifying these good people i am mortally offended i am very very angry i shall show temper indeed i have shown it mr pollingray must and does think me a goose dear sir and i think you are justified if any one pretends to guess how i have names to suit that person i am a ninny an ape and mind i call myself these bad things because i deserve worse i am flighty i believe i am heartless charles is away and i suffer no pangs the truth is i fancied myself so exceedingly penetrating and it was my vanity looking in a glass i saw something that answered to my nods and howdyedos andbut i am ashamed and so penitent i might begin making a collection of beetles i cannot lift up my head mr pollingray is such a different man from the one i had imagined what that one was i have now quite forgotten i remember too clearly what the wretched guesser was i have been three weeks at dayton and if my sisters know me when i return to the vicarage they are not foolish virgins for my part i know that i shall always hate mrs romer pattlecombe and that i am unjust to the good woman but i do hate her and i think the stories shocking and wonder intensely what it was that i could have found in them to laugh at i shall never laugh again for many years perhaps when i am an old woman i may i wish the time had come all young people seem to me so helplessly silly i am one of them for the present and have no hope that i can appear to be anything else the young are a crowda shoal of small fry their elders are the select of the world on the morning of the day when i was to leave home for dayton a distance of eight miles i looked out of my window while dressingas early as halfpast sevenand i saw mr pollingrays groom on horseback leading up and down the walk a darling little round plump black cob that made my heart leap with an immense bound of longing to be on it and away across the downs and then the maid came to my door with a letter mr pollingray in return for her considerate good behaviour and saving of trouble to him officially begs his goddaughter to accept the accompanying little animal height h age years hunts is surefooted and likely to be the best jumper in the county i flew downstairs i rushed out of the house and up to my treasure and kissed his nose and stroked his mane i could not get my fingers away from him horses are so like the very best and beautifullest of women when you caress them they show their pleasure so at being petted they curve their necks and paw and look proud they take your flattery like sunshine and are lovely in it i kissed my beauty peering at his blackmottled skin which is like allingborough heath in the twilight the smell of his new saddle and bridleleather was sweeter than a garden to me the man handed me a large ridingwhip mounted with silver i longed to jump up and ride till midnight then mama and papa came out and read the note and looked at my darling little cob and my sisters saw him and kissed me for they are not envious girls the most distressing thing was that we had not a ridinghabit in the family i was ready to wear any sort i would have ridden as a guy rather than not ride at all but mama gave me a promise that in two days a ridinghabit should be sent on to dayton and i had to let my pet be led back from where he came i had no life till i was following him i could have believed him to be a fairy prince who had charmed me i called him prince leboo because he was black and good i forgive anybody who talks about first love after what my experience has been with prince leboo what papa thought of the present i do not know but i know very well what mama thought and for my part i thought everything not distinctly including that for i could not suppose such selfishness in one so generous as mr pollingray but i came to dayton in a state of arrogant pride that gave assurance if not ease to my manners i thanked mr pollingray warmly but in a way to let him see it was the matter of a horse between us you give i register thanks and theres an end he thinks me a fool a fool my habit i said comes after me i hope we shall have some rides together many replied mr pollingray and his bow inflated me with ideas of my condescension and because miss pollingray queen elizabeth he calls her looked half sad i read it i do not write what i read it to be behold the uttermost fool of all female creation led over the house by mr pollingray he showed me the family pictures i am no judge of pictures mr pollingray you will learn to see the merits of these im afraid not though i were to study them for years you may have that opportunity oh that is more than i can expect you will develop intelligence on such subjects by and by a dull sort of distant blow struck me in this remark but i paid no heed to it he led me over the gardens and the grounds the great john methlyn pollingray planted those trees and designed the house and the flowergarden still speaks of his task but he is not my master and consequently i could not share his three greatgrandsons veneration for him there are high firwoods and beech woods and a long ascending narrow meadow between them through which a brook falls in continual cascades it is the sort of scene i love for it has a woodland grandeur and seclusion that leads me to think and makes a better girl of me but what i said was yes it is the place of all others to come and settle in for the evening of ones days you could not take to it now said mr pollingray now my expression of face must have been a picture you feel called upon to decline such a residence in the morning of your days he persisted in looking at me as he spoke and i felt like something withering scarlet i am convinced he saw through me while his face was polished brass my selfpossession returned for my pride was not to be dispersed immediately please take me to the stables i entreated and there i was at home there i saw my prince leboo and gave him a thousand caresses he knows me already i said then he is some degrees in advance of me said mr pollingray is not cold dissection of ones character a cruel proceeding and i think too that a form of hospitality like this by which i am invited to be analysed at leisure is both mean and base i have been kindly treated and i am grateful but i do still say even though i may have improved under it it is unfair to proceed the dinner hour arrived the atmosphere of his own house seems to favour mr pollingray as certain soils and sites favour others he walked into the diningroom between us with his hands behind him talking to us both so easily and smoothly cheerfullynaturally and pleasantlyinimitable by any young man you hardly feel the change of room we were but three at table but there was no lack of entertainment mr pollingray is an admirable host he talks just enough himself and helps you to talk what does comfort me is that it gives him real pleasure to see a hearty appetite young men i know it for a certainty never quite like us to be so human ah which is right i would not miss the faith in our nobler essence which charles has but if it nobler one who has lived longer in the world ought to know better and mr pollingray approves of naturalness in everything i have now seen through charless eyes for several months so implicitly that i am timid when i dream of trusting to anothers judgement it is however a fact that i am not quite natural with charles every day mr pollingray puts on evening dress out of deference to his sister if young men had these good habits they would gain our respect and lose their own selfesteem less early after dinner i sang then mr pollingray read an amusing essay to us and retired to his library miss pollingray sat and talked to me of her brother and of her nephewfor whom it is that mr pollingray is beginning to receive company and is going into society charless subsequently received letter explained the receive company i could not comprehend it at the time the house has been shut up for years or rarely inhabited by us for more than a month in the year mr pollingray prefers france all his associations i may say his sympathies are in france latterly he seems to have changed a little but from normandy to touraine and dauphinywe had a triangular home over there indeed we have it still i am never certain of my brother while miss pollingray was speaking my eyes were fixed on a vidal crayon drawing faintly coloured with chalks of a foreign ladyi could have sworn to her being frenchyoung quite girlish i doubt if her age was more than mine she is pretty is she not said miss pollingray she is almost beautiful i exclaimed and miss pollingray seeing my curiosity was kind enough not to keep me in suspense that is the marquise de mazardouinnee louise de riverolles you will see other portraits of her in the house this is the most youthful of them if i except one representing a baby and bearing her initials i remembered having noticed a similarity of feature in some of the portraits in the different rooms my longing to look at them again was like a sudden jet of flame within me there was no chance of seeing them till morning so promising myself to dream of the face before me i dozed through a conversation with my hostess until i had got the french ladys eyes and hair and general outline stamped accurately as i hoped on my mind i was no sooner on my way to bed than all had faded the torment of trying to conjure up that face was inconceivable i lay and tossed and turned to right and to left and scattered my sleep but by and by my thoughts reverted to mr pollingray and then like sympathetic ink held to the heat i beheld her again but vividly as she must have been when she was sitting to the artist the hair was naturally crisped waving thrice over the forehead and brushed clean from the temples showing the small ears and tied in a knot loosely behind her eyebrows were thick and dark but soft flowing eyebrows far lovelier to my thinking than any pencilled arch dark eyes and full not prominent i find little expression of inward sentiment in very prominent eyes on the contrary they seem to have a fishlike dependency of gaze on what is without and show fishy depths if any for instance my eyes are rather prominent and i am just the little foolbut the french lady is my theme madame la marquise your eyes are sweeter to me than celestial i never saw such candour and unaffected innocence in eyes before accept the compliment of the pauvre anglaise did you do mischief with them did vidals delicate sketch do justice to you your lips and chin and your throat all repose in such girlish grace that if ever it is my good fortune to see you you will not be aged to me i slept and dreamed of her in the morning i felt certain that she had often said mon cher gilbert to mr pollingray had he ever said ma chere louise he might have said ma bien aimee for it was a face to be loved my change of feeling towards him dates from that morning he had previously seemed to me a man so much older i perceived in him now a youthfulness beyond mere vigour of frame i could not detach him from my dreams of the night he insists upon addressing me by the terms of our official relationship as if he made it a principle of our intercourse well and is your godpapa to congratulate you on your having had a quiet rest was his greeting i answered stupidly oh yes thank you and would have given worlds for the courage to reply in french but i distrusted my accent at breakfast the opportunity or rather the excuse for an attempt was offered his french valet francois waits on him at breakfast mr pollingray and his sister asked for things in the french tongue and as if fearing some breach of civility mr pollingray asked me if i knew french yes i know it that is i understand it i stuttered allons nous parlerons francais said he but i shook my head and remained like a silly mute i was induced towards the close of the meal to come out with a few french words i was utterly shamefaced mr pollingray has got the french manner of protesting that one is all but perfect in ones speaking i know how absurd it must have sounded but i felt his kindness and in my heart i thanked him humbly i believe now that a residence in france does not deteriorate an englishman mr pollingray when in his own house has the best qualities of the two countries he is gay and yes while he makes a study of me i am making a study of him which of us two will know the other first he was papas college friendpapas junior of course and infinitely more papas junior now i observe that weakness in him i mean his clinging to youthfulness less and less but i do see it i cannot be quite in error the truth is i begin to feel that i cannot venture to mistrust my infallible judgement or i shall have no confidence in myself at all after breakfast i was handed over to miss pollingray with the intimation that i should not see him till dinner gilbert is anxious to cultivate the society of his english neighbours now that he has as he supposes really settled among them she remarked to me at his time of life the desire to be useful is almost a malady but he cherishes the poor and that is more than an occupation it is a virtue her speech has become occasionally french in the construction of the sentences mais oui i said shyly and being alone with her i was not rebuffed by her smile especially as she encouraged me on i am she told me to see a monde of french people here in september so the story of me is to be completer or continued in september i could not get miss pollingray to tell me distinctly whether madame la marquise will be one of the guests but i know that she is not a widow in that case she has a husband in that case what is the story of her relations towards mr pollingray there must be some story he would not surely have so many portraits of her about the house and they travel with him wherever he goes if she were but a lovely face to him i cannot understand it they were frequent constant visitors to one anothers estates in france always together perhaps a man of mr pollingrays age or perhaps m le marquisand here i lose myself french habits are so different from ours one thing i am certain of no charge can be brought against my englishman i read perfect rectitude in his face i would cast anchor by him he must have had a dreadful unhappiness mama kept her promise by sending my riding habit and hat punctually but i had run far ahead of all the wishes i had formed when i left home and i half feared my ride out with mr pollingray that was before i had received charless letter letting me know the object of my invitation here i require at times a morbid pride to keep me up to the work i suppose i rode befittingly for mr pollingray praised my seat on horseback i know i can ride or feel the blast of a horse like my ownas he calls it yet he never could have had a duller companion my conversation was all yes and no as if it went on a pair of crutches like a miserable cripple i was humiliated and vexed all the while i was trying to lead up to the french lady and i could not commence with a single question he appears to have really cancelled the past in every respect save his calling me his goddaughter his talk was of the english poor and vegetation and papas goodness to his old dames in ickleworth parish and defects in my education acknowledged by me but not likely to restore me in my depressed state the ride was beautiful we went the length of a twelvemile ridge between ickleworth and hillford over high commons with immense views on both sides and through beechwoods oakwoods and furzy dells and downs spotted with juniper and yewtreesold picnic haunts of mine but mr pollingrays fresh delight in the landscape made them seem new and strange home through the valley the next day miss pollingray joined us wearing a feutre gris and green plume which looked exceedingly odd until you became accustomed to it her hair has decided gray streaks and that and the queen elizabeth nose and the feutre grisbut she is so kind i could not even smile in my heart it is singular that mr pollingray whos but three years her junior should look at least twenty years youngerat the very least his moustache and beard are of the colour of a corn sheaf and his blue eyes shining over them remind me of summer that describes him he is summer and has not fallen into his autumn yet miss pollingray helped me to talk a little she tried to check her brothers enthusiasm for our scenery and extolled the french paysage he laughed at her for when they were in france it was she who used to say there is nothing here like england miss fool rode between them attentive to the jingling of the bells in her cap yes and no at anybodys command in and out of season thank you charles for your letter i was beginning to think my invitation to dayton inexplicable when that letter arrived i cannot but deem it an unworthy baseness to entrap a girl to study her without a warning to her i went up to my room after i had read it and wrote in reply till the breakfastbell rang i resumed my occupation an hour later and wrote till one oclock in all fifteen pages of writing which i carefully folded and addressed to charles sealed the envelope stamped it and destroyed it i went to bed no i wont ride out today i have a headache i repeated this about halfadozen times to nobodys knocking on the door and when at last somebody knocked i tried to repeat it once but having the message that mr pollingray particularly wished to have my company in a ride i rose submissively and cried this humiliation made my temper ferocious mr pollingray observed my face and put it down in his notebook a savage disposition or no an untamed little rebel for he has hopes of me he had the cruelty to say so what i am i shall remain said i he informed me that it was perfectly natural for me to think it and on my replying that persons ought to know themselves best at my age perhaps he said and added i cannot speak very confidently of my knowledge of myself then you make us out to be nothing better than puppets mr pollingray if we have missed an early apprenticeship to the habit of selfcommand ma filleule merci mon parrain he laughed my french i suppose i determined that if he wanted to study me i would help him i can command myself when i choose but it is only when i choose this seemed to me quite a reasonable speech until i found him looking for something to follow in explanation and on coming to sift my meaning i saw that it was temper and getting more angry continued the sort of young people who have such wonderful command of themselves are not the pleasantest no he said they disappoint us we expect folly from the young i shut my lips prince leboo knew that he must go and a good gallop reconciled me to circumstances then i was put to jumping little furzes and ditches which one cannot pretend to do without a fair appearance of gaiety for while you are running the risk of a tumble you are compelled to look cheerful and gay at least i am to fall frowning will never do i had no fall my gallant leboo made my heart leap with love of him though millstones were tied to it i may be vexed when i begin but i soon ride out a bad temper and he is mine i am certainly inconstant to charles for i think of leboo fifty times more besides there is no engagement as yet between charles and me i have first to be approved worthy by mr and miss pollingray two pairs of eyes and ears over which i see a solemnly downy owl sitting conning their reports of me it is a very unkind ordeal to subject any inexperienced young woman to it was harshly conceived and it is being remorselessly executed i would complain more loudlyin shrieksif i could say i was unhappy but every night i look out of my window before going to bed and see the long falls of the infant river through the meadow and the dark woods seeming to enclose the house from harm i dream of the old inhabitant his ancestors and the numbers and numbers of springs when the wildflowers have flourished in those woods and the nightingales have sung there and i feel there will never be a home to me like dayton chapter v he for twenty years of my life i have embraced the phantom of the fairest woman that ever drew breath i have submitted to her whims i have worshipped her feet i have i believe strengthened her principle i have done all in my devotion but adopt her religious faith and i have as i trusted some time since awakened to perceive that those twenty years were a period of mere sentimental pastime perfectly useless fruitless unless as is possible it has saved me from other follies but it was a folly in itself can ones nature be too stedfast the question whether a spice of frivolousness may not be a safeguard has often risen before me the truth i must learn to think is that my mental power is not the match for my ideal or sentimental apprehension and native tenacity of attachment i have fallen into one of the pits of a wellmeaning but idle man the world discredits the existence of pure platonism in love i myself can barely look back on those twenty years of amatory servility with a full comprehension of the part i have been playing in them and yet i would not willingly forfeit the exalted admiration of louise for my constancy as little willingly as i would have imperilled her purity i cling to the past as to something in which i have deserved well though i am scarcely satisfied with it according to our english notions i know my name english notions however are not to be accepted in all matters any more than the flat declaration of a fact will develop it in alt its bearings when our english society shall have advanced to a high civilization it will be less expansive in denouncing the higher stupidities among us much of the social judgement of bodge upon the relations of men to women is the stereotyped opinion of the land there is the dictum here for a man who adores a woman who is possessed by a husband if he has long adored her and known himself to be preferred by her in innocency of heart if he has solved the problem of being her bosoms lord without basely seeking to degrade her to being his mistress the epithets to characterise him in our vernacular will probably be all the less flattering politically we are the most selfconscious people upon earth and socially the frankest animals the terrorism of our social laws is eminently serviceable for without it such frank animals as we are might run into bad excesses i judge rather by the abstract evidence than by the examples our fair matrons give to astounded foreigners when abroad louise writes that her husband is paralysed the marquis de mazardouin is at last tasting of his mortality i bear in mind the day when he married her she says that he has taken to priestly counsel and like a woman she praises him for that it is the one thing which i have not done to please her she anticipates his decease should she be freewhat then my heart does not beat the faster for the thought there are twenty years upon it and they make a great load but i have a desire that she should come over to us the old folly might rescue me from the new one not that i am any further persecuted by the dread that i am in imminent danger here i have established a proper mastery over my young lady nous avons change de role alice is subdued she laughs feebly is becoming consciousa fact to be regretted if i desired to check the creatures growth there is vast capacity in the girl she has plainly not centred her affections upon charles so that a mans conscience might be at ease ifif he chose to disregard what is due to decency but why when i contest it do i bow to the worlds opinion concerning disparity of years between husband and wife i know innumerable cases of an old husband making a young wife happy my friend dr galliot married his ward and he had the best wife of any man of my acquaintance she has been publishing his learned manuscripts ever since his death that is an extreme case for he was fortyfive years her senior and stood bald at the altar old general althorpe married julia dahoop and but for his preposterous jealousy of her might be cited in proof that the ordinary reckonings are not to be a yoke on the neck of one who earnestly seeks to spouse a fitting mate though late in life but what are fifty years they mark the prime of a healthy mans existence he has by that time seen the world can decide and settle and is virtually more eligibleto use the cant phrase of gossipsthan a young man even for a young girl and may not some fair and fresh reward be justly claimed as the crown of a virtuous career i say all this yet my real feeling is as if i were bald as dr galliot and jealous as general althorpe for with my thorough knowledge of myself i were i like either one of them should not have offered myself to the mercy of a young woman or of the world nor as i am and know myself to be would i offer myself to the mercy of alice amble when my filleule first drove into dayton she had some singularly audacious ideas of her own those vivid young feminine perceptions and untamed imaginations are desperate things to encounter there is nothing beyond their reach our safety from them lies in the fact that they are always seeing too much and imagining too wildly so that with a little help from us they may be taught to distrust themselves and when they have once distrusted themselves we need not afterwards fear them their supernatural vitality has vanished i fancy my pretty alice to be in this state now she leaves us tomorrow in the autumn we shall have her with us again and louise will scan her compassionately i desire that they should meet it will be hardly fair to the english girl but if i stand in the gap between them i shall summon up no small quantity of dormant compatriotic feeling the contemplation of the contrast too may save me from both like the logic ass with the two trusses of hay on either side of him chapter vi she i am at home there was never anybody who felt so strange in her home it is not a month since i left my sisters and i hardly remember that i know them they all and even papa appear to be thinking about such petty things they complain that i tell them nothing what have i to tell my prince my own leboo if i might lie in the stall with you then i should feel thoroughly happy that is if i could fall asleep evelina declares we are not eight miles from dayton it seems to me i am eight millions of miles distant and shall be all my life travelling along a weary road to get there again just for one long sunny day and it might rain when i got there after all my trouble nobody knows nobody knows a thing the night before my departure miss pollingray did me the honour to accompany me up to my bedroom she spoke to me searchingly about charles but she did not demand compromising answers she is not in favour of early marriages so she merely wishes to know the footing upon which we stand that of friends i assured her we were simply friends it is the firmest basis of an attachment she said and i did not look hurried but i gained my end i led her to talk of the beautiful marquise this is the tale mr pollingray when a very young man and comparatively poor went over to france with good introductions and there saw and fell in love with louise de riverolles she reciprocated his passion if he would have consented to abjure his religion and worship with her madame de riverolles her mother would have listened to her entreaties but gilbert was firm mr pollingray i mean refused to abandon his faith her mother consequently did not interfere and monsieur de riverolles her father gave her to the marquis de marzardouin a roue young nobleman immensely rich and shockingly dissipated and she married him no i cannot understand french girls do as i will it is quite incomprehensible to me how louise loving another could suffer herself to be decked out in bridal finery and go to the altar and take the marriage oaths not if perdition had threatened would i have submitted i have a feeling that mr pollingray should have shown at least one years resentment at such conduct and yet i admire him for his immediate generous forgiveness of her it was fatherly she was married at sixteen his forgiveness was the fruit of his few years seniority said miss pollingray whose opinion of the marquise i cannot arrive at at any rate they have been true and warm friends ever since constantly together interchangeing visits that is why mr pollingray has been more french than english for those long years miss pollingray concluded by asking me what i thought of the story i said it is very strange french habits are so different from ours i dare say i hope perhaps indeed mr pollingray seems happy now her idea of my wits must be that they are of the schoolgirl ordera perfect receptacle for indefinite impressions ah said she gilbert has burnt his heart to ashes by this time i slept with that sentence in my brain in the morning i rose and dressed dreaming as i was turning the handle of my door to go down to breakfast suddenly i swung round in a fit of tears it was so piteous to think that he should have waited by her twenty years in a slow anguish his heart burning out without a reproach or a complaint i saw him i still see him like a martyr some people miss pollingray said i permitted themselves to think evil of my brothers assiduous devotion to a married woman there is not a spot on his character or on that of the person whom gilbert loved i would believe it in the teeth of calumny i would cling to my belief in him if i were drowning i consider that those twenty years are just nothing if he chooses to have them so he has lived embalmed in a saintly affection no wonder he considers himself still youthful he is entitled to feel that his future is before him no amount of sponging would get the stains away from my horrid red eyelids i slunk into my seat at the breakfasttable not knowing that one of the maids had dropped a letter from charles into my hand and that i had opened it and was holding it open the letter as i found afterwards told me that charles has received an order from his uncle to go over to mr pollingrays estate in dauphiny on business i am not sorry that they should have supposed i was silly enough to cry at the thought of charless crossing the channel they did imagine it i know for by and by miss pollingray whispered les absents nauront pas tort cette fois nestcepas and mr pollingray was cruelly gentle an air of i would not intrude on such emotions and i heightened their delusions as much as i could there was no other way of accounting for my pantomime face why should he fancy i suffered so terribly he talked with an excited cheerfulness meant to relieve me of course but there was no justification for his deeming me a lovesick kind of woebegone ballad girl it caused him likewise to adopt a mannerwhat to call it i cannot think tender respect frigid regard anything that accompanies and belongs to the pressure of your hand with the fingertips he said goodbye so tenderly that i would have kissed his sleeve the effort to restrain myself made me like an icicle oh adieu mon parrain etext editors bookmarks a wise man will not squander his laughter if he can help it a woman is hurt if you

sixty years ago scene i professor spiral dame dresden lady oldlace virginia winifred swithin and osier as they slowly promenade the garden the professor is delivering one of his exquisite orations on woman spiral one husband the woman consenting to marriage takes but one for her there is no widowhood that punctuation of the sentence called death is not the end of the chapter for her it is the brilliant proof of her having a soul so she exalts her sex above the wrangle and clamour of the passions she is a fixed star after once recording her obedience to the laws of our common naturethat is to say by descending once to wedlockshe passes on in sovereign disengagementa dedicated widow by this time they have disappeared from view homeware appears he craftily avoids joining their party like one who is unworthy of such noble oratory he desires privacy and a book but is disturbed by the arrival of arden who is painfully anxious to be polite to her uncle homeware scene ii homeware arden arden a glorious morning sir homeware the sun is out sir arden i am happy in meeting you mr homeware homeware i can direct you to the ladies mr arden you will find them up yonder avenue arden they are

arden dedicated widow homeware the reference you will observe is to my niece astraea arden she is dedicated to whom homeware to her dead husband you see the reverse of astraea says the professor in those worldinfamous widows who marry again arden bah homeware astraea it is decided must remain solitary virgin cold like the little alpine flower professor spiral has his theme arden he will make much of it may i venture to say that i prefer my present company homeware it is a singular choice i can supply you with no weapons for the sort of stride in which young men are usually engaged you belong to the camp you are avoiding arden achilles was not the worse warrior sir for his probation in petticoats homeware his deeds proclaim it but alexander was the better chieftain until he drank with lais arden no i do not plead guilty to bacchus homeware you are confessing to the madder form of drunkenness arden how sir i beg homeware how when a young man sees the index to himself in

third of the gentlemen commissioned to consult the ladys uncle homeware arden the third homeware yes she is pursued it could hardly be otherwise her attractions are acknowledged and the house is not a convent yet mr arden i must remind you that all of you are upon an enterprise held to be profane by the laws of this region can you again forget that astraea is a widow arden she was a wife two months she has been a widow two years homeware the widow of the great and venerable professor towers is not to measure her widowhood by years his from the altar to the tomb as it might be read a one days walk arden is she in the pride of her youth to be sacrificed to a whimsical feminine delicacy homeware you have argued it with her arden i have presumed homeware and still she refused her hand arden she commended me to you sir she has a sound judgement of persons homeware i should put it that she passes the commissioners of lunacy on the ground of her being a humorous damsel your predecessors had also argued it with her and they too discovered their enemy in a whimsical feminine delicacy where is the difference between you evidently she cannot perceive it and i have to seek you will have had many conversations with astraea arden i can say that i am thrice the man i was before i had them homeware you have gained in manhood from conversations with a widow in her twentysecond year and you want more of her arden as much as i want more wisdom homeware you would call her your muse arden so prosaic a creature as i would not dare to call her that homeware you have the timely mantle of modesty mr arden she has prepared you for some of the tests with her uncle homeware arden she warned me to be myself without a spice of affectation homeware no harder task could be set a young man in modern days oh the humorous damsel you sketch me the dimple at her mouth arden frankly sir i wish you to know me better and i think i can bear inspection astraea sent me to hear the reasons why she refuses me a hearing homeware her reason i repeat is this to her idea a second wedlock is unholy further it passes me to explain the young lady lands us where we were at the beginning such must have been her humorous intention arden what can i do homeware love and war have been compared both require strategy and tactics according to my recollection of the campaign arden i will take to heart what you say sir homeware take it to head there must be occasional descent of lovers heads from the clouds and professor spiralbut here we have a belated breeze of skirts the reference is to the arrival of

more do i value my uncle homewares company she is affectionate to excess but has a roguish eye withal as of one who knows that uncle homeware suspects all young men and most young women homeware agree with the lady promptly my friend arden i would gladly boast of so lengthened an experience lady pluriel lyra i must have a talk with astraea my dear uncle her letters breed suspicions she writes feverishly the last one hints at service on the west coast of africa homeware for the draining of a pestiferous land or an enlightenment of the benighted black we could not despatch a missionary more effective than the handsomest widow in great britain lyra have you not seen signs of disturbance homeware a great oration may be a sedative lyra i have my suspicions homeware mr arden i could counsel you to throw yourself at lady pluriels feet and institute her as your confessional priest arden madam i am at your feet i am devoted to the lady lyra devoted there cannot be an objection it signifies that a man asks for nothing in return homeware have a thought upon your words with this lady mr arden arden devoted i said i am i would give my life for her lyra expecting it to be taken tomorrow or next day accept my encomiums a male devotee is within an inch of a miracle women had been looking for this model for ages uncle homeware you are the model mr arden lyra can you have intended to say that it is in view of marriage you are devoted to the widow of professor towers arden my one view lyra it is a star you are beseeching to descend arden it is lyra you disappoint me hugely you are of the ordinary tribe after all and your devotion craves an enormous exchange infinitely surpassing the amount you bestow arden it does she is rich in gifts i am poor but i give all i have lyra these lovers uncle homeware homeware a honeybag is hung up and we have them about us they would persuade us that the chief business of the world is a march to the altar arden with the right partner if the business of the world is to be better done lyra which right partner has been chosen on her part by a veiled woman who marches back from the altar to discover that she has chained herself to the skeleton of an idea or is in charge of that devouring tyrant an uxorious husband is mr arden in favour with the dame uncle homeware my sister is an unsuspicious potentate as you know pretenders to the hand of an inviolate widow bite like waves at a rock lyra professor spiral advances rapidly homeware not it would appear when he has his audience of ladies and their satellites lyra i am sure i hear a springtide of enthusiasm coming arden i will see he goes up the path lyra now my own dear uncle save me from pluriel i have given him the slip in sheer desperation but the man is at his shrewdest when he is left to guess at my heels tell him i am anywhere but here tell him i ran away to get a sense of freshness in seeing him again let me have one day of liberty or upon my word i shall do deeds i shall console young arden i shall fly to paris and set my cap at presidents and foreign princes anything rather than be eaten up every minute as i am may no woman of my acquaintance marry a man of twenty years her senior she marries a gigantic limpet at that period of his life a man becomes too voraciously constant homeware cupid clipped of wing is a destructive parasite lyra i am in dead earnest uncle and i will have a respite or else let decorum beware arden returns arden the ladies are on their way lyra i must get astraea to myself homeware my library is a virgin fortress mr arden

virginia winifred arden swithin osier lady oldlace such perfect rhythm winifred such oratory lady oldlace a master hand i was in a trance from the first sentence to the impressive close osier such oratory is a whole orchestral symphony virginia such command of intonation and subject swithin that resonant voice lady oldlace swithin his flow of eloquence he launched forth swithin like an eagle from a cliff osier the measure of the words was like a beat of wings swithin he makes poets of us dame dresden spiral achieved his pinnacle today virginia how treacherous is our memory when we have most the longing to recall great sayings osier true i conceive that my notes will be precious winifred you could take notes lady oldlace it seems a device for missing the quintessential swithin scraps of the body to the loss of the soul of it we can allow that our friend performed good menial service winifred i could not have done the thing swithin in truth it does remind one of the mess of pottage lady oldlace one hardly felt one breathed virginia i confess it moved me to tears swithin there is a pathos for us in the display of perfection such subtle contrast with our individual poverty affects us winifred surely there were passages of a distinct and most exquisite pathos lady oldlace as in all great oratory the key of it is the pathos virginia in great oratory great poetry great fiction you try it by the pathos all our critics agree in stipulating for the pathos my tears were no feminine weakness i could not be a discordant instrument swithin i must make confession he played on me too osier we shall be sensible for long of that vibration from the touch of a master hand arden an accomplished player can make a toyshop fiddle sound you a stradivarius dame dresden have you a right to a remark mr arden what could have detained you arden ah dame it may have been a warning that i am a discordant instrument i do not readily vibrate dame dresden a discordant instrument is out of place in any civil society you have lost what cannot be recovered arden there are the notes osier yes the notes swithin you can be satisfied with the dogs feast at the table mr arden osier ha virginia never have i seen astraea look sublimer in her beauty than with her eyes uplifted to the impassioned speaker reflecting every variation of his tones arden astraea lady oldlace she was entranced when he spoke of woman descending from her ideal to the gross reality of man osier yes yes i have the words reads woman is to the front of man holding the vestal flower of a purer civilization i see he says the little taper in her hands transparent round the light against rough winds dame dresden and of astraea herself what were the words natures dedicated widow swithin vestal widow was it not virginia maiden widow i think dame dresden we decide for dedicated winifred spiral paid his most happy tribute to the memory of her late husband the renowned professor towers virginia but his look was at dear astraea arden at astraea why virginia for her sanction doubtless arden ha winifred he said his pride would ever be in his being received as the successor of professor towers arden successor swithin guardian was it not osier tutor i think he said the three gentlemen consult osiers notes uneasily dame dresden our professor must by this time have received in full astraeas congratulations and lyra is hearing from her what it is to be too late you will join us at the luncheon table if you do not feel yourself a discordant instrument there mr arden arden going to her the allusion to knife and fork tunes my strings instantly dame dame dresden you must help me today for the professor will be tired though we dare not hint at it in his presence no reference ladies to the great speech we have been privileged to hear we have expressed our appreciation and he could hardly bear it arden nothing is more distasteful to the orator virginia as with every true genius he is driven to feel humbly human by the exultation of him swithin he breathes in a rarified air osier i was thrilled i caught at passing beauties i see that here and there i have jotted down incoherencies lines have seduced me so that i missed the sequencethe precious part ladies permit me to rank him with plato as to the equality of women and men winifred it is nobly said osier and with the stoics in regard to celibacy by this time all the ladies have gone into the house arden successor was the word successor arden swithin and osier are excitedly searching the notes when spiral passes and strolls into the house his air of selfsatisfaction increases their uneasiness they follow him astraea and lyra come down the path scene v astraea lyra lyra oh pluriel ask me of him i wish i were less sure he would not be at the next corner i turn astraea you speak of your husband strangely lyra lyra my head is out of a sack i managed my escape from him this morning by renouncing bath and breakfast and what a relief to be in the railway carriage alone that is when the engine snorted and if i set eyes on him within a week he will hear some truths his idea of marriage is the taking of the woman into custody my hat is on and on goes pluriels my foot on the stairs i hear his boot behind me in my boudoir i am alone one minute and then the door opens to the inevitable i pay a visit he is passing the house as i leave it he will not even affect surprise i belong to him i am cats mouse and he will look doating on me in public and when i speak to anybody he is that fearful picture of all smirks fling off a kid glove after a round of calls feel your handthere you have me now that i am out of him for my half a day if for as long astraea this is one of the worlds happy marriages lyra this is one of the worlds choice dishes and i have it planted under my nostrils eternally spare me the mention of pluriel until he appears thats too certain this very day oh good husband good kind of man whatever you please only some peace i do pray for the husbandhaunted wife i like him i like him of course but i want to breathe why an english boy perpetually bowled by a christmas pudding would come to loathe the mess astraea his is surely the excess of a merit lyra excess is a poison excess of a merit is a capital offence in morality it disgusts us with virtue and you are the cunningest of fencers tongue or foils you lead me to talk of myself and i hate the subject by the way you have practised with mr arden astraea a tiresome instructor who lets you pass his guard to compliment you on a hit lyra he rather wins me astraea he does at first lyra begins plurielizing without the law to back him does he astraea the fencing lessons are at an end lyra the duetts with mr swithins violoncello continue astraea he broke through the melody lyra there were readings in poetry with mr osier i recollect astraea his own compositions became obtrusive lyra no fencing no music no poetry no west coast of africa either i suppose astraea very well i am on my defence you at least shall not misunderstand me lyra one intense regret i have that i did not live in the time of the amazons they were free from this question of marriage this babble of love why am i so persecuted he will not take a refusal there are sacred reasons i am supported by every woman having the sense of her dignity i am perverted burlesqued by the fury of wrath i feel at their incessant pursuit and i despise mr osier and mr swithin because they have an air of pious agreement with the dame and are conspirators behind their mask lyra false false men astraea they come to me i am complimented on being the vulnerable spot lyra the object desired is usually addressed by suitors my poor astraea astraea with the assumption that as i am feminine i must necessarily be in the folds of the horrible constrictor they call love and that i leap to the thoughts of their debasing marriage lyra one of them goes to mr homeware astraea all are sent to him in turn he can dispose of them lyra now that is really masterly fun my dear most creditable to you love marriage a troop of suitors and uncle homeware no it would not have occurred to me andi am considered to have some humour of course he disposes of them he seemed to have a fairly favourable opinion of mr arden astraea i do not share it he is the least respectful of the sentiments entertained by me pray spare me the mention of him as you say of your husband he has that pitiful conceit in men which sets them thinking that a woman must needs be susceptible to the declaration of the mere existence of their passion he is past argument impossible for him to conceive a womans having a mind above the conditions of her sex a woman according to him can have no ideal of life except as a ball to toss in the air and catch in a cup put him aside we creatures are doomed to marriage and if we shun it we are a kind of cripple he is grossly earthy in his view of us we are unable to move a step in thought or act unless we submit to have a husband that is his reasoning nature nature i have to hear of nature we must be above nature i tell him or we shall be very much below he is ranked among our clever young men and he can be amusing so far he passes muster and he has a pleasant voice i dare say he is an uncle homewares good sort of boy girls like him why does he not fix his attention upon one of them why upon me we waste our time in talking of him the secret of it is that he has no reverence the marriage he vaunts is a mere convenient arrangement for two to live together under command of nature reverence for the state of marriage is unknown to him how explain my feeling i am driven into silence cease to speak of him he is the dupe of his eloquencehis passion he calls it i have only to trust myself to him andi shall be one of the worlds married women words are useless how am i to make him see that it is i who respect the state of marriage by refusing not he by perpetually soliciting once married married for ever widow is but a term when women hold their own against him as i have done they will be more esteemed i have resisted and conquered i am sorry i do not share in the opinion of your favourite lyra mine astraea you spoke warmly of him lyra warmly was it astraea you are not blamed my dear he has a winning manner lyra i take him to be a manly young fellow smart enough handsome too astraea oh he has good looks lyra and a head by repute astraea for the worlds work yes lyra not romantic astraea romantic ideas are for dreamy simperers lyra amazons repudiate them astraea laugh at me half my time i am laughing at myself i should regain my pride if i could be resolved on a step i am strong to resist i have not strength to move lyra i see the sphinx of egypt astraea and all the while i am a manufactory of gunpowder in this quiet oldworld sabbath circle of dear good souls with their stereotyped interjections and orchestra of enthusiasms their tapering delicacies the rejoicing they have in their common agreement on all created things to them it is restful it spurs me to fly from rooms and chairs and beds and houses i sleep hardly a couple of hours then into the early morning air out with the birds i know no other pleasure lyra hospital work for a variation civil or military the former involves the housesurgeon the latter the grateful lieutenant astraea not if a woman can resist i go to it proofarmoured lyra what does the dame say astraea sighs over me just a little maddening to hear lyra when we feel we have the strength of giants and are bidden to sit and smile you should rap out some of our old sweetinnocent garden oaths with hercarnation dame that used to make her dance on her seatbut dearest dame it is as natural an impulse for women to have that relief as for men and natural will out begonia it will we ran through the book of botany for devilish objurgations i do believe our misconduct caused us to be handed to the good man at the altar as the right corrective and you were the worst offender astraea was i i could be now though i am so changed a creature lyra you enjoy the studies with your spiral come astraea professor spiral is the one honest gentleman here he does homage to my principles i have never been troubled by him no silly hints or sidelooksyou know the dog at the forbidden bone lyra a grand orator astraea he is you fix on the smallest of his gifts he is intellectually and morally superior lyra praise of that kind makes me rather incline to prefer his inferiors he fed gobblegobble on your puffs of incense i coughed and scraped the gravel quite in vain he tapped for more and more astraea professor spiral is a thinker he is a sage he gives women their due lyra and he is a bachelor tooor consequently astraea if you like you may be as playful with me as the lyra of our maiden days used to be my dear my dear how glad i am to have you here you remind me that i once had a heart it will beat again with you beside me and i shall look to you for protection a novel request from me from annoyance i mean it has entirely altered my character sometimes i am afraid to think of what i was lest i should suddenly romp and perform pirouettes and cry carnation there is the bell we must not be late when the professor condescends to sit for meals lyra that rings healthily in the professor astraea arm in arm my lyra lyra no pluriel yet they enter the house and the time changes to evening of the same day the scene is still the garden scene vi astraea arden astraea pardon me if i do not hear you well arden i will not even think you barbarous astraea i am i am the object of the chase arden the huntsman draws the wood then and not you astraea at any instant i am forced to run or turn in my defence how can i be other than barbarous you are the cause arden no heaven that made you beautifuls the cause astraea say earth that gave you instincts bring me down to instincts when by chance i speak awhile with our professor you appear in haste full cry to sight again the missing hare away ideas all thats divinest flies i have to bear in mind how young you are arden you have only to look up to me four years instead of forty astraea sir arden theres my misfortune and worse that young i love as a young man could i but quench the fire i might conceal the youthfulness offending you so much astraea i wish you would i wish it earnestly arden impossible i burn astraea you should not burn arden tis more than i tis fire it masters will you would not say i should not if you knew fire it seizes it devours astraea dry wood arden cold wit how cold you can be but be cold for sweet you must be and your eyes are mine with them i see myself unworthy to usurp the place i hold a moment while i look i have my happiness astraea you should look higher arden through you to the highest only through you through you the mark i may attain is visible and i have strength to dream of winning it you are the bow that speeds the arrow you the glass that brings the distance nigh my world is luminous through you pure heavenly but hangs upon the roses outer leaf not next her heart astraea my own beloved astraea we may be excellent friends and i have faults arden name them i am hungering for more to love astraea i waver very constantly i have no fixity of feeling or of sight i have no courage i can often dream of daring when i wake i am in dread i am inconstant as a butterfly and shallow as a brook with little fish strange little fish that tempt the small boys net but at a touch straight dive i am any ones and no ones i am vain praise of my beauty lodges in my ears the lark reels up with it the nightingale sobs bleeding the flowers nod i could believe a poet though he praised me to my face arden never had poet so divine a fount to drink of astraea have i given you more to love arden more you have given me your inner mind where conscience in the robes of justice shoots light so serenely keen that in such light fair infants i newly criminal of earth as your friend osier says might show some blot seraphs might more to love oh these dear faults lead you to me like troops of laughing girls with garlands all the fear is that you trifle feigning them astraea for what purpose arden can i guess astraea i think tis you who have the triflers note my hearing is acute and when you speak two voices ring though you speak fervidly your osier quotation jars beware why were you absent from our meetingplace this morning arden i was on the way and met your uncle homeware astraea ah arden he loves you astraea he loves me he has never understood he loves me as a creature of the flock a little whiter than some others yes he loves me as men love not to uplift not to have faith in not to spiritualize for him i am a woman and a widow one of the flock unmarked save by a brand he said ityou confess it you have learnt to share his error erring fatally arden by

craves an enormous exchange miscellaneous prose contents introduction to w m thackerays the four georges a pause in the strife concession to the celt leslie stephen correspondence from the seat of war in italy letters written to the morning post from the seat of war in italy introduction to w m thackerays the four georges william makepeace thackeray was born at calcutta july the only child of richmond and anne thackeray he received the main part of his education at the charterhouse as we know to our profit thence he passed to cambridge remaining there from february to sometime in to judge by quotations and allusions his favourite of the classics was horace the chosen of the eighteenth century and generally the voice of its philosophy in a prosperous country his voyage from india gave him sight of napoleon on the rocky island in his young manhood he made his bow reverentially to goethe of weimar which did not check his hand from setting its mark on the sickliness of werther he was built of an extremely impressionable nature and a commanding good sense he was in addition a calm observer having the harvest of a quiet eye of this combination with the flood of subjects brought up to judgement in his mind came the prevalent humour the enforced disposition to satire the singular critical drollery notable in his works his parodies even those pushed to burlesque are an expression of criticism and are more effective than the serious method while they rarely overstep the line of justness the novels by eminent hands do not pervert the originals they exaggerate sieyes an abbe now a ferocious lifeguardsman stretches the face of the rollicking irish novelist without disfeaturing him and the mysterious visitor to the palatial mansion in holywell street indicates possibilities in the oriental imagination of the eminent statesman who stooped to conquer fact through fiction thackerays attitude in his great novels is that of the composedly urbane lecturer on a level with a select audience assured of interesting above requirements to excite the slow movement of the narrative has a grace of style to charm like the dance of the minuet de la cour it is the limpidity of addison flavoured with salt of a racy vernacular and such is the verisimilitude and the dialogue that they might seem to be heard from the mouths of living speakers when in this way the characters of vanity fair had come to growth their author was rightly appreciated as one of the creators in our literature he took at once the place he will retain with this great book and with esmond and the newcomes he gave a name eminent singular and beloved to english fiction charges of cynicism are common against all satirists thackeray had to bear with them the social world he looked at did not show him heroes only here and there a plain good soul to whom he was affectionate in the unhysterical way of an english father patting a son on the head he described his world as an accurate observer saw it he could not be dishonest not a page of his books reveals malevolence or a sneer at humanity he was driven to the satirical task by the scenes about him there must be the moralist in the satirist if satire is to strike the stroke is weakened and art violated when he comes to the front but he will always be pressing forward and thackeray restrained him as much as could be done in the manner of a goodhumoured constable thackeray may have appeared cynical to the devout by keeping him from a station in the pulpit among congregations of the many convicted sinners that the moralist would have occupied it and thundered had he presented us with the fourth of the georges we see when we read of his rejecting the solicitations of so seductive a personage for the satiric rod himself one of the manliest the kindliest of human creatures it was the love of his art that exposed him to misinterpretation he did stout service in his day if the bad manners he scourged are now lessened to some degree we pay a debt in remembering that we owe much to him and if what appears incurable remains with us a continued reading of his works will at least help to combat it a pause in the strife our eriniad or ballad epic of the enfranchisement of the sister island is closing its first fytte for the singer and with such result as those englishmen who have some knowledge of their fellows foresaw there are sufficient reasons why the tories should always be able to keep together but let them have the credit of cohesiveness and subordination to control though working for their own ends they won the esteem of their allies which will count for them in the struggles to follow their leaders appear to have seen what has not been distinctly perceptible to the opposite partythat the break up of the liberals means the defection of the old whigs in permanence heralding the establishment of a powerful force against radicalism with a capital cry to the country they have tactical astuteness if they seem rather too proud of their victory it is merely because as becomes them they do not look ahead to rejoice in the gaining of a day without having clear views of the morrow is puerile enough any tory victory it may be said is little more than a pause in the strife unless when the radical game is played to dish the whigs and the tories are now fast bound down by their incorporation of the latter to abstain from the violent springs and rightaboutfacings of the derbydisraeli period they are so heavily weighted by the new combination that their jackinthebox lord randolph will have to stand like an ordinary sentinel on duty and take the measurement of his natural size they must on the supposition of their entry into office even to satisfy their own constituents produce a scheme their majority in the house will command it to this extent then mr gladstone has not been defeated the question set on fire by him will never be extinguished until the combustible matter has gone to ashes but personally he meets a sharp rebuff the tories may well raise hurrahs over that radicals have to admit it and point to the grounds of it between a mans enemies and his friends there comes out a rough painting of his character not without a resemblance to the final summary albeit wanting in the justly delicate historical touch to particular features on the one side he is abused as the oneman power lauded on the other for his marvellous intuition of the popular will one can believe that he scarcely wishes to march dictatorially and full surely his egyptian policy was from step to step a misreading of the will of the english people he went forth on this campaign with the finger of egypt not ineffectively levelled against him a second time nevertheless he does read his english he has too the fatal tendency to the bringing forth of bills in the manner of jove big with minerva he perceived the necessity and the issue of the necessity clearly defined what must come and with a higher motive than the vanity with which his enemies charge him though not with such high counsel as wisdom at his ear fell to work on it alone produced the whole bill alone and then handed it to his cabinet to digest too much in love with the thing he had laid and incubated to permit of any serious dismemberment of its frame hence the disruption he worked for the future produced a bill for the future and is wrecked in the present probably he can work in no other way than from the impulse of his enthusiasm solitarily it is a way of making men overweeningly in love with their creations the consequence is likely to be that ireland will get her full measure of justice to appease her cravings earlier than she would have had as much from the united liberal cabinet but at a cost both to her and to england meanwhile we are to have a house of commons incapable of conducting public business the tradesmen to whom the times addressed pathetic condolences on the loss of their season will lose more than one and we shall be made sensible that we have an enemy in our midst until a people slow to think have taken counsel of their native generosity to put trust in the most generous race on earth concession to the celt things are quiet outside an anthill until the stick has been thrust into it mr gladstones bill for helping to the wiser government of ireland has brought forth our busy citizens on the toprubble in traversing counterswarms and whatever may be said against a bill that deals roughly with many sensitive interests one asks whether anything less violently impressive would have roused industrious england to take this question at last into the mind as a matter for settlement the liberal leader has driven it home and wantonly in the way of a pedestrian demagogue some think certainly to the discomposure of the comfortable and the myopely busy who prefer to live on with a disease in the frame rather than at all be stirred they can we see pronounce a positive electoral negative yet even they after the eighty and odd years of our domestic perplexity in the presence of the eighty and odd members pledged for home rule have been moved to excited inquiries regarding measuresshort of the obnoxious bill how much we suffer from sniffing the vain incense of that word practical is contempt of prevision many of the measures now being proposed responsively to the fretful cry for them as a better alternative to correction by force of arms are sound and just ten years back or at a more recent period before mr parnells triumph in the number of his followers they would have formed a basis for the appeasement of the troubled land the institution of county boards the abolition of the detested castle something like the establishment of a royal residence in dublin would have begun the work well materially and sentimentally they were the right steps to take they are now proposed too late they are regarded as petty concessions insufficient and vexatious the lower and the higher elements in the population are fused by the enthusiasm of men who find themselves marching in full body on a road under a flag at the heels of a trusted leader and they will no longer be fed with sops petty concessions are signs of weakness to the unsatisfied they prick an appetite they do not close breaches if our object is as we hear it said to appease the irish we shall have to give them the parliament their leader demands it might once have been much less it may be worried into a raving perhaps a desperate wrestling for still more nations pay sibylline prices for want of forethought mr parnells terms are embodied in mr gladstones bill to which he and his band have subscribed the one point for him is the statutory parliament so that ireland may civilly govern herself and standing before the world as representative of his country he addresses an applausive audience when he cites the total failure of england to do that business of government as at least a logical reason for the claim england has confessedly failed the world says it the country admits it we have failed and not because the socalled saxon is incapable of understanding the celt but owing to our system suitable enough to us of rule by party which puts perpetually a shifting hand upon the reins and invites the clamour it has to allay the irishthe english too in some degreehave been taught that roaring in its various forms is the trick to open the ears of ministers we have encouraged by irritating them to practise it until it has become a habit an hereditary profession with them ministers in turn have defensively adopted the arts of beguilement varied by an exercise of the police we grew accustomed to periods of irish fever the exhaustion ensuing we named tranquillity and hoped that it would bear fruit but we did not plant the party in office directed its attention to what was uppermost and urgentto that which kicked them although we were living by common consent with a disease in the frame eruptive at intervals a national disfigurement always a danger the ministerial idea of arresting it for the purpose of healing was confined before the passing of mr gladstones wellmeant land bill to the occasional despatch of commissions and in fine we behold through history the irish malady treated as a form of british constitutional gout parliament touched on the irish only when the irish were active as a virus our later alternations of cajolery and repression bear painful resemblance to the nervous fit of rickety riders compounding with their destinations that they may keep their seats the cajolery was foolish if an end was in view the repression inefficient to repress efficiently we have to stifle a conscience accusing us of old injustice and forget that we are sworn to freedom the cries that we have been hearing for cromwell or for bismarck prove the existence of an impatient faction in our midst fitter to wear the collars of those masters whom they invoke than to drop a vote into the ballotbox as for the prominent politicians who have displaced their rivals partly on the strength of an implied approbation of those cries we shall see how they illumine the councils of a governing people they are wiser than the barking dogs cromwell and bismarck are great names but the harrying of ireland did not settle it and to germanize a posen and call it peace will find echo only in the german tongue posen is the error of a mastermind too much given to hammer at obstacles he has however the hammer can it be imagined in english hands the braver exemplar for grappling with monstrous political tasks is cavour and he would not have hinted at the iron method or the bayonet for a pacification cavour challenged debate he had faith in the active intellect and that is the thing to be prayed for by statesmen who would register permanent successes the irish it is true do not conduct an argument coolly mr parnell and his eightyfive have not met the conservative leader and his following in the commons with the gravity of platonic disputants but they have a logical position equivalent to the best of arguments they are representatives they would say of a country admittedly illgoverned by us and they have accepted the bill of the defeated minister as final its provisions are their terms of peace they offer in return for that boon to take the burden we have groaned under off our hands if we answer that we think them insincere we accuse these thrice accredited representatives of the irish people of being hypocrites and crafty conspirators and numbers in england affected by the weapons they have used to get to their present strength do think it forgetful that our obtuseness to their constant appeals forced them into the extremer shifts of agitation yet it will hardly be denied that these men love ireland and they have not shown themselves by their acts to be insane to suppose them conspiring for separation indicates a suspicion that they have neither hearts nor heads for ireland separation is immediate ruin it would prove a very short sail for these conspirators before the ship went down the vital necessity of the union for both countries obviously for the weaker of the two is known to them and unless we resume our exasperation of the wild fellow the celt can be made by such a process we have not rational grounds for treating him or treating with him as a bedlamite he has besides his passions shrewd sense and his passions may be rightly directed by benevolent attraction this is language derided by the victorious enemy it speaks nevertheless what the world and even troubled america thinks of the irish celt more of it now on our side of the channel would be serviceable the notion that he hates the english comes of his fevered chafing against the harness of england and when subject to his fevers he is unrestrained in his cries and deeds that pertains to the nature of him of course if we have no belief in the virtues of friendliness and confidencenone in regard to the irishmanwe show him his footing and we challenge the issue for the sole alternative is distinct antagonism a form of war mr gladstones bill has brought us to that definite line ireland having given her adhesion to it swearing that she does so in good faith and will not accept a smaller quantity peace is only to be had by our placing trust in the irish we trust them or we crush them intermediate ways are but the prosecution of our ugly flounderings in bogland and dubious as we see the choice on either side a decisive step to right or left will not show us to the world so bemired to ourselves so miserably inefficient as we appear in this session of a new parliament with his eightyfive apart from external operations lawful or not mr parnell can act as a sort of lumbricus in the house let journalists watch and chronicle events if mr gladstone has humour they will yet note a peculiar smile on his closed mouth from time to time when the alien body within the house from which for the sake of its dignity and ability to conduct its affairs he would have relieved it till the day of a warmer intelligence between irish and english paralyzes our machinery business an ablyhandled coherent body in the midst of the liquid groups will make it felt that ireland is a nation naturally dependent though she must be we have to do with forces in politics and the great majority of the irish nationalists in ireland has made them a force no doubt mr matthew arnold is correct in his apprehensions of the dangers we may fear from a dublin house of commons the declarations and novel or ultra theories might almost be written down beforehand i should for my part anticipate a greater danger in the familiar attitude of the english metropolitan press and public toward an experiment they dislike and incline to dreadthe cynical comments the quotations between inverted commas the commiserating shrug cold irony raw banter growl of menace sharp snap rounds of laughter frenchmen of the young republic not presently appreciated as offensive have had some of these careless trifles translated for them and have been stung we favoured germany with them now and then before germany became the first power in europe before america had displayed herself as greatest among the giants that do not go to pieces she had as americans forgivingly remember without mentioning a series of flicks of the whip it is well to learn manners without having them imposed on us there are various ways for tripping the experiment nevertheless when the experiment is tried considering that our welfare is involved in its not failing as we have failed we should prepare to start it cordially cordially assist it thoughtful political minds regard the measure as a backward step yet conceiving but a prospect that a measure accepted by home rulers will possibly enable the irish and english to step together it seems better worth the venture than to pursue a course of prospectless discord whatever we do or abstain from doing has now its evident dangers and this being imminent may appear the larger of them but if a weighing of the conditions dictates it and conscience approves the wiser proceeding is to make trial of the untried our outlook was preternaturally black with enormous increase of dangers when the originator of our species venturesomely arose from the posture of the quatre pattes we consider that we have not lost by his temerity in states of dubitation under impelling elements the instinct pointing to courageous action is besides the manlier conjecturably the right one leslie stephen when that noble body of scholarly and cheerful pedestrians the sunday tramps were on the march with leslie stephen to lead them there was conversation which would have made the presence of a shorthand writer a benefaction to the country a pause to it came at the examination of the leaders watch and ordnance map under the western sun and void was given for the strike across country to catch the tail of a train offering dinner in london at the cost of a run through hedges over ditches and fellows past proclamation against trespassers under suspicion of being taken for more serious depredators in flight the chief of the tramps had a wonderful calculating eye in the observation of distances and the nature of the land as he proved by his discovery of untried passes in the higher alps and he had no mercy for pursy followers i have often said of this lifelong student and philosophical head that he had in him the making of a great military captain he would not have been opposed to the profession of arms if he had been captured early for the service notwithstanding his abomination of bloodshed he had a high calm courage was unperturbed in a dubious position and would confidently take the way out of it which he conceived to be the better we have not to deplore that he was diverted from the ways of a soldier though england as the country has been learning of late cannot boast of many in uniform who have capacity for leadership his work in literature will be reviewed by his lieutenant of tramps one of the ablest of writersfrederic w maitlandthe memory of it remains with us as being the profoundest and the most sober criticism we have had in our time the only sting in it was an inoffensive humorous irony that now and then stole out for a roll over like a furry cub or the occasional ripple on a lake in grey weather we have nothing left that is like it one might easily fall into the pit of panegyric by an enumeration of his qualities personal and literary it would not be out of harmony with the temper and characteristics of a mind so equable he the equable whether in condemnation or eulogy our loss of such a man is great for work was in his brain and the hand was active till close upon the time when his breathing ceased the loss to his friends can be replaced only by an imagination that conjures him up beside them that will be no task to those who have known him well enough to see his view of things as they are and revive his expression of it with them he will live despite the word farewell correspondence from the seat of war in italy letters written to the morning post from the seat of war in italy from our own correspondent ferrara june before this letter reaches london the guns will have awakened both the echo of the old river po and the classical mincio the whole of the troops about men with which cialdini intends to force the passage of the firstnamed river are already massed along the right bank of the po anxiously waiting that the last hour of tomorrow should strike and that the order for action should be given the telegraph will have already informed your readers that according to the intimation sent by general lamarmora on tuesday evening to the austrian headquarters the three days fixed by the generals message before beginning hostilities will expire at twelve pm of the rd of june cialdinis headquarters have been established in this city since wednesday morning and the famous general in whom the fourth corps he commands and the whole of the nation has so much confidence has concentrated the whole of his forces within a comparatively narrow compass and is ready for action i believe therefore that by tomorrow the right bank of the po will be connected with the mainland of the polesine by several pontoon bridges which will enable cialdinis corps darmee to cross the river and as everybody here hopes to cross it in spite of any defence the austrians may make on my way to this ancient city last evening i met general cadogan and two superior prussian officers who by this time must have joined victor emmanuels headquarters at cremona if not they have been by this time transferred elsewhere more on the front towards the line of the mincio on which according to appearance the first second and third italian corps darmee seem destined to operate the english general and the two prussian officers above mentioned are to follow the kings staff the first as english commissioner the superior in rank of the two others in the same capacity i have been told here that before leaving bologna cialdini held a general council of the commanders of the seven divisions of which his powerful corps darmee is formed and that he told them that in spite of the forces the enemy has massed on the left bank of the po between the point which faces stellata and rovigo the river must be crossed by his troops whatever might be the sacrifice this important operation requires cialdini is a man who knows how to keep his word and for this reason i have no doubt he will do what he has already made up his mind to accomplish i am therefore confident that before two or three days have elapsed these italian troops or a great part of them will have trod for the italians the sacred land of venetia once the river po crossed by cialdinis corps darmee he will boldly enter the polesine and make himself master of the road which leads by rovigo towards este and padua a glance at the map will show your readers how at about twenty or thirty miles from the firstmentioned town a chain of hills called the colli euganei stretches itself from the last spur of the julian alps in the vicinity of vicenza gently sloping down towards the sea as this line affords good positions for contesting the advance of an army crossing the po at lago scuro or at any other point not far from it it is to be supposed that the austrians will make a stand there and i should not be surprised at all that cialdinis first battle if accepted by the enemy should take place within that comparatively narrow ground which is within montagnana este terradura abano and padua it is impossible to suppose that cialdinis corps darmee being so large is destined to cross the po only at one point of the river below its course it is extremely likely that part of it should cross it at some point above between revere and stellata where the river is in two or three instances only metres wide were the italian general to be successfulprotected as he will be by the tremendous fire of the powerful artillery he disposes ofin these twofold operations the austrians defending the line of the colli euganei could be easily outflanked by the italian troops who would have crossed the river below lago scuro of course these are mere suppositions for nobody as you may imagine except the king cialdini himself lamarmora pettiti and menabrea is acquainted with the plan of the forthcoming campaign there was a rumour at cialdinis headquarters today that the austrians had gathered in great numbers in the polesine and especially at rovigo a small town which they have strongly fortified of late with an apparent design to oppose the crossing of the po were cialdini to attempt it at or near lago scuro there are about rovigo large tracts of marshes and fields cut by ditches and brooks which though owing to the dryness of the season they cannot be as it was generally believed two weeks ago easily inundated yet might well aid the operations the austrians may undertake in order to check the advance of the italian fourth corps darmee the resistance to the undertaking of cialdini may be on the part of the austrians very stout but i am almost certain that it will be overcome by the ardour of italian troops and by the skill of their illustrious leader as i told you above the declaration of war was handed over to an austrian major for transmission to count stancowick the austrian governor of mantua on the evening of the th by colonel bariola souschef of the general staff who was accompanied by the duke luigi of sant arpino the husband of the amiable widow of lord burghersh the duke is the eldest son of prince san teodoro one of the wealthiest noblemen of naples in spite of his high position and of his family ties the duke of sant arpino who is well known in london fashionable society entered as a volunteer in the italian army and was appointed orderly officer to general lamarmora the choice of such a gentleman for the mission i am speaking of was apparently made with intention in order to show the austrians that the neapolitan nobility is as much interested in the national movement as the middle and lower classes of the kingdom once so fearfully misruled by the bourbons the duke of sant arpino is not the only neapolitan nobleman who has enlisted in the italian army since the war with austria broke out in order to show you the importance which must be given to this pronunciamiento of the neapolitan noblemen allow me to give you here a short list of the names of those of them who have enlisted as private soldiers in the cavalry regiments of the regular army the duke of policastro the count of savignano guevara the eldest son of the duke of bovino the duke dozia dangri who had emigrated in and returned to naples six months ago marquis rivadebro serra marquis pisicelli whose family had left naples in out of devotion to francis ii two carraciolos of the historical family from which sprung the unfortunate neapolitan admiral of this name whose head lord nelson would have done better not to have sacrificed to the cruelty of queen caroline prince carini the representative of an illustrious family of sicily a nephew of the marquis del vasto and pescara a descendant of that great general of charles v to whom the proud francis i of france was obliged to surrender and give up his sword at the battle of pavia besides these neapolitan noblemen who have enlisted of late as privates the italian army now encamped on the banks of the po and of the mincio may boast of two colonnas a prince of somma two barons renzi an acquaviva of the duke of atri two capece two princes buttera etc to return to the mission of colonel bariola and the duke of sant arpino i will add some details which were told me this morning by a gentleman who left cremona yesterday evening and who had them from a reliable source the messenger of general lamarmora had been directed to proceed from cremona to the small village of le grazie which on the line of the mincio marks the austrian and italian frontier on the right bank of the lake of mantua in the year stood a small chapel containing a miraculous painting of the madonna called by the people of the locality santa maria delle grazie the boatmen and fishermen of the mincio who had been as they said often saved from certain death by the madonnaas famous in those days as the modern lady of rimini celebrated for the startling feat of winking her eyesdetermined to erect for her a more worthy abode hence arose the santuario delle grazie here as at loretto and other holy localities of italy a fair is held in which amongst a great number of worldly things rosaries holy images and other miraculous objects are sold and astounding boons are said to be secured at the most trifling expense the santuario della madonna delle grazie enjoying a farspread reputation the dumb deaf blind and haltin short people afflicted with all sorts of infirmitiesflock thither during the fair and are not wanting even on the other days of the year the church of le grazie is one of the most curious of italy not that there is anything remarkable in its architecture for it is an italian gothic structure of the simplest style but the ornamental part of the interior is most peculiar the walls of the building are covered with a double row of wax statues of life size representing a host of warriors cardinals bishops kings and popes whoas the story runspretended to have received some wonderful grace during their earthly existence amongst the grand array of illustrious personages there are not a few humbler individuals whose history is faithfully told if you choose to credit it by the painted inscriptions below there is even a convict who at the moment of being hanged implored succour of the allpowerful madonna whereupon the beam of the gibbet instantly broke and the worthy individual was restored to societya very doubtful benefit after all on colonel bariola and the duke of sant arpino arriving at this place which is only five miles distant from mantua their carriage was naturally stopped by the commissaire of the austrian police whose duty was to watch the frontier having told him that they had a despatch to deliver either to the military governor of mantua or to some officer sent by him to receive it the commissaire at once despatched a mounted gendarme to mantua two hours had scarcely elapsed when a carriage drove into the village of le grazie from which an austrian major of infantry alighted and hastened to a wooden hut where the two italian officers were waiting colonel bariola who was trained in the austrian military school of viller nashstad and regularly left the austrian service in acquainted the newlyarrived major with his mission which was that of delivering the sealed despatch to the general in command of mantua and receiving for it a regular receipt the despatch was addressed to the archduke albert commanderinchief of the austrian army of the south care of the governor of mantua after the major had delivered the receipt the three messengers entered into a courteous conversation during which colonel bariola seized an opportunity of presenting the duke purposely laying stress on the fact of his belonging to one of the most illustrious families of naples it happened that the austrian major had also been trained in the same school where colonel bariola was brought upa circumstance of which he was reminded by the austrian officer himself three hours had scarcely elapsed from the arrival of the two italian messengers of war at le grazie on the austrian frontier when they were already on their way back to the headquarters of cremona where during the night the rumour was current that a telegram had been received by lamarmora from verona in which archduke albert accepted the challenge victor emmanuel whom i saw at bologna yesterday arrived at cremona in the morning at two oclock but by this time his majestys headquarters must have removed more towards the front in the direction of the oglio i should not be at all surprised were the italian headquarters to be established by tomorrow either at piubega or gazzoldo if not actually at goito a village as you know which marks the italianaustrian frontier on the mincio the whole of the first second and third italian corps darmee are by this time concentrated within that comparatively narrow space which lies between the position of castiglione delle stiviere lorrato and desenzano on the lake of garda and solferino on one side piubega gazzoldo sacca goito and castellucchio on the other are these three corps darmee to attack when they hear the roar of cialdinis artillery on the right bank of the po are they destined to force the passage of the mincio either at goito or at borghetto or are they destined to invest verona storm peschiera and lay siege to mantua this is more than i can tell you for i repeat it the intentions of the italian leaders are enveloped in a veil which nobodythe austrians includedhas as yet been able to penetrate one thing however is certain and it is this that as the clock of victor emmanuel marks the last minute of the seventysecond hour fixed by the declaration delivered at le grazie on wednesday by colonel bariola to the austrian major the fair land where virgil was born and tasso was imprisoned will be enveloped by a thick cloud of the smoke of hundreds and hundreds of cannon let us hope that god will be in favour of right and justice which in this imminent and fierce struggle is undoubtedly on the italian side cremona june the telegraph will have already informed you of the concentration of the italian army whose headquarters have since tuesday been removed from redondesco to piadena the king having chosen the adjacent villa of cigognolo for his residence the concentrating movements of the royal army began on the morning of the th ie three days after the bloody fait darmes of the th which narrated and commented on in different manners according to the interests and passions of the narrators still remains for many people a mystery at the end of this letter you will see that i quote a short phrase with which an austrian major now prisoner of war portrayed the results of the fierce struggle fought beyond the mincio this officer is one of the few survivors of a regiment of austrian volunteers uhlans two squadrons of which he himself commanded the declaration made by this officer was thoroughly explicit and conveys the exact idea of the valour displayed by the italians in that terrible fight those who incline to overrate the advantages obtained by the austrians on sunday last must not forget that if lamarmora had thought proper to persist in holding the positions of valeggio volta and goito the austrians could not have prevented him it seems the austrian generalinchief shared this opinion for after his army had carried with terrible sacrifices the positions of monte vento and custozza it did not appear nor indeed did the austrians then give any signs that they intended to adopt a more active system of warfare it is the business of a commander to see that after a victory the fruit of it should not be lost and for this reason the enemy is pursued and molested and time is not left him for reorganization nothing of this happened after the thnothing has been done by the austrians to secure such results the frontier which separates the two dominions is now the same as it was on the eve of the declaration of war at goito at monzambano and in the other villages of the extreme frontier the italian authorities are still discharging their duties nothing is changed in those places were we to except that now and then an austrian cavalry party suddenly makes its appearance with the only object of watching the movements of the italian army one of these parties formed by four squadrons of the wurtemberg hussar regiment having advanced at six oclock this morning on the right bank of the mincio met the fourth squadron of the italian lancers of foggia and were beaten back and compelled to retire in disorder towards goito and rivolta in this unequal encounter the italian lancers distinguished themselves very much made some austrian hussars prisoners and killed a few more amongst whom was an officer the same state of thing prevails at rivottella a small village on the shores of the lake of garda about four miles distant from the most advanced fortifications of peschiera there as elsewhere some austrian parties advanced with the object of watching the movements of the garibaldians who occupy the hilly ground which from castiglione eseuta and cartel venzago stretches to lonato salo and desenzano and to the mountain passes of caffaro in the lastnamed place the garibaldians came to blows with the austrians on the morning of the th and the former got the best of the fray had the fait darmes of the th or the battle of custozza as archduke albrecht calls it been a great victory for the austrians why should the imperial army remain in such inaction the only conclusion we must come to is simply this that the austrian losses have been such as to induce the commanderinchief of the army to act prudently on the defensive we are now informed that the charges of cavalry which the austrian lancers and the hungarian hussars had to sustain near villafranca on the th with the italian horsemen of the aorta and alessandria regiments have been so fatal to the former that a whole division of the kaiser cavalry must be reorganised before it can be brought into the field main the regiment of haller hussars and two of volunteer uhlans were almost destroyed in that terrible charge to give you an idea of this cavalry encounter it is sufficient to say that colonel vandoni at the head of the aorta regiment he commands charged fourteen times during the short period of four hours the volunteer uhlans of the kaiser regiment had already given up the idea of breaking through the square formed by the battalion in the centre of which stood prince humbert of savoy when they were suddenly charged and literally cut to pieces by the alessandria light cavalry in spite of the long lances they carried this weapon and the loose uniform they wear makes them resemble the cossacks of the don there is one circumstance which if i am not mistaken has not as yet been published by the newspapers and it is this there was a fight on the th on a place at the north of roverbella between the italian regiment of novara cavalry and a regiment of hungarian hussars whose name is not known this regiment was so thoroughly routed by the italians that it was pursued as far as villafranca and had two squadrons put hors de combat whilst the novara regiment only lost twentyfour mounted men i think it right to mention this for it proves that the day after the bloody affair of the th the italian army had still a regiment of cavalry operating at villafranca a village which lay at a distance of fifteen kilometres from the italian frontier a report which is much accredited here explains how the italian army did not derive the advantages it might have derived from the action of the th it appears that the orders issued from the italian headquarters during the previous night and especially the verbal instructions given by lamarmora and pettiti to the staff officers of the different army corps were either forgotten or misunderstood by those officers those sent to durando the commander of the first corps seem to have been as follows that he should have marched in the direction of castelnuovo without however taking part in the action durando it is generally stated had strictly adhered to the orders sent from the headquarters but it seems that general cerale understood them too literally having been ordered to march on castelnuovo and finding the village strongly held by the austrians who received his division with a tremendous fire he at once engaged in the action instead of falling back on the reserve of the first corps and waiting new instructions if such was really the case it is evident that cerale thought that the order to march which he had received implied that he was to attack and get possession of castelnuovo had this village as it really was already been occupied by the enemy in mentioning this fact i feel bound to observe that i write it under the most complete reserve for i should be sorry indeed to charge general cerale with having misunderstood such an important order i see that one of your leading contemporaries believes that it would be impossible for the king or lamarmora to say what result they expected from their illconceived and worseexecuted attempt the result they expected is i think clear enough they wanted to break through the quadrilateral and make their junction with cialdini who was ready to cross the po during the night of the th that the attempt was illconceived and worseexecuted neither your contemporary nor the public at large has for the present the right to conclude for no one knows as yet but imperfectly the details of the terrible fight what is certain however is that general durando perceiving that the cerale division was lost did all that he could to help it failing in this he turned to his two aidesdecamp and coolly said to them now gentlemen it is time for you to retire for i have a duty to perform which is a strictly personal onethe duty of dying on saying these words he galloped to the front and placed himself at about twenty paces from a battalion of austrian sharpshooters which were ascending the hill in less than five minutes his horse was killed under him and he was wounded in the right hand i scarcely need add that his aidesdecamp did not flinch from sharing durandos fate they bravely followed their general and one the marquis corbetta was wounded in the leg the other count esengrini had his horse shot under him i called on durando who is now at milan the day before yesterday though a stranger to him he received me at once and speaking of the action of the th he only said i have the satisfaction of having done my duty i wait tranquilly the judgement of history assuming for arguments sake that general cerale misunderstood the orders he had received and that by precipitating his movement he dragged into the same mistake the whole of durandos corpsassuming i say this to be the right version you can easily explain the fact that neither of the two contending parties are as yet in a position clearly to describe the action of the th why did neither the one nor the other display and bring into action the whole forces they could have had at their disposal why so many partial engagements at a great distance one from the other in a word why that want of unity which in my opinion constituted the paramount characteristic of that bloody struggle i may be greatly mistaken but i am of opinion that neither the italian generalinchief nor the austrian archduke entertained on the night of the rd the idea of delivering a battle on the th there and only there lies the whole mystery of the affair the total want of unity of action on the part of the italians assured to the austrians not the victory but the chance of rendering impossible lamarmoras attempt to break through the quadrilateral this no one can deny but on the other hand if the italian army failed in attaining its object the failureowing to the bravery displayed both by the soldiers and by the generalswas far from being a disastrous or irreparable one the italians fought from three oclock in the morning until nine in the evening like lions showing to their enemies and to europe that they know how to defend their country and that they are worthy of the noble enterprise they have undertaken but let me now register one of the striking episodes of that memorable day it was five oclock pm when general bixio whose division held an elevated position not far from villafranca was attacked by three strong austrian brigades which had debouched at the same time from three different roads supported with numerous artillery an officer of the austrian staff waving a white handkerchief was seen galloping towards the front of bixios position and once in the presence of this general bade him surrender those who are not personally acquainted with bixio cannot form an idea of the impression this bold demand must have made on him i have been told that on hearing the word surrender his face turned suddenly pale then flushed like purple and darting at the austrian messenger said major if you dare to pronounce once more the word surrender in my presence i tell youand bixio always keeps his wordthat i will have you shot at once the austrian officer had scarcely reached the general who had sent him than bixio rapidly moving his division fell with such impetuosity on the austrian column which were ascending the hill that they were thrown pellmell in the valley causing the greatest confusion amongst their reserve bixio himself led his men and with his aidesdecamp cavaliere filippo fermi count martini and colonel malenchini all tuscans actually charged the enemy i have been told that on hearing this episode garibaldi said i am not at all surprised for bixio is the best general i have made once the enemy was repulsed bixio was ordered to manoeuvre so as to cover the backward movement of the army which was orderly and slowly retiring on the mincio assisted by the cooperation of the heavy cavalry commanded by general count de sonnaz bixio covered the retreat and during the night occupied goito a position which he held till the evening of the th in consequence of the concentrating movement of the italian army which i have mentioned at the beginning of this letter the fourth army corps cialdinis still holds the line of the po if i am rightly informed the decree for the formation of the fourth army corps was signed by the king yesterday this corps is that of garibaldi and is about strong an officer who has just returned from milan told me this morning that he had had an opportunity of speaking with the austrian prisoners sent from milan to the fortress of finestrelle in piedmont amongst them was an officer of a uhlan regiment who had all the appearance of belonging to some aristocratic family of austrian poland having been asked if he thought austria had really gained the battle on the th he answered i do not know if the illusions of the austrian army go so far as to induce it to believe it has obtained a victoryi do not believe it he who loves austria cannot however wish she should obtain such victories for they are the victories of pyrrhus there is at verona some element in the austrian councils of war which we dont understand but which gives to their operations in this present phase of the campaign just as uncertain and as vacillating a character as it possessed during the campaign of on friday they are still beyond the mincio and on saturday their small fleet on the lake of garda steams up to desenzano and opens fire against this defenceless city and her railway station whilst two battalions of tyrolese sharpshooters occupy the building on sunday they retire but early yesterday they cross the mincio at goito and monzambano and begin to throw two bridges over the same river between the lastnamed place and the mills of volta at the same time they erect batteries at goito torrione and valeggio pushing their reconnoitring parties of hussars as far as medole castiglione delle stiviere and montechiara this lastnamed place being only at a distance of twenty miles from brescia before this news reached me here this morning i was rather inclined to believe that they were playing at hideandseek in the hope that the leaders of the italian army should be tempted by the game and repeat for the second time the too hasty attack on the quadrilateral this news which i have from a reliable source has however changed my former opinion and i begin to believe that the austrian archduke has really made up his mind to come out from the strongholds of the quadrilateral and intends actually to begin war on the very battlefields where his imperial cousin was beaten on the th june it may be that the partial disasters sustained by benedek in germany have determined the austrian government to order a more active system of war against italy or as is generally believed here that the organisation of the commissariat was not perfect enough with the army archduke albert commands to afford a more active and offensive action be that as it may the fact is that the news received here from several parts of upper lombardy seems to indicate on the part of the austrians the intention of attacking their adversaries yesterday whilst the peaceable village of gazzoldofive italian miles from goitowas still buried in the silence of night it was occupied by hussars to the great consternation of the people who were roused from their sleep by the galloping of their unexpected visitors the sindaco or mayor of the village who is the chemist of the place was i hear forcibly taken from his house and compelled to escort the austrians on the road leading to piubega and redondesco this worthy magistrate who was not apparently endowed with sufficient courage to make at least half a hero was so much frightened that he was taken ill and still is in a very precarious condition these inroads are not always accomplished with impunity for last night not far from guidizzuolo two squadrons of italian light cavalrycavalleggieri di lucca if i am rightly informedat a sudden turn of the road leading from the lastnamed village to cerlongo found themselves almost face to face with four squadrons of uhlans the italians without numbering their foes set spurs to their horses and fell like thunder on the austrians who after a fight which lasted more than half an hour were put to flight leaving on the ground fifteen men hors de combat besides twelve prisoners whilst skirmishing of this kind is going on in the flat ground of lombardy which lies between the mincio and the chiese a more decisive action has been adopted by the austrian corps which is quartered in the italian tyrol and valtellina a few days ago it was generally believed that the mission of this corps was only to oppose garibaldi should he try to force those alpine passes but now we suddenly hear that the austrians are already masters of caffaro bagolino riccomassino and turano which points they are fortifying this fact explains the last movements made by garibaldi towards that direction but whilst the austrians are massing their troops on the tyrolese alps the revolution is spreading fast in the more southern mountains of the friuli and cadorre thus threatening the flank and rear of their army in venetia this revolutionary movement may not have as yet assumed great proportions but as it is the effect of a plan proposed beforehand it might become really imposing more so as the ranks of those italian patriots are daily swollen by numerous deserters and refractory men of the venetian regiments of the austrian army although the main body of the austrians seems to be still concentrated between peschiera and verona i should not wonder if they crossed the mincio either today or tomorrow with the object of occupying the heights of volta cavriana and solferino which both by their position and by the nature of the ground are in themselves so many fortresses supposing that the italian army should decide for actionand there is every reason to believe that such will be the caseit is not unlikely that as we had already a second battle at custozza we may have a second one at solferino that at the italian headquarters something has been decided upon which may hasten the forward movement of the army i infer from the fact that the foreign military commissioners at the italian headquarters who after the th june had gone to pass the leisure of their camp life at cremona have suddenly made their appearance at torre malamberti a villa belonging to the marquis araldi where lamarmoras staff is quartered a still more important event is the presence of baron ricasoli whom i met yesterday evening on coming here the president of the council was coming from florence and after stopping a few hours at the villa of cicognolo where victor emmanuel and the royal household are staying he drove to torre malamberti to confer with general lamarmora and count pettiti the presence of the baron at headquarters is too important an incident to be overlooked by people whose business is that of watching the course of events in this country and it should be borne in mind that on his way to headquarters baron ricasoli stopped a few hours at bologna where he had a long interview with cialdini nor is this all for the most important fact i have to report today is that whilst i am writing five oclock am three corps of the italian army are crossing the oglio at different pointsall three acting together and ready for any occurrence this reconnaissance en force may as you see be turned into a regular battle should the austrians have crossed the mincio with the main body of their army during the course of last night you see that the air around me smells enough of powder to justify the expectation of events which are likely to exercise a great influence over the cause of right and justicethe cause of italy marcaria july evening murrays guide will save me the trouble of telling you what this little and dirty hole of marcaria is like the river oglio runs due south not far from the village and cuts the road which from bozzolo leads to mantua it is about seven miles from castellucchio a town which since the peace of villafranca marked the italian frontier in lower lombardy towards this lastnamed place marched this morning the eleventh division of the italians under the command of general angioletti only a month ago minister of the marine in lamarmoras cabinet angiolettis division of the second corps was in the case of an attack to be supported by the fourth and eighth which had crossed the oglio at gazzuolo four hours before the eleventh had started from the place from which i am now writing two other divisions also moved in an oblique line from the upper course of the abovementioned river crossed it on a pontoon bridge and were directed to maintain their communications with angiolettis on the left whilst the eighth and fourth would have formed its right these five divisions were the avant garde of the main body of the italian army i am not in a position to tell you the exact line the army thus advancing from the oglio has followed but i have been told that in order to avoid the possibility of repeating the errors which occurred in the action of the th the three corps darmee have been directed to march in such a manner as to enable them to present a compact mass should they meet the enemy contrary to all expectations angiolettis division was allowed to enter and occupy castellucchio without firing a shot as its vanguard reached the hamlet of ospedaletto it was informed that the austrians had left castellucchio during the night leaving a few hussars who in their turn retired on mantua as soon as they saw the cavalry angioletti had sent to reconnoitre both the country and the borough of castellucchio news has just arrived here that general angioletti has been able to push his outposts as far as rivolta on his left and still farther forward on his front towards curtalone although the distance from rivolta to goito is only five miles angioletti i have been told could not ascertain whether the austrians had crossed the mincio in force what part both cialdini and garibaldi will play in the great struggle nobody can tell it is certain however that these two popular leaders will not be idle and that a battle if fought will assume the proportions of an almost unheard of slaughter general headquarters of the italian army torre malimberti july whilst the austrian emperor throws himself at the feet of the ruler of francei was almost going to write the arbiter of europeitaly and its brave army seem to reject disdainfully the idea of getting venetia as a gift of a neutral power there cannot be any doubt as to the feeling in existence since the announcement of the austrian proposal by the moniteur being one of astonishment and even indignation so far as italy herself is concerned one hears nothing but expressions of this kind in whatever italian town he may be and the italian army is naturally anxious that she should not be said to relinquish her task when austrians speak of having beaten her without proving that she can beat them too there are high considerations of honour which no soldier or general would ever think of putting aside for humanitarian or political reasons and with these considerations the italian army is fully in accord since the th june the way too in which the kaiser chose to give up the longcontested point by ignoring italy and recognising france as a party to the venetian question created great indignation amongst the italians whose papers declare one and all that a fresh insult has been offered to the country this is the state of public opinion here and unless the greatest advantages are obtained by a premature armistice and a hurried treaty of peace it is likely to continue the same not to the entire security of public order in italy as a matter of course all eyes are turned towards villa pallavicini two miles from here where the king is to decide upon either accepting or rejecting the french emperors advice both of which decisions are fraught with considerable difficulties and no little danger the king will have sought the advice of his ministers besides which that of prussia will have been asked and probably given the matter may be decided one way or the other in a very short time or may linger on for days to give time for public anxiety and fears to be allayed and to calm down in the meantime it looks as if the king and his generals had made up their mind not to accept the gift an attack on the borgoforte tetedepont on the right side of the po began on th at halfpast three in the morning under the immediate direction of general cialdini the attacking corps was the duke of mignanos all the day yesterday the gun was heard at torre malamberti as it was also this morning between ten and eleven oclock borgoforte is a fortress on the left side of the po throwing a bridge across this river the right end of which is headed by a strong tetedepont the object of the present attack this work may be said to belong to the quadrilateral as it is only an advanced part of the fortress of mantua which resting upon its rear is connected to borgoforte by a military road supported on the mantua side by the pietolo fortress the distance between mantua and borgoforte is only eleven kilometres the fetedepoet is thrown upon the po its structure is of recent date and it consists of a central part and of two wings called rocchetta and bocca di ganda respectively the lock here existing is enclosed in the rocchetta work since i wrote you my last letter garibaldi has been obliged to desist from the idea of getting possession of bagolino sant antonio and monte suello after a fight which lasted four hours seeing that he had to deal with an entire austrian brigade supported by uhlans sharpshooters almost a battalion and twelve pieces of artillery these positions were subsequently abandoned by the enemy and occupied by garibaldis volunteers in this affair the general received a slight wound in his left leg the nature of which however is so very trifling that a few days will be enough to enable him to resume active duties it seems that the arms of the austrians proved to be much superior to those of the garibaldians whose guns did very bad service the loss of the latter amounted to about killed and wounded figures in which the officers appear in great proportion owing to their having been always at the head of their men fighting charging and encouraging their comrades throughout captain adjutantmajor battino formerly of the regular army died struck by three bullets while rushing on the austrians with the first regiment on abandoning the caffaro line which they had reoccupied after the lodrone encounterin consequence of which the garibaldians had to fall back because of the concentration following the battle of custozzathe austrians have retired to the lardara fortress between the stabolfes and tenara mountains covering the route to tione and trento in the italian tyrol the third regiment of volunteers suffered most as two of their companies had to bear the brunt of the terrible austrian fire kept up from formidable positions another fight was taking place almost at the same time in the val camonico ie north of the caffaro and of rocca danfo garibaldis point dappui this encounter was sustained in the same proportions the italians losing one of their bravest and best officers in the person of major castellini a milanese commander of the second battalion of lombardian bersaglieri although these and major caldesis battalion had to fall back from vezza a strong position was taken near edalo while in the rear a regiment kept breno safe although still at headquarters only two days ago baron ricasoli has been suddenly summoned by telegram from florence and as i hear has just arrived this is undoubtedly brought about by the new complications especially as at a council of ministers presided over by the baron a vote the nature of which is as yet unknown was taken on the present state of affairs as you know very well in england italy has great confidence in ricasoli whose conduct always far from obsequious to the french emperor has pleased the nation he is thought to be at this moment the right man in the right place and with the great acquaintance he possesses of italy and the italians and with the cooperation of such an honest man as general lamarmora italy may be pronounced safe both against friends and enemies from what i saw this morning coming back from the front i presume that something and that something new perhaps will be attempted tomorrow so far the proposed armistice has had no effect upon the dispositions at general headquarters and did not stay the cannons voice in the middle of rumours of hopes and fears italys wish to push on with the war has as yet been adhered to by her trusted leaders headquarters of the first army corps piadena july as i begin writing you no doubt can be entertained that some movement is not only in contemplation at headquarters but is actually provided to take place today and that it will probably prove to be against the austrian positions at borgoforte on the left bank of the po up to this time the tetedepout on the right side of the river had only been attacked by general the duke of mignanos guns it would now on the contrary be a matter of cutting the communications between borgoforte and mantua by occupying the lower part of the country around the latter fortress advancing upon the valli veronesi and getting round the quadrilateral into venetia while then waiting for further news to tell us whether this plan has been carried into execution and whether it will be pursued mindless of the existence of mantua and borgoforte on its flanks one great fact is already ascertained that the armistice proposed by the emperor napoleon has not been accepted and that the war is to be continued the austrians may shut themselves up in their strongholds or may even be so obliging as to leave the king the uncontested possession of them by retreating in the same line as their opponents advance the pursuit if not the struggle the war if not the battle will be carried on by the italians at torre malamberti where the general headquarters are no end of general officers were to be seen yesterday hurrying in all directions i met the king generals brignone gavone valfre and menabrea within a few minutes of one another and prince amadeus who has entirely recovered from his wound had been telegraphed for and will arrive in cremona today no precise information is to be obtained respecting the intentions of the austrians but it is to be hoped for the italian army and for the credit of its generals that more will be known about them now than was known on the eve of the famous th of june and on its very morning the heroism of the italians on that memorable day surpasses any possible idea that can be formed as it did also surpass all expectations of the country let me relate you a few out of many heroic facts which only come to light when an occasion is had of speaking with those who have been eyewitnesses of them as they are no object of magnified regimentalorders or as yet of welldeserved honours italian soldiers seem to think that the army only did its duty and that wherever italians may fight they will always show equal valour and firmness captain biraghi of milan belonging to the general staff having in the midst of the battle received an order from general lamarmora for general durando was proceeding with all possible speed towards the first army corps which was slowly retreating before the superior forces of the enemy and before the greatly superior number of his guns when while under a perfect shower of grape and canister he was all of a sudden confronted by an austrian officer of cavalry who had been lying in wait for the italian orderly the austrian fires his revolver at biraghi and wounds him in the arm nothing daunted biraghi assails him and makes him turn tail then following in pursuit unsaddles him but has his own horse shot down under him biraghi disentangles himself kills his antagonist and jumps upon the latters horse this however is thrown down also in a moment by a cannon ball so that the gallant captain has to go back on foot bleeding and almost unable to walk talking of heroism of inimitable endurance and strength of soul what do you think of a man who has his arm entirely carried away by a grenade and yet keeps on his horse firm as a rock and still directs his battery until hemorrhageand hemorrhage alonestrikes him down at last dead such was the case with a neapolitanmajor abate of the artilleryand his name is worth the glory of a whole army of a whole war and may only find a fit companion in that of an officer of the eighteenth battalion of bersaglieri who dashing at an austrian flagbearer wrenches the standard out of his hands with his left one has it clean cut away by an austrian officer standing near and immediately grapples it with his right until his own soldiers carry him away with his trophy does not this sound like greek history repeateddoes it not look as if the brave men of old had been born again and the old facts renewed to tell of italian heroism another bersaglierea tuscan by name orlandi matteo belonging to that heroic fifth battalion which fought against entire brigades regiments and battalions losing out of its officers and about out of its menorlandi was wounded already when perceiving an austrian flag he makes a great effort dashes at the officer kills him takes the flag and almost dying gives it over to his lieutenant he is now in a ward of the san domenico hospital in brescia and all who have learnt of his bravery will earnestly hope that he may survive to be pointed out as one of the many who covered themselves with fame on that day if it is sad to read of death encountered in the field by so many a patriotic and brave soldiers it is sadder still to learn that not a few of them were barbarously killed by the enemy and killed too when they were harmless for they lay wounded on the ground the sicilian colonel stalella a soninlaw of senator castagnetto and a courageous man amongst the most courageous of men was struck in the leg by a bullet and thrown down from his horse while exciting his men to repulse the austrians which in great masses were pressing on his thinned column although retreating the regiment sent some of his men to take him away but as soon as he had been put on a stretcher he had to be put down as ten or twelve uhlans were galloping down obliging the men to hide themselves in a bush when the uhlans got near the colonel and when they had seen him lying down in agony they all planted their lances in his body is not this wanton crueltycruelty even unheard of cruelty that no savage possesses still these are facts and no one will ever dare to deny them from verona and vienna for they are known as much as it was known and seen that the uhlans and many of the austrian soldiers were drunk when they began fighting and that alighting from the trains they were provided with their rations and with rum and that they fought without their haversacks this is the truth and nothing beyond it has to the honour of the italians been asserted whether to the disgrace or credit of their enemies so that while denying that they illtreat austrian prisoners they are ready to state that theirs are well treated in verona without thinking of slandering and calumniating as the vienna papers have done this morning prince amadeus arrived in cremona where a most spontaneous and hearty reception was given him by the population and the national guard he proceeded at once by the shortest way to the headquarters so that his wish to be again at the front when something should be done has been accomplished this brave young man and his worthy brother prince humbert have won the applause of all italy which is justly proud of counting her king and her princes amongst the foremost in the field i have just learned from a most reliable source that the austrians have mined the bridge of borghetto on the mincio so that should it be blown up the only two those of goito and borghetto would be destroyed and the italians obliged to make provisional ones instead i also hear that the venetian towns are without any garrison and that most probably all the forces are massed on two lines one from peschiera to custozza and the other behind the adige you will probably know by this time that the garrison of vienna had on the rd been directed to prague the news we receive from prussia is on the whole encouraging inasmuch as the greatly feared armistice has been repulsed by king william some people here think that france will not be too hard upon italy for keeping her word with her ally and that the brunt of french anger or disapproval will have to be borne by prussia this is the least she can expect as you know it is probable that by tomorrow i shall be able to write you more about the italoaustrian war of gonzaga july i write you from a villa only a mile distant from gonzaga belonging to the family of the counts arrivabene of mantua the owners have never reentered it since and it is only the fortune of war which has brought them to see their beautiful seat of the aldegatta never it is to be hoped for them to be abandoned again it is as you see mutatum ab illo onward have gone then the exiled patriots onward will go the nation that owns them the wish of every one who is compelled to remain behind is that the army that the volunteers that the fleet should all cooperate and that they should one and all land on venetian ground to seek for a great battle to give the army back the fame it deserves and to the country the honour it possesses the king is called upon to maintain the word nobly given to avenge novara and with it the new austrian insulting proposal all it is said is ready the army has been said to be numerous if to be numerous and brave means to deserve victory let the italian generals prove what italian soldiers are worthy of if they will fight the country will support them with the boldest of resolutionsthe country will accept a discussion whenever the government having dispersed all fears will proclaim that the war is to be continued till victory is inscribed on italys shield as i am not far from borgoforte i am able to learn more than the mere cannons voice can tell me and so will give you some details of the action against the tetedepont which began as i told you in one of my former letters on the th in gorgoforte there were about austrians and on the night from the th to the th they kept up from their four fortified works a sufficiently wellsustained fire the object of which was to prevent the enemy from posting his guns this fire however did not cause any damage and the italians were able to plant their batteries early on the th the firing began all along the line the italian pounders having been the first to open fire the italian right was commanded by colonel mattei the left by colonel bangoni who did excellent work while the other wing was not so successful the heaviest guns had not yet arrived owing to one of those incidents always sure to happen when least expected so that the pounders could not be brought to bear against the forts until later in the day the damage done to the works was not great for the moment but still the advantage had been gained of feeling the strength of the enemys positions and finding the right way to attack them the artillerymen worked with great vigour and were only obliged to desist by an unexpected order which arrived about two pm from general cialdini the attack was however resumed on the following day and the condition of the monteggiana and rochetta forts may be pronounced precarious as a sign of the times and more especially of the just impatience which prevails in italy about the general direction of the army movements it may not be without importance to notice that the italian press has begun to cry out against the darkness in which everything is enveloped while the time already passed since the th june tells plainly of inaction it is remarked that the bitter gift made by austria of the venetian provinces and the suspicious offer of mediation by france ought to have found italy in greatly different condition both as regards her political and military position italy is on the contrary in exactly the same state as when the archduke albert telegraphed to vienna that a great success had been obtained over the italian army these are facts and however strong and worthy of respect may be the reasons there is no doubt that an extraordinary delay in the resumption of hostilities has occurred and that at the present moment operations projected are perfectly mysterious something is let out from time to time which only serves to make the subsequent absence of news more and more puzzling for the present the first official relation of the unhappy fight of the th june is published and is accordingly anxiously scanned and closely studied it is a matter of general remark that no great military knowledge is required to perceive that too great a reliance was placed upon supposed facts and that the indulgence of speculations and ideas caused the waste of so much precious blood the prudence characterising the subsequent moves of the austrians may have been caused by the effects of their opponents arrangements but the italian commanders ought to have avoided the responsibility of giving the enemy the option to move it is clear that to mend things the utterance of generous and patriotic cries is not sufficient and that it must be shown that the vigour of the body is not at all surpassed by the vigour of the mind it is also clear that many lives might have been spared if there had been greater proofs of intelligence on the part of those who directed the movement the situation is still very serious such an armistice as general von gablenz could humiliate himself enough to ask from the prussians has been refused but another which the emperor of the french has advised them to accept might ultimately become a fact for italy the purely venetian question could then also be settled while the italian the national question the question of right and honour which the army prizes so much would still remain to be solved gonzaga july travelling is generally said to be troublesome but travelling with and through brigades divisions and army corps i can certify to be more so than is usually agreeable it is not that italian officers or italian soldiers are in any way disposed to throw obstacles in your way but they unhappily for you have with them the inevitable cars with the inevitable carmen both of which are enough to make your blood freeze though the barometer stands very high what with their indolence what with their number and the dust they made i really thought they would drive me mad before i should reach casalmaggiore on my way from torre malamberti i started from the former place at three am with beautiful weather which true to tradition accompanied me all through my journey passing through san giovanni in croce to which the headquarters of general pianell had been transferred i turned to the right in the direction of the po and began to have an idea of the wearisome sort of journey which i would have to make up to casalmaggiore on both sides of the way some regiments belonging to the rear division were still camped and as i passed it was most interesting to see how busy they were cooking their rancio polishing their arms and making the best of their time the officers stood leisurely about gazing and staring at me supposing as i thought that i was travelling with some part in the destiny of their country here and there some soldiers who had just left the hospitals of brescia and milan made their way to their corps and shook hands with their comrades from whom only illness or the fortune of war had made them part they seemed glad to see their old tent their old drum their old coloursergeant and also the flag they had carried to the battle and had not at any price allowed to be taken i may state here en passant that as many as six flags were taken from the enemy in the first part of the day of custozza and were subsequently abandoned in the retreat while of the italians only one was lost to a regiment for a few minutes when it was quickly retaken this fact ought to be sufficient by itself to establish the bravery with which the soldiers fought on the th and the bravery with which they will fight if as they ardently wish a new occasion is given to them as long as i had only met troops either marching or camping on the road all went well but i soon found myself mixed with an interminable line of cars and the like forming the military and the civil train of the moving army then it was that it needed as much patience to keep from jumping out of ones carriage and from chastising the carrettieri as they would persist in not making room for one and being as dumb to ones entreaties as a stone when you had finished with one you had to deal with another and you find them all as obstinate and as egotistical as they are from one end of the world to the other whether it be on the casalmaggiore road or in high holborn from time to time things seemed to proceed all right and you thought yourself free from further trouble but you soon found out your mistake as an enormous ammunition car went smack into your path as one wheel got entangled with another and as imperturbable signor carrettiere evidently took delight at a fresh opportunity for stoppage inaction indolence and sleep i soon came to the conclusion that italy would not be free when the austrians had been driven away for that another and a more formidable foean enemy to society and comfort to men and horses to mankind in general would have still to be beaten expelled annihilated in the shape of the carrettiere if you employ him he robs you fifty times over if you want him to drive quickly he is sure to keep the animal from going at all if worse than all you never think of him or have just been plundered by him he will not move an inch to oblige you surely the cholera is not the only pestilence a country may be visited with and should cialdini ever go to vienna he might revenge novara and the spielberg by taking with him the carrettieri of the whole army at last casalmaggiore hove in sight and when good fortune and the carmen permitted i reached it it was time no ironplated jacob could ever have resisted another two miles journey in such company at casalmaggiore i branched off there were happily two roads and not the slightest reason or smallest argument were needed to make me choose that which my cauchemar had not chosen they were passing the river at casalmaggiore i went of course for the same purpose somewhere else any place was good enoughso i thought at least then new adventures new miseries awaited mesome carrettiere or other guessing that i was no friend of his nor of the whole set of them had thrown the jattatura on me i alighted at the colombina after four hours ride to give the horses time to rest a little the albergo della colombina was a great disappointment for there was nothing there that could be eaten i decided upon waiting most patiently but most unlike a few cavalry officers who all covered with dust and evidently as hungry and as thirsty as they could be began to swear to their hearts content in an hour some eggs and some salame a kind of sausage were brought up and quickly disposed of a young lieutenant of the thirtieth infantry regiment of the pisa brigade took his place opposite and we were soon engaged in conversation he had been in the midst and worst part of the battle of custozza and had escaped being taken prisoner by what seemed a miracle he told me how when his regiment advanced on the monte croce position which he practically described to me as having the form of an english pudding they were fired upon by batteries both on their flanks and front the lieutenant added however rather contemptuously that they did not even bow before them as the custom appears to bethat is to lie down as the austrians were firing very badly the crossfire got however so tremendous that an order had to be given to keep down by the road to avoid being annihilated the assault was given the whole range of positions was taken and kept too for hours until the infallible rule of three to one backed by batteries grape and canister compelled them to retreat which they did slowly and in order it was then that their brigade commander major general rey de villarey who though a native of mentone had preferred remaining with his king from going over to the french after the cession turning to his son who was also his aidedecamp said in his dialect now my son we must die both of us and with a touch of the spurs was soon in front of the line and on the hill where three bullets struck him almost at once dead the horse of his son falling while following his life was spared my lieutenant at this moment was so overcome with hunger and fatigue that he fell down and was thought to be dead he was not so however and had enough life to hear after the fight was over the austrian jagers pass by and again retire to their original positions where their infantry was lying down not dreaming for one moment of pursuing the italians four of his soldiersall neapolitans he heard coming in search of him while the bullets still hissed all round and as soon as he made a sign to them they approached and took him on their shoulders back to where was what remained of the regiment it is highly creditable to italian unity to hear an old piedmontese officer praise the levies of the new provinces and the lieutenant took delight in relating that another neapolitan was in the fight standing by him and firing as fast as he could when a shell having burst near him he disdainfully gave it a look and did not even seek to save himself from the jattatura the gallant lieutenant had unfortunately to leave at last and i was deprived of many an interesting tale and of a brave mans company i started therefore for viadana where i purposed passing the po the left bank of which the road was now following parallel with the stream at viadana however i found no bridge as the military had demolished what existed only the day before and so had to look out for in formation as i was going about under the porticoes which one meets in almost all the villages in this neighbourhood i was struck by the sight of an ancient and beautiful piece of artfor so it wasa venetian mirror of murano it hung on the wall inside the village drapers shop and was readily shown me by the owner who did not conceal the pride he had in possessing it it was one of those mirrors one rarely meets with now which were once so abundant in the old princes castles and palaces it looked so deep and true and the gilt frame was so light and of such a purity and elegance that it needed all my resolution to keep from buying it though a bargain would not have been effected very easily the mirror however had to be abandoned as dosalo the nearest point for crossing the po was still seven miles distant by this time the sun was out in all its force and the heat was by no means agreeable then there was dust too as if the carrettieri had been passing in hundreds so that the heat was almost unbearable at last the dosalo ferry was reached the road leading to it was entered and the carriage was i thought to be at once embarked when a drove of oxen were discovered to have the precedence and so i had to wait this under such a sun on a shadeless beach and with the prospect of having to stay there for two hours at least was by no means pleasant it took threequarters of an hour to put the oxen in the boat it took half an hour to get them on the other shore and another hour to have the ferry boat back the panorama from the beach was splendid the po appeared in all the mighty power of his waters and as you looked with the glass at oxen and trees on the other shore they appeared to be clothed in all the colours of the rainbow and as if belonging to another world several peasants were waiting for the boat near me talking about the war and the austrians and swearing they would if possible annihilate some of the latter i gave them the glass to look with and i imagined that they had never seen one before for they thought it highly wonderful to make out what the time was at the luzzara tower three miles in a straight line on the other side the revolver too was a subject of great admiration and they kept turning feeling and staring at it as if they could not make out which way the cartridges were put in one of these peasants however was doing the grand with the others and once on the subject of history related to all who would hear how he had been to st helena which was right in the middle of moscow where it was so very cold that his nose had got to be as large as his head the poor man was evidently mixing one nights tale with that of the next one a tale probably heard from the old sindaco who is at the same time the schoolmaster the notary and the highest municipal authority in the place i started in the ferry boat with them at last while crossing they got to speak of the priests and were all agreed to put it in the mildest way in thinking extremely little of them and only differed as to what punishment they should like them to suffer on the side where we landed lay heaps of ammunition casks for the corps besieging borgoforte others were conveyed upon cars by my friends the carrettieri of whom it was decreed i should not be quit for some time to come entering guastalla i found only a few artillery officers evidently in charge of what we had seen carried along the route guastalla is a neat little town very proud of its statue of duke ferrante gonzaga and the croce rossa is a neat little inn which may be proud of a smart young waiter who actually discovered that as i wanted to proceed to luzzara a few miles on i had better stop till next morning i did not take his advice and was soon under the gate of luzzara a very neat little place once one of the many possessions where the gonzagas had a court a palace and a castle the arms over the archway may still be seen and would not be worth any notice but for a remarkable work of terracotta representing a crown of pines and pine leaves in a wonderful state of preservation the whole is so artistically arranged and so natural that one might believe it to be one of luca della robbias works luzzara has also a great tower which i had seen in the distance from dosalo and the only albergo in the place gives you an excellent italian dinner the wine might please one of the greatest admirers of sherry and if you are not given feather beds the beds are at least clean like the rooms themselves here as it was getting too dark i decided upon stopping a decision which gave me occasion to see one of the finest sunsets i ever saw as i looked from the albergo i could see a gradation of colours from the purple red to the deepest of sea blue rising like an immense tent from the dark green of the trees and the fields here and there dotted with little white houses with their red roofs while in front the luzzara tower rose majestically in the twilight as the hour got later the colours deepened and the lower end of the immense curtain gradually disappeared while the stars and the planets began shining high above a peasant was singing in a field near by and the bells of a church were chiming in the distance both seemed to harmonise wonderfully it was a scene of great loveliness at four am i was up and soon after on the road to reggiolo and then to gonzaga here the vegetation gets to be more luxuriant and every inch of ground contributes to the immense vastness of the whole nature is here in full perfection and as even the telegraphic wire hangs leisurely down from tree to tree instead of being stuck upon poles you feel that the romantic aspect of the place is too beautiful to be encroached upon all is peace beauty and happiness all reveals to you that you are in italy in gonzaga which only a few days ago belonged to the austrians the italian tricolour is out of every window as the former masters retired the new advanced and when a detachment of monferrato lancers entered the old castle town the joy of the inhabitants seemed to be almost bordering on delirium the lancers soon left however the flag only remains july cialdini began passing the po on the th and crossed at three points ie carbonara carbonarola and follonica beginning at three oclock in the morning he had finished crossing upon the two first pontoon bridges towards midnight on the th the bridge thrown up at follonica was still intact up to seven in the morning on the th but the troops and the military and the civil train that remained followed the po without crossing to stellata in the supposed direction of ponte lagoscura yesterday guns were heard here at seven oclock in the morning and up to eleven oclock in the direction of legnano towards i think the adige the firing was lively and of such a nature as to make one surmise that battle had been given perhaps the austrians have awaited cialdini under legnano or they have disputed the crossing of the adige rovigo was abandoned by the austrians in the night of the th and th they have blown up the rovigo and boara fortresses have destroyed the tetedepont on the adige and burnt all bridges they may now seek to keep by the left side of this river up to legnano so as to get under the protection of the quadrilateral in which case if cialdini can cross the river in time the shock would be almost inevitable and would be a reason for yesterdays firing they may also go by rail to padua when they would have cialdini between them and the quadrilateral in any case if this general is quick or if they are not too quick for him according to possible instructions a collision is difficult to be avoided baron ricasoli has left florence for the camp and all sorts of rumours are afloat as to the present state of negotiations as they appear unmistakably to exist the opinions are i think divided in the high councils of the crown and the country is still anxious to know the result of this state of affairs a splendid victory by cialdini might at this moment solve many a difficulty as it is the war is prosecuted everywhere except by sea for garibaldis forces are slowly advancing in the italian tyrol while the austrians wait for them behind the walls of landaro and ampola the garibaldians advanced posts were by the latest news near darso the news from prussia is still contradictory while the italian press is unanimous in asking with the country that cialdini should advance meet the enemy fight him and rout him if possible italys wishes are entirely with him noale near treviso july from lusia i followed general medicis division to motta where i left it not without regret however as better companions could not easily be found so kind were the officers and jovial the men they are now encamped around padua and will tomorrow march on treviso where the italian light horse have already arrived if i judge so from their having left noale on the th from the right i hear that the advanced posts have proceeded as far as mira on the brenta twenty kilometres from venice itself and that the first army corps is to concentrate opposite chioggia this corps has marched from ferrara straight on to rovigo which the forward movement of the fourth or cialdinis corps darmee had left empty of soldiers general pianell has still charge of it and majorgeneral cadalini formerly at the head of the siena brigade replaces him in the command of his former division general pianell has under him the gallant prince amadeus who has entirely recovered from his chest wound and of whom the brigade of lombardian grenadiers is as proud as ever they could not wish for a more skilled commander a better superior officer and a more valiant soldier thus the troops who fought on the th june are kept in the second line while the still fresh divisions under cialdini march first as fast as they can this however is of no avail the italian outposts on the piave have not yet crossed it for the reason that they must keep distances with their regiments but will do so as soon as these get nearer to the river if it was not that this is always done in regular warfare they could beat the country beyond the piave for a good many miles without even seeing the shadow of an austrian to the simple private who does not know of diplomatic imbroglios and of political considerations this sudden retreat means an almost as sudden retracing of steps because he remembers that this manoeuvre preceded both the attacks on solferino and on custozza by the austrians to the officer however it means nothing else than a fixed desire not to face the italian army any more and so it is to him a source of disappointment and despondency he cannot bear to think that another battle is improbable and may be excused if he is not in the best of humour when on this subject this is the case not only with the officers but with the volunteers who have left their homes and the comfort of their domestic life not to be paraded at reviews but to be sent against the enemy there are hundreds of these in the regular armyin the cavalry especially and the aosta lancers and the regiment of guides are half composed of them if you listen to them there ought not to be the slightest doubt or hesitation as to crossing the isongo and marching upon vienna may heaven see their wishes accomplished for unless crushed by sheer force italy is quite decided to carry war into the enemys country the decisions of the french government are looked for here with great anxiety and not a few men are found who predict them to be unfavourable to italy still it is hard for every one to believe that the french emperor will carry things to extremities and increase the many difficulties europe has already to contend with today there was a rumour at the mess table that the austrians had abandoned legnano one of the four fortresses of the quadrilateral i do not put much faith in it at present but it is not improbable as we may expect many strange things from the vienna government it would have been much better for them since archduke albert spoke in eulogistic terms of the king of his sons and of his soldiers while relating the action of the th to have treated with italy direct thus securing peace and perhaps friendship from her but the men who have ruled so despotically for years over italian subjects cannot reconcile themselves to the idea that italy has at last risen to be a nation and they even take slyly an opportunity to throw new insult into her face you can easily see that the old spirit is still struggling for empire that the old contempt is still trying to make light of italians and that the old metternich ideas are still fondly clung to does not this deserve another lesson does not this need another sadowa to quiet down for ever yes and it devolves upon italy to do it if so let only cialdinis army alone and the day may be nigh at hand when the king may tell the country that the task has been accomplished a talk on the present state of political affairs and on the peculiar position of italy is the only subject worth notice in a letter from the camp everything else is at a standstill and the movements of the fine army cialdini now disposes of about men are no longer full of interest they may perhaps have some as regards an attack on venice because austrian soldiers are still garrisoning it and will be obliged to fight if they are assailed it is hoped if such is the case that the beautiful queen of the adriatic will be spared a scene of devastation and that no new haynau will be found to renew the deeds of brescia and vicenza the king has not yet arrived and it seems probable he will not come for some time until indeed the day comes for italian troops to make their triumphal entry into the city of the doges the heat continues intense and this explains the slowness in advancing as yet no sickness has appeared and it must be hoped that the troops will be healthy as sickness tries the morale much more than halfadozen custozzas psi had finished writing when an officer came rushing into the inn where i am staying and told me that he had just heard that an italian patrol had met an austrian one on the road out of the village and routed it this may or may not be true but it was must curious to see how delighted every one was at the idea that they had found them at last they did not care much about the result of the engagement which as i said was reported to have been favourable all that they cared about was that they were close to the enemy one cannot despair of an army which is animated with such spirits you would think from the joy which brightens the face of the soldiers you meet now about that a victory had been announced for the italian arms dolo near venice july i returned from noale to padua last evening and late in the night i received the intimation at my quarters that cannon was heard in the direction of venice it was then black as in dantes hell and raining and blowing with violenceone of those italian storms which seem to awake all the earthly and heavenly elements of creation there was no choice for it but to take to the saddle and try to make for the front no one who has not tried it can fancy what work it is to find ones way along a road on which a whole corps damee is marching with an enormous materiel of war in a pitch dark night this however is what your special correspondent was obliged to do fortunately enough i had scarcely proceeded as far as ponte di brenta when i fell in with an officer of cialdinis staff who was bound to the same destination namely dolo as we proceeded along the road under a continuous shower of rain our eyes now and then dazzled by the bright serpentlike flashes of the lightning we fell in with some battalion or squadron which advanced carefully as it was impossible for them as well as for us to discriminate between the road and the ditches which flank it for all the landmarks so familiar to our guides in the daytime were in one dead level of blackness so it was that my companion and myself after stumbling into ditches and out of them after knocking our horses heads against an ammunition car or a party of soldiers sheltered under some big tree found ourselves after three hours ride in this village of dolo by this time the storm had greatly abated in its violence and the thunder was but faintly heard now and then at such a distance as to enable us distinctly to hear the roar of the guns our horses could scarcely get through the sticky black mud into which the white suffocating dust of the previous days had been turned by one nights rain we however made our way to the parsonage of the village for we had already made up our minds to ascend the steeple of the church to get a view of the surrounding country and a better hearing of the guns if possible after a few words exchanged with the sextona staunch italian as he told us he waswe went up the ladder of the church spire once on the wooden platform we could hear more distinctly the boom of the guns which sounded like the broadsides of a big vessel were they the guns of persanos long inactive fleet attacking some of brondolos or chioggias advanced forts were the guns those of some austrian manofwar which had engaged an italian ironclad or were they the affondatore which left the thames only a month ago pitching into trieste to tell the truth although we patiently waited two long hours on dolo church spire when both i and my companion descended we were not in a position to solve either of these problems we however thought then and still think they were the guns of the italian fleet which had attacked an austrian fort civita vecchia july since the departure from this port of the old hospital ship gregeois about a year ago no french ship of war had been stationed at civita vecchia but on wednesday morning the steamsloop catinat men cast anchor in the harbour and the commandant immediately on disembarking took the train for rome and placed himself in communication with the french ambassador i am not aware whether the pontifical government had applied for this vessel or whether the sending it was a spontaneous attention on the part of the french emperor but at any rate its arrival has proved a source of pleasure to his holiness as there is no knowing what may happen in troublous times like the present and it is always good to have a retreat insured yesterday it was notified in this port as well as at naples that arrivals from marseilles would be until further notice subjected to a quarantine of fifteen days in consequence of cholera having made its appearance at the latter place a sailing vessel which arrived from marseilles in the course of the day had to disembark the merchandise it brought for civita vecchia into barges off the lazaretto where the yellow flag was hoisted over them this vessel left marseilles five days before the announcement of the quarantine while the prince napoleon of valerys company passenger and merchandise steamer which left marseilles only one day before its announcement was admitted this morning to free pratique few travellers will come here by sea now marseilles july accustomed as we have been of late in italy to almost hourly bulletins of the progress of hostilities it is a trying condition to be suddenly debarred of all intelligence by finding oneself on board a steamer for thirtysix hours without touching at any port as was my case in coming here from civita vecchia on board the prince napoleon but although telegrams were wanting discussions on the course of events were rife on board among the passengers who had embarked at naples and civita vecchia comprising a strong batch of french and belgian priests returning from a pilgrimage to rome well supplied with rosaries and chaplets blessed by the pope and facsimiles of the chains of st peter not much sympathy for the italian cause was shown by these gentlemen or the few french and german travellers who with three or four neapolitans formed the quarterdeck society and our corsican captain took no pains to hide his contempt at the dilatory proceedings of the italian fleet at ancona we know that the prussian minister m dusedom has been recently making strenuous remonstrances at ferrara against the slowness with which the italian naval and military forces were proceeding while their allies the prussians were already near the gates of vienna and the conversation of a prussian gentleman on board our steamer who was connected with that embassy plainly indicated the disappointment felt at berlin at the rather inefficacious nature of the diversion made in venetia and on the coast of istria by the army and navy of victor emmanuel he even attributed to his minister an expression not very flattering either to the future prospects of italy as resulting from her alliance with prussia or to the fidelity of the latter in carrying out the terms of it i do not know whether this gentleman intended his anecdote to be taken cum grano salis but i certainly understood him to say that he had deplored to the minister the want of vigour and the absence of success accompanying the operations of the italian allies of prussia when his excellency replied cest bien vrai ils nous ont tromps mais que voulezvous y faire maintenant nous aurons le temps de les faire egorger apres it is difficult to suppose that there should exist a preconceived intention on the part of prussia to repay the sacrifices hitherto made although without a very brilliant accompaniment of success by the italian government in support of the alliance by making her own separate terms with austria and leaving italy subsequently exposed to the vengeance of the latter but such would certainly be the inference to be drawn from the conversation just quoted it was only on arriving in the port of marseilles however that the full enmity of most of my travelling companions towards italy and the italians was manifested a sailor the first man who came on board before we disembarked was immediately pounced upon for news and he gave it as indeed nothing less than the destruction more or less complete of the italian fleet by that of the austrians at this astounding intelligence the prussian burst into a yell of indignation fools blockheads miserables beaten at sea by an inferior force is that the way they mean to reconquer venice by dint of arms if ever they do regain venetia it will be through the blood of our brandenburghers and pomeranians and not their own during this tirade a little old belgian in black with the chain of st peter at his buttonhole by way of watchguard capered off to communicate the grateful news to a group of his ecclesiastical fellowtravellers shrieking out in ecstasy rosses messieurs ces blagueurs ditaliens ont ete rosses par mer comme ils avaient ete rosses par terre whereupon the reverend gentlemen congratulated each other with nods and winks and smiles and sundry fervent squeezes of the hand the same demonstrations would doubtless have been made by the neapolitan passengers had they belonged to the bourbonic faction but they happened to be honest traders with cases of coral and lava for the paris market and therefore they merely stood silent and aghast at the fatal news with their eyes and mouths as wide open as possible i had no sooner got to my hotel than i inquired for the latest paris journal when the france was handed me and i obtained confirmation in a certain degree of the disaster to the italian fleet narrated by the sailor although not quite in the same formidable proportions before quitting the subject of my fellowpassengers on board the prince napoleon i must mention an anecdote related to me respecting the state of brigandage by a russian or german gentleman who told me he was established at naples he was complaining of the dangers he had occasionally encountered in crossing in a diligence from naples to foggia on business and then speaking of the audacity of brigands in general he told me that last year he saw with his own eyes in broad daylight two brigands walking about the streets of naples with messages from captured individuals to their relations mentioning the sums which had been demanded for their ransoms they were unarmed and in the common peasants dresses and whenever they arrived at one of the houses to which they were addressed for this purpose they stopped and opened a handkerchief which one of them carried in his hand and took out an ear examining whether the ticket on it corresponded with the address of the house or the name of the resident there were six ears all ticketed with the names of the original owners in the handkerchief which were gradually dispensed to their families in naples to stimulate prompt payment of the required ransoms on my inquiring how it was that the police took no notice of such barefaced operations my informant told me that previous to the arrival of these brigand emissaries in town the chief always wrote to the police authorities warning them against interfering with them as the messengers were always followed by spies in plain clothes belonging to the band who would immediately report any molestation they might encounter in the discharge of their delicate mission and the infallible result of such molestation would be first the putting to death of all the hostages held for ransom and next the summary execution of several members of gendarmery and police force captured in various skirmishes by the brigands and held as prisoners of war such audacity would seem incredible if we had not heard and read of so many similar instances of late etext editors bookmarks a very doubtful benefit americans forgivingly remember without mentioning as becomes them they do not look ahead charges of cynicism are common against all satirists fourth of the georges here and there a plain good soul to whom he was affectionate holy images and other miraculous objects are sold it is well to learn manners without having them imposed on us men overweeningly in love with their creations must be the moralist in the satirist if satire is to strike not a page of his books reveals malevolence or a sneer petty concessions are signs of weakness to the unsatisfied statesman who stooped to conquer fact through fiction the social world he looked at did not show him heroes the exhaustion ensuing we named tranquillity utterance of generous and patriotic cries is not sufficient we trust them or we crush them we grew accustomed to periods of irish fever on the idea of comedy and of the uses of the comic spirit this etext was prepared from the archibald constable and company edition by david price email ccxcoventryacuk good comedies are such rare productions that notwithstanding the wealth of our literature in the comic element it would not occupy us long to run over the english list if they are brought to the test i shall propose very reputable comedies will be found unworthy of their station like the ladies of arthurs court when they were reduced to the ordeal of the mantle there are plain reasons why the comic poet is not a frequent apparition and why the great comic poet remains without a fellow a society of cultivated men and women is required wherein ideas are current and the perceptions quick that he may be supplied with matter and an audience the semibarbarism of merely giddy communities and feverish emotional periods repel him and also a state of marked social inequality of the sexes nor can he whose business is to address the mind be understood where there is not a moderate degree of intellectual activity moreover to touch and kindle the mind through laughter demands more than sprightliness a most subtle delicacy that must be a natal gift in the comic poet the substance he deals with will show him a startling exhibition of the dyers hand if he is without it people are ready to surrender themselves to witty thumps on the back breast and sides all except the head and it is there that he aims he must be subtle to penetrate a corresponding acuteness must exist to welcome him the necessity for the two conditions will explain how it is that we count him during centuries in the singular number cest une etrange entreprise que celle de faire rire les honnetes gens moliere says and the difficulty of the undertaking cannot be overestimated then again he is beset with foes to right and left of a character unknown to the tragic and the lyric poet or even to philosophers we have in this world men whom rabelais would call agelasts that is to say nonlaughers men who are in that respect as dead bodies which if you prick them do not bleed the old grey boulderstone that has finished its peregrination from the rock to the valley is as easily to be set rolling up again as these men laughing no collision of circumstances in our mortal career strikes a light for them it is but one step from being agelastic to misogelastic and the greek text which cannot be reproduced the laughterhating soon learns to dignify his dislike as an objection in morality we have another class of men who are pleased to consider themselves antagonists of the foregoing and whom we may term hypergelasts the excessive laughers everlaughing who are as clappers of a bell that may be rung by a breeze a grimace who are so loosely put together that a wink will shake them cest nestimer rien questioner tout le monde and to laugh at everything is to have no appreciation of the comic of comedy neither of these distinct divisions of nonlaughers and overlaughers would be entertained by reading the rape of the lock or seeing a performance of le tartuffe in relation to the stage they have taken in our land the form and title of puritan and bacchanalian for though the stage is no longer a public offender and shakespeare has been revived on it to give it nobility we have not yet entirely raised it above the contention of these two parties our speaking on the theme of comedy will appear almost a libertine proceeding to one while the other will think that the speaking of it seriously brings us into violent contrast with the subject comedy we have to admit was never one of the most honoured of the muses she was in her origin short of slaughter the loudest expression of the little civilization of men the light of athene over the head of achilles illuminates the birth of greek tragedy but comedy rolled in shouting under the divine protection of the son of the winejar as dionysus is made to proclaim himself by aristophanes our second charles was the patron of like benignity of our comedy of manners which began similarly as a combative performance under a licence to deride and outrage the puritan and was here and there bacchanalian beyond the aristophanic example worse inasmuch as a cynical licentiousness is more abominable than frank filth an eminent frenchman judges from the quality of some of the stuff dredged up for the laughter of men and women who sat through an athenian comic play that they could have had small delicacy in other affairs when they had so little in their choice of entertainment perhaps he does not make sufficient allowance for the regulated licence of plain speaking proper to the festival of the god and claimed by the comic poet as his inalienable right or for the fact that it was a festival in a season of licence in a city accustomed to give ear to the boldest utterance of both sides of a case however that may be there can be no question that the men and women who sat through the acting of wycherleys country wife were past blushing our tenacity of national impressions has caused the word theatre since then to prod the puritan nervous system like a satanic instrument just as one has known antipapists for whom smithfield was redolent of a sinister smoke as though they had a later recollection of the place than the lowing herds hereditary puritanism regarding the stage is met to this day in many families quite undistinguished by arrogant piety it has subsided altogether as a power in the profession of morality but it is an error to suppose it extinct and unjust also to forget that it had once good reason to hate shun and rebuke our public shows we shall find ourselves about where the comic spirit would place us if we stand at middle distance between the inveterate opponents and the drumandfife supporters of comedy comme un point fixe fait remarquer lemportement des autres as pascal says and were there more in this position comic genius would flourish our english idea of a comedy of manners might be imaged in the person of a blowsy country girlsay hoyden the daughter of sir tunbelly clumsy who when at home never disobeyed her father except in the eating of green gooseberriestransforming to a varnished city madam with a loud laugh and a mincing step the crazy ancestress of an accountably fallen descendant she bustles prodigiously and is punctually smart in her speech always in a fluster to escape from dulness as they say the dogs on the nilebanks drink at the river running to avoid the crocodile if the monster catches her as at times he does she whips him to a froth so that those who know dulness only as a thing of ponderousness shall fail to recognise him in that light and airy shape when she has frolicked through her five acts to surprise you with the information that mr aimwell is converted by a sudden death in the world outside the scenes into lord aimwell and can marry the lady in the light of day it is to the credit of her vivacious nature that she does not anticipate your calling her farce five is dignity with a trailing robe whereas one two or three acts would be short skirts and degrading advice has been given to householders that they should follow up the shot at a burglar in the dark by hurling the pistol after it so that if the bullet misses the weapon may strike and assure the rascal he has it the point of her wit is in this fashion supplemented by the rattle of her tongue and effectively according to the testimony of her admirers her wit is at once like steam in an engine the motive force and the warning whistle of her headlong course and it vanishes like the track of steam when she has reached her terminus never troubling the brains afterwards a merit that it shares with good wine to the joy of the bacchanalians as to this wit it is warlike in the neatest hands it is like the sword of the cavalier in the mall quick to flash out upon slight provocation and for a similar officeto wound commonly its attitude is entirely pugilistic two blunt fists rallying and countering when harmless as when the word fool occurs or allusions to the state of husband it has the sound of the smack of harlequins wand upon clown and is to the same extent exhilarating believe that idle empty laughter is the most desirable of recreations and significant comedy will seem pale and shallow in comparison our popular idea would be hit by the sculptured group of laughter holding both his sides while comedy pummels by way of tickling him as to a meaning she holds that it does not conduce to making merry you might as well carry cannon on a racingyacht morality is a duenna to be circumvented this was the view of english comedy of a sagacious essayist who said that the end of a comedy would often be the commencement of a tragedy were the curtain to rise again on the performers in those old days female modesty was protected by a fan behind which and it was of a convenient semicircular breadth the ladies present in the theatre retired at a signal of decorum to peep covertly askant or with the option of so peeping through a prettily fringed eyelethole in the eclipsing arch ego limis specto sic per flabellum clanculumterence that fan is the flag and symbol of the society giving us our socalled comedy of manners or comedy of the manners of southsea islanders under city veneer and as to comic idea vacuous as the mask without the face behind it elia whose humour delighted in floating a galleon paradox and wafting it as far as it would go bewails the extinction of our artificial comedy like a poet sighing over the vanished splendour of cleopatras nilebarge and the sedateness of his plea for a cause condemned even in his time to the penitentiary is a novel effect of the ludicrous when the realism of those fictitious halfbelieved personages as he calls them had ceased to strike they were objectionable company uncaressable as puppets their artifices are staringly naked and have now the effect of a painted face viewed after warm hours of dancing in the morning light how could the lurewells and the plyants ever have been praised for ingenuity in wickedness critics apparently sober and of high reputation held up their shallow knaveries for the world to admire these lurewells plyants pinchwifes fondlewifes miss prue peggy hoyden all of them save charming milamant are dead as last years clothes in a fashionable fine ladys wardrobe and it must be an exceptionably abandoned abigail of our period that would look on them with the wish to appear in their likeness whether the puppet show of punch and judy inspires our streeturchins to have instant recourse to their fists in a dispute after the fashion of every one of the actors in that public entertainment who gets possession of the cudgel is open to question it has been hinted and angry moralists have traced the national taste for tales of crime to the smell of blood in our nurserysongs it will at any rate hardly be questioned that it is unwholesome for men and women to see themselves as they are if they are no better than they should be and they will not when they have improved in manners care much to see themselves as they once were that comes of realism in the comic art and it is not public caprice but the consequence of a bettering state the same of an immoral may be said of realistic exhibitions of a vulgar society the french make a critical distinction in ce qui remue from ce qui emeutthat which agitates from that which touches with emotion in the realistic comedy it is an incessant remuageno calm merely bustling figures and no thought excepting congreves way of the world which failed on the stage there was nothing to keep our comedy alive on its merits neither with all its realism true portraiture nor much quotable fun nor idea neither salt nor soul the french have a school of stately comedy to which they can fly for renovation whenever they have fallen away from it and their having such a school is mainly the reason why as john stuart mill pointed out they know men and women more accurately than we do moliere followed the horatian precept to observe the manners of his age and give his characters the colour befitting them at the time he did not paint in raw realism he seized his characters firmly for the central purpose of the play stamped them in the idea and by slightly raising and softening the object of study as in the case of the exhuguenot duke de montausier for the study of the misanthrope and according to st simon the abbe roquette for tartuffe generalized upon it so as to make it permanently human concede that it is natural for human creatures to live in society and alceste is an imperishable mark of one though he is drawn in light outline without any forcible human colouring our english school has not clearly imagined society and of the mind hovering above congregated men and women it has imagined nothing the critics who praise it for its downrightness and for bringing the situations home to us as they admiringly say cannot but disapprove of molieres comedy which appeals to the individual mind to perceive and participate in the social we have splendid tragedies we have the most beautiful of poetic plays and we have literary comedies passingly pleasant to read and occasionally to see acted by literary comedies i mean comedies of classic inspiration drawn chiefly from menander and the greek new comedy through terence or else comedies of the poets personal conception that have had no model in life and are humorous exaggerations happy or otherwise these are the comedies of ben jonson massinger and fletcher massingers justice greedy we can all of us refer to a type with fat capon lined that has been and will be and he would be comic as panurge is comic but only a rabelais could set him moving with real animation probably justice greedy would be comic to the audience of a country booth and to some of our friends if we have lost our youthful relish for the presentation of characters put together to fit a type we find it hard to put together the mechanism of a civil smile at his enumeration of his dishes something of the same is to be said of bobadil swearing by the foot of pharaoh with a reservation for he is made to move faster and to act the comic of jonson is a scholars excogitation of the comic that of massinger a moralists shakespeare is a wellspring of characters which are saturated with the comic spirit with more of what we will call bloodlife than is to be found anywhere out of shakespeare and they are of this world but they are of the world enlarged to our embrace by imagination and by great poetic imagination they are as it werei put it to suit my present comparisoncreatures of the woods and wilds not in walled towns not grouped and toned to pursue a comic exhibition of the narrower world of society jaques falstaff and his regiment the varied troop of clowns malvolio sir hugh evans and fluellenmarvellous welshmenbenedict and beatrice dogberry and the rest are subjects of a special study in the poetically comic his comedy of incredible imbroglio belongs to the literary section one may conceive that there was a natural resemblance between him and menander both in the scheme and style of his lighter plays had shakespeare lived in a later and less emotional less heroical period of our history he might have turned to the painting of manners as well as humanity euripides would probably in the time of menander when athens was enslaved but prosperous have lent his hand to the composition of romantic comedy he certainly inspired that fine genius politically it is accounted a misfortune for france that her nobles thronged to the court of louis quatorze it was a boon to the comic poet he had that lively quicksilver world of the animalcule passions the huge pretensions the placid absurdities under his eyes in full activity vociferous quacks and snapping dupes hypocrites posturers extravagants pedants rosepink ladies and mad grammarians sonneteering marquises highflying mistresses plainminded maids interthreading as in a loom noisy as at a fair a simply bourgeois circle will not furnish it for the middle class must have the brilliant flippant independent upper for a spur and a pattern otherwise it is likely to be inwardly dull as well as outwardly correct yet though the king was benevolent toward moliere it is not to the french court that we are indebted for his unrivalled studies of mankind in society for the amusement of the court the ballets and farces were written which are dearer to the rabble upper as to the rabble lower class than intellectual comedy the french bourgeoisie of paris were sufficiently quickwitted and enlightened by education to welcome great works like le tartuffe les femmes savantes and le misanthrope works that were perilous ventures on the popular intelligence big vessels to launch on streams running to shallows the tartuffe hove into view as an enemys vessel it offended not dieu mais les devots as the prince de conde explained the cabal raised against it to the king the femmes savantes is a capital instance of the uses of comedy in teaching the world to understand what ails it the farce of the precieuses ridiculed and put a stop to the monstrous romantic jargon made popular by certain famous novels the comedy of the femmes savantes exposed the later and less apparent but more finely comic absurdity of an excessive purism in grammar and diction and the tendency to be idiotic in precision the french had felt the burden of this new nonsense but they had to see the comedy several times before they were consoled in their suffering by seeing the cause of it exposed the misanthrope was yet more frigidly received moliere thought it dead i cannot improve on it and assuredly never shall he said it is one of the french titles to honour that this quintessential comedy of the opposition of alceste and celimene was ultimately understood and applauded in all countries the middle class presents the public which fighting the world and with a good footing in the fight knows the world best it may be the most selfish but that is a question leading us into sophistries cultivated men and women who do not skim the cream of life and are attached to the duties yet escape the harsher blows make acute and balanced observers moliere is their poet of this class in england a large body neither puritan nor bacchanalian have a sentimental objection to face the study of the actual world they take up disdain of it when its truths appear humiliating when the facts are not immediately forced on them they take up the pride of incredulity they live in a hazy atmosphere that they suppose an ideal one humorous writing they will endure perhaps approve if it mingles with pathos to shake and elevate the feelings they approve of satire because like the beak of the vulture it smells of carrion which they are not but of comedy they have a shivering dread for comedy enfolds them with the wretched host of the world huddles them with us all in an ignoble assimilation and cannot be used by any exalted variety as a scourge and a broom nay to be an exalted variety is to come under the calm curious eye of the comic spirit and be probed for what you are men are seen among them and very many cultivated women you may distinguish them by a favourite phrase surely we are not so bad and the remark if that is human nature save us from it as if it could be done but in the peculiar paradise of the wilful people who will not see the exclamation assumes the saving grace yet should you ask them whether they dislike sound sense they vow they do not and question cultivated women whether it pleases them to be shown moving on an intellectual level with men they will answer that it does numbers of them claim the situation now comedy is the fountain of sound sense not the less perfectly sound on account of the sparkle and comedy lifts women to a station offering them free play for their wit as they usually show it when they have it on the side of sound sense the higher the comedy the more prominent the part they enjoy in it dorine in the tartuffe is commonsense incarnate though palpably a waitingmaid celimene is undisputed mistress of the same attribute in the misanthrope wiser as a woman than alceste as man in congreves way of the world millamant overshadows mirabel the sprightliest male figure of english comedy but those two ravishing women so copious and so choice of speech who fence with men and pass their guard are heartless is it not preferable to be the pretty idiot the passive beauty the adorable bundle of caprices very feminine very sympathetic of romantic and sentimental fiction our women are taught to think so the agnes of the ecole des femmes should be a lesson for men the heroines of comedy are like women of the world not necessarily heartless from being clearsighted they seem so to the sentimentallyreared only for the reason that they use their wits and are not wandering vessels crying for a captain or a pilot comedy is an exhibition of their battle with men and that of men with them and as the two however divergent both look on one object namely life the gradual similarity of their impressions must bring them to some resemblance the comic poet dares to show us men and women coming to this mutual likeness he is for saying that when they draw together in social life their minds grow liker just as the philosopher discerns the similarity of boy and girl until the girl is marched away to the nursery philosopher and comic poet are of a cousinship in the eye they cast on life and they are equally unpopular with our wilful english of the hazy region and the ideal that is not to be disturbed thus for want of instruction in the comic idea we lose a large audience among our cultivated middle class that we should expect to support comedy the sentimentalist is as averse as the puritan and as the bacchanalian our traditions are unfortunate the public taste is with the idle laughers and still inclines to follow them it may be shown by an analysis of wycherleys plain dealer a coarse prose adaption of the misanthrope stuffed with lumps of realism in a vulgarized theme to hit the mark of english appetite that we have in it the keynote of the comedy of our stage it is moliere travestied with the hoof to his foot and hair on the pointed tip of his ear and how difficult it is for writers to disentangle themselves from bad traditions is noticeable when we find goldsmith who had grave command of the comic in narrative producing an elegant farce for a comedy and fielding who was a master of the comic both in narrative and in dialogue not even approaching to the presentable in farce these bad traditions of comedy affect us not only on the stage but in our literature and may be tracked into our social life they are the ground of the heavy moralizings by which we are outwearied about life as a comedy and comedy as a jade when popular writers conscious of fatigue in creativeness desire to be cogent in a modish cynicism perversions of the idea of life and of the proper esteem for the society we have wrested from brutishness and would carry higher stock images of this description are accepted by the timid and the sensitive as well as by the saturnine quite seriously for not many look abroad with their own eyes fewer still have the habit of thinking for themselves life we know too well is not a comedy but something strangely mixed nor is comedy a vile mask the corrupted importation from france was noxious a noble entertainment spoilt to suit the wretched taste of a villanous age and the later imitations of it partly drained of its poison and made decorous became tiresome notwithstanding their fun in the perpetual recurring of the same situations owing to the absence of original study and vigour of conception scene v act of the misanthrope owing no doubt to the fact of our not producing matter for original study is repeated in succession by wycherley congreve and sheridan and as it is at second hand we have it done cynicallyor such is the tone in the manner of below stairs comedy thus treated may be accepted as a version of the ordinary worldly understanding of our social life at least in accord with the current dicta concerning it the epigrams can be made but it is uninstructive rather tending to do disservice comedy justly treated as you find it in moliere whom we so clownishly mishandled the comedy of moliere throws no infamous reflection upon life it is deeply conceived in the first place and therefore it cannot be impure meditate on that statement never did man wield so shrieking a scourge upon vice but his consummate selfmastery is not shaken while administering it tartuffe and harpagon in fact are made each to whip himself and his class the false pietists and the insanely covetous moliere has only set them in motion he strips folly to the skin displays the imposture of the creature and is content to offer her better clothing with the lesson chrysale reads to philaminte and belise he conceives purely and he writes purely in the simplest language the simplest of french verse the source of his wit is clear reason it is a fountain of that soil and it springs to vindicate reason commonsense rightness and justice for no vain purpose ever the wit is of such pervading spirit that it inspires a pun with meaning and interest his moral does not hang like a tail or preach from one character incessantly cocking an eye at the audience as in recent realistic french plays but is in the heart of his work throbbing with every pulsation of an organic structure if life is likened to the comedy of moliere there is no scandal in the comparison congreves way of the world is an exception to our other comedies his own among them by virtue of the remarkable brilliancy of the writing and the figure of millamant the comedy has no idea in it beyond the stale one that so the world goes and it concludes with the jaded discovery of a document at a convenient season for the descent of the curtain a plot was an afterthought with congreve by the help of a wooden villain maskwell marked gallows to the flattest eye he gets a sort of plot in the double dealer his way of the world might be called the conquest of a town coquette and millamant is a perfect portrait of a coquette both in her resistance to mirabel and the manner of her surrender and also in her tongue the wit here is not so salient as in certain passages of love for love where valentine feigns madness or retorts on his father or mrs frail rejoices in the harmlessness of wounds to a womans virtue if she keeps them from air in the way of the world it appears less prepared in the smartness and is more diffused in the more characteristic style of the speakers here however as elsewhere his famous wit is like a bullyfencer not ashamed to lay traps for its exhibition transparently petulant for the train between certain ordinary words and the powdermagazine of the improprieties to be fired contrast the wit of congreve with molieres that of the first is a toledo blade sharp and wonderfully supple for steel cast for duelling restless in the scabbard being so pretty when out of it to shine it must have an adversary molieres wit is like a running brook with innumerable fresh lights on it at every turn of the wood through which its business is to find a way it does not run in search of obstructions to be noisy over them but when dead leaves and viler substances are heaped along the course its natural song is heightened without effort and with no dazzling flashes of achievement it is full of healing the wit of good breeding the wit of wisdom genuine humour and true wit says landor require a sound and capacious mind which is always a grave one rabelais and la fontaine are recorded by their countrymen to have been reveurs few men have been graver than pascal few men have been wittier to apply the citation of so great a brain as pascals to our countryman would be unfair congreve had a certain soundness of mind of capacity in the sense intended by landor he had little judging him by his wit he performed some happy thrusts and taking it for genuine it is a surface wit neither rising from a depth nor flowing from a spring on voit quil se travaille e dire de bons mots he drives the poor hack word fool as cruelly to the market for wit as any of his competitors here is an example that has been held up for eulogy witwoud he has brought me a letter from the fool my brother etc etc mirabel a fool and your brother witwoud witwoud ay ay my halfbrother my halfbrother he is no nearer upon my honour mirabel then tis possible he may be but half a fool by evident preparation this is a sort of wit one remembers to have heard at school of a brilliant outsider perhaps to have been guilty of oneself a trifle later it was no doubt a blaze of intellectual fireworks to the bumpkin squire who came to london to go to the theatre and learn manners where congreve excels all his english rivals is in his literary force and a succinctness of style peculiar to him he had correct judgement a correct ear readiness of illustration within a narrow range in snapshots of the obvious at the obvious and copious language he hits the mean of a fine style and a natural in dialogue he is at once precise and voluble if you have ever thought upon style you will acknowledge it to be a signal accomplishment in this he is a classic and is worthy of treading a measure with moliere the way of the world may be read out currently at a first glance so sure are the accents of the emphatic meaning to strike the eye perforce of the crispness and cunning polish of the sentences you have not to look over them before you confide yourself to him he will carry you safe sheridan imitated but was far from surpassing him the flow of boudoir billingsgate in lady wishfort is unmatched for the vigour and pointedness of the tongue it spins along with a final ring like the voice of nature in a fury and is indeed racy eloquence of the elevated fishwife millamant is an admirable almost a lovable heroine it is a piece of genius in a writer to make a womans manner of speech portray her you feel sensible of her presence in every line of her speaking the stipulations with her lover in view of marriage her fine ladys delicacy and fine ladys easy evasions of indelicacy coquettish airs and playing with irresolution which in a common maid would be bashfulness until she submits to dwindle into a wife as she says form a picture that lives in the frame and is in harmony with mirabels description of her here she comes i faith full sail with her fan spread and her streamers out and a shoal of fools for tenders and after an interview think of you to think of a whirlwind though twere in a whirlwind were a case of more steady contemplation a very tranquillity of mind and mansion there is a picturesqueness as of millamant and no other in her voice when she is encouraged to take mirabel by mrs fainall who is sure she has a mind to him millamant are you i think i haveand the horrid man looks as if he thought so too etc etc one hears the tones and sees the sketch and colour of the whole scene in reading it celimene is behind millamant in vividness an air of bewitching whimsicality hovers over the graces of this comic heroine like the lively conversational play of a beautiful mouth but in wit she is no rival of celimene what she utters adds to her personal witchery and is not further memorable she is a flashing portrait and a type of the superior ladies who do not think not of those who do in representing a class therefore it is a lower class in the proportion that one of gainsboroughs fulllength aristocratic women is below the permanent impressiveness of a fair venetian head millamant side by side with celimene is an example of how far the realistic painting of a character can be carried to win our favour and of where it falls short celimene is a womans mind in movement armed with an ungovernable wit with perspicacious clear eyes for the world and a very distinct knowledge that she belongs to the world and is most at home in it she is attracted to alceste by her esteem for his honesty she cannot avoid seeing where the good sense of the man is diseased rousseau in his letter to dalembert on the subject of the misanthrope discusses the character of alceste as though moliere had put him forth for an absolute example of misanthropy whereas alceste is only a misanthrope of the circle he finds himself placed in he has a touching faith in the virtue residing in the country and a critical love of sweet simpleness nor is he the principal person of the comedy to which he gives a name he is only passively comic celimene is the active spirit while he is denouncing and railing the trial is imposed upon her to make the best of him and control herself as much as a witty woman eagerly courted can do by appreciating him she practically confesses her faultiness and she is better disposed to meet him halfway than he is to bend an inch only she is une ame de vingt ans the world is pleasant and if the gilded flies of the court are silly uncompromising fanatics have their ridiculous features as well can she abandon the life they make agreeable to her for a man who will not be guided by the common sense of his class and who insists on plunging into one extremeequal to suicide in her eyesto avoid another that is the comic question of the misanthrope why will he not continue to mix with the world smoothly appeased by the flattery of her secret and really sincere preference of him and taking his revenge in satire of it as she does from her own not very lofty standard and will by and by do from his more exalted one celimene is worldliness alceste is unworldliness it does not quite imply unselfishness and that is perceived by her shrewd head still he is a very uncommon figure in her circle and she esteems him lhomme aux rubans verts who sometimes diverts but more often horribly vexes her as she can say of him when her satirical tongue is on the run unhappily the soul of truth in him which wins her esteem refuses to be tamed or silent or unsuspicious and is the perpetual obstacle to their good accord he is that melancholy person the critic of everybody save himself intensely sensitive to the faults of others wounded by them in love with his own indubitable honesty and with his ideal of the simpler form of life befitting it qualities which constitute the satirist he is a jean jacques of the court his proposal to celimene when he pardons her that she should follow him in flying humankind and his frenzy of detestation of her at her refusal are thoroughly in the mood of jean jacques he is an impracticable creature of a priceless virtue but celimene may feel that to fly with him to the desert that is from the court to the country ou detre homme dhonneur on ait la liberte she is likely to find herself the companion of a starving satirist like that poor princess who ran away with the waitingman and when both were hungry in the forest was ordered to give him flesh she is a fieffee coquette rejoicing in her wit and her attractions and distinguished by her inclination for alceste in the midst of her many other lovers only she finds it hard to cut them offwhat woman with a train does notand when the exposure of her naughty wit has laid her under their rebuke she will do the utmost she can she will give her hand to honesty but she cannot quite abandon worldliness she would be unwise if she did the fable is thin our pungent contrivers of plots would see no indication of life in the outlines the life of the comedy is in the idea as with the singing of the skylark out of sight you must love the bird to be attentive to the song so in this highest flight of the comic muse you must love pure comedy warmly to understand the misanthrope you must be receptive of the idea of comedy and to love comedy you must know the real world and know men and women well enough not to expect too much of them though you may still hope for good menander wrote a comedy called misogynes said to have been the most celebrated of his works this misogynist is a married man according to the fragment surviving and is a hater of women through hatred of his wife he generalizes upon them from the example of this lamentable adjunct of his fortunes and seems to have got the worst of it in the contest with her which is like the issue in reality in the polite world he seems also to have deserved it which may be as true to the copy but we are unable to say whether the wife was a good voice of her sex or how far menander in this instance raised the idea of woman from the mire it was plunged into by the comic poets or rather satiric dramatists of the middle period of greek comedy preceding him and the new comedy who devoted their wit chiefly to the abuse and for a diversity to the eulogy of extramural ladies of conspicuous fame menander idealized them without purposely elevating he satirized a certain thais and his thais of the eunuchus of terence is neither professionally attractive nor repulsive his picture of the two andrians chrysis and her sister is nowhere to be matched for tenderness but the condition of honest women in his day did not permit of the freedom of action and fencing dialectic of a celimene and consequently it is below our mark of pure comedy saintebeuve conjures up the ghost of menander saying for the love of me love terence it is through love of terence that moderns are able to love menander and what is preserved of terence has not apparently given us the best of the friend of epicurus greek text which cannot be reproduced the lover taken in horror and greek text the damsel shorn of her locks have a promising sound for scenes of jealousy and a too masterful display of lordly authority leading to regrets of the kind known to intemperate men who imagined they were fighting with the weaker as the fragments indicate of the six comedies of terence four are derived from menander two the hecyra and the phormio from apollodorus these two are inferior in comic action and the peculiar sweetness of menander to the andria the adelphi the heautontimorumenus and the eunuchus but phormio is a more dashing and amusing convivial parasite than the gnatho of the lastnamed comedy there were numerous rivals of whom we know next to nothingexcept by the quotations of athenaeus and plutarch and the greek grammarians who cited them to support a dictumin this as in the preceding periods of comedy in athens for menanders plays are counted by many scores and they were crowned by the prize only eight times the favourite poet with critics in greece as in rome was menander and if some of his rivals here and there surpassed him in comic force and outstripped him in competition by an appositeness to the occasion that had previously in the same way deprived the genius of aristophanes of its due reward in clouds and birds his position as chief of the comic poets of his age was unchallenged plutarch very unnecessarily drags aristophanes into a comparison with him to the confusion of the older poet their aims the matter they dealt in and the times were quite dissimilar but it is no wonder that plutarch writing when athenian beauty of style was the delight of his patrons should rank menander at the highest in what degree of faithfulness terence copied menander whether as he states of the passage in the adelphi taken from diphilus verbum de verbo in the lovelier scenesthe description of the last words of the dying andrian and of her funeral for instanceremains conjectural for us terence shares with his master the praise of an amenity that is like elysian speech equable and ever gracious like the face of the andrians young sister adeo modesto adeo venusto ut nihil supra the celebrated flens quam familiariter of which the closest rendering grounds hopelessly on harsh prose to express the sorrowful confidingness of a young girl who has lost her sister and dearest friend and has but her lover left to her she turned and flung herself on his bosom weeping as though at home there this our instinct tells us must be greek though hardly finer in greek certain lines of terence compared with the original fragments show that he embellished them but his taste was too exquisite for him to do other than devote his genius to the honest translation of such pieces as the above menander then with him through the affinity of sympathy terence and shakespeare and moliere have this beautiful translucency of language and the study of the comic poets might be recommended if for that only a singular ill fate befell the writings of menander what we have of him in terence was chosen probably to please the cultivated romans and is a romantic play with a comic intrigue obtained in two instances the andria and the eunuchus by rolling a couple of his originals into one the titles of certain of the lost plays indicate the comic illumining character a selfpitier a selfchastiser an illtempered man a superstitious an incredulous etc point to suggestive domestic themes terence forwarded manuscript translations from greece that suffered shipwreck he who could have restored the treasure died on the way home the zealots of byzantium completed the work of destruction so we have the four comedies of terence numbering six of menander with a few sketches of plotsone of them the thesaurus introduces a miser whom we should have liked to contrast with harpagonand a multitude of small fragments of a sententious cast fitted for quotation enough remains to make his greatness felt without undervaluing other writers of comedy i think it may be said that menander and moliere stand alone specially as comic poets of the feelings and the idea in each of them there is a conception of the comic that refines even to pain as in the menedemus of the heautontimorumenus and in the misanthrope menander and moliere have given the principal types to comedy hitherto the micio and demea of the adelphi with their opposing views of the proper management of youth are still alive the sganarelles and arnolphes of the ecole des maris and the ecole des femmes are not all buried tartuffe is the father of the hypocrites orgon of the dupes thraso of the braggadocios alceste of the manlys davus and syrus of the intriguing valets the scapins and figaros ladies that soar in the realms of rosepink whose language wears the nodding plumes of intellectual conceit are traceable to philaminte and belise of the femmes savantes and the mordant witty women have the tongue of celimene the reason is that these two poets idealized upon life the foundation of their types is real and in the quick but they painted with spiritual strength which is the solid in art the idealistic conceptions of comedy gives breadth and opportunities of daring to comic genius and helps to solve the difficulties it creates how for example shall an audience be assured that an evident and monstrous dupe is actually deceived without being an absolute fool in le tartuffe the note of high comedy strikes when orgon on his return home hears of his idols excellent appetite le pauvre homme he exclaims he is told that the wife of his bosom has been unwell et tartuffe he asks impatient to hear him spoken of his mind suffused with the thought of tartuffe crazy with tenderness and again he croons le pauvre homme it is the mothers cry of pitying delight at a nurses recital of the feats in young animal gluttony of her cherished infant after this masterstroke of the comic you not only put faith in orgons roseate prepossession you share it with him by comic sympathy and can listen with no more than a tremble of the laughing muscles to the instance he gives of the sublime humanity of tartuffe un rien presque suffit pour le scandaliser jusquele quil se vint lautre jour accuser davoir pris une puce en faisant sa priere et de lavoir tuee avec trop de colere and to have killed it too wrathfully translating moliere is like humming an air one has heard performed by an accomplished violinist of the pure tones without flourish orgon awakening to find another dupe in madame pernelle incredulous of the revelations which have at last opened his own besotted eyes is a scene of the double comic vivified by the spell previously cast on the mind there we feel the power of the poets creation and in the sharp light of that sudden turn the humanity is livelier than any realistic work can make it italian comedy gives many hints for a tartuffe but they may be found in boccaccio as well as in machiavellis mandragola the frate timoteo of this piece is only a very oily friar compliantly assisting an intrigue with ecclesiastical sophisms to use the mildest word for payment frate timoteo has a fine italian priestly pose donna credete voi chel turco passi questo anno in italia f tim se voi non fate orazione si priestly arrogance and unctuousness and trickeries and casuistries cannot be painted without our discovering a likeness in the long italian gallery goldoni sketched the venetian manners of the decadence of the republic with a french pencil and was an italian scribe in style the spanish stage is richer in such comedies as that which furnished the idea of the menteur to corneille but you must force yourself to believe that this liar is not forcing his vein when he piles lie upon lie there is no preceding touch to win the mind to credulity spanish comedy is generally in sharp outline as of skeletons in quick movement as of marionnettes the comedy might be performed by a troop of the corps de ballet and in the recollection of the reading it resolves to an animated shuffle of feet it is in fact something other than the true idea of comedy where the sexes are separated men and women grow as the portuguese call it affaimados of one another faminestricken and all the tragic elements are on the stage don juan is a comic character that sends souls flying nor does the humour of the breaking of a dozen womens hearts conciliate the comic muse with the drawing of blood german attempts at comedy remind one vividly of heines image of his country in the dancing of atta troll lessing tried his hand at it with a sobering effect upon readers the intention to produce the reverse effect is just visible and therein like the portly graces of the poor old pyrenean bear poising and twirling on his right hindleg and his left consists the fun jean paul richter gives the best edition of the german comic in the contrast of siebenkas with his lenette a light of the comic is in goethe enough to complete the splendid figure of the man but no more the german literary laugh like the timed awakenings of their barbarossa in the hollows of the untersberg is infrequent and rather monstrousnever a laugh of men and women in concert it comes of unrefined abstract fancy grotesque or grim or gross like the peculiar humours of their little earthmen spiritual laughter they have not yet attained to sentimentalism waylays them in the flight here and there a volkslied or marchen shows a national aptitude for stout animal laughter and we see that the literature is built on it which is hopeful so far but to enjoy it to enter into the philosophy of the broad grin that seems to hesitate between the skull and the embryo and reaches its perfection in breadth from the pulling of two square fingers at the corners of the mouth one must have aid of the good rhine wine and be of german blood unmixed besides this trebledutch lumbersomeness of the comic spirit is of itself exclusive of the idea of comedy and the poor voice allowed to women in german domestic life will account for the absence of comic dialogues reflecting upon life in that land i shall speak of it again in the second section of this lecture eastward you have total silence of comedy among a people intensely susceptible to laughter as the arabian nights will testify where the veil is over womensfaces you cannot have society without which the senses are barbarous and the comic spirit is driven to the gutters of grossness to slake its thirst arabs in this respect are worse than italiansmuch worse than germans just in the degree that their system of treating women is worse m saintmarc girardin the excellent french essayist and master of critical style tells of a conversation he had once with an arab gentleman on the topic of the different management of these difficult creatures in orient and in occident and the arab spoke in praise of many good results of the greater freedom enjoyed by western ladies and the charm of conversing with them he was questioned why his countrymen took no measures to grant them something of that kind of liberty he jumped out of his individuality in a twinkling and entered into the sentiments of his race replying from the pinnacle of a splendid conceit with affected humility of manner you can look on them without perturbationbut we and after this profoundly comic interjection he added in deep tones the very face of a woman our representative of temperate notions demurely consented that the arabs pride of inflammability should insist on the prudery of the veil as the civilizing medium of his race there has been fun in bagdad but there never will be civilization where comedy is not possible and that comes of some degree of social equality of the sexes i am not quoting the arab to exhort and disturb the somnolent east rather for cultivated women to recognize that the comic muse is one of their best friends they are blind to their interests in swelling the ranks of the sentimentalists let them look with their clearest vision abroad and at home they will see that where they have no social freedom comedy is absent where they are household drudges the form of comedy is primitive where they are tolerably independent but uncultivated exciting melodrama takes its place and a sentimental version of them yet the comic will out as they would know if they listened to some of the private conversations of men whose minds are undirected by the comic muse as the sentimental man to his astonishment would know likewise if he in similar fashion could receive a lesson but where women are on the road to an equal footing with men in attainments and in libertyin what they have won for themselves and what has been granted them by a fair civilizationthere and only waiting to be transplanted from life to the stage or the novel or the poem pure comedy flourishes and is as it would help them to be the sweetest of diversions the wisest of delightful companions now to look about us in the present time i think it will be acknowledged that in neglecting the cultivation of the comic idea we are losing the aid of a powerful auxiliar you see folly perpetually sliding into new shapes in a society possessed of wealth and leisure with many whims many strange ailments and strange doctors plenty of commonsense is in the world to thrust her back when she pretends to empire but the firstborn of commonsense the vigilant comic which is the genius of thoughtful laughter which would readily extinguish her at the outset is not serving as a public advocate you will have noticed the disposition of commonsense under pressure of some pertinacious piece of lightheadedness to grow impatient and angry that is a sign of the absence or at least of the dormancy of the comic idea for folly is the natural prey of the comic known to it in all her transformations in every disguise and it is with the springing delight of hawk over heron hound after fox that it gives her chase never fretting never tiring sure of having her allowing her no rest contempt is a sentiment that cannot be entertained by comic intelligence what is it but an excuse to be idly minded or personally lofty or comfortably narrow not perfectly humane if we do not feign when we say that we despise folly we shut the brain there is a disdainful attitude in the presence of folly partaking of the foolishness to comic perception and anger is not much less foolish than disdain the struggle we have to conduct is essence against essence let no one doubt of the sequel when this emanation of what is firmest in us is launched to strike down the daughter of unreason and sentimentalism such being follys parentage when it is respectable our modern system of combating her is too long defensive and carried on too ploddingly with concrete engines of war in the attack she has time to get behind entrenchments she is ready to stand a siege before the heavily armed man of science and the writer of the leading article or elaborate essay have primed their big guns it should be remembered that she has charms for the multitude and an english multitude seeing her make a gallant fight of it will be half in love with her certainly willing to lend her a cheer benevolent subscriptions assist her to hire her own man of science her own organ in the press if ultimately she is cast out and overthrown she can stretch a finger at gaps in our ranks she can say that she commanded an army and seduced men whom we thought sober men and safe to act as her lieutenants we learn rather gloomily after she has flashed her lantern that we have in our midst able men and men with minds for whom there is no polestar in intellectual navigation comedy or the comic element is the specific for the poison of delusion while folly is passing from the state of vapour to substantial form o for a breath of aristophanes rabelais voltaire cervantes fielding moliere these are spirits that if you know them well will come when you do call you will find the very invocation of them act on you like a renovating airthe southwest coming off the sea or a cry in the alps no one would presume to say that we are deficient in jokers they abound and the organisation directing their machinery to shoot them in the wake of the leading article and the popular sentiment is good but the comic differs from them in addressing the wits for laughter and the sluggish wits want some training to respond to it whether in public life or private and particularly when the feelings are excited the sense of the comic is much blunted by habits of punning and of using humouristic phrase the trick of employing johnsonian polysyllables to treat of the infinitely little and it really may be humorous of a kind yet it will miss the point by going too much round about it a certain french duke pasquier died some years back at a very advanced age he had been the venerable duke pasquier in his later years up to the period of his death there was a report of duke pasquier that he was a man of profound egoism hence an argument arose and was warmly sustained upon the excessive selfishness of those who in a world of troubles and calls to action and innumerable duties husband their strength for the sake of living on can it be possible the argument ran for a truly generous heart to continue beating up to the age of a hundred duke pasquier was not without his defenders who likened him to the oak of the foresta venerable comparison the argument was conducted on both sides with spirit and earnestness lightened here and there by frisky touches of the polysyllabic playful reminding one of the serious pursuit of their fun by truant boys that are assured they are out of the eye of their master and now and then indulge in an imitation of him and well might it be supposed that the comic idea was asleep not overlooking them it resolved at last to this that either duke pasquier was a scandal on our humanity in clinging to life so long or that he honoured it by so sturdy a resistance to the enemy as one who has entangled himself in a labyrinth is glad to get out again at the entrance the argument ran about to conclude with its commencement now imagine a master of the comic treating this theme and particularly the argument on it imagine an aristophanic comedy of the centenarian with choric praises of heroical early death and the same of a stubborn vitality and the poet laughing at the chorus and the grand question for contention in dialogue as to the exact age when a man should die to the identical minute that he may preserve the respect of his fellows followed by a systematic attempt to make an accurate measurement in parallel lines with a tough ropeyarn by one party and a string of yawns by the other of the veterans power of enduring life and our capacity for enduring him with tremendous pulling on both sides would not the comic view of the discussion illumine it and the disputants like very lightning there are questions as well as persons that only the comic can fitly touch aristophanes would probably have crowned the ancient tree with the consolatory observation to the haggard line of longexpectant heirs of the centenarian that they live to see the blessedness of coming of a strong stock the shafts of his ridicule would mainly have been aimed at the disputants for the sole ground of the argument was the old mans character and sophists are not needed to demonstrate that we can very soon have too much of a bad thing a centenarian does not necessarily provoke the comic idea nor does the corpse of a duke it is not provoked in the order of nature until we draw its penetrating attentiveness to some circumstance with which we have been mixing our private interests or our speculative obfuscation dulness insensible to the comic has the privilege of arousing it and the laying of a dull finger on matters of human life is the surest method of establishing electrical communications with a battery of laughterwhere the comic idea is prevalent but if the comic idea prevailed with us and we had an aristophanes to barb and wing it we should be breathing air of athens prosers now pouring forth on us like public fountains would be cut short in the street and left blinking dumb as pillarposts with letters thrust into their mouths we should throw off incubus our dreadful familiarby some called boredomwhom it is our present humiliation to be just alive enough to loathe never quick enough to foil there would be a bright and positive clear hellenic perception of facts the vapours of unreason and sentimentalism would be blown away before they were productive where would pessimist and optimist be they would in any case have a diminished audience yet possibly the change of despots from goodnatured old obtuseness to keenedged intelligence which is by nature merciless would be more than we could bear the rupture of the link between dull people consisting in the fraternal agreement that something is too clever for them and a shot beyond them is not to be thought of lightly for slender though the link may seem it is equivalent to a cement forming a concrete of dense cohesion very desirable in the estimation of the statesman a political aristophanes taking advantage of his lyrical bacchic licence was found too much for political athens i would not ask to have him revived but that the sharp light of such a spirit as his might be with us to strike now and then on public affairs public themes to make them spin along more briskly he hated with the politicians fervour the sophist who corrupted simplicity of thought the poet who destroyed purity of style the demagogue the sawtoothed monster who as he conceived chicaned the mob and he held his own against them by strength of laughter until fines the curtailing of his comic licence in the chorus and ultimately the ruin of athens which could no longer support the expense of the chorus threw him altogether on dialogue and brought him under the law after the catastrophe the poet who had ever been gazing back at the men of marathon and salamis must have felt that he had foreseen it and that he was wise when he pleaded for peace and derided military coxcombry and the captious old creature demus we can admit he had the comic poets gift of commonsensewhich does not always include political intelligence yet his political tendency raised him above the old comedy turn for uproarious farce he abused socrates but xenophon the disciple of socrates by his trained rhetoric saved the ten thousand aristophanes might say that if his warnings had been followed there would have been no such thing as a mercenary greek expedition under cyrus athens however was on a landslip falling none could arrest it to gaze back to uphold the old times was a most natural conservatism and fruitless the aloe had bloomed whether right or wrong in his politics and his criticisms and bearing in mind the instruments he played on and the audience he had to win there is an idea in his comedies it is the idea of good citizenship he is not likely to be revived he stands like shakespeare an unapproachable swift says of him with a loving chuckle but as for comic aristophanes the dog too witty and too profane is aristophanes was profane under satiric direction unlike his rivals cratinus phrynichus ameipsias eupolis and others if we are to believe him who in their extraordinary donnybrook fair of the day of comedy thumped one another and everybody else with absolute heartiness as he did but aimed at small game and dragged forth particular women which he did not he is an aggregate of many men all of a certain greatness we may build up a conception of his powers if we mount rabelais upon hudibras lift him with the songfulness of shelley give him a vein of heinrich heine and cover him with the mantle of the antijacobin adding that there may be some irish in him a dash of grattan before he is in motion but such efforts at conceiving one great one by incorporation of minors are vain and cry for excuse supposing wilkes for leading man in a country constantly plunging into war under some plumed lamachus with enemies periodically firing the land up to the gates of london and a samuel foote of prodigious genius attacking him with ridicule i think it gives a notion of the conflict engaged in by aristophanes this laughing baldpate as he calls himself was a titanic pamphleteer using laughter for his political weapon a laughter without scruple the laughter of hercules he was primed with wit as with the garlic he speaks of giving to the gamecocks to make them fight the better and he was a lyric poet of aerial delicacy with the homely song of a jolly national poet and a poet of such feeling that the comic mask is at times no broader than a cloth on a face to show the serious features of our common likeness he is not to be revived but if his method were studied some of the fire in him would come to us and we might be revived taking them generally the english public are most in sympathy with this primitive aristophanic comedy wherein the comic is capped by the grotesque irony tips the wit and satire is a naked sword they have the basis of the comic in them an esteem for commonsense they cordially dislike the reverse of it they have a rich laugh though it is not the gros rire of the gaul tossing gros sel nor the polished frenchmans mentally digestive laugh and if they have now like a monarch with a troop of dwarfs too many jesters kicking the dictionary about to let them reflect that they are dull occasionally like the pensive monarch surprising himself with an idea of an idea of his own they look so and they are given to looking in the glass they must see that something ails them how much even the better order of them will endure without a thought of the defensive when the person afflicting them is protected from satire we read in memoirs of a preceding age where the vulgarly tyrannous hostess of a great house of reception shuffled the guests and played them like a pack of cards with her exact estimate of the strength of each one printed on them and still this house continued to be the most popular in england nor did the lady ever appear in print or on the boards as the comic type that she was it has been suggested that they have not yet spiritually comprehended the signification of living in society for who are cheerfuller brisker of wit in the fields and as explorers colonisers backwoodsmen they are happy in rough exercise and also in complete repose the intermediate condition when they are called upon to talk to one another upon other than affairs of business or their hobbies reveals them wearing a curious look of vacancy as it were the socket of an eye wanting the comic is perpetually springing up in social life and it oppresses them from not being perceived thus at a dinnerparty one of the guests who happens to have enrolled himself in a burial company politely entreats the others to inscribe their names as shareholders expatiating on the advantages accruing to them in the event of their very possible speedy death the salubrity of the site the aptitude of the soil for a quick consumption of their remains etc and they drink sadness from the incongruous man and conceive indigestion not seeing him in a sharply defined light that would bid them taste the comic of him or it is mentioned that a newly elected member of our parliament celebrates his arrival at eminence by the publication of a book on cabfares dedicated to a beloved female relative deceased and the comment on it is the word indeed but merely for a contrast turn to a not uncommon scene of yesterday in the huntingfield where a brilliant young rider having broken his collarbone trots away very soon after against medical interdict half put together in splinters to the most distant meet of his neighbourhood sure of escaping his doctor who is the first person he encounters i came here purposely to avoid you says the patient i came here purposely to take care of you says the doctor off they go and come to a swollen brook the patient clears it handsomely the doctor tumbles in all the field are alive with the heartiest relish of every incident and every crosslight on it and dull would the man have been thought who had not his word to say about it when riding home in our prose literature we have had delightful comic writers besides fielding and goldsmith there is miss austen whose emma and mr elton might walk straight into a comedy were the plot arranged for them galts neglected novels have some characters and strokes of shrewd comedy in our poetic literature the comic is delicate and graceful above the touch of italian and french generally however the english elect excel in satire and they are noble humourists the national disposition is for hardhitting with a moral purpose to sanction it or for a rosy sometimes a larmoyant geniality not unmanly in its verging upon tenderness and with a singular attraction for thickheadedness to decorate it with asses ears and the most beautiful sylvan haloes but the comic is a different spirit you may estimate your capacity for comic perception by being able to detect the ridicule of them you love without loving them less and more by being able to see yourself somewhat ridiculous in dear eyes and accepting the correction their image of you proposes each one of an affectionate couple may be willing as we say to die for the other yet unwilling to utter the agreeable word at the right moment but if the wits were sufficiently quick for them to perceive that they are in a comic situation as affectionate couples must be when they quarrel they would not wait for the moon or the almanac or a dorine to bring back the floodtide of tender feelings that they should join hands and lips if you detect the ridicule and your kindliness is chilled by it you are slipping into the grasp of satire if instead of falling foul of the ridiculous person with a satiric rod to make him writhe and shriek aloud you prefer to sting him under a semicaress by which he shall in his anguish be rendered dubious whether indeed anything has hurt him you are an engine of irony if you laugh all round him tumble him roll him about deal him a smack and drop a tear on him own his likeness to you and yours to your neighbour spare him as little as you shun pity him as much as you expose it is a spirit of humour that is moving you the comic which is the perceptive is the governing spirit awakening and giving aim to these powers of laughter but it is not to be confounded with them it enfolds a thinner form of them differing from satire in not sharply driving into the quivering sensibilities and from humour in not comforting them and tucking them up or indicating a broader than the range of this bustling world to them fieldings jonathan wild presents a case of this peculiar distinction when that man of eminent greatness remarks upon the unfairness of a trial in which the condemnation has been brought about by twelve men of the opposite party for it is not satiric it is not humorous yet it is immensely comic to hear a guilty villain protesting that his own party should have a voice in the law it opens an avenue into villains ratiocination and the comic is not cancelled though we should suppose jonathan to be giving play to his humour i may have dreamed this or had it suggested to me for on referring to jonathan wild i do not find it apply the case to the man of deep wit who is ever certain of his condemnation by the opposite party and then it ceases to be comic and will be satiric the look of fielding upon richardson is essentially comic his method of correcting the sentimental writer is a mixture of the comic and the humorous parson adams is a creation of humour but both the conception and the presentation of alceste and of tartuffe of celimene and philaminte are purely comic addressed to the intellect there is no humour in them and they refresh the intellect they quicken to detect their comedy by force of the contrast they offer between themselves and the wiser world about them that is to say society or that assemblage of minds whereof the comic spirit has its origin byron had splendid powers of humour and the most poetic satire that we have example of fusing at times to hard irony he had no strong comic sense or he would not have taken an antisocial position which is directly opposed to the comic and in his philosophy judged by philosophers he is a comic figure by reason of this deficiency so bald er philosophirt ist er ein kind goethe says of him carlyle sees him in this comic light treats him in the humorous manner the satirist is a moral agent often a social scavenger working on a storage of bile the ironeist is one thing or another according to his caprice irony is the humour of satire it may be savage as in swift with a moral object or sedate as in gibbon with a malicious the foppish irony fretting to be seen and the irony which leers that you shall not mistake its intention are failures in satiric effort pretending to the treasures of ambiguity the humourist of mean order is a refreshing laugher giving tone to the feelings and sometimes allowing the feelings to be too much for him but the humourist of high has an embrace of contrasts beyond the scope of the comic poet heart and mind laugh out at don quixote and still you brood on him the juxtaposition of the knight and squire is a comic conception the opposition of their natures most humorous they are as different as the two hemispheres in the time of columbus yet they touch and are bound in one by laughter the knights great aims and constant mishaps his chivalrous valiancy exercised on absurd objects his good sense along the highroad of the craziest of expeditions the compassion he plucks out of derision and the admirable figure he preserves while stalking through the frantically grotesque and burlesque assailing him are in the loftiest moods of humour fusing the tragic sentiment with the comic narrative the stroke of the great humourist is worldwide with lights of tragedy in his laughter taking a living great though not creative humourist to guide our description the skull of yorick is in his hands in our seasons of festival he sees visions of primitive man capering preposterously under the gorgeous robes of ceremonial our souls must be on fire when we wear solemnity if we would not press upon his shrewdest nerve finite and infinite flash from one to the other with him lending him a twoedged thought that peeps out of his peacefullest lines by fits like the lantern of the firewatcher at windows going the rounds at night the comportment and performances of men in society are to him by the vivid comparison with their mortality more grotesque than respectable but ask yourself is he always to be relied on for justness he will fly straight as the emissary eagle back to jove at the true hero he will also make as determined a swift descent upon the man of his wilful choice whom we cannot distinguish as a true one this vast power of his built up of the feelings and the intellect in union is often wanting in proportion and in discretion humourists touching upon history or society are given to be capricious they are as in the case of sterne given to be sentimental for with them the feelings are primary as with singers comedy on the other hand is an interpretation of the general mind and is for that reason of necessity kept in restraint the french lay marked stress on mesure et gout and they own how much they owe to moliere for leading them in simple justness and taste we can teach them many things they can teach us in this the comic poet is in the narrow field or enclosed square of the society he depicts and he addresses the still narrower enclosure of mens intellects with reference to the operation of the social world upon their characters he is not concerned with beginnings or endings or surroundings but with what you are now weaving to understand his work and value it you must have a sober liking of your kind and a sober estimate of our civilized qualities the aim and business of the comic poet are misunderstood his meaning is not seized nor his point of view taken when he is accused of dishonouring our nature and being hostile to sentiment tending to spitefulness and making an unfair use of laughter those who detect irony in comedy do so because they choose to see it in life poverty says the satirist has nothing harder in itself than that it makes men ridiculous but poverty is never ridiculous to comic perception until it attempts to make its rags conceal its bareness in a forlorn attempt at decency or foolishly to rival ostentation caleb balderstone in his endeavour to keep up the honour of a noble household in a state of beggary is an exquisitely comic character in the case of poor relatives on the other hand it is the rich whom they perplex that are really comic and to laugh at the former not seeing the comedy of the latter is to betray dulness of vision humourist and satirist frequently hunt together as ironeists in pursuit of the grotesque to the exclusion of the comic that was an affecting moment in the history of the prince regent when the first gentleman of europe burst into tears at a sarcastic remark of beau brummells on the cut of his coat humour satire irony pounce on it altogether as their common prey the comic spirit eyes but does not touch it put into action it would be farcical it is too gross for comedy incidents of a kind casting ridicule on our unfortunate nature instead of our conventional life provoke derisive laughter which thwarts the comic idea but derision is foiled by the play of the intellect most of doubtful causes in contest are open to comic interpretation and any intellectual pleading of a doubtful cause contains germs of an idea of comedy the laughter of satire is a blow in the back or the face the laughter of comedy is impersonal and of unrivalled politeness nearer a smile often no more than a smile it laughs through the mind for the mind directs it and it might be called the humour of the mind one excellent test of the civilization of a country as i have said i take to be the flourishing of the comic idea and comedy and the test of true comedy is that it shall awaken thoughtful laughter if you believe that our civilization is founded in commonsense and it is the first condition of sanity to believe it you will when contemplating men discern a spirit overhead not more heavenly than the light flashed upward from glassy surfaces but luminous and watchful never shooting beyond them nor lagging in the rear so closely attached to them that it may be taken for a slavish reflex until its features are studied it has the sages brows and the sunny malice of a faun lurks at the corners of the halfclosed lips drawn in an idle wariness of half tension that slim feasting smile shaped like the longbow was once a big round satyrs laugh that flung up the brows like a fortress lifted by gunpowder the laugh will come again but it will be of the order of the smile finely tempered showing sunlight of the mind mental richness rather than noisy enormity its common aspect is one of unsolicitous observation as if surveying a full field and having leisure to dart on its chosen morsels without any fluttering eagerness mens future upon earth does not attract it their honesty and shapeliness in the present does and whenever they wax out of proportion overblown affected pretentious bombastical hypocritical pedantic fantastically delicate whenever it sees them selfdeceived or hoodwinked given to run riot in idolatries drifting into vanities congregating in absurdities planning shortsightedly plotting dementedly whenever they are at variance with their professions and violate the unwritten but perceptible laws binding them in consideration one to another whenever they offend sound reason fair justice are false in humility or mined with conceit individually or in the bulkthe spirit overhead will look humanely malign and cast an oblique light on them followed by volleys of silvery laughter that is the comic spirit not to distinguish it is to be bullblind to the spiritual and to deny the existence of a mind of man where minds of men are in working conjunction you must as i have said believe that our state of society is founded in commonsense otherwise you will not be struck by the contrasts the comic spirit perceives or have it to look to for your consolation you will in fact be standing in that peculiar oblique beam of light yourself illuminated to the general eye as the very object of chase and doomed quarry of the thing obscure to you but to feel its presence and to see it is your assurance that many sane and solid minds are with you in what you are experiencing and this of itself spares you the pain of satirical heat and the bitter craving to strike heavy blows you share the sublime of wrath that would not have hurt the foolish but merely demonstrate their foolishness moliere was contented to revenge himself on the critics of the ecole des femmes by writing the critique de lecole des femmes one of the wisest as well as the playfullest of studies in criticism a perception of the comic spirit gives high fellowship you become a citizen of the selecter world the highest we know of in connection with our old world which is not supermundane look there for your unchallengeable upper class you feel that you are one of this our civilized community that you cannot escape from it and would not if you could good hope sustains you weariness does not overwhelm you in isolation you see no charms for vanity personal pride is greatly moderated nor shall your title of citizenship exclude you from worlds of imagination or of devotion the comic spirit is not hostile to the sweetest songfully poetic chaucer bubbles with it shakespeare overflows there is a mild moons ray of it pale with superrefinement through distance from our flesh and blood planet in comus pope has it and it is the daylight side of the night half obscuring cowper it is only hostile to the priestly element when that by baleful swelling transcends and overlaps the bounds of its office and then in extreme cases it is too true to itself to speak and veils the lamp as for example the spectacle of bossuet over the dead body of moliere at which the dark angels may but men do not laugh we have had comic pulpits for a sign that the laughtermoving and the worshipful may be in alliance i know not how far comic or how much assisted in seeming so by the unexpectedness and the relief of its appearance at least they are popular they are said to win the ear laughter is open to perversion like other good things the scornful and the brutal sorts are not unknown to us but the laughter directed by the comic spirit is a harmless wine conducing to sobriety in the degree that it enlivens it enters you like fresh air into a study as when one of the sudden contrasts of the comic idea floods the brain like reassuring daylight you are cognizant of the true kind by feeling that you take it in savour it and have what flowers live on natural air for food that which you give outthe joyful roaris not the better part let that go to good fellowship and the benefit of the lungs aristophanes promises his auditors that if they will retain the ideas of the comic poet carefully as they keep dried fruits in boxes their garments shall smell odoriferous of wisdom throughout the year the boast will not be thought an empty one by those who have choice friends that have stocked themselves according to his directions such treasuries of sparkling laughter are wells in our desert sensitiveness to the comic laugh is a step in civilization to shrink from being an object of it is a step in cultivation we know the degree of refinement in men by the matter they will laugh at and the ring of the laugh but we know likewise that the larger natures are distinguished by the great breadth of their power of laughter and no one really loving moliere is refined by that love to despise or be dense to aristophanes though it may be that the lover of aristophanes will not have risen to the height of moliere embrace them both and you have the whole scale of laughter in your breast nothing in the world surpasses in stormy fun the scene in the frogs when bacchus and xanthias receive their thrashings from the hands of businesslike oeacus to discover which is the divinity of the two by his imperviousness to the mortal condition of pain and each under the obligation of not crying out makes believe that his horrible bellowthe gods iouiou being the lustiermeans only the stopping of a sneeze or horseman sighted or the prelude to an invocation to some deity and the slave contrives that the god shall get the bigger lot of blows passages of rabelais one or two in don quixote and the supper in the manner of the ancients in peregrine pickle are of a similar cataract of laughter but it is not illuminating it is not the laughter of the mind molieres laughter in his purest comedies is ethereal as light to our nature as colour to our thoughts the misanthrope and the tartuffe have no audible laughter but the characters are steeped in the comic spirit they quicken the mind through laughter from coming out of the mind and the mind accepts them because they are clear interpretations of certain chapters of the book lying open before us all between these two stand shakespeare and cervantes with the richer laugh of heart and mind in one with much of the aristophanic robustness something of molieres delicacy the laughter heard in circles not pervaded by the comic idea will sound harsh and soulless like versified prose if you step into them with a sense of the distinction you will fancy you have changed your habitation to a planet remoter from the sun you may be among powerful brains too you will not find poetsor but a stray one overworshipped you will find learned men undoubtedly professors reputed philosophers and illustrious dilettanti they have in them perhaps every element composing light except the comic they read verse they discourse of art but their eminent faculties are not under that vigilant sense of a collective supervision spiritual and present which we have taken note of they build a temple of arrogance they speak much in the voice of oracles their hilarity if it does not dip in grossness is usually a form of pugnacity insufficiency of sight in the eye looking outward has deprived them of the eye that should look inward they have never weighed themselves in the delicate balance of the comic idea so as to obtain a suspicion of the rights and dues of the world and they have in consequence an irritable personality a very learned english professor crushed an argument in a political discussion by asking his adversary angrily are you aware sir that i am a philologer the practice of polite society will help in training them and the professor on a sofa with beautiful ladies on each side of him may become their pupil and a scholar in manners without knowing it he is at least a fair and pleasing spectacle to the comic muse but the society named polite is volatile in its adorations and tomorrow will be petting a bronzed soldier or a black african or a prince or a spiritualist ideas cannot take root in its evershifting soil it is besides addicted in selfdefence to gabble exclusively of the affairs of its rapidly revolving world as children on a whirligoround bestow their attention on the wooden horse or cradle ahead of them to escape from giddiness and preserve a notion of identity the professor is better out of a circle that often confounds by lionizing sometimes annoys by abandoning and always confuses the school that teaches gently what peril there is lest a cultivated head should still be coxcombs and the collisions which may befall highsoaring minds empty or full is more to be recommended than the sphere of incessant motion supplying it with material lands where the comic spirit is obscure overhead are rank with raw crops of matter the traveller accustomed to smooth highways and people not covered with burrs and prickles is amazed amid so much that is fair and cherishable to come upon such curious barbarism an englishman paid a visit of admiration to a professor in the land of culture and was introduced by him to another distinguished professor to whom he took so cordially as to walk out with him alone one afternoon the first professor an erudite entirely worthy of the sentiment of scholarly esteem prompting the visit behaved if we exclude the dagger with the vindictive jealousy of an injured spanish beauty after a short prelude of gloom and obscure explosions he discharged upon his faithless admirer the bolts of passionate logic familiar to the ears of flighty caballeroseither i am a fit object of your admiration or i am not of these things oneeither you are competent to judge in which case i stand condemned by you or you are incompetent and therefore impertinent and you may betake yourself to your country again hypocrite the admirer was for persuading the wounded scholar that it is given to us to be able to admire two professors at a time he was driven forth perhaps this might have occurred in any country and a comedy of the pedant discovering the greedy humanity within the dusty scholar would not bring it home to one in particular i am mindful that it was in germany when i observe that the germans have gone through no comic training to warn them of the sly wise emanation eyeing them from aloft nor much of satirical heinrich heine has not been enough to cause them to smart and meditate nationally as well as individually when they are excited they are in danger of the grotesque as when for instance they decline to listen to evidence and raise a national outcry because one of german blood has been convicted of crime in a foreign country they are acute critics yet they still wield clubs in controversy compare them in this respect with the people schooled in la bruyere la fontaine moliere with the people who have the figures of a trissotin and a vadius before them for a comic warning of the personal vanities of the caressed professor it is more than difference of race it is the difference of traditions temper and style which comes of schooling the french controversialist is a polished swordsman to be dreaded in his graces and courtesies the german is orson or the mob or a marching army in defence of a good case or a bada big or a little his irony is a missile of terrific tonnage sarcasm he emits like a blast from a dragons mouth he must and will be titan he stamps his foe underfoot and is astonished that the creature is not dead but stinging for in truth the titan is contending by comparison with a god when the germans lie on their arms looking across the alsatian frontier at the crowds of frenchmen rushing to applaud lami fritz at the theatre francais looking and considering the meaning of that applause which is grimly comic in its political response to the domestic moral of the playwhen the germans watch and are silent their force of character tells they are kings in music we may say princes in poetry good speculators in philosophy and our leaders in scholarship that so gifted a race possessed moreover of the stern good sense which collects the waters of laughter to make the wells should show at a disadvantage i hold for a proof instructive to us that the discipline of the comic spirit is needful to their growth we see what they can reach to in that great figure of modern manhood goethe they are a growing people they are conversable as well and when their men as in france and at intervals at berlin teatables consent to talk on equal terms with their women and to listen to them their growth will be accelerated and be shapelier comedy or in any form the comic spirit will then come to them to cut some figures out of the block show them the mirror enliven and irradiate the social intelligence modern french comedy is commendable for the directness of the study of actual life as far as that which is but the early step in such a scholarship can be of service in composing and colouring the picture a consequence of this crude though wellmeant realism is the collision of the writers in their scenes and incidents and in their characters the muse of most of them is an aventuriere she is clever and a certain diversion exists in the united scheme for confounding her the object of this person is to reinstate herself in the decorous world and either having accomplished this purpose through deceit she has a nostalgie de la boue that eventually casts her back into it or she is exposed in her course of deception when she is about to gain her end a very good innocent young man is her victim or a very astute goodish young man obstructs her path this latter is enabled to be the champion of the decorous world by knowing the indecorous well he has assisted in the progress of aventurieres downward he will not help them to ascend the world is with him and certainly it is not much of an ascension they aspire to but what sort of a figure is he the triumph of a candid realism is to show him no hero you are to admire him for it must be supposed that realism pretends to waken some admiration as a credibly living young man no better only a little firmer and shrewder than the rest if however you think at all after the curtain has fallen you are likely to think that the aventurieres have a case to plead against him true and the author has not said anything to the contrary he has but painted from the life he leaves his audience to the reflections of unphilosophic minds upon life from the specimen he has presented in the bright and narrow circle of a spyglass i do not know that the fly in amber is of any particular use but the comic idea enclosed in a comedy makes it more generally perceptible and portable and that is an advantage there is a benefit to men in taking the lessons of comedy in congregations for it enlivens the wits and to writers it is beneficial for they must have a clear scheme and even if they have no idea to present they must prove that they have made the public sit to them before the sitting to see the picture and writing for the stage would be a corrective of a tooincrusted scholarly style into which some great ones fall at times it keeps minor writers to a definite plan and to english many of them now swelling a plethoric market in the composition of novels in punmanufactories and in journalism attached to the machinery forcing perishable matter on a public that swallows voraciously and groans might with encouragement be attending to the study of art in literature our critics appear to be fascinated by the quaintness of our public as the world is when our beastgarden has a new importation of magnitude and the creatures appetite is reverently consulted they stipulate for a writers popularity before they will do much more than take the position of umpires to record his failure or success now the pig supplies the most popular of dishes but it is not accounted the most honoured of animals unless it be by the cottager our public might surely be led to try other perhaps finer meat it has good taste in song it might be taught as justly on the whole and the sooner when the cottagers view of the feast shall cease to be the humble one of our
