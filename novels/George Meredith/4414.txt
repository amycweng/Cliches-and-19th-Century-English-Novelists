and david widger widgercecometnet sandra belloni by george meredith book xi in which we see the magnanimity that is in beer xii showing how sentiment and passion take the disease of love xiii contains a short discourse on puppets xiv the besworth question xv wilfrid's exhibition of treachery xvi how the ladies of brookfield came to their resolve xvii in the woods chapter xi at half past nine of the clock on the evening of this memorable day a body of five and twenty stout young fellows prize winners wrestlers boxers and topers of the hillford club set forth on a march to ipley common now a foreigner hearing of their destination and the provocation they had endured would have supposed that they were bent upon deeds of vengeance and it requires knowledge of our countrymen to take it as a fact that the idea and aim of the expedition were simply to furnish the offending ipley boys a little music such were the idea and the aim hillford had nothing to do with consequences no more than our england is responsible when she sails out among the empires and hemispheres saying 'buy' and 'sell' and they clamour to be eaten up entire foreigners pertinaciously misunderstand us they have the barbarous habit of judging by results let us know ourselves better it is melancholy to contemplate the intrigues and vile designs and vengeances of other nations and still more so after we have written so many pages of intelligible history to see them attributed to us will it never be perceived that we do not sow the thing that happens the source of the flooding stream which drinks up those rich acres of low flat land is not more innocent than we if as does seem possible we are in a sort of alliance with destiny we have signed no compact and accomplish our work as solidly and merrily as a wood hatchet in the hands of the woodman this arrangement to give ipley a little music was projected as a return for the favours of the morning nor have i in my time heard anything comparable to it in charity of sentiment when i consider the detestable outrage hillford suffered under the parading of the drum the trombone a horn two whistles and a fife in front of hillford booth caught the fancy of the clubmen who roared out parting adjurations that the music was not to be spared and that tom breeks was a musical fellow with a fine empty pate if any one of the instruments should fail perchance they were to give ipley plenty of music for ipley wanted to be taught harmony harmony was ipley's weak point gie 'em said one jolly ruddy hillford man gie 'em whack fol lol and he smacked himself and set toward an invisible partner nor as recent renowned historians have proved are observations of this nature beneath the dignity of chronicle they vindicate as they localize the sincerity of hillford really to be an islander full of ale is to be the kindest creature on or off two legs for that very reason it may be his wrath at bad blood is so easily aroused in our hot moods we would desire things like unto ourselves and object violently to whatsoever is unlike and also we desire that the benefits we shed be appreciated if ipley understands neither our music nor our intent haply we must hold a performance on the impenetrable sconce of ipley at the hour named the expedition with many a promise that the music should be sweet departed hilariously will burdock the left handed cricketer and hard hitter being leader with peter bartholomew potboy john girling miller's man and ned thewk gardener's assistant for lieutenants on the march silence was proclaimed and partially enforced after two fights against authority near the sign of king william's head general burdock called a halt and betrayed irresolution with reference to the route to be adopted but as none of his troop could at all share such a condition of mind in the neighbourhood of an inn he was permitted to debate peacefully with his lieutenants while the rest burst through the doors and hailed the landlord a proceeding he was quickly induced to imitate thus when the tail shows strongest decision of purpose the head must follow an accurate oinometer or method of determining what shall be the condition of the spirit of man according to the degrees of wine or beer in him were surely of priceless service to us for now must we to be certain of our sanity and dignity abstain which is to clip impoverish imprison the soul or else taking wings of wine we go aloft over capes and islands and seas but are even as balloons that cannot make for any line and are at the mercy of the winds without a choice save to come down by virtue of a collapse could we say to ourselves in the great style this is the point where desire to embrace humanity is merged in vindictiveness toward individuals where radiant sweet temper culminates in tremendous wrath where the treasures of anticipation waxing riotous arouse the memory of wrongs in plain words could we know positively and from the hand of science when we have had enough we should stop there is not a doubt that we should stop it is so true we should stop that i am ready to say ladies have no right to call us horrid names and complain of us till they have helped us to some such trustworthy scientific instrument as this which i have called for in its absence i am persuaded that the true natural oinometer is the hat were the hat always worn during potation were ladies when they retire to place it on our heads or better still chaplets of flowers then like the wise ancients we should be able to tell to a nicety how far we had advanced in our dithyramb to the theme of fuddle and muddle unhappily the hat does not forewarn it is simply indicative i believe nevertheless that science might set to work upon it forthwith and found a system when you mark men drinking who wear their hats and those hats are seen gradually beginning to hang on the backs of their heads as from pegs in the fashion of a fez the bald projection of forehead looks jolly and frank distrust that sign the may fly of the soul is then about to be gobbled up by the chub of the passions a hat worn fez fashion is a dangerous hat a hat on the brows shows a man who can take more but thinks he will go home instead and does so peaceably that is his determination he may look like macduff but he is a lamb the vinous reverses the non vinous passionate expression of the hat if i am discredited i appeal to history which tells us that the hats of the hillford five and twenty were all exceedingly hind ward set when the march was resumed it followed that peter bartholomew potboy made irritable objections to that old joke which finished his name as though it were a cat calling and the offence being repeated he dealt an impartial swing of his stick at divers heads and told them to take that which they assured him they had done by sending him flying into a hedge peter being reprimanded by his commanding officer acknowledged a hot desire to try his mettle and the latter responsible person had to be restrained from granting the wish he cherished by john girling whom he threw for his trouble and as burdock was the soundest hitter numbers cried out against girling revolting him with a sense of overwhelming injustice that could be appeased only by his prostrating two stout lads and squaring against a third who came up from a cross road this one knocked him down with the gentleness of a fist that knows how beer should be treated and then sang out in the voice of wilfrid pole which is the nearest way to ipley you fellows come along with us sir and we'll show you said burdock are you going there well that's pretty clear hillford men are you we've left the women behind i'm in a hurry so good night and so are we in a hurry sir but you're a gentleman and we want to give them chaps at ipley a little surprise d'ye see in the way of a dollop o' music and if you won't go givin' 'em warning you may trot and that road'll take you all right said wilfrid now fairly divided between his jealousy of gambier and anxiety for emilia could her artist nature of which he had heard perplexing talk excuse her and make her heart absolutely guiltless what he called 'innocent' in trusting herself to any man's honour i regret to say that the dainty adorers of the sex are even thus grossly suspicious of all women when their sentiment is ever so triflingly offended lights on ipley common were seen from a rise of the hilly road the moon was climbing through drifts of torn black cloud hastening his pace for a double reason now wilfrid had the booth within hearing listened a moment and then stood fast his unconscious gasp of the words thank god there she is might have betrayed him to another she was sitting near one end of the booth singing as wilfrid had never yet heard her sing her dark eyes flashing behind her stood captain gambier keeping guard with all the composure of a gentleman usher at a royal presentation along the tables men and women were ranged facing her open mouthed some of them but for the most part wearing a predetermined expression of applausive judgement as who should say queer but good they gave emilia their faces which was all she wanted and silence save for an intermingling soft snore here and there the elfin trumpet of silence to tell truth certain heads had bowed low to the majesty of beer and were down on the table between sprawling doubled arms no essay on the power of beer could exhibit it more convincingly than the happy indifference with which they received admonishing blows from quart pots salutes from hot pipe bowls pricks from pipe ends on nose and cheek and pate as if to vindicate for their beloved beverage a right to rank with that old classic drink wherewith the fairest of women vanquished human ills the majority however had been snatched out of this bliss by the intrusion of their wives who sat beside them like consciences in petticoats and it must be said that emilia was in favour with the married men for one reason because she gave these broad ribboned ladies a good excuse for allowing their lords to stop where they were so comfortable a continually extending five minutes longer yet though the words were foreign and the style of the song and the singer were strange many of the older fellows' eyes twinkled and their mouths pursed with a kind of half protesting pleasure all were reverent to the compliment paid them by emilia's presence the general expression was much like that seen when the popular ear is given to the national anthem wilfrid hung at the opening of the booth a cynical spectator for what on earth made her throw such energy and glory of music into a song before fellows like these he laughed dolorously she hasn't a particle of any sense of ridicule he said to himself forthwith her voice took hold of him and led him as heroes of old were led unwillingly into enchanted woods if she had been singing things holy a hymn a hallelujah in this company it struck him that somehow it would have seemed appropriate not objectionable at any rate not ridiculous dr watts would have put a girdle about her but a song of romance sung in this atmosphere of pipes and beer and boozy heads chagrined wilfrid in proportion as the softer half of him began to succumb to the deliciousness of her voice emilia may have had some warning sense that admiration is only one ingredient of homage that to make it fast and true affection must be won now poor people yokels clods cannot love what is incomprehensible to them an idol must have their attributes a king must show his face now and then a song must appeal to their intelligence to subdue them quite this as we know is not the case in the higher circles emilia may have divined it possibly from the very great respect with which her finale was greeted vigorous as the brayvos were they sounded abashed they lacked abandonment in fact it was gratitude that applauded and not enthusiasm hillford don't hear stuff like that do 'em which was the main verbal encomium passed may be taken testificatorily as to this point dame dame cried emilia finding her way quickly to one of the more decently bonneted women am i not glad to see you here did i please you and you dear farmer wilson i caught sight of you just as i was finishing i remember the song you like and i want to sing it i know the tune but the words the words what are the words humming won't do ah now quoth farmer wilson pointing out the end of his pipe that's what they'll swallow down that's the song to make 'em kick sing that miss furrin songs 's all right enough but 'ale it is my tipple and england is my nation' let's have something plain and flat on the surface miss dame wilson jogged her husband's arm to make him remember that talking was his dangerous pastime and sent abroad a petition for a song book and after a space a very doggy eared book resembling a poodle of that genus was handed to her then uprose a shout for this song and that but emilia fixed upon the one she had in view and walked back to her harp with her head bent perusing it attentively all the way there she gave the book to captain gambier and begged him to hold it open before her with a passing light of eyes likely to be rather disturbing to a jealous spectator the captain seized the book without wincing and displayed a remarkable equanimity of countenance as he held it out according to direction no sooner had emilia struck a prelude of the well known air than the interior of the booth was transfigured legs began to move elbows jerked upward fingers fillipped the whole body of them were ready to duck and bow dance and do her bidding she had fairly caught their hearts for besides the pleasure they had in their own familiar tune it was wonderful to them that emilia should know what they knew this was the marvel this the inspiration she smiled to see how true she had struck and seemed to swim on the pleasure she excited once as her voice dropped she looked up at captain gambier so very archly with the curving line of her bare throat that wilfrid was dragged down from his cynical observatory and made to feel as a common man among them all at the thrum thrum on the harp strings which wound up the song frenzied shouts were raised for a repetition emilia was perfectly willing to gratify them captain gambier appeared to be remonstrating with her but she put up her joined hands mock petitioningly and he with great affability held out the book anew wilfrid was thinking of moving to her to take her forcibly away when she recommenced at the same instant but who knowing that a house of glass is about to be shattered can refrain from admiring its glitter in the beams ipley crooned a ready accompaniment the sleepers had been awakened the women and the men were alive half dancing half chorusing here a baby was tossed and there an old fellow's elbow worked mutely expressive of the rollicking gaiety within him the whole length of the booth was in a pleasing simmer ready to overboil with shouts humane and cheerful while emilia pitched her note and led archly and quite one with them all and yet in a way that critical wilfrid could not object to so plainly did she sing to give happiness i cannot delay but i request you that are here privileged to soar aloft with the muse to fix your minds upon one point in this flight let not the heat and dust of the ensuing fray divert your attention from the magnanimity of beer it will be vindicated in the end but be worthy of your seat beside the muse who alone of us all can take one view of the inevitable two that perplex mortal judgements for if ipley had jumped jovially up and met the hillford alarum with laughter how then why then i maintain that the magnanimity of beer would have blazed effulgent on the spot there would have been louder laughter and fraternal greetings as it was the fire on the altar of wisdom was again kindled by folly and the steps to the altar were broken heads after the antique fashion in dismay ipley started the members of the club stared emilia faltered in horror a moment her voice swam stemming the execrable concert but it was overwhelmed wilfrid pressed forward to her they could hear nothing but the din the booth raged like an insurgent menagerie outside it sounded of brazen beasts and beasts that whistled beasts that boomed a whirlwind huddled them and at last a cry we've got a visit from hillford told a tale at once the stoutest hearts pressed to the opening my harp emilia made her voice reach wilfrid's ear unprovided with weapons ipley parleyed hillford howled in reply the trombone brayed an interminable note that would have driven to madness quiescent cats by steaming kettles and quick like the springing pulse of battle the drum thumped and thumped blood could not hear it and keep from boiling the booth shook violently wilfrid and gambier threw over half a dozen chairs forms and tables to make a barrier for the protection of the women come wilfrid said to emilia leave the harp i will get you another come no no she cried in her nervous fright for god's sake come he reiterated she stamping her foot as to emphasize no no no but i will buy you another harp he made audible to her through the hubbub this one she gasped with her hand on it what will he think if he finds that i forsook it wilfrid knew her to allude to the unknown person who had given it to her there there said he i sent it and i can get you another so come be good and come it was you emilia looked at him she seemed to have no senses for the uproar about her but now the outer barricade was broken through and the rout pressed on the second line tom breeks the orator and jim transformed from a lurching yokel to a lithe dog of battle kept the retreat of ipley challenging any two of hillford to settle the dispute captain gambier attempted an authoritative parley in the midst of which a hillford man made a long arm and struck emilia's harp till the strings jarred loose and horrid the noise would have been enough to irritate wilfrid beyond endurance when he saw the fellow continuing to strike the harp frame while emilia clutched it in a feeble defence against her bosom he caught a thick stick from a neighbouring hand and knocked that hillford man so clean to earth that hillford murmured at the blow wilfrid then joined the front array half a dozen hits like that a piece sir nodded tom breeks there goes another jim shouted not quite my lad interposed ned thewk though peter bartholomew was reeling in confirmation his blow at jim missed but came sharply in the swing on wilfrid's cheek bone maddened at the immediate vision of that feature swollen purple even as a plum with an assiduous fly on it certifying to ripeness says the philosopher we are never up to the mark of any position if we are in a position beneath our own mark and it is true that no hero in conflict should think of his face but wilfrid was all the while protesting wrathfully against the folly of his having set foot in such a place maddened i say wilfrid a keen swordman cleared a space john girling fell to him ned thewk fell to him and the sconce of will burdock rang a rascally absurd business said gambier letting his stick do the part of a damnatory verb on one of the enemy while he added the drunken vagabonds all the hillford party were now in the booth ipley meantime was not sleeping farmer wilson and a set of the ipley men whom age had sagaciously instructed to prefer stratagem to force had slipped outside and were labouring as busily as their comrades within stooping to the tent pegs sending emissaries to the tent poles drunk roared will burdock did you happen to say 'drunk' and looking all the while at gambier he with infernal cunning swung at wilfrid's fated cheekbone the latter rushed furiously into the press of them and there was a charge from ipley and a lock from which wilfrid extricated himself to hurry off emilia he perceived that bad blood was boiling up forward cried will burdock and hillford in turn made a tide as they came on in numbers too great for ipley to stand against an obscuration fell over all the fight paused then a sensation as of some fellows smoothing their polls and their cheeks and leaning on their shoulders with obtrusive affection inspirited them to lash about indiscriminately whoops and yells arose then peals of laughter homage to the cleverness of ipley was paid in hurrahs the moment hillford understood the stratagem by which its men of valour were lamed and imprisoned the truth was that the booth was down on them and they were struggling entangled in an enormous bag of canvas wilfrid drew emilia from under the drooping folds of the tent he was allowed on inspection of features to pass the men of hillford were captured one by one like wild geese as with difficulty they emerged roaring rolling with laughter all yea to such an extent did they laugh that they can scarce be said to have done less than make the joke of the foe their own and this proves the great and amazing magnanimity of beer chapter xii a pillar of dim silver rain fronted the moon on the hills emilia walked hurriedly with her head bent like a penitent now and then peeping up and breathing to the keen scent of the tender ferns wilfrid still grasped her hand and led her across the common away from the rout when the uproar behind them had sunk he said you'll get your feet wet i'm sorry you should have to walk how did you come here she answered i forget you must have come here in some conveyance did you walk again she answered i forget a little querulously perhaps wilfully well he persisted you must have got your harp to this place by some means or other yes my harp a sob checked her voice wilfrid tried to soothe her never mind the harp it's easily replaced not that one she moaned we will get you another i shall never love any but that perhaps we may hear good news of it to morrow no for i felt it die in my hands the third blow was the one that killed it it's broken wilfrid could not reproach her and he had not any desire to preach so as no idea of having done amiss in coming to the booth to sing illumined her and she yet knew that she was in some way guilty she accused herself of disregard for that dear harp while it was brilliant and serviceable now i remember what poor music i made of it i touched it with cold fingers the sound was thin as if it had no heart tick tick i fancy i touched it with a dead man's finger nails she crossed her wrists tight at the clasp of her waist and letting her chin fall on her throat shook her body fretfully much as a pettish little girl might do wilfrid grimaced tick tick was not a pathetic elegy in his ears the only thing is not to think about it said he it's only an instrument after all it's the second one i've seen killed like a living creature replied emilia they walked on silently till wilfrid remarked that he wondered where gambier was she gave no heed to the name the little quiet footing and the bowed head by his side moved him to entreat her not to be unhappy her voice had another tone when she answered that she was not unhappy no tears at all wilfrid stooped to get a close view of her face i thought i saw one if it's about the harp look you shall go into that cottage where the light is sit there and wait for me and i will bring you what remains of it i dare say we can have it mended emilia lifted her eyes i am not crying for the harp if you go back i must go with you that's out of the question you must never be found in that sort of place again let us leave the harp she murmured you cannot go without me let me sit here for a minute sit with me she pointed to a place beside herself on the fork of a dry log under flowering hawthorn a pale shadowy blue centre of light among the clouds told where the moon was rain had ceased and the refreshed earth smelt all of flowers as if each breeze going by held a nosegay to their nostrils wilfrid was sensible of a sudden marked change in her his blood was quicker than his brain in feeling it her voice now even in common speaking had that vibrating richness which in her singing swept his nerves if you cry there must be a cause you know he said for the sake of keeping the conversation in a safe channel how brave you are was emilia's sedate exclamation in reply her cheeks glowed as if she had just uttered a great confession but while the colour mounted to her eyes they kept their affectionate intentness upon him without a quiver of the lids do you think me a coward she relieved him by asking sharply like one whom the thought had turned into a darker path i am not i hung my head while you were fighting because what could i do i would not have left you girls can only say i will perish with him but wilfrid tried to laugh there was no necessity for that sort of devotion what are you thinking of it was half in good humour all through part of their fun clearly emilia's conception of the recent fray was unchangeable and the place for girls is at home that's certain he added i should always like to be where her voice flowed on with singular gravity to that stop wilfrid's hand travelled mechanically to his pricking cheek bone was it possible that a love scene was coming on as a pendant to that monstrously ridiculous affair of half an hour back to know that she had sufficient sensibility was gratifying and flattering that it aimed at him she was really a darling little woman only too absurd had she been on the point of saying that she would always like to be where he wilfrid was an odd touch of curiosity peculiar to the languid emotions made him ask her this and to her soft yes he continued briskly and in the style of condescending fellowship of course we're not going to part i wonder said emilia there she sat evidently sounding right through the future with her young brain to hear what destiny might have to say the 'i wonder' rang sweetly in his head it was as delicate a way of confessing i love you with all my soul as could be imagined extremely refined young ladies could hardly have improved upon it saving with the angelic shades of sentiment familiar to them convinced that he had now heard enough for his vanity wilfrid returned emphatically to the tone of the world's highroad by the way he said you mustn't have any exaggerated idea of this night's work remember also i have to share the honours with captain gambier i did not see him said emilia are you not cold he asked for a diversion though he had one of her hands she gave him the other he could not quit them abruptly nor could he hold both without being drawn to her what is it you say wilfrid whispered men kiss us when we are happy is that right and are you happy she lifted a clear full face to which he bent his mouth over the flowering hawthorn the moon stood like a windblown white rose of the heavens the kiss was given and taken strange to tell it was he who drew away from it almost bashfully and with new feelings quite unaware that he played the feminine part wilfrid alluded to her flight from richford with the instinct to sting his heart by a revival of his jealous sensations previously experienced and so taste the luxury of present satisfaction why did you run away from me he said semi reproachfully i promised would you not break a promise to stay with me now i would you promised captain gambier no those poor people you are sorry that you went no she was happy you have lost your harp by it said wilfrid what do you think of me for not guessing not knowing who sent it she returned i feel guilty of something all those days that i touched it not thinking of you wicked filthy little creature that i was i despise ungrateful girls i detest anything that has to do with gratitude wilfrid appended pray give me none why did you go away with captain gambier i was very fond of him she replied unhesitatingly but speaking as it were with numbed lips i wanted to tell him to thank him and hold his hand i told him of my promise he spoke to me a moment in the garden you know he said he was leaving to go to london early and would wait for me in the carriage then we might talk he did not wish to talk to me in the garden and you went with him in the carriage and told him you were so grateful yes but men do not like us to be grateful so he said he would do all sorts of things on condition that you were not grateful he said yes i forget i do forget how can i tell what he said emilia added piteously i feel as if i had been emptied out of a sack wilfrid was pierced with laughter and then the plainspoken simile gave him a chilling sensation while he was rising to the jealous pitch did he talk about taking you to italy put your head into the sack and think yes she answered blandly an affirmative that caused him some astonishment for he had struck at once to the farthest end of his suspicions he feels as i do about the italian schools said emilia he wishes me to owe my learning to him he says it will make him happy and i thought so too she threw in a then wilfrid looked moodily into the opposite hedge did he name the day for your going he asked presently little anticipating another yes but it came and her rather faltering manner showed her to be conscious too that the word was getting to be a black one to him did you say you would go i did question and answer crossed like two rapiers wilfrid jumped up the smell of this tree's detestable he said glancing at the shadowing hawthorn emilia rose quietly plucked a flower off the tree and put it in her bosom their way was down a green lane and across long meadow paths dim in the moonlight a nightingale was heard on this side and on that overhead they had a great space of sky with broken cloud full of the glory of the moon the meadows dipped to a brook slenderly spanned by a plank then there was an ascent through a cornfield to a copse rounding this they had sight of brookfield but while they were yet at the brook wilfrid said when is it you're going to italy in return he had an eager look so that he was half ashamed to add with captain gambier i mean he was suffering and by being brutal he expected to draw balm on himself nor was he deceived emilia just then gave him her hand to be led over and answered as she neared him i am never to leave you you never shall wilfrid caught her in his arms quite conquered by her proud of her he reflected with a loving rapture that her manner at that moment was equal to any lady's and the phantom of her with her hand out and her frank look and trustful footing while she spoke those words kept on advancing to him all the way to brookfield at the same time that the sober reality murmured at his elbow love with his accustomed cunning managed thus to lift her out of the mire and array her in his golden dress to idealize her as we say reconciled for the hour were the contesting instincts in the nature of this youth the adoration of feminine refinement and the susceptibility to sensuous impressions but emilia walked with a hero the dream of all her days one generous and gentle as well as brave who had fought for her had thought of her tenderly was with her now having raised her to his level with a touch how much might they not accomplish together he with sword she with harp through shadowy alleys in the clouds emilia saw the bright italian plains opening out to her the cities of marble such as her imagination had fashioned them porticos of stately palaces and towers and statues white among cypresses and farther minutely radiant in the vista as a shining star venice of the sea fancy made the flying minutes hours now they marched with the regiments of italy under the folds of her free banner now she sang to the victorious army waving the banner over them and now she floated in a gondola and turning to him the dear home of her heart yet pale with the bleeding of his wound for italy said softly in the tone that had power with him only let me please you when where what with came the blunt response from england with electric speed and emilia fell from the clouds i meant my singing i thought of how i sang to you oh happy time she exclaimed to cut through the mist of vision in her mind to me down at the booth muttered wilfrid perplexed oh no i mean just now and languid with the burden of so full a heart she did not attempt to explain herself further though he said invitingly i thought i heard you humming then he was seized with a desire to have the force of her spirit upon him for brookfield was in view and with the sight of brookfield the natural fascination waxed a shade fainter and he feared it might be going this he was happily as ignorant as any other youth of the working of his machinery prompted him to bid her sing before they parted emilia checked her steps at once to do as he desired her throat filled but the voice quavered down again like a fainting creature sick unto death she made another effort and ended with a sorrowful look at his narrowly watching eyes i can't she said and in fear of his anger took his hand to beg forgiveness while her eyelids drooped wilfrid locked her fingers in a strong pressure and walked on silent as a man who has faced one of the veiled mysteries of life it struck a full human blow on his heart dragging him out of his sentimental pastures precipitately he felt her fainting voice to be the intensest love cry that could be uttered the sound of it coursed through his blood striking a rare illumination of sparks in his not commonly brilliant brain in truth that little episode showed an image of nature weak with the burden of new love i do not charge the young cavalry officer with the power of perceiving images he saw no more than that she could not sing because of what was in her heart toward him but such a physical revelation was a divine love confession coming involuntarily from one whose lips had not formed the name of love and wilfrid felt it so deeply that the exquisite flattery was almost lost in a certain awed sense of his being in the presence of an absolute fact a thing real though it was much talked about and visible though it did not wear a hat or a petticoat it searched him thoroughly enough to keep him from any further pledges in that direction propitious as the moment was while the moon slipped over banks of marble into fields of blue and all the midnight promised silence they passed quickly through the laurel shrubs and round the lawn lights were in the sleepless ladies' bed room windows do i love her thought wilfrid as he was about to pull at the bell and the thought that he should feel pain at being separated from her for half a dozen hours persuaded him that he did the self restraint which withheld him from protesting that he did confirmed it to morrow morning he whispered i shall be down by daylight answered emilia you are in the shade i cannot see you said he the door opened as emilia was moving out of the line of shadow chapter xiii on the morrow wilfrid was gone no one had seen him go emilia while she touched the keys of a muted piano softly in the morning quiet of the house had heard the front door close at that hour one attributes every noise to the servants she played on and waited patiently till the housemaid expelled her into the dewy air the report from his bedchamber telling the ladies of his absence added that he had taken linen for a lengthened journey this curious retreat of my hero belongs to the order of things that are done 'none know why' a curtain which drops conveniently upon either the bewilderment of the showman or the infirmities of the puppet i must own though i need not be told what odium frowns on such a pretension to excess of cleverness that i do know why i know why and unfortunately for me i have to tell what i know if i do not tell this narrative is so constituted that there will be no moral to it one who studies man in puppets in which purpose lies the chief value of this amusing species must think that we are degenerating rapidly the puppet hero for instance is a changed being we know what he was but now he takes shelter in his wits his organs affect his destiny careless of the fact that the hero's achievement is to conquer nature he seems rather to boast of his subservience to her still up to this day the fixture of a nose upon the puppet hero's frontispiece has not been attempted some one does it at last when the alternative came no nose to the hero no moral to the tale could there be hesitation and i would warn our sentimentalists to admit the nose among the features proper to heroes otherwise the race will become extinct there is already an amount of dropping of the curtain that is positively wearisome even to extremely refined persons in order to save him from apparent misconduct he will have to go altogether unless we boldly figure him as other men manifestly the moment his career as a fairy prince was at end he was on the high road to a nose the beneficent power that discriminated for him having vanished utterly he was like a bankrupt gentleman obliged to do all the work for himself this is nothing more than the tendency of the generations downward from the ideal the springs that moved wilfrid upon the present occasion were simple we will strip him of his heroic trappings for one fleeting instant and show them jumping briskly from a restless bed his first act was to address his features to the looking glass and he saw surely the most glorious sight for a hero of the knightly age that could possibly have been offered the battle of the previous night was written there in one eloquent big lump which would have passed him current as hero from end to end of the land in the great days of old these are the tea table days his preference was for the visage of wilfrid pole which he saw not at the aspect of the fearful mask this young man stared and then cursed and then by an odd transition he was reminded as by the force of a sudden gust that emilia's hair was redolent of pipe smoke his remark was i can't be seen in this state his thought a dim reminiscence of poetical readings ambrosial locks indeed a sad irony which told that much gold leaf had peeled away from her image in his heart wilfrid was a gallant fellow with good stuff in him but he was young ponder on that pregnant word for you are about to see him grow he was less a coxcomb than shamefaced and sentimental and one may have these qualities and be a coxcomb to boot and yet be a gallant fellow one may also be a gallant fellow and harsh exacting double dealing and i know not what besides in youth the question asked by nature is has he the heart to take and keep an impression for if he has circumstances will force him on and carve the figure of a brave man out of that mass of contradictions in return for such benefits he pays forfeit commonly of the dearest of the things prized by him in this terrestrial life whereat albeit created man by her he reproaches nature and the sculptor circumstance forgetting that to make him man is their sole duty and that what betrayed him was the difficulty thrown in their way by his quondam self the pleasant boonfellow he forgets in fact that he was formerly led by his nose and sacrificed his deeper feeling to a low disgust when the youth is called upon to look up he can adore devoutly and ardently but when it is his chance to look down on a fair head he is if not worse a sentimental despot wilfrid was young and under the dominion of his senses which can be if the sentimentalists will believe me as tyrannous and misleading when super refined as when ultra bestial he made a good stout effort to resist the pipe smoke emilia's voice her growing beauty her simplicity her peculiar charms of feature were all conjured up to combat the dismal images suggested by that fatal dragging down smell it was vain horrible pipe smoke pervaded the memory of her it seemed to his offended dainty fancy that he could never dissociate her from smoking booths and abominably bad tobacco and let us add for this was part of the secret that it never could dwell on her without the companionship of a hideous disfigured countenance claiming to be wilfrid pole he shuddered to think that he had virtually almost engaged himself to this girl or had he was his honour bound distance appeared to answer the question favourably there was safety in being distant from her she possessed an incomprehensible attractiveness she was at once powerful and pitiable so that while he feared her and was running from her spell he said from time to time poor little thing and deeply hoped she would not be unhappy a showman once a novice in his art or ambitious beyond the mark after a successful exhibition of his dolls handed them to the company with the observation satisfy yourselves ladies and gentlemen the latter having satisfied themselves that the capacity of the lower limbs was extraordinary returned them disenchanted that showman did ill but i am not imitating him i do not wait till after the performance when it is too late to revive illusion to avoid having to drop the curtain i choose to explain an act on which the story hinges while it is advancing which is in truth an impulse of character instead of his being more of a puppet this hero is less wooden than he was certainly i am much more in awe of him chapter xiv mr pole was one of those men whose characters are read off at a glance he was neat insignificant and nervously cheerful with the eyes of a bird that let you into no interior his friends knew him thoroughly his daughters were never in doubt about him at the period of the purchase of brookfield he had been excitable and feverish but that was ascribed to the projected change in his habits and the stern necessity for an occasional family intercommunication on the subject of money he had a remarkable shyness of this theme and reversed its general treatment for he would pay but would not talk of it if it had to be discussed with the ladies he puffed and blinked and looked so much like a culprit that though they rather admired him for what seemed to them the germ of a sense delicate above his condition they would have said of any man they had not known so perfectly that he had painful reasons for wishing to avoid it now that they spoke to him of besworth assuring him that they were serious in their desire to change their residence the fit of shyness was manifested first in outrageous praise of brookfield which was speedily and inexplicably followed by a sort of implied assent to the proposition to depart from it for besworth displayed numerous advantages over brookfield and to contest one was to plunge headlong into the money question he ventured to ask his daughters what good they expected from the change they replied that it was simply this that one might live fifty years at brookfield and not get such a circle as in two might be established at besworth they were restricted they had gathering friends and no means of bringing them together and the beauty of the site of besworth made them enthusiastic well but said mr pole what does it lead to is there nothing to come after he explained you're girls you know you won't always stop with me you may do just as well at brookfield for yourselves as over there the ladies blushed demurely you forecast very kindly for us papa said cornelia our object is entirely different i wish i could see it he returned but you do see papa you do see interposed adela that a select life is preferable to that higgledy piggledy city square existence so many poor creatures are condemned to select said mr pole thinking that he had hit upon a weakness in their argument how can it be select when you want to go to a place where you may have a crowd about you selection can only be made from a crowd remarked arabella with terrible placidity it is where we see few that we are at the mercy of kind fortune for our acquaintances don't you see papa that the difference between the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie is that the former choose their sets and the latter are obliged to take what comes to them said adela this was the first domestic discussion upon besworth the visit to richford had produced the usual effect on the ladies who were now looking to other heights from that level the ladies said we have only to press it with papa and we shall quit this place but at the second discussion they found that they had not advanced the only change was in the emphasis that their father added to the interrogations already uttered what does it lead to what's to come after i see your object but am i to go into a new house for the sake of getting you out of it and then be left there alone it's against your interests too never mind how leave that to a business man if your brother had proposed itbut he's too reasonable the ladies upon this hint wrote to wilfrid to obtain his concurrence and assistance he laughed when he read the simple sentence we hope you will not fancy that we have any peculiar personal interest in view and replied to them that he was sure they had none that he looked upon besworth with favour and i may inform you he pursued that your taste is heartily applauded by lady charlotte chillingworth she bids me tell you the letter was dated from stornley the estate of the marquis lady charlotte's father her ladyship's brother was a member of wilfrid's club he calls besworth the most habitable place in the county and promises to be there as many months out of the twelve as you like to have him i agree with him that stornley can't hold a candle to it there are three residences in england that might be preferred to it and of those two are ducal the letter was a piece of that easy diplomacy which comes from habit the of those two are ducal was masterly it affected the imagination of brookfield which two and could besworth be brought to rival them ultimately it might be the neighbourhood to london too gave it noble advantages rapid relays of guests and a metropolitan reputation for country attractions would distinguish besworth above most english houses a house where all the chief celebrities might be encountered a house under suave feminine rule a house a home to a chosen set and a refreshing fountain to a widening circle we have a dispute they wrote playfully to wilfrid a dispute we wish you or lady charlotte to settle i arabella know nothing of trout i cornelia know nothing of river beds i adela know nothing of engineering but we are persuaded the latter that the river running for a mile through besworth grounds may be deepened we are persuaded the intermediate that the attempt will damage the channel we are persuaded the first that all the fish will go in reply wilfrid appeared to have taken them in earnest i rode over yesterday with lady charlotte he said we think something might be done without at all endangering the fish or spoiling the channel at all events the idea of making the mile of broad water serviceable for boats is too good to give up in a hurry how about the dining hall i told lady charlotte you were sure to insist upon a balcony for musicians she laughed you will like her when you know her thus the ladies of brookfield were led on to be more serious concerning besworth than they had thought of being and began to feel that their honour was pledged to purchase this surpassing family seat in a household where every want is supplied and money as a topic utterly banished it is not surprising that they should have had imperial views adela was wilfrid's favoured correspondent she described to him gaily the struggle with their papa but if you care for besworth you may calculate on it or is it only for our sakes as i sometimes think besworth is won nothing but the cost of the place to be considered you know could withhold it from us and of that papa has not uttered a syllable though he conjures up every possible objection to a change of abode and will not perhaps poor dear cannot see what we intend doing in the world now you know that rich men invariably make the question of the cost their first and loudest outcry i know that to be the case they call it their blood papa seems indifferent to this part of the affair he does not even allude to it still we do not progress it is just possible that the tinleys have an eye on beautiful besworth their own place is bad enough but good enough for them give them besworth and they will sit upon the neighbourhood we shall be invaded by everything that is mean and low and a great chance will be gone for us i think i may say for the county the country our advice is that you write to papa one of your cleverest letters we know darling what you can do with the pen as well as the sword write word that you have written wilfrid's reply stated that he considered it unadviseable that he should add his voice to the request for the present the ladies submitted to this quietly until they heard from their father one evening at dinner that he had seen wilfrid in the city he doesn't waste his time like some young people i know said mr pole with a wink papa is it possible cried adela everything's possible my dear lady charlotte there is a lady charlotte who would be lady charlotte still whatever occurred mr pole laughed no no you get nothing out of me all i say is be practical the sun isn't always shining he appeared to be elated with some secret good news have you been over to besworth the last two or three days he asked the ladies smiled radiantly acknowledging wilfrid's wonderful persuasive powers in their hearts no papa we have not been said adela we are always anxious to go as i think you know the merchant chirped over his glass well well there's a way straight over a gate ha ha his gaiety would have been perplexing but for the allusion to lady charlotte the sisters in their unfailing midnight consultation persuaded one another that wilfrid had become engaged to that lady they wrote forthwith fine shades to him on the subject his answer was boeotian and all about besworth press it now he said if you really want it the iron is hot and above all things let me beg you not to be inconsiderate to the squire when he and i are doing all we can for you i mean we are bound to consider him if there should happen to be anything he wishes us to do what could the word 'inconsiderate' imply the ladies were unable to summon an idea to solve it they were sure that no daughters could be more perfectly considerate and ready to sacrifice everything to their father in the end they deputed the volunteering adela to sit with him in the library and put the question of besworth decisively in the name of all they meantime who had a contempt for sleep waited aloft to hold debate over the result of the interview an hour after midnight adela came to them looking pale and uncertain her curls seeming to drip and her blue eyes wandering about the room as if she had seen a thing that kept her in a quiver between belief and doubt the two ladies drew near to her expressing no verbal impatience from which the habit of government and great views naturally saved them but singularly curious adela's first exclamation i wish i had not gone alarmed them has any change come to papa breathed arabella cornelia smiled do you not know him too well an acute glance from adela made her ask whether besworth was to be surrendered oh no my dear we may have besworth then surely but there are conditions said arabella yes wilfrid's enigma is explained bella that woman has seen papa what woman mrs chump she has our permission to see him in town if that is any consolation to her she has told him continued adela that no explanation or whatever it may be was received by her certainly not if it was not sent papa and adela's voice trembled papa will not think of besworth not a word of it until until we consent to welcome that woman here as our guest cornelia was the first to break the silence that followed this astounding intelligence then she said besworth is not to be thought of you told him so adela's head drooped oh she cried what shall we do we shall be a laughing stock to the neighbourhood the house will have to be locked up we shall live like hermits worried by a demon her brogue do you remember it it is not simply irish it's irish steeped in brine it's pickled irish she feigned the bursting into tears of real vexation you speak said cornelia contemptuously as if we had very humbly bowed our heads to the infection papa making terms with us murmured arabella pray repeat his words adela tossed her curls i will as well as i can i began by speaking of besworth cheerfully saying that if he really had no strong affection for brookfield that would make him regret quitting it we saw innumerable advantages in the change of residence proposed predilection not affection that was what i said he replied that besworth was a large place and i pointed out that therein lay one of its principal merits i expected what would come he alluded to the possibility of our changing our condition you know that idea haunts him i told him our opinion of the folly of the thing i noticed that he grew red in the face and i said that of course marriage was a thing ordained but that we objected to being submerged in matrimony until we knew who and what we were i confess he did not make a bad reply of its kind 'you're like a youngster playing truant that he may gain knowledge' what do you think of it a smart piece of city speech was arabella's remark cornelia placidly observing vulgarity never contains more than a minimum of the truth i said adela went on think as you will papa we know we are right he looked really angry he said that we have the absurdest ideas you tell me to repeat his words of any girls that ever existed and then he put a question listen i give it without comment 'i dare say you all object to widows marrying again' i kept myself quiet 'marrying again papa if they marry once they might as well marry a dozen times' it was the best way to irritate him i did not intend it that is all i can say he jumped from his chair rubbed his hair and almost ran up and down the library floor telling me that i prevaricated 'you object to a widow marrying at all that's my question' he cried out loud of course i contained my voice all the more 'distinctly papa' when i had spoken i could scarcely help laughing he went like a pony that is being broken in crying i don't know how many times 'why what's your reason' you may suppose darlings that i decline to enter upon explanation if a person is dense upon a matter of pure sentiment there is no ground between us he has simply a sense wanting 'what has all this to do with besworth' i asked 'a great deal more than you fancy' was his answer he seemed to speak every word at me in capital letters then as if a little ashamed he sat down and reached out his hand to mine and i saw his eyes were moist i drew my chair nearer to him now whether i did right or wrong in this i do not know i leave it entirely to your judgement if you consider how i was placed you will at all events excuse me what i did was you know the very farthest suspicion one has of an extreme possibility one does not mind mentioning i said 'papa if it should so happen that money is the objection to besworth we will not trouble you' at this i can only say that he behaved like an insane person he denounced me as wilfully insulting him that i might avoid one subject and what on earth can that be interposed arabella you may well ask could a genie have guessed that mrs chump was at the bottom of it all the conclusion of the dreadful discussion is this that papa offers to take the purchase of besworth into his consideration if we as i said before will receive mrs chump as our honoured guest i am bound to say poor dear old man he spoke kindly as he always does and kissed me and offered to give me anything i might want i came from him stupefied i have hardly got my senses about me yet the ladies caressed her with grave looks but neither of them showed a perturbation of spirit like that which distressed adela wilfrid's meaning is now explained said cornelia he is in league with papa or has given in his adhesion to papa's demands at least he is another example of the constant tendency in men to be what they call 'practical' at the expense of honour and sincerity i hope not said arabella in any case that need not depress you so seriously darling she addressed adela do you not see adela cried in response what are you both blind to the real significance of papa's words i could not have believed it or am i this time too acute i pray to heaven it may be so both ladies desired her to be explicit arabella eagerly cornelia with distrust the question of a widow marrying what is this woman whom papa wishes to force on us as our guest why should he do that why should he evince anxiety with regard to our opinion of the decency of widows contemplating re union remember previous words and hints when we lived in the city this at least you may spare us said cornelia ruffling offended adela smiled in tenderness for her beauty but it is important if we are following a track dear think over it no cried arabella it cannot be true we might easily have guessed this if we ever dreamed of impossibilities in such cases when appearances lean in one direction set principles in the opposite balance added cornelia what adela apprehends may seem to impend but we know that papa is incapable of doing it to know that shuts the gates of suspicion she has allowed herself to be troubled by a ghastly nightmare adela believed in her own judgement too completely not to be sure that her sisters were perhaps unknowingly disguising a slowness of perception they were ashamed of by thus partially accusing her of giddiness she bit her lip very well if you have no fears whatever you need not abandon the idea of besworth i abandon nothing said arabella if i have to make a choice i take that which is least objectionable i am chagrined most at the idea that wilfrid has been treacherous practical cornelia suggested you are not speaking of one of our sex questions were then put to adela whether mr pole had spoken in the manner of one who was prompted whether he hesitated as he spoke whether in short wilfrid was seen behind his tongue adela resolved that wilfrid should have one protectress you are entirely mistaken in ascribing treachery to him she said it is papa that is changed you may suppose it to be without any reason if you please i would tell you to study him for yourselves only i am convinced that these special private interviews are anything but good policy and are strictly to be avoided unless of course as in the present instance we have something directly to do toward dawn the ladies had decreed that it was policy to be quite passive and provoke no word of mrs chump by making any allusion to besworth and by fencing with the mention of the place as they rarely failed to carry out any plan deliberately conceived by them mr pole was astonished to find that besworth was altogether dropped after certain scattered attempts to bring them upon besworth he shrugged and resigned himself but without looking happy indeed he looked so dismal that the ladies began to think he had a great longing for besworth and yet he did not go there or even praise it to the discredit of brookfield they were perplexed let me ask you how it is said cornelia to mr barrett that a person whom we know whose actions and motives are as plain to us as though discerned through a glass should at times produce a completer mystification than any other creature or have you not observed it i have had better opportunities of observing it than most people mr barren replied with one of his saddest amused smiles i have come to the conclusion that the person we know best is the one whom we never understand you answer me with a paradox is it not the natural attendant on an assumption what assumption that you know a person thoroughly may we not do you when you acknowledge this 'complete mystification' yes cornelia smiled when she had said it and no mr barrett with his eyes on her laughed softly which is paradox at the fountain head but when we say we know any one we mean commonly that we are accustomed to his ways and habits of mind or that we can reckon on the predominant influence of his appetites sometimes we can tell which impulse is likely to be the most active and which principle the least restraining the only knowledge to be trusted is a grounded or scientific study of the springs that move him side by side with his method of moving the springs if you fail to do this you have two classes under your eyes you have sane and madman and it will seem to you that the ranks of the latter are constantly being swollen in an extraordinary manner the customary impression as we get older is that our friends are the maddest people in the world you see we have grown accustomed to them and now if they bewilder us our judgement in self defence is compelled to set them down lunatic cornelia bowed her stately head with gentle approving laughter they must go or they despatch us thither she said while her fair face dimpled into serenity the remark was of a lower nature than an intellectual discussion ordinarily drew from her but could mr barrett have read in her heart he might have seen that his words were beginning to rob that organ of its native sobriety so that when he spoke a cogent phrase she was silenced and became aware of a strange exultation in her blood that obscured grave thought cornelia attributed this display of mental weakness altogether to mr barrett's mental force the interposition of a fresh agency was undreamt of by the lady meanwhile it was evident that mr pole was a victim to one of his fevers of shyness he would thrum on the table frowning and then as he met the look of one of the ladies try to disguise the thought in his head with a forced laugh occasionally he would turn toward them as if he had just caught a lost idea that was peculiarly precious the ladies drawing up to attend to the communication had a most trivial matter imparted to them and away he went several times he said to them you don't make friends as you ought and their repudiation of the charge made him repeat you don't make friends home friends the house can be as full as we care to have it papa yes acquaintances all very well but i mean friends rich friends we will think of it papa said adela when we want money it isn't that he murmured adela had written to wilfrid a full account of her interview with her father wilfrid's reply was laconic if you cannot stand a week of the brogue give up besworth by all means he made no further allusion to the place they engaged an opera box for the purpose of holding a consultation with him in town he wrote evasively but did not appear and the ladies with emilia between them listened to every foot fall by the box door and were too much preoccupied to marvel that emilia was just as inattentive to the music as they were when the curtain dropped they noticed her dejection what ails you they asked let us go out of london to night she whispered and it was difficult to persuade her that she would see brookfield again remember said adela it is you that run away from us not we from you soft chidings of this description were the only reproaches for her naughty conduct she seemed contrite very still and timid since that night of adventure the ladies were glad to observe it seeing that it lent her an air of refinement and proved her sensible to correction at last mr pole broke the silence he had returned from business humming and rubbing his hands like one newly primed with a suggestion that was the key of a knotty problem observant adela said have you seen wilfrid papa saw him in the morning mr pole replied carelessly mr barrett was at the table by the way what do you think of our law of primogeniture mr pole addressed him he replied with the usual allusion to a basis of aristocracy well it's the english system said mr pole that's always in its favour at starting i'm englishman enough to think that there ought to be an entail of every decent bit of property eh it was observed that mr barrett reddened as he said i certainly think that a young man should not be subject to his father's caprice father's caprice that isn't common but if you're founding a family you must entail we agree sir from my point of view and from yours knits the family bond don't you think i mean makes the trunk of the tree firm it makes the girls poor though mr barrett saw that he had some confused legal ideas in his head and that possibly there were personal considerations in the background so he let the subject pass when the guest had departed mr pole grew demonstrative in his paternal caresses he folded adela in one arm and framed her chin in his fingers marks of affection dear to her before she had outgrown them so he said you've given up besworth have you at the name arabella and cornelia drew nearer to his chair given up besworth papa it is not we who have given it up said adela yes you have and quite right too you say 'what's the use of it for that's a sort of thing that always goes to the son' you suppose papa that we indulge in ulterior calculations came from cornelia well you see my love no i don't suppose it at all but to buy a place and split it up after two or three years i dare say they wouldn't insure me for more that's nonsense and it seems unfair to you as you must think darling papa we are not selfish it rejoiced adela to exclaim his face expressed a transparent simple mindedness that won the confidence of the ladies and awakened their ideal of generosity i know what you mean papa said arabella but we love besworth and if we may enjoy the place for the time that we are all together i shall think it sufficient i do not look beyond her sisters echoed the sentiment and sincerely they were as little sordid as creatures could be if deeply questioned it would have been found that their notion of the position providence had placed them in in other words their father's unmentioned wealth permitted them to be as lavish as they pleased mr pole had endowed them with a temperament similar to his own and he had educated it in feminine earth it flourished wonderfully shy as himself their shyness took other forms and developed with warm youth not only did it shut them up from others which is the first effect of this disease but it tyrannized over them internally so that there were subjects they had no power to bring their minds to consider money was in the list the besworth question as at present considered involved the money question all of them felt that father and children it is not surprising therefore that they hurried over it as speedily as they could and by a most comical exhibition of implied comprehension of meanings and motives of course we're only in the opening stage of the business said mr pole there's nothing decided you know lots of things got to be considered you mean what you say do you very well and you want me to think of it so i will and look my dears you know that here his voice grew husky as was the case with it when touching a shy topic even beneath the veil but they were above suspicion you know that a that we must all give way a little to the other now and then nothing like being kind pray have no fear papa dear rang the clear voice of arabella well then you're all for besworth even though it isn't exactly for your own interest all right the ladies kissed him we'll each stretch a point he continued we shall get on better if we do much you're a little hard on people who're not up to the mark there's an end to that even your old father will like you better these last remarks were unintelligible to the withdrawing ladies on the morning that followed mr pole expressed a hope that his daughters intended to give him a good dinner that day and he winked humorously and kindly by which they understood him to be addressing a sort of propitiation to them for the respect he paid to his appetite papa said adela i myself will speak to cook she added with a smile thrown to her sisters without looking at them i dare say she will know who i am mr pole went down to his wine cellar and was there busy with bottles till the carriage came for him a bason was fetched that he might wash off the dust and cobwebs in the passage having rubbed his hands briskly with soap he dipped his head likewise in an oblivious fit and then turning round to the ladies said what have i forgotten looking woebegone with his dripping vacant face oh ah i remember now and he chuckled gladly he had just for one moment forgotten that he was acting and a pang of apprehension had caught him when the water covered his face to the effect that he must forfeit the natural artistic sequence of speech and conduct which disguised him so perfectly away he drove nodding and waving his hand dear simple innocent old man was the pitiful thought in the bosoms of the ladies and if it was accompanied by the mute exclamation how singular that we should descend from him it would not have been for the first time they passed one of their delightful quiet days in which they paved the future with gold and if i may use so bold a figure lifted parasols against the great sun that was to shine on them now they listened to emilia and now strolled in the garden conversed on the social skill of lady gosstre who was nevertheless narrow in her range and on the capacities of mansions on the secret of mixing people in society and what to do with the women a terrible problem this latter one not terrible to hostesses at a mere rout or drum or at a dance pure and simple but terrible when you want good talk to circulate for then they are not as a body amused and when they are not amused you know they are not inclined to be harmless and in this state they are vipers and where is society then and yet you cannot do without them which is the revolting mystery i need not say that i am not responsible for these critical remarks such tenderness to the sex comes only from its sisters so went a day rich in fair dreams to the ladies and at the hour of their father's return they walked across the parvenu park in a state of enthusiasm for besworth that threw some portion of its decorative light on the donor of besworth when his carriage was heard on the road they stood fast and greeted his appearance with a display of pocket handkerchiefs in the breeze a proceeding that should have astonished him being novel but seemed not to do so for it was immediately responded to by the vigorous waving of a pair of pocket handkerchiefs from the carriage window the ladies smiled at this piece of simplicity which prompted him to use both his hands as if one would not have been enough complacently they continued waving then adela looked at her sisters cornelia's hand dropped and arabella the last to wave was the first to exclaim that must be a woman's arm the carriage stopped at the gate and it was one in the dress of a woman at least and of the compass of a big woman who descended by the aid of mr pole safely alighted she waved her pocket handkerchief afresh the ladies of brookfield did not speak to one another nor did they move their eyes from the object approaching a simultaneous furtive extinction of three pocket handkerchiefs might have been noticed there was no further sign given chapter xv a letter from brookfield apprised wilfrid that mr pole had brought mrs chump to the place as a visitor and that she was now in the house formal as a circular the idea of it appeared to be that the bare fact would tell him enough and inspire him with proper designs no reply being sent a second letter arrived formal too but pointing out his duty to succour his afflicted family and furnishing a few tragic particulars thus he learnt that while mr pole was advancing toward the three grouped ladies on the day of mrs chump's arrival he called arabella by name and arabella went forward alone and was engaged in conversation by mrs chump mr pole left them to make his way to adela and cornelia now mind i expect you to keep to your agreement he said gradually they were led on to perceive that this simple minded man had understood their recent talk of besworth to signify a consent to the stipulation he had previously mentioned to adela perfect simplicity is as deceiving as the depth of cunning adela despairingly wrote much to wilfrid's amusement a third letter followed it was of another tenor and ran thus in adela's handwriting my darling wilfrid we have always known that some peculiar assistance would never be wanting in our extremity aid or comfort or whatever you please to call it at all events something to show we are not neglected that old notion of ours must be true i shall say nothing of our sufferings in the house they continue yesterday papa came from town looking important he had up some of his best wine for dinner all through the service his eyes were sparkling on cornelia i spare you a family picture while there is this huge blot on it naughty brother but listen your place is here for many reasons as you will be quick enough to see after dinner papa took cornelia into the library alone and they were together for ten minutes she came out very pale she had been proposed for by sir twickenham pryme our member for the borough i have always been sure that cornelia was born for parliament and he will be lucky if he wins her we know not yet of course what her decision will be the incident is chiefly remarkable to us as a relief to what i need not recount to you but i wish to say one thing dear wilfrid you are gazetted to a lieutenancy and we congratulate you but what i have to say is apparently much more trifling and it is that will you take it to heart it would do arabella and myself infinite good if we saw a little more of our brother and just a little less of a very gentlemanly organ player phenomenon who talks so exceedingly well he is a very pleasant man and appreciates our ideas and so forth but it is our duty to love our brother best and think of him foremost and we wish him to come and remind us of our duty at our cornelia's request with our concurrence papa is silent in the house as to the purport of the communication made by sir tp by the way are you at all conscious of a sound like absurdity in a christian name of three syllables preceding a surname of one sir twickenham pryme cornelia's pronunciation of the name first gave me the feeling the 'twickenham' seems to perform a sort of educated monkey kind of ridiculously decorous pirouette and entrechat before the 'pryme' i think that cornelia feels it also you seem to fancy elastic limbs bending to the measure of a solemn church organ sir timothy but sir timothy does not jump with the same grave agility as sir twickenham if she rejects him it will be half attributable to this my own brother i expect no confidences but a whisper warns me that you have not been to stornley twice without experiencing the truth of our old discovery that the poles are magnetic why should we conceal it from ourselves if it be so i think it a folly and fraught with danger for people not to know their characteristics if they attract they should keep in a circle where they will have no reason to revolt at or say repent of what they attract my argumentative sister does not coincide if she did she would lose her argument adieu such is my dulness i doubt whether i have made my meaning clear your thrice affectionate adela ps lady gosstre has just taken emilia to richford for a week papa starts for bidport to morrow this short and rather blunt exercise in fine shades was read impatiently by wilfrid why doesn't she write plain to the sense he asked with the usual injustice of men who demand a statement of facts forgetting how few there are to feed the post and that indication and suggestion are the only language for the multitude of facts unborn and possible twilight best shows to the eye what may be i suppose i must go down there he said to himself keeping a meditative watch on the postscript as if it possessed the capability of slipping away and deceiving him does she mean that cornelia sees too much of this man barrett or what does she mean and now he saw meanings in the simple passages and none at all in the intricate ones and the double meanings were monsters that ate one another up till nothing remained of them in the end however he made a wrathful guess and came to a resolution which brought him to the door of the house next day at noon he took some pains in noting the exact spot where he had last seen emilia half in moonlight and then dismissed her image peremptorily the house was apparently empty gainsford the footman gave information that he thought the ladies were upstairs but did not volunteer to send a maid to them he stood in deferential footman's attitude with the aspect of a dog who would laugh if he could but being a footman out of his natural element cannot here's a specimen of the new plan of treating servants thought wilfrid turning away to act a farce for their benefit that fellow will explode when he gets downstairs i see how it is this woman chump is making them behave like schoolgirls he conceived the idea sharply and forthwith without any preparation he was ready to treat these high aspiring ladies like schoolgirls nor was there a lack of justification for when they came down to his shouts in the passage they hushed and held a finger aloft and looked altogether so unlike what they aimed at being that wilfrid's sense of mastery became almost contempt i know perfectly what you have to tell me he said mrs chump is here you have quarrelled with her and she has shut her door and you have shut yours it's quite intelligible and full of dignity i really can't smother my voice in consequence he laughed with unnecessary abandonment the sensitive young women wanted no other schooling to recover themselves in a moment they were seen leaning back and contemplating him amusedly as if he had been the comic spectacle and were laughing for a wager there are few things so sour as the swallowing of one's own forced laugh wilfrid got it down and commenced a lecture to fill the awkward pause his sisters maintained the opera stall posture of languid attention contesting his phrases simply with their eyebrows and smiling he was no match for them while they chose to be silent and indeed if the business of life were conducted in dumb show women would beat men hollow they posture admirably in dumb show they are equally good for attack and defence but this is not the case in speech so when arabella explained that their hope was to see mrs chump go that day owing to the rigorous exclusion of all amusement and the outer world from the house wilfrid regained his superior footing and made his lecture tell in the middle of it there rang a cry from the doorway that astonished even him it was so powerfully irish the lady you have called down is here said arabella's cold glance in answer to his they sat with folded hands while wilfrid turned to mrs chump who advanced a shock of blue satin to the eye crying on a jump is ut mr wilfrud it's i ma'am wilfrid bowed and the censorious ladies could not deny that his style was good if his object was to be familiar and if that was his object he was paid for it a great thick kiss was planted on his cheek with the motto harm to them that thinks ut wilfrid bore the salute like a man who presumes that he is flattered and it's you said mrs chump i was just off i'm packed and bonnutted and ready for a start becas my dear where there's none but women i don't think it natural to stop you're splendud how a little fella like pole could go and be father to such a mighty big son with your bit of moustache and your blue eyes are they blue or a bit of grey in 'em mrs chump peered closely they're kill'n' let their colour be annyhow and i that knew ye when ye were no bigger than my garter oh sir don't talk of ut i'll be thinkin' of my coffin ye're glad to see me say yes do very glad quoth wilfrid upon your honour now upon my honour my dears mrs chump turned to the ladies i'll stop and just thank your brother for't though you can't help being garls reduced once more to demonstrate like schoolgirls by this woman the ladies rose together and were retiring when mrs chump swung round and caught arabella's hand see heer she motioned to wilfrid arabella made a bitter effort to disengage herself see now it's jeal'sy of me mr wilfrud becas i'm a widde and just an abom'nation to garls poor darlin's and twenty shindies per dime we've been havin' and me such a placable body if ye'll onnly let m' explode i'm all powder avery bit and might ha' been christened saltpetre if born a boy she hasn't so much as a shot to kill a goose says chump poor fella but he went annyway i must kiss somebody when i talk of 'm mr wilfrud i'll take the girls and entitle myself to you arabella was the first victim her remonstrance was inarticulate cornelia's madam was smothered adela behaved better being more consciously under wilfrid's eye she prepared her pocket handkerchief received the salute and deliberately effaced it there said mrs chump duty to begin with and now for you mr wilfrud the ladies escaped their misery could not be conveyed to the mind the woman was like a demon come among them they felt chiefly degraded not by her vulgarity but by their inability to cope with it and by the consequent sickening sense of animal inefficiency the block that was put to all imaginative delight in the golden hazy future they figured for themselves and which was their wine of life an intellectual adversary they could have combated this huge brogue burring engine quite overwhelmed them wilfrid's worse than shameful behaviour was a common rallying point and yet so absolutely critical were they by nature their blame of him was held mentally in restraint by the superior ease of his manner as contrasted with their own lamentably silly awkwardness highly civilized natures do sometimes and keen wits must always feel dissatisfied when they are not on the laughing side their dread of laughter is an instinctive respect for it dinner brought them all together again wilfrid took his father's seat facing his aunt lupin and increased the distress of his sisters by his observance of every duty of a host to the dreadful intruder whom he thus established among them he was incomprehensible his visit to stornley had wrought in him a total change he used to like being petted and would regard everything as right that his sisters did before he went there and was a languid long legged indifferent cavalier representing men to them things made to be managed snubbed admired but always virtually subservient and in the background now without perceptible gradation his superiority was suddenly manifest so that irritated and apprehensive as they were they could not by the aid of any of their intricate mental machinery look down on him they tried to they tried hard to think him despicable as well as treacherous his style was too good when he informed mrs chump that he had hired a yacht for the season and added after enlarging on the merits of the vessel i am under your orders his sisters were as creatures cut in twain one half abominating his conduct the other approving his style the bow the smile were perfect the ladies had to make an effort to recover their condemnatory judgement oh cried mrs chump and if you've got a yacht mr wilfrud won't ye have a great parcel o' the arr'stocracy on board you may spy a title by the aid of a telescope said wilfrid and i'm to come i am are you not elected captain oh if ye've got lords and real ladies on board i'll come be sure of ut i'll be as sick as a cat i will but i'll come if it's the rroon of my stomach i'd say to chump oh if ye'd only been born a lord or would just get yourself struck a knight on one o' your shoulders oh chump i'd say 'it wouldn't be necessary to be rememberin' always the words of the cerr'mony about lovin' and honourin' and obeyin' of a little whistle of a fella like you poor lad he couldn't stop for his luck did ye ask me to take wine mr wilfrud i'll be cryin' else as a widde should ye know frequent administrations of wine arrested the tears of mrs chump until it is possible that the fulness of many a checked flow caused her to redden and talk slightly at random at the first mention of their father's name the ladies went out from the room it was foolish for they might have watched the effect of certain vinous innuendoes addressed to wilfrid's apprehensiveness but they were weakened and humbled and everything they did was foolish from the fact that they offended their keen critical taste moreover they were targets to the shaft that wounds more fatally than all no ridicule knocks the strength out of us so thoroughly as our own whether or not he guessed their condition favourable for his plans wilfrid did not give them time to call back their scattered powers at the hour of eleven he sent for arabella to come to him in the library the council upstairs permitted arabella to go on the understanding that she was prepared for hostilities and ready to tear the mask from wilfrid's face he commenced without a shadow of circumlocution and in a matter of fact way as if all respect for the peculiar genius of the house of pole had vanished i sent for you to talk a word or two about this woman who i see troubles you a little i'm sorry she's in the house indeed said arabella i'm sorry she's in the house not for my sake but for yours since the proximity does not seem to i needn't explain it comes of your eternal consultations you are the eldest why not act according to your judgement which is generally sound you listen to adela young as she is or a look of cornelia's leads you the result is the sort of scene i saw this afternoon i confess it has changed my opinion of you it has i grieve to say it this woman is your father's guest you can't hurt her so much as you hurt him if you misbehave to her you can't openly object to her and not cast a slur upon him there is the whole case he has insisted and you must submit you should have fought the battle before she came she is here owing to a miserable misconception said arabella ah she is here however that is the essential as your old governess madame timpan would have said nor can a protest against coarseness be sweepingly interpreted as a piece of unfilial behaviour said arabella she is coarse wilfrid nodded his head there are some forms of coarseness which dowagers would call it coarseness to notice not if you find it locked up in the house with you not if you suffer under a constant repulsion pray do not use these phrases to me wilfrid an accusation of coarseness cannot touch us no certainly assented wilfrid and you have a right to protest i disapprove the form of your protest nothing more a schoolgirl'sbut you complain of the use of comparisons i complain wilfrid of your want of sympathy that for two or three weeks you must hear a brogue at your elbow the poor creature is not so bad she is good hearted it's hard that you should have to bear with her for that time and receive nothing better than besworth as your reward very seeing that we endure the evil and decline the sop with it how we have renounced besworth have you and did this renunciation make you all sit on the edge of your chairs this afternoon as if edward buxley had arranged you you give up besworth i'm afraid it's too late oh wilfrid can you be ignorant that something more is involved in the purchase of besworth arabella gazed at him with distressful eagerness as one who believes in the lingering of a vestige of candour do you mean that my father may wish to give this woman his name said wilfrid coolly you have sense enough to know that if you make his home disagreeable you are taking the right method to drive him into such a course ha i don't think it's to be feared unless you pursue these consultations and let me say for my part we have gone too far about besworth and can't recede i have given out everywhere that the place is ours i did so almost at your instigation besworth was nothing to me till you cried it up and now i won't detain you i know i can rely on your sense if you will rely on it good night bella as she was going a faint spark of courage revived arabella's wits seeing that she was now ready to speak he opened the door wide and she kissed him and went forth feeling driven but while arabella was attempting to give a definite version of the interview to her sisters a message came requesting adela to descend the ladies did not allow her to depart until two or three ingenuous exclamations from her made them share her curiosity ah wilfrid caught her hand as she came in no i don't intend to let it go you may be a fine lady but you're a rogue you know and a charming one as i hear a friend of mine has been saying shall i call him out shall i fight him with pistols or swords and leave him bleeding on the ground because he thinks you a pretty rogue adela struggled against the blandishment of this old familiar style of converse part fun part flattery dismissed since the great idea had governed brookfield please tell me what you called me down for dear to give you a lesson in sitting on chairs 'adela or the puritan sister' thus you sit on the extremest edge and your eyes peruse the ceiling and oh will you ever forget that perfectly ridiculous scene adela cried in anguish she was led by easy stages to talk of besworth understand said wilfrid that i am indifferent about it the idea sprang from you i mean from my pretty sister adela who is president of the council of three i hold that young woman responsible for all that they do am i wrong oh very well you suggested besworth at all events and if we quarrel i shall cut off one of your curls we never will quarrel my darling quoth adela softly unless she added wilfrid kissed her forehead unless what well then you must tell me who it is that talks of me in that objectionable manner i do not like it shall i convey that intimation i choose to ask simply that i may defend myself i choose to keep him buried then simply to save his life adela made a mouth and wilfrid went on by the way i want you to know lady charlotte you will take to one another she likes you already says you want dash but on that point there may be two opinions if dash said adela quite beguiled that is dash what does it mean but if lady charlotte means by dash am i really wanting in it i should define it the quality of being openly natural without vulgarity and surely then you two differ a little and must meet and settle your dispute you don't differ about besworth or didn't i never saw a woman so much in love with a place as she is a place emphasized adela don't be too arch i comprehend she won't take me minus besworth you may be sure did you wilfrid but you did not offer yourself as owner of besworth wilfrid kept his eyes slanting on the floor now i see why you should still wish it continued adela perhaps you don't know the reason which makes it impossible or i would say bacchus it must be compassed you remember your old schoolboy oath which you taught me we used to swear always by bacchus adela laughed and blushed like one who petitions pardon for this her utmost sin that is not regretted as it should be mrs chump again isn't it said wilfrid pole would be a preferable name if she has the ambition it elevates her and it would be rather amusing to see the dear old boy in love adela gave her under lip a distressful bite why do you wilfrid why treat such matters with levity levity i am the last to treat ninety thousand pounds with levity has she so much adela glanced at him she will be snapped up by some poor nobleman if i take her down to the yacht one of lady charlotte's brothers or uncles will bite to a certainty it would be an excellent idea to take her cried adela excellent and i'll do it if you like could you bear the reflex of the woman don't you know that i am not in the habit of sitting on the extreme edge adela started breathing piteously wilfrid dear you want something of me what is it simply that you should behave civilly to your father's guest i had a fear dear but i think too well of you to entertain it for a moment if civility is to win besworth for you there is my hand be civil that's all said wilfrid pressing the hand given these consultations of yours and acting in concert one tongue for three women are a sort of missish unripe nonsense that one sees only in bourgeoise girls eh give it up lady charlotte hit on it at a glance and i my chameleon brother will return her the compliment some day adela said to herself as she hurried back to her sisters bearing a message for cornelia this lady required strong persuasion a word from adela he will think you have some good reason to deny him a private interview sent her straight to the stairs wilfrid was walking up and down with his arms folded and his brows bent cornelia stood in the doorway you desire to speak to me wilfrid and in private i didn't wish to congratulate you publicly that's all i know it's rather against your taste we'll shut the door and sit down if you don't mind yes i congratulate you with all my heart he said placing a chair for cornelia may i ask wherefore you don't think marriage a matter for congratulation sometimes as the case may be well it's not marriage yet i congratulate you on your offer i thank you you accept it of course i reject it certainly after this preliminary passage wilfrid remained silent long enough for cornelia to feel uneasy i want you to congratulate me also he recommenced we poor fellows don't have offers you know to be frank i think lady charlotte chillingworth will have me if she's awfully fond of besworth and i need not tell you that as she has position in the world i ought to show something in return when you wrote about besworth i knew it was as good as decided i told her so and well i fancy there's that sort of understanding between us she will have me when you know how the poorer members of the aristocracy are situated her father's a peer and has a little influence he might push me but she is one of a large family she has nothing i am certain you will not judge of her as common people might she does me a particular honour is she not much older than you wilfrid said cornelia or in other words he added is she not a very mercenary person that i did not even imply honestly was it not in your head now you put it so plainly i do say it strikes me disagreeably i have heard of nothing like it do you think it unreasonable that i should marry into a noble family that is assuredly not my meaning nevertheless you are on the whole in favour of beggarly alliances no wilfrid why do you reject this offer that has been made to you cornelia flushed and trembled the traitorous feint had thrown her off her guard she said faltering would you have me marry one i do not love well well he drew back you are going to do your best to stop the purchase of besworth no i am quiescent though i tell you how deeply it concerns me wilfrid my own brother cornelia flung herself before him catching his hand i wish you to be loved first of all think of the horror of a loveless marriage however gilded does a woman make stipulations ere she gives her hand does not love seek to give to bestow i wish you to marry well but chiefly that you should be loved wilfrid pressed her head in both his hands i never saw you look so handsome he said you've got back your old trick of blushing too why do you tremble by the way you seem to have been learning a great deal about that business lately what business love a river of blood overflowed her fair cheeks how long has this been his voice came to her there was no escape she was at his knees and must look up or confess guilt this come my dearest girl wilfrid soothed her i can help you and will if you'll take advice i've always known your heart was generous and tender under that ice you wear so well how long has this been going on wilfrid you want plain speech she wanted that still less we'll call it 'this' he said i have heard of it guessed it and now see it how far have you pledged yourself in 'this' how far wilfrid held silent finding that her echo was not accepted as an answer she moaned his name lovingly it touched his heart where a great susceptibility to passion lay as if the ghost of emilia were about him he kissed his sister's hand and could not go on with his cruel interrogations his next question was dew of relief to her has your emilia been quite happy of late oh quite dear very and sings with more fire she's cheerful she does not romp her eyes are full and bright she's satisfied with everything here how could she be otherwise yes yes you weren't severe on her for that escapade i mean when she ran away from lady gosstre's we scarcely alluded to the subject or permitted her to or permitted her to wilfrid echoed with a grimace and she's cheerful now quite i mean she doesn't mope why should she cornelia had been too hard pressed to have suspicion the questions were an immense relief wilfrid mused gloomily cornelia spoke further of emilia and her delight in the visits of mr powys who spent hours with her like a man fascinated she flowed on little aware that she was fast restoring to wilfrid all his judicial severity he said at last i suppose there's no engagement existing engagement you have not what they call plighted your troth to the man cornelia struggled for evasion she recognized the fruitlessness of the effort and abandoning it stood up i am engaged to no one well i should hope not said wilfrid an engagement might be broken not by me it might is all that i say a romantic sentiment is tougher now i have been straightforward with you will you be with me i shall not hurt the man or wound his feelings he paused but it was to find that no admission of the truth save what oozed out in absence of speech was to be expected she seemed after the fashion of women to have got accustomed to the new atmosphere into which he had dragged her without any conception of a forward movement i see i must explain to you how we are situated said wilfrid we are in a serious plight you should be civil to this woman for several reasons for your father's sake and your own she is very rich oh wilfrid well i find money well thought of everywhere has your late school been good for you this woman i repeat is rich and we want money oh not the ordinary notion of wanting money but the more we have the more power we have our position depends on it yes if we can be tempted to think so flashed cornelia our position depends on it if you posture and are poor you provoke ridicule and to think of scorning money is a piece of folly no girls of condition are guilty of now you know i am fond of you so i'll tell you this you have a chance don't miss it something unpleasant is threatening but you may escape it it would be madness to throw such a chance away and it is your duty to take advantage of it what is there plainer you are engaged to no one cornelia came timidly close to him pray be explicit well this offer yes but what there is something to escape from wilfrid deliberately replied there is no doubt of the pater's intentions with regard to mrs chump he means he means to marry her and you wilfrid well of course he cuts me out there there forgive me but what can i do do you conspire wilfrid is it possible are you an accomplice in the degradation of our house cornelia had regained her courage perforce of wrath wilfrid's singular grey eyes shot an odd look at her he is to be excused for not perceiving the grandeur of the structure menaced for it was invisible to all the world though a real fabric if mrs chump were poor i should think the pater demented he said as it is well as it is there's grist to the mill wind to the organ you must be aware and he leaned over to her with his most suspicious gentleness of tone you are aware that all organs must be fed but you will make a terrible mistake if you suppose for a moment that the human organ requires the same sort of feeding as the one in hillford church good night said cornelia closing her lips as if for good wilfrid pressed her hand as she was going the springs of kindness in his heart caused him to say forgive me if i seemed rough yes dear wilfrid even brutality rather than your exultation over the wreck of what was noble in you with which phrase cornelia swept from the room chapter xvi seen wilfrid was mr pole's first cheery call to his daughters on his return an answer on that head did not seem to be required by him for he went on ah the boy's improved that place over there stornley does him as much good as the army did as to setting him up you know common sense and a ready way of speaking and thinking he sees a thing now well martha what do you eh what's your opinion mrs chump was addressed pole she said fanning her cheek with vehement languor don't ask me my heart's gone to the young fella in pursuance of a determination to which the ladies of brookfield had come adela following her sprightly fancy now gave the lead in affability toward mrs chump has the conqueror run away with it to bury it she laughed och won't he know what it is to be a widde cried mrs chump a widde's heart takes aim and flies straight as a bullet and the hearts o' you garls they're like whiffs o' tobacca curlin' and wrigglin' and not knowin' where they're goin' marry 'em pole marry 'em mrs chump gesticulated with two dangling hands they're nice garls but lord they naver see a man and they're stuputly contented and want to remain garls and don't ye see it was naver meant to be says i to mr wilfrud and he agreed with me ye might say nice sour grapes as well as nice garls if the creatures think o' stoppin' where they are and what they are it's horrud and upon my honour my heart aches for 'm mr pole threw an uneasy side glance of inquisition at his daughters to mark how they bore this unaccustomed language and haply intercede between the unworthy woman and their judgement of her but the ladies merely smiled placidly triumphant in its endurance the smile said we decline even to feel such a martyrdom as this well you know martha i he said i no father could wish eh if you could manage to persuade them not to be so fond of me they must think of their future of course they won't always have a home a father a father i mean god grant they may never want eh the dinner boh let's in to dinner ma'am he bowed an arm to mrs chump who took it with a scared look at him why if ye haven't got a tear in your eye pole nonsense nonsense quoth he bowing another arm to adela papa i'm not to be winked at said she accepting convoy and there was some laughter all about nothing as they went in to dinner the ladies were studiously forbearing in their treatment of mrs chump women are wonderfully quick scholars under ridicule though it half kills them wilfrid's theory had impressed the superior grace of civility upon their minds and now that they practised it they were pleased with the contrast they presented not the less were they maturing a serious resolve the suspicion that their father had secret vile designs in relation to mrs chump they kept in the background it was enough for them that she was to be a visitor and would thus destroy the great circle they had projected to accept her in the circle they felt was out of the question wilfrid's plain speaking broke up the air bubble which they had so carefully blown and in which they had embarked all their young hopes they had as much as given one another a pledge that their home likewise should be broken up are you not almost too severe a student mr barrett happened to say to cornelia the day after wilfrid had worried her do i show the signs she replied by no means but last night was it not your light that was not extinguished till morning we soon have morning now said cornelia and her face was pale as the first hour of the dawn are you not a late foot farer i may ask in return mere restlessness i have no appetite for study i took the liberty to cross the park from the wood and saw you at least i guessed it your light and then i met your brother yes you met him mr barrett gestured an affirmative and he did he speak he nodded he was in some haste but then you did not go to bed at all that night it is almost my turn to be lecturer if i might expect to be listened to do you not know or am i constitutionally different from others mr barrett resumed i can't be alone in feeling that there are certain times and periods when what i would like to call poisonous influences are abroad that touch my fate in the days to come i know i am helpless i can only wander up and down that sounds like a creed of fatalism it is not a creed it is a matter of nerves a creed has its 'kismet' the nerves are wild horses it is something to be fought against said cornelia admonishingly is it something to be distrusted i should say yes then i was wrong he stooped eagerly in his temperate way to catch sight of her answering face cornelia's quick cheeks took fire she fenced with a question of two and stood in a tremble marvelling at his intuition for possibly at that moment when he stood watching her window light ah poor heart she was half pledging her word to her sisters in a whirl of wrath at wilfrid herself and the world that she would take the lead in breaking up brookfield an event occurred that hurried them on they received a visit from their mother's brother john pierson a colonel of uhlans in the imperial royal service he had rarely been in communication with them his visit was unexpected his leave of absence from his quarters in italy was not longer than a month and he was on his way to ireland to settle family business but he called as he said to make acquaintance with his nieces the ladies soon discovered in spite of his foreign cut chin and pronounced military habit of speech and bearing that he was at heart fervidly british his age was about fifty a man of great force of shoulder and potent length of arm courteous and well bred in manner he was altogether what is called a model of a cavalry officer colonel pierson paid very little attention to his brother in law but the ladies were evidently much to his taste and when he kissed cornelia's hand his eyes grew soft as at a recollection you are what your mother once promised to be he said to her he gave that mother's portrait taking it solemnly from his breast pocket and attentively contemplating it before it left his hands the ladies pressed him for a thousand details of their mama's youthful life they found it a strange consolation to talk of her and image her like cornelia the foreign halo about the colonel had an effect on them that was almost like what nobility produces and by degrees they heated their minds to conceive that they were consenting to an outrage on that mother's memory in countenancing mrs chump's transparent ambition to take her place as they did by staying in the house with the woman the colonel's few expressive glances at mrs chump and mrs chump's behaviour before the colonel touched them with intense distaste for their present surly aspect of life civilized little people are moved to fulfil their destinies and to write their histories as much by distaste as by appetite this fresh sentimental emotion which led them to glorify their mother's image in their hearts heightened and gave an acid edge to their distaste for the think they saw nor was it wonderful that cornelia said to be so like that mother should think herself bound to accept the office of taking the initiative in a practical protest against the desecration of the name her mother had borne at times i see that sentiment approaches too near the holy of earthly holies for us to laugh at it it has too much truth in it to be denounced nay if we are not alert and quick of wit we shall be deceived by it and wonder in the end as the fool does why heaven struck that final blow concluding that it was but another whimsy of the gods the ladies prayed to their mother they were indeed suffering vile torture ethereal eyes might pardon the unconscious jugglery which made their hearts cry out to her that the step they were about to take was to save her children from seeming to acquiesce in a dishonour to her memory some such words adela's tongue did not shrink from and as it is a common habit for us to give to the objects we mentally address just as much brain as is wanted for the occasion she is not to be held singular colonel pierson promised to stay a week on his return from ireland will that person be here he designated mrs chump who among other things had reproached him for fighting with foreign steel and wearing any uniform but the red the ladies and colonel pierson were soon of one mind in relation to mrs chump certain salient quiet remarks dropped by him were cherished after his departure they were half willing to think that he had been directed to come to them bearer of a message from a heavenly world to urge them to action they had need of a spiritual exaltation to relieve them from the palpable depression caused by the weight of mrs chump they encouraged one another with exclamations on the oddness of a visit from their mother's brother at such a time of tribulation indecision and general darkness mrs chump remained on the field when adela begged her papa to tell her how long the lady was to stay he replied eh by the way i haven't asked her and retreated from this almost too obvious piece of simplicity with i want you to know her i want you to like her want you to get to understand her won't talk about her going just yet if they could have seen a limit to that wholesale slaughter of the nice feelings they might have summoned patience to avoid the desperate step to immediate relief but they saw none their father's quaint kindness and wilfrid's treachery had fixed her there perhaps for good the choice was to let london come and see them dragged through the mire by the monstrous woman or to seek new homes london they contended could not further be put off and would come especially now that the season was dying after all their parting from one another was the bitterest thing to bear and as each seemed content to endure it for the good of all and as properly considered they did not bury their ambition by separating they said farewell to the young delicious dawn of it by means of fine shades it was understood that brookfield was to be abandoned not one direct word was uttered there were expressions of regret that the village children of ipley would miss the supervizing eyes that had watched over them perchance at any rate would lose them all went on in the household as before and would have continued so but that they had a chief among them this was adela pole who found her powers with the occasion adela thought decisively people never move unless they are pushed and when you have got them to move ever so little then propel but by no means expect that a movement on their part means progression without propulsion nothing results adela saw what cornelia meant to do it was not to fly to sir twickenham but to dismiss mr barrett arabella consented to write to edward buxley but would not speak of old days and barely alluded to a misunderstanding though if she loved one man this was he adela was disengaged she had moreover to do penance for a wrong committed and just as children will pinch themselves pleased up to the verge of unendurable pain so do sentimentalists find a keen relish in performing secret penance for self accused offences thus they become righteous to their own hearts and evade as they hope the public scourge the wrong committed was translated out of fine shades that she had made love to her sister's lover in the original tongue she had innocently played with the sacred fire of a strange affection a child in the temple our penitent child took a keen pinching pleasure in dictating words for arabella to employ toward edward and then recurring to her interview with wilfrid it struck her suppose that after all money yes mammon has acted hymen before now nothing else explained mrs chump so she thought in one clear glimpse inveterate sentimental habit smeared the picture with two exclamations impossible and papa i desire it to be credited that these simple interjections absolutely obscured her judgement little people think either what they are made to think or what they choose to think and the education of girls is to make them believe that facts are their enemies a naughty spying race upon whom the dogs of pudeur are to be loosed if they surprise them without note of warning adela silenced her suspicion easily enough but this did not prevent her taking a measure to satisfy it petting her papa one evening she suddenly asked him for ninety pounds ninety said mr pole taking a sharp breath he was as composed as possible is that too much papa darling not if you want it not if you want it of course not you seemed astonished the sum it's an odd sum for a girl to want ten twenty fifty a hundred but you never hear of ninety never unless it's to pay a debt and i have all the bills or your aunt has them well papa if it excites you i will do without it it is for a charity chiefly mr pole fumbled in his pocket muttering no money here cheque book in town i'll give it you he said aloud to morrow morning morrow morning early that will do papa and adela relieved him immediately by shooting far away from the topic the ladies retired early to their hall of council in the bedchamber of arabella and some time after midnight cornelia went to her room but she could not sleep she affected in her restlessness to think that her spirits required an intellectual sedative so she went down to the library for a book where she skimmed many a fashion that may be recommended for assisting us to a sense of sovereign superiority to authors and also of serene contempt for all mental difficulties fortified in this way cornelia took a plutarch and an encyclopaedia under her arm to return to her room but one volume fell and as she stooped to recover it her candle shared its fate she had to find her way back in the dark on the landing of the stairs she fancied that she heard a step and a breath the lady was of unshaken nerves she moved on steadily her hand stretched out a little before her what it touched was long in travelling to her brain but when her paralyzed heart beat again she knew that her hand clasped another hand her nervous horror calmed as the feeling came to her of the palpable weakness of the hand who are you she asked some hoarse answer struck her ear she asked again making her voice distincter the hand now returned her pressure with force she could feel that the person whoever it was stood collecting strength to speak then the words came what do you mean by imitating that woman's brogue papa said cornelia why do you talk irish in the dark there goodnight i've just come up from the library my candle dropped i shouldn't have been frightened but you talked with such a twang but i have just come from the library myself said cornelia i mean from the dining room her father corrected himself hastily i can't sit in the library shall have it altered full of draughts don't you think so my dear good night what's this in your arm books ah you study i can get a light for myself the dialogue was sustained in the hard whispered tones prescribed by darkness cornelia kissed her father's forehead and they parted at breakfast in the morning it was the habit of all the ladies to assemble partly to countenance the decency of matin prayers and also to give the head of the household their dutiful society till business called him away adela in earlier days had maintained that early rising was not fashionable but she soon grasped the idea that a great rivalry with fashion in minor matters where the support of the satirist might be counted on was the proper policy of brookfield mrs chump was given to be extremely fashionable in her hours and began her brookfield career by coming downstairs at ten and eleven o'clock when she found a desolate table well stocked indeed but without any of the exuberant smiles of nourishment which a morning repast should wear you are a protestant ma'am are you not adela mildly questioned after informing her that she missed family prayer by her late descent mrs chump assured her that she was a firm protestant and liked to see faces at the breakfast table the poor woman was reduced to submit to the rigour of the hour coming down flustered and endeavouring to look devout while many uncertainties as to the condition of the hooks of her attire distracted her mind and fingers on one occasion gainsford the footman had been seen with his eye on her and while mr pole read of sacred things at a pace composed of slow march and amble this unhappy man was heard struggling to keep under and extinguish a devil of laughter by which his human weakness was shaken he retired from the room with the speed of a voyager about to pay tribute on high seas mr pole cast a pregnant look at the servants' row as he closed the book but the expression of his daughters' faces positively signified that no remark was to be made and he contained himself later the ladies told him that gainsford had done no worse than any uneducated man would have been guilty of doing mrs chump had it appeared a mother's feeling for one flat curl on her rugged forehead which was often fondly caressed by her for the sake of ascertaining its fixity doubts of the precision of outline and general welfare of this curl apparently caused her to straighten her back and furtively raise her head with an easy upward motion as of a cork alighted in water above the level of the looking glass on her left hand an action she repeated with a solemn aspect four times at which point gainsford gave way the ladies accorded him every extenuation for the offence they themselves but for the heroism of exalted natures must have succumbed to the gross temptation it is difficult dear papa to bring one's mind to religious thoughts in her company even when she is quiescent they said thus by the prettiest exercise of charity that can be conceived they pleaded for the man gainsford while they struck a blow at mrs chump and in performing one of the virtues laid down by religion proved their enemy to be hostile to its influences mrs chump was this morning very late the office of morning reader was new to mr pole who had undertaken it when first squire of brookfield at the dictate of the ladies his daughters so that waiting with the book before him and his audience expectant he lacked composure spoke irritably in an under breath of 'that woman' and asked twice whether she was coming or not at last the clump of her feet was heard approaching mr pole commenced reading the instant she opened the door she stood there with a face like a petrified irish outcry an imploring sound of pole pole issued from her then she caught up one hand to her mouth and rolled her head in evident anguish at the necessitated silence a convulsion passed along the row of maids two of whom dipped to their aprons but the ladies gazed with a sad consciousness of wicked glee at the disgust she was exciting in the bosom of their father will you shut the door mr pole sternly addressed mrs chump at the conclusion of the first prayer pole ye know that money ye gave me in notes i must speak pole shut the door mrs chump let go the door handle with a moan the door was closed by gainsford now one of the gravest of footmen a chair was placed for her and she sat down desperately watching the reader for the fall of his voice the period was singularly protracted the ladies turned to one another to question with an eyelid why it was that extra allowance was given that morning mr pole was in a third prayer stumbling on and picking himself up apparently unaware that he had passed the limit this continued until the series of ejaculations which accompanied him waxed hotter little muffled shrieks of oh deer oh lard when will he stop oh mercy och and me burrstin' to speak oh what'll i do i can't keep 't in pole ye're kill'n me oh deer i'll be sayin' somethin' to vex the prophets presently pole if it was a race that he ran with mrs chump mr pole was beaten he came to a sudden stop mrs chump had become too deeply absorbed in her impatience to notice the change in his tone and when he said now then to breakfast quick she was pursuing her lamentable interjections at sight of the servants trooping forth she jumped up and ran to the door ye don't go pole they're all here and i've been robbed i have avery note i had from ye pole all gone and my purse left behind like the skin of a thing lord forbid i accuse annybody but when i get up my first rush is to feel in my pocket and ask 'em if ye didn't keep me so poor pole they'd know i'm a generous woman but i cann't bear to be robbed and pinmoney 's for spendin' annybody'll tell you that and i ask ye t' examine 'em pole for last night i counted my notes wantin' change and i thought of a salmon i bought on the banks of the suir to make a present to chump which was our onnly visit to waterford together for he naver went t' ireland before or after dyin' as he did and it's not his ingrat'tude with his talk of a severrn salmon to the deuce with 'm that makes me soft poor fella i didn't mean to the deuce but since he's gone his widde's just unfit to bargain for a salmon at all and averybody robs her and she's kept poor and hatud d'ye heer pole i've lost my money my money and i will speak and ye shann't interrupt me during the delivery of this charge against the household mr pole had several times waved to the servants to begone but as they had always the option to misunderstand authoritative gestures they preferred remaining and possibly he perceived that they might claim to do so under accusation how can you bring this charge against the inmates of my house eh i guarantee the honesty of all who serve me martha you must be mad mad money why you never have money you waste it if you do not money pole oh and why becas ye keep me low o' purpose till i cringe like a slut o' the scullery and cry out for halfpence but oh that seventy five pounds in notes mr pole shook his head as one who deals with a gross delusion i remember nothing about it not about mrs chump dropped her chin ye don't remember the givin' of me just that sum of seventy five in eight notes pole eh i daresay i have given you the amount one time or other now let's be quiet about it yesterday mornin' pole and the night i go to bed i count my money and says i i'll not lock ut up for i'll onnly be unlockin' again to morrow and doin' a thing and undoin' ut's a sign of a brain that's addled like yours pole if ye say ye didn't go to give me the notes mr pole frowned at her sagaciously must change your diet martha my dite and what's my dite to do with my money who went into mrs chump's bedchamber this morning asked mr pole generally a pretty little housemaid replied with an indignant flush that she was the person mrs chump acknowledged to being awake when the shutters were opened and agreed that it was not possible her pockets could have been rifled then so you see martha you're talking nonsense said mr pole do you know the numbers of those notes the numbers at the sides ye mean pole ay the numbers at the sides if you like the and so on the oh i can't remember such a lot as that if ever i leave off repeatin' it there you see you're not fit to have money in your possession martha everybody who has bank notes looks at the numbers you have a trick of fancying all sorts of sums in your pocket and when you don't find them there of course they're lost now let's have some breakfast arabella told the maids to go out mr pole turned to the breakfast table rubbing his hands seeing herself and her case abandoned mrs chump gave a deplorable shout ye're crool and young women that look on at a fellow woman's mis'ry oh how can ye do ut but soft hearts can be the hardest and all my seventy five gone gone and no law out of annybody and no frightenin' of 'em off from doin' the like another time oh i will i will have my money tush come to breakfast martha said mr pole you shall have money if you want it you have only to ask now will you promise to be quiet and i'll give you this money the amount you've been dreaming about last night i'll fetch it now let us have no scenes dry your eyes mr pole went to his private room and returned just as mrs chump had got upon a succession of quieter sobs with each one of which she addressed a pathetic roll of her eyes to the utterly unsympathetic ladies respectively there martha there's exactly the sum for you free gift say thank you and eat a good breakfast to show your gratitude mind you take this money on condition that you let the servants know you made a mistake mrs chump sighed heavily crumpling the notes that the crisp sweet sound might solace her for the hard condition and don't dream any more not about money i mean said mr pole oh if i dream like that i'll be living double mrs chump put her hand to the notes and called him kind and pitied him for being the loser the sight of a fresh sum in her possession intoxicated her it was but feebly that she regretted the loss to her samuel bolton pole your memory's worth more than that she said as she filled her purse with the notes anyhow now i can treat somebody and she threw a wink of promise at adela adela's eyes took refuge with her papa who leaned over to her and said you won't mind waiting till you see me again she's taken all i had adela nodded blankly and the next moment with an angry glance toward mrs chump papa said she if you wish to see servants in the house on your return you must yourself speak to them and tell them that we their master and mistresses do not regard them as thieves out of this there came a quarrel as furious as the ladies would permit it to be for mrs chump though willing to condone the offence for the sum she had received stuck infamy upon the whole list of them the celtic nature murmured cornelia and the ladies maintained that their servants should be respected at any cost you ma'am said arabella with a clear look peculiar to her when vindictive you may have a stain on your character and you are not ruined by it but these poor creatures ye dare to compar' me contrast you ma'am it's just as imp'dent i say our servants ma'am oh to the deuce with your 'ma'am' i hate the word it's like fittin' a cap on me ye want to make one a turbaned dow'ger ye malicious young woman those are personages that are i believe accepted in society so the contest raged mrs chump being run clean through the soul twenty times without touching the consciousness of that sensitive essence mr pole appeared to take the part of his daughters and by and by mrs chump having failed to arouse mrs lupin's involuntary laugh which always consoled her in such cases huffed out of the room then mr pole in an abruptly serious way bashfully entreated the ladies to be civil to martha who had the best heart in the world it sounded as if he were going to say more after a pause he added emphatically do and went he was many days absent nor did he speak to adela of the money she had asked for when he returned adela had not the courage to allude to it chapter xvii emilia sat in her old place under the dwarf pine mr powys had brought her back to brookfield where she heard that wilfrid had been seen and now her heart was in contest with an inexplicable puzzle he was here and did not come to me since that night when they had walked home from ipley green she had not suffered a moment of longing her senses had lain as under a charm with heart at anchor and a mind free to work no one could have guessed that any human spell was on the girl wherever he is he thinks of me i find him everywhere he is safe for i pray for him and have my arms about him he will come so she waited as some grey lake lies full and smooth awaiting the star below the twilight if she let her thoughts run on to the hour of their meeting she had to shut her eyes and press at her heart but as yet she was not out of tune for daily life and she could imagine how that hour was to be strewn with new songs and hushed surprises and 'thus' he would look and 'thus' my hero breathed emilia shuddering a little but now she was perplexed now that he had come and gone she began to hunger bitterly for the sight of his face and that which had hitherto nourished her grew a sickly phantom of delight she wondered how she had forced herself to be patient and what it was that she had found pleasure in none of the ladies were at home when emilia returned she went out to the woods and sat shadowed by the long bent branch watching mechanically the slow rounding and yellowing of the beam of sunlight over the thick floor of moss up against the fir stems the chaffinch and the linnet flitted off the grey orchard twigs singing from new stations and the bee seemed to come questioning the silence of the woods and droning disappointed away the first excess of any sad feeling is half voluntary emilia could not help smiling when she lifted her head out of a musing fit to find that she had composed part of a minuet for the languid dancing motes in the shaft of golden light at her feet can i remember it she thought and forgot the incident with the effort down at her right hand bordering a water stood a sallow a dead tree channelled inside with the brown trail of a goat moth looking in this direction she saw cornelia advancing to the tree when the lady had reached it she drew a little book from her bosom kissed it and dropped it in the hollow this done she passed among the firs emilia had perceived that she was agitated and with that strange instinct of hearts beginning to stir which makes them divine at once where they will come upon the secret of their own sensations she ran down to the tree and peered on tiptoe at the embedded volume on a blank page stood pencilled this is the last fruit of the tree come not to gather more there was no meaning for her in that sentimental chord but she must have got some glimpse of a meaning for now as in an agony her lips fashioned the words if i forget his face i may as well die and she wandered on striving more and more vainly to call up his features the does he think of me and what am i to him such timorous little feather play of feminine emotion she knew nothing of in her heart was the strong flood of a passion she met edward buxley and freshfield sumner at a cross path on their way to brookfield and then adela joined the party which soon embraced mr barrett and subsequently cornelia all moved on in a humming leisure chattering by fits mr sumner was delicately prepared to encounter mrs chump whom said adela edward himself finds it impossible to caricature and she affected to laugh at the woman happy the pencil that can reproduce mr barrett exclaimed and meeting his smile cornelia said do you know my feeling is and i cannot at all account for it that if she were a catholic she would not seem so gross some of the poetry of that religion would descend upon her possibly returned mr barrett do you mean freshfield said quickly that she would stand a fair chance of being sainted out of this arose some polite fencing between the two freshfield might have argued to advantage in a court of law but he was no match on such topics and before such an audience for a refined sentimentalist more than once he betrayed a disposition to take refuge in his class he being son to one of the puisne judges cornelia speedily punished him and to any correction from her he bowed his head adela was this day gifted with an extraordinary insight emilia alone of the party was as a blot to her but the others she saw through as if they had been walking transparencies she divined that edward and freshfield had both come in concert upon amorous business that it was freshfield's object to help edward to a private interview with her and in return edward was to perform the same service for him with cornelia so that mr barrett was shockingly in the way of both and the perplexity of these stupid fellows who would insist upon wondering why the man barrett and the girl emilia musicians both both as it were vagrants did not walk together and talk of quavers and minims was extremely comic passing the withered tree mr barrett deserved thanks from freshfield if he did not obtain them for he lingered surrendering his place and then adela knew that the weight of edward buxley's remonstrative wrath had fallen on silent emilia to whom she clung fondly i have had a letter edward murmured in the voice that propitiates secresy a letter she cried loud and off flew the man like a rabbit into his hole the mask of him remaining emilia presently found mr barrett at her elbow his hand clasped the book cornelia had placed in the tree it is hers said emilia he opened it and pointed to his initials she looked in his face are you very ill adela turned round from edward's neighbouring head who is ill cornelia brought freshfield to a stop ill before them all book in hand mr barrett had to give assurance that he was hearty and to appear to think that his words were accepted in spite of blanched jowl and reddened under lid cornelia threw him one glance his eyes closed under it adela found it necessary to address some such comforting exclamation as 'goodness gracious' to her observant spirit in the park path leading to the wood arabella was seen as they came out the young branches that fringed the firs she hurried up i have been looking for you papa has arrived with sir twickenham pryme who dines with us adela unhesitatingly struck a blow lady pryme we make place for you and she crossed to cornelia cornelia kept her eyes fixed on adela's mouth as one looks at a place whence a venomous reptile has darted out her eyelids shut and she stood a white sculpture of pain pitiable to see emilia took her hand encouraging the tightening fingers with a responsive pressure the group shuffled awkwardly together though adela did her best she was very angry with mr barrett for wearing that absurdly pale aspect she was even angry with his miserable bankrupt face for mounting a muscular edition of the smile cornelia had shown his feelings she cried internally and the fact presented itself to her that feelings were a luxury utterly unfit for poor men who were to be accused of presumption for indulging in them now i suppose you are happy she spoke low between arabella and edward the effect of these words was to colour violently two pair of cheeks arabella's behaviour did not quite satisfy the fair critic edward buxley was simply caught in a trap he had the folly to imagine that by laughing he released himself is not that the laugh of an engaged said adela to freshfield he replied that would have been my idea under other conditions and looked meaningly she met the look with there are harsh conditions in life are there not and left him sufficiently occupied by his own sensations mr barrett she inquired partly to assist the wretch out of his compromising depression and also that the question represented a real matter of debate in her mind i want your opinion will you give it me apropos of slang why does it sit well on some people it certainly does not vulgarize them after all in many cases it is what they call 'racy idiom' perhaps our delicacy is strained now it was mr barrett's established manner to speak in a deliberately ready fashion upon the introduction of a new topic habit made him on this occasion respond instantly but the opening of the gates displayed the confusion of ideas within and the rageing tumult he said in many cases there are two sorts if you could call it the language of nature which anythingi beg your pardon slang polite society rightly excludes it because yes yes returned adela but do we do rightly in submitting to the absolute tyranny i mean i think originality flies from us in consequence the pitiable mortal became a trifle more luminous the objection is to the repetition of risked phrases a happy audacity of expression may pass it is bad taste to repeat it that is all then there is the slang of heavy boorishness and the slang of impatient wit is there any fine distinction between the extremes said cornelia in as clear a tone as she could summon i think observed arabella that whatever shows staleness speedily is self condemned and that is the case with slang and yet it's to avoid some feeling of the sort that people employ it was adela's remark and the discussion of this theme dropped lifelessly and they walked on as before coming to a halt near the garden gate adela tapped emilia's cheek addressing her how demure she has become ah went arabella does she know papa has had a letter from mr pericles who wrote from milan to say that he has made arrangements for her to enter the academy there and will come to fetch her in a few days emilia's wrists crossed below her neck while she gave ear to take me away she said the tragic attitude and outcry with the mournful flash of her eyes might have told emilia's tale adela unwillingly shielded her by interpreting the scene see she must be a born actress they always exaggerate in that style so that you would really think she had a mighty passion for brookfield or in it suggested freshfield or in it she laughed assentingly mr pole was perceived entering the garden rubbing his hands a little too obsequiously to some remark of the baronet's as the critical ladies imagined sir twickenham's arm spread out in a sweep mr pole's head nodded after the ceremony of the salute the ladies were informed of sir twickenham's observation sir twickenham pryme a statistical member of parliament a well preserved half century in age a gentleman in bearing passably grey headed his whiskers brushed out neatly as if he knew them individually and had the exact amount of them collectively at his fingers' ends sir twickenham had said of mr pole's infant park that if devoted to mangold wurzel it would be productive and would pay whereas now it was not ornamental and was waste sir twickenham calculates said mr pole that we should have a crop of eh the average sir twickenham asked on the evident upward mounting of a sum in his brain and then with a relaxing look upon cornelia perhaps you might have fifteen sixteen perhaps for the first year or say you see the exact acreage is unknown to me say roughly ten thousand sacks the first year of what inquired cornelia mangold wurzel said the baronet she gazed about her mr barrett was gone but no doubt you take no interest in such reckonings sir twickenham added on the contrary i take every interest in practical details practical men believe this when they hear it from the lips of gentlewomen and without philosophically analyzing the fact that it is because the practical quality possesses simply the fascination of a form of strength sir twickenham pursued his details day closed on brookfield blankly nevertheless the ladies felt that the situation was now dignified by tragic feeling and remembering keenly how they had been degraded of late they had a sad enjoyment of the situation etext editor's bookmarks emilia alone of the party was as a blot to her i cannot delay but i request you that are here privileged i detest anything that has to do with gratitude love with his accustomed cunning no nose to the hero no moral to the tale nor can a protest against coarseness be sweepingly interpreted one of those men whose characters are read off at a glance the majority however had been snatched out of this bliss their way was down a green lane and across long meadow paths they meantime who had a contempt for sleep women are wonderfully quick scholars under ridicule
