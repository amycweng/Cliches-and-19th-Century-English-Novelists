vii threats of a crisis in the government of brookfield and of the virtue resident in a tail coat viii in which a big drum speeds the march of emilia's history ix the rival clubs x the ladies of brookfield at school chapter i we are to make acquaintance with some serious damsels as this english generation knows them and at a season verging upon may the ladies of brookfield arabella cornelia and adela pole daughters of a flourishing city of london merchant had been told of a singular thing that in the neighbouring fir wood a voice was to be heard by night so wonderfully sweet and richly toned that it required their strong sense to correct strange imaginings concerning it adela was herself the chief witness to its unearthly sweetness and her testimony was confirmed by edward buxley whose ear had likewise taken in the notes though not on the same night as the pair publicly proved by dates both declared that the voice belonged to an opera singer or a spirit the ladies of brookfield declining the alternative perceived that this was a surprise furnished for their amusement by the latest celebrity of their circle mr pericles their father's business ally and fellow speculator mr pericles the greek the man who held millions of money as dust compared to a human voice fortified by this exquisite supposition their strong sense at once dismissed with scorn the idea of anything unearthly however divine being heard at night in the nineteenth century within sixteen miles of london city they agreed that mr pericles had hired some charming cantatrice to draw them into the woods and delightfully bewilder them it was to be expected of his princely nature they said the tinleys of bloxholme worshipped him for his wealth the ladies of brookfield assured their friends that the fact of his being a money maker was redeemed in their sight by his devotion to music music was now the art in the ascendant at brookfield the ladies for it is as well to know at once that they were not of that poor order of women who yield their admiration to a thing for its abstract virtue only the ladies were scaling society by the help of the arts to this laudable end sacrifices were now made to euterpe to assist them as mere daughters of a merchant they were compelled to make their house not simply attractive but enticing and seeing that they liked music it seemed a very agreeable device the tinleys of bloxholme still kept to dancing and had effectually driven away mr pericles from their gatherings for mr pericles said if that they will go 'so' i will be amused he presented a top like triangular appearance for one staggering second the tinleys did not go so' at all and consequently they lost the satirical man and were called 'the ballet dancers' by adela which thorny scoff her sisters permitted to pass about for a single day and no more the tinleys were their match at epithets and any low contention of this kind obscured for them the social summit they hoped to attain the dream whereof was their prime nourishment that the tinleys really were their match they acknowledged upon the admission of the despicable nature of the game the tinleys had winged a dreadful shaft at them not in itself to be dreaded but that it struck a weak point it was a common shot that exploded a magazine and for a time it quite upset their social policy causing them to act like simple young ladies who feel things and resent them the ladies of brookfield had let it be known that in their privacy together they were pole polar and north pole pole polar and north pole were designations of the three shades of distance which they could convey in a bow a form of salute they cherished as peculiarly their own being a method they had invented to rebuke the intrusiveness of the outer world and hold away all strangers until approved worthy even friends had occasionally to submit to it in a softened form arabella the eldest and adela the youngest alternated pole and polar but north pole was shared by cornelia with none she was the fairest of the three a nobly built person her eyes not vacant of tenderness when she put off her armour in her war panoply before unhappy strangers she was a britomart they bowed to an iceberg which replied to them with the freezing indifference of the floating colossus when the winter sun despatches a feeble greeting messenger beam from his miserable arctic wallet the simile must be accepted in its might for no lesser one will express the scornfulness toward men displayed by this strikingly well favoured formal lady whose heart of hearts demanded for her as spouse a lord a philosopher and a christian in one and he must be a member of parliament hence her isolated air now when the ladies of brookfield heard that their pole polar and north pole the splendid image of themselves had been transformed by the tinleys and defiled by them to pole polony and maypole they should have laughed contemptuously but the terrible nerve of ridicule quivered in witness against them and was not to be stilled they could not understand why so coarse a thing should affect them it stuck in their flesh it gave them the idea that they saw their features hideous but real in a magnifying mirror there was therefore a feud between the tinleys and the poles and when mr pericles entirely gave up the former the latter rewarded him by spreading abroad every possible kind interpretation of his atrocious bad manners he was a greek of parisian gilding whose parisian hat flew off at a moment's notice and whose savage snarl was heard at the slightest vexation his talk of renowned prime donne by their christian names and the way that he would catalogue emperors statesmen and noblemen known to him with familiar indifference as things below the musical art gave a distinguishing tone to brookfield from which his french accentuation of our tongue did not detract mr pericles grimaced bitterly at any claim to excellence being set up for the mysterious voice in the woods tapping one forefinger on the uplifted point of the other he observed that to sing abroad in the night air of an english spring month was conclusive of imbecility and that no imbecile sang at all because to sing involved the highest accomplishment of which the human spirit could boast did the ladies see he asked they thought they saw that he carried on a deception admirably in return they inquired whether he would come with them and hunt the voice saying that they would catch it for him i shall catch a cold for myself said mr pericles from the elevation of a shrug feeling that he was doomed to go forth he acted reluctance so well that the ladies affected a pretty imperiousness and when at last he consented to join the party they thanked him with a nicely simulated warmth believing that they had pleased him thoroughly their brother wilfrid was at brookfield six months earlier he had returned from india an invalided cornet of light cavalry with a reputation for military dash and the prospect of a medal then he was their heroic brother he was now their guard they love him tenderly and admired him when it was necessary but they had exhausted their own sensations concerning his deeds of arms and fancied that he had served their purpose and besides valour is not an intellectual quality they said they were ladies so aspiring these daughters of the merchant samuel bolton pole that if napoleon had been their brother their imaginations would have overtopped him after his six months' inaction in the tuileries they would by that time have made a stepping stone of the emperor 'mounting' was the title given to this proceeding they went on perpetually mounting it is still a good way from the head of the tallest of men to the stars so they had their work before them but as they observed they were young to be brief they were very ambitious damsels aiming at they knew not exactly what save that it was something so wide that it had not a name and so high in the air that no one could see it they knew assuredly that their circle did not please them so therefore they were constantly extending and refining it extending it perhaps for the purpose of refining it their susceptibilities demanded that they should escape from a city circle having no mother they ruled their father's house and him and were at least commanders of whatsoever forces they could summon for the task it may be seen that they were sentimentalists that is to say they supposed that they enjoyed exclusive possession of the nice feelings and exclusively comprehended the fine shades whereof more will be said but in the meantime it will explain their propensity to mount it will account for their irritation at the material obstructions surrounding them and possibly the philosopher will now have his eye on the source of that extraordinary sense of superiority to mankind which was the crown of their complacent brows eclipsed as they may be in the gross appreciation of the world by other people who excel in this and that accomplishment persons that nourish nice feelings and are intimate with the fine shades carry their own test of intrinsic value nor let the philosopher venture hastily to despise them as pipers to dilettante life such persons come to us in the order of civilization in their way they help to civilize us sentimentalists are a perfectly natural growth of a fat soil wealthy communities must engender them if with attentive minds we mark the origin of classes we shall discern that the nice feelings and the fine shades play a principal part in our human development and social history i dare not say that civilized man is to be studied with the eye of a naturalist but my vulgar meaning might almost be twisted to convey that our sentimentalists are a variety owing their existence to a certain prolonged term of comfortable feeding the pig it will be retorted passes likewise through this training he does but in him it is not combined with an indigestion of high german romances here is so notable a difference that he cannot possibly be said to be of the family and i maintain it against him who have nevertheless listened attentively to the eulogies pronounced by the vendors of prize bacon after thus stating to you the vast pretensions of the ladies of brookfield it would be unfair to sketch their portraits nothing but comedy bordering on burlesque could issue from the contrast though they graced a drawing room or a pew and had properly elegant habits and taste in dress and were all fair to the sight moreover adela had not long quitted school outwardly they were not unlike other young ladies with wits alert they were at the commencement of their labours on this night of the expedition when they were fated to meet something greatly confusing them chapter ii half of a rosy mounting full moon was on the verge of the east as the ladies with attendant cavaliers passed humming softly through the garden gates arabella had by right of birth made claim to mr pericles not without an unwontedly fretful remonstrance from cornelia who said my dear you must allow that i have some talent for drawing men out and arabella replied certainly dear you have and i think i have some too the gentle altercation lasted half an hour but they got no farther than this mr pericles was either hopeless of protecting himself from such shrewd assailants or indifferent to their attacks for all his defensive measures were against the cold he was muffled in a superbly mounted bearskin which came up so closely about his ears that arabella had to repeat to him all her questions and as it were force a way for her voice through the hide this was provoking since it not only stemmed the natural flow of conversation but prevented her imagination from decorating the reminiscence of it subsequently which was her profound secret pleasure besides letting in the outer world upon her take it as an axiom when you utter a sentimentalism that more than one pair of ears makes a cynical critic a sentimentalism requires secresy i can enjoy it and shall treat it respectfully if you will confide it to me alone but i and my friends must laugh at it outright does there not seem a soul in the moonlight for instance arabella after a rapturous glance at the rosy orb put it to mr pericles in subdued impressive tones she had to repeat her phrase mr pericles then echoing with provoking monotony of tone sol whereupon soul was reiterated somewhat sharply and mr pericles peering over the collar of the bear with half an eye continued the sentence in the manner of one sent thereby farther from its meaning ze moonlight despairing and exasperated arabella commenced afresh i said there seems a soul in it and mr pericles assented bluntly in ze light which sounded so little satisfactory that arabella explained i mean the aspect and having said three times distinctly what she meant in answer to a terrific glare from the unsubmerged whites of the eyes of mr pericles this was his comment almost roared forth sol you say so whole in ze moonlight luna hein ze aspect is of sol yez and mr pericles sank into his bear again while wilfrid pole who was swinging his long cavalry legs to rearward shouted and mr sumner a rising young barrister walking beside cornelia smiled a smile of extreme rigidity arabella was punished for claiming rights of birth she heard the murmuring course of the dialogue between cornelia and mr sumner sufficiently clear to tell her it was not fictitious and was well sustained while her heart was kept thirsting for the key to it in advance were adela and edward buxley who was only a rich alderman's only son but had the virtue of an extraordinary power of drawing caricatures and was therefore useful in exaggerating the features of disagreeable people and showing how odious they were besides endearing pleasant ones exhibiting how comic they could be gossips averred that before mr pole had been worried by his daughters into giving that mighty sum for brookfield arabella had accepted edward as her suitor but for some reason or other he had apparently fallen from his high estate to tell the truth arabella conceived that he had simply obeyed her wishes while he knew he was naughtily following his own and adela without introspection at all was making her virgin effort at the caricaturing of our sex in his person an art for which she promised well out of the long black shadows of the solitary trees of the park and through low yellow moonlight they passed suddenly into the muffed ways of the wood mr pericles was ineffably provoking he had come for gallantry's sake and was not to be rallied and would echo every question in a roar and there was no drawing of the man out at all he knocked against branches and tripped over stumps and ejaculated with energy but though he gave no heed or help to his fair associate she thought not the worse of him so heroic can women be toward any creature that will permit himself to be clothed by a mystery at times the party hung still fancying the voice aloft and then after listening to the unrelieved stillness they laughed and trod the stiff dry ferns and soft mosses once more at last they came to a decided halt when the proposition to return caused adela to come up to mr pericles and say to him now you must confess you have prohibited her from singing to night so that we may continue to be mystified i call this quite shameful of you and even as mr pericles was protesting that he was the most mystified of the company his neck lengthened and his head went round and his ear was turned to the sky while he breathed an elaborate ah and sure enough that was the voice of the woods cleaving the night air not distant a sleepy fire of early moonlight hung through the dusky fir branches the voice had the woods to itself and seemed to fill them and soar over them it was so full and rich so light and sweet and now to add to the marvel they heard a harp accompaniment the strings being faintly touched but with firm fingers a woman's voice on that could be no dispute tell me what opens heaven more flamingly to heart and mind than the voice of a woman pouring clear accordant notes to the blue night sky that grows light blue to the moon there was no flourish in her singing all the notes were firm and rounded and sovereignly distinct she seemed to have caught the ear of night and sang confident of her charm it was a grand old italian air requiring severity of tone and power now into great mournful hollows the voice sank steadfastly one soft sweep of the strings succeeded a deep final note and the hearers breathed freely stradella said the greek folding his arms the ladies were too deeply impressed to pursue their play with him real emotions at once set aside the semi credence they had given to their own suggestions hush she will sing again whispered adela it is the most delicious contralto murmurs of objection to the voice being characterized at all by any technical word or even for a human quality were heard let me find zis woman cried the prose enthusiast mr pericles imperiously with his bearskin thrown back on his shoulders and forth they stepped following him in the middle of the wood there was a sandy mound rising half the height of the lesser firs bounded by a green grown vallum where once an old woman hopelessly a witch had squatted and defied the authorities to make her budge nor could they accomplish the task before her witch soul had taken wing in the form of a black night bird often to be heard jarring above the spot lank dry weeds and nettles and great lumps of green and gray moss now stood on the poor old creature's place of habitation and the moon slanting through the fir clumps was scattered on the blossoms of twisted orchard trees gone wild again amid this desolation a dwarfed pine whose roots were partially bared as they grasped the broken bank that was its perch threw far out a cedar like hand in the shadow of it sat the fair singer a musing touch of her harp strings drew the intruders to the charmed circle though they could discern nothing save the glimmer of the instrument and one set of fingers caressing it how she viewed their rather impertinent advance toward her till they had ranged in a half circle nearer and nearer could not be guessed she did not seem abashed in any way for having preluded she threw herself into another song the charm was now more human though scarcely less powerful this was a different song from the last it was not the sculptured music of the old school but had the richness and fulness of passionate blood that marks the modern italian where there is much dallying with beauty in the thick of sweet anguish here at a certain passage of the song she gathered herself up and pitched a nervous note so shrewdly triumphing that as her voice sank to rest her hearers could not restrain a deep murmur of admiration then came an awkward moment the ladies did not wish to go and they were not justified in stopping they were anxious to speak and they could not choose the word to utter mr pericles relieved them by moving forward and doffing his hat at the same time begging excuse for the rudeness they were guilty of the fair singer answered with the quickness that showed a girl oh stay do stay if i please you a singular form of speech it was thought by the ladies she added i feel that i sing better when i have people to listen to me you find it more sympathetic do you not remarked cornelia i don't know responded the unknown with a very honest smile i like it she was evidently uneducated a professional whispered adela to arabella she wanted little invitation to exhibit her skill at all events for at a word the clear bold but finely nervous voice was pealing to a brisker measure that would have been joyous but for one fall it had coming unexpectedly without harshness and winding up the song in a ringing melancholy after a few bars had been sung mr pericles was seen tapping his forehead perplexedly the moment it ended he cried out in a tone of vexed apology for strange ignorance but i know not it it is italian yes i swear it is italian but who then it is superbe but i know not it it is mine said the young person your music miss i mean i composed it permit me to say brava the ladies instantly petitioned to have it sung to them again and whether or not they thought more of it or less now that the authorship was known to them they were louder in their applause which seemed to make the little person very happy you are sure it pleases you she exclaimed they were very sure it pleased them somehow the ladies were growing gracious toward her from having previously felt too humble it may be she was girlish in her manner and not imposing in her figure she would be a sweet mystery to talk about they thought but she had ceased to be quite the same mystery to them i would go on singing to you she said i could sing all night long but my people at the farm will not keep supper for me when it's late and i shall have to go hungry to bed if i wait have you far to go ventured adela only to wilson's farm about ten minutes' walk through the wood she answered unhesitatingly arabella wished to know whether she came frequently to this lovely spot when it does not rain every evening was the reply you feel that the place inspires you said cornelia i am obliged to come she explained the good old dame at the farm is ill and she says that music all day is enough for her and i must come here or i should get no chance of playing at all at night but surely you feel an inspiration in the place do you not cornelia persisted she looked at this lady as if she had got a hard word given her to crack and muttered i feel it quite warm here and i do begin to love the place the stately cornelia fell back a step the moon was now a silver ball on the edge of the circle of grey blue above the ring of firs and by the light falling on the strange little person as she stood out of the shadow to muffle up her harp it could be seen that she was simply clad and that her bonnet was not of the newest fashion the sisters remarked a boot lace hanging loose the peculiar black lustre of her hair and thickness of her long black eyebrows struck them likewise her harp being now comfortably mantled cornet wilfrid pole who had been watching her and balancing repeatedly on his forward foot made a stride and really could not allow her to carry it herself and begged her permission that he might assist her it's very heavy you know he added too heavy for me she said favouring him with a thankful smile i have some one who does that where is jim she called for jim and from the back of the sandy hillock where he had been reclining a broad shouldered rustic came lurching round to them now take my harp if you please and be as careful as possible of branches and don't stumble she uttered this as if she were giving jim his evening lesson and then with a sudden cry she laughed out oh but i haven't played you your tune and you must have your tune forthwith she stript the harp half bare and throwing a propitiatory bright glance at her audience on the other side of her she commenced thrumming a kind of giles scroggins native british beer begotten air while jim smeared his mouth and grinned as one who sees his love dragged into public view and is not the man to be ashamed of her though he hopes you will hardly put him to the trial this is his favourite tune that he taught me she emphasized to the company i play to him every night for a finish and then he takes care not to knock my poor harp to pieces and tumble about the gentlemen were amused by the giles scroggins air which she had delivered with a sufficient sense of its lumping fun and leg for leg jollity and they laughed and applauded but the ladies were silent after the performance until the moment came to thank her for the entertainment she had afforded them and then they broke into gentle smiles and trusted they might have the pleasure of hearing her another night oh just as often and as much as you like she said and first held her hand to arabella next to cornelia and then to adela she seemed to be hesitating before the gentlemen and when wilfrid raised his hat she was put to some confusion and bowed rather awkwardly and retired good night miss called mr pericles good night sir she answered from a little distance and they could see that she was there emboldened to drop a proper curtsey in accompaniment then the ladies stood together and talked of her not with absolute enthusiasm for was it not divine said adela and cornelia asked her if she meant the last piece and oh gracious not that adela exclaimed and then it was discovered how their common observation had fastened on the boot lace and this vagrant article became the key to certain speculations on her condition and character i wish i'd had a dozen bouquets that's all cried wilfrid she deserved them has she sentiment for what she sings or is it only faculty cornelia put it to mr sumner that gentleman faintly defended the stranger for the intrusion of the bumpkin tune she did it so well he said i complain that she did it too well uttered cornelia whose use of emphasis customarily implied that the argument remained with her talking in this manner and leisurely marching homeward they were startled to hear mr pericles who had wrapped himself impenetrably in the bear burst from his cogitation suddenly to cry out in his harshest foreign accent yeaz and thereupon he threw open the folds and laid out a forefinger and delivered himself i am made my mind i send her abroad to ze academie for one two tree year she shall be instructed as was not before zen a noise at la scala no paris no london she shall astonish london fairst yez if i take a theatre yez if i buy a newspaper yez if i pay feefty sossand pound his singular outlandish vehemence and the sweeping grandeur of a determination that lightly assumed the corruptibility of our press sent a smile circling among the ladies and gentlemen the youth who had wished to throw the fair unknown a dozen bouquets caught himself frowning at this brilliant prospect for her which was to give him his opportunity chapter iii the next morning there were many tra las and tum te turns over the family breakfast table a constant humming and crying i have it and after two or three bars baffled pauses and confusion of mind mr pericles was almost abusive at the impotent efforts of the sisters to revive in his memory that particular delicious melody the composition of the fair singer herself at last he grew so impatient as to arrest their opening notes and even to interrupt their unmusical consultations with no it is no use it is no use no no i say but instantly he would plunge his forehead into the palm of his hand and rub it red and work his eyebrows frightfully until tender humanity led the sisters to resume adela's i'm sure it began low down tum cornelia's the key note i am positive was b flat ta and arabella's putting of these two assertions together and promise to combine them at the piano when breakfast was at an end though it was sunday morning were exasperating to the exquisite lover of music mr pericles was really suffering torments do you know what it is to pursue the sylph and touch her flying skirts think you have caught her and are sure of her that she is yours the rapturous evanescent darling when some well meaning earthly wretch interposes and trips you and off she flies and leaves you floundering a lovely melody nearly grasped and lost in this fashion tries the temper apollo chasing daphne could have been barely polite to the wood nymphs in his path and mr pericles was rude to the daughters of his host smoothing his clean square chin and thick moustache hastily with outspread thumb and fingers he implored them to spare his nerves smiling rigidly he trusted they would be merciful to a sensitive ear mr pole who as an englishman could not understand anyone being so serious in the pursuit of a tune laughed and asked questions and almost drove mr pericles mad on a sudden the greek's sallow visage lightened it is to you it is to you he cried stretching his finger at wilfrid the young officer having apparently waited till he had finished with his knife and fork was leaning his cheek on his fist looking at nobody and quietly humming a part of the air mr pericles complimented and thanked him but you have ear for music extraordinaire he said adela patted her brother fondly remarking yes when his feelings are concerned will you repeat zat asked the greek 'to to ri' hein i lose it 'to to ru' bah i lose it 'to ri to ru ri ro' it is no use i lose it neither his persuasions nor his sneer because it is sunday perhaps would induce wilfrid to be guilty of another attempt the ladies tried sisterly cajoleries on him fruitlessly until mr pole seeing the desperation of his guest said why not have her up here toon and all some week day sunday birds won't suit us you know we've got a piano for her that's good enough for the first of 'em if money means anything the ladies murmured meekly yes papa i shall find her for you while you go to your charch said mr pericles and here wilfrid was seized with a yawn and rose and asked his eldest sister if she meant to attend the service that morning undoubtedly she answered and mr pole took it up that's our discipline my boy must set an example do our duty all the house goes to worship in the country why in ze country queried mr pericles because cornelia came to the rescue of her sire but her impetuosity was either unsupported by a reason or she stooped to fit one to the comprehension of the interrogator oh because do you know we have very select music at our church we have a highly paid organist added arabella recently elected said adela ah mon dieu mr pericles ejaculated some music sound well at afar mellow you say i prefer your charch music mellow won't you come cried wilfrid with wonderful briskness no mellow for me the greek's grinders flashed and wilfrid turned off from him sulkily he saw in fancy the robber greek prowling about wilson's farm setting snares for the marvellous night bird and it was with more than his customary inattention to his sisters' refined conversation that he formed part of their male escort to the place of worship mr pericles met the church goers on their return in one of the green bowery lanes leading up to brookfield cold as he was to english scenes and sentiments his alien ideas were not unimpressed by the picture of those daintily clad young women demurely stepping homeward while the air held a revel of skylarks and the scented hedgeways quickened with sunshine you have missed a treat arabella greeted him a sermon said he the ladies would not tell him until his complacent cynicism at the notion of his having missed a sermon spurred them to reveal that the organ had been handled in a masterly manner and that the voluntary played at the close of the service was most exquisite even papa was in raptures very good indeed said mr pole i'm no judge but you might listen to that sort of playing after dinner mr pericles seemed to think that was scarcely a critical period but he merely grimaced and inquired did you see ze player oh no they are hidden arabella explained to him behind a curtain but what shouted the impetuous greek have you no curiosity a woman and zen you saw not her no remarked cornelia in the same aggravating sing song voice of utter indifference we don't know whether it was not a man our usual organist is a man i believe the eyes of the greek whitened savagely and he relapsed into frigid politeness wilfrid was not present to point their apprehensions he had loitered behind but when he joined them in the house subsequently he was cheerful and had a look of triumph about him which made his sisters say so you have been with the copleys and he allowed them to suppose it if they pleased the copleys being young ladies of position in the neighbourhood of much higher standing than the tinleys who though very wealthy could not have given their brother such an air the sisters imagined at lunch wilfrid remarked carelessly by the way i met that little girl we saw last night the singer where asked his sisters with one voice coming out of church she goes to church then this exclamation showed the heathen they took her to be why she played the organ said wilfrid and how does she look by day how does she dress oh very jolly little woman dresses quiet enough she played the organ it was she then an organist is there anything approaching to gentility in her appearance i really i'm no judge said wilfrid you had better ask laura tinley she was talking to her when i went up the sisters exchanged looks presently they stood together in consultation then they spoke with their aunt mrs lupin and went to their papa the rapacity of those tinleys for anything extraordinary was known to them but they would not have conceived that their own discovery their own treasure could have been caught up so quickly if the tinleys got possession of her the defection of mr pericles might be counted on and the display of a phenomenon would be lost to them they decided to go down to wilson's farm that very day and forestall their rivals by having her up to brookfield the idea of doing this had been in a corner of their minds all the morning it seemed now the most sensible plan in the world it was patronage in its right sense and they might be of great service to her by giving a proper elevation and tone to her genius while she might amuse them and their guests and be let off in fact as a firework for the nonce among the queenly cases of women who are designing to become the heads of a circle if i may use the term an accurate admeasurement of reciprocal advantages can scarcely be expected to rank but the knowledge that an act depending upon us for execution is capable of benefiting both sides will make the proceeding appear so unselfish that its wisdom is overlooked as well as its motives the sisters felt they were the patronesses of the little obscure genius whom they longed for to illumine their household before they knew her name cornet wilfrid pole must have chuckled mightily to see them depart on their mission these ladies who managed everybody had themselves been very cleverly managed it is doubtful whether the scheme to surprise and delight mr pericles would have actuated the step they took but for the dread of seeing the rapacious tinleys snatch up their lawful prey the tinleys were known to be quite capable of doing so they had on a particular occasion made transparent overtures to a celebrity belonging to the poles whom they had first met at brookfield could never have hoped to have seen had they not met him at brookfield and girls who behaved in this way would do anything the resolution was taken to steal a march on them nor did it seem at all odd to people naturally so hospitable as the denizens of brookfield that the stranger of yesterday should be the guest of to day kindness of heart combined with a great scheme in the brain easily put aside conventional rules but we don't know her name they said when they had taken the advice of the gentlemen on what they had already decided to do all excepting mr pericles for whom the surprise was in store belloni miss belloni said wilfrid are you sure how do you know she told laura tinley within five minutes of the receipt of this intelligence the ladies were on their way to wilson's farm chapter iv the circle which the ladies of brookfield were designing to establish just now was of this receipt celebrities london residents and county notables all in their severally due proportions were to meet mix and revolve the celebrities to shine the metropolitans to act as satellites the county ignoramuses to feel flattered in knowing that all stood forth for their amusement they being the butts of the quick witted metropolitans whom they despised while the sons of renown were encouraged to be conscious of their magnanimous superiority over both sets for whose entertainment they were ticketed this is a pudding indeed and the contemplation of the skill and energy required to get together and compound such a brookfield pudding well nigh leads one to think the work that is done out of doors a very inferior business and as it were mere gathering of fuel for the fire inside it was known in the neighbourhood that the ladies were preparing one and moreover that they had a new kind of plum in other words that they intended to exhibit a prodigy of genius who would flow upon the world from brookfield to announce her with the invitations rejecting the idea of a surprise in the assembly had been necessary because there was no other way of securing lady gosstre who led the society of the district the great lady gave her promise to attend though as she said to arabella you must know i abominate musical parties and think them the most absurd of entertainments possible but if you have anything to show that's another matter two or three chosen friends were invited down beforehand to inspect the strange girl and say what they thought of her for the ladies themselves were perplexed they had found her to be commonplace a creature without ideas and with a decided appetite so when tracy runningbrook who had also been a plum in his day and was still a poet said that she was exquisitely comic they were induced to take the humorous view of the inexplicable side in the character of miss belloni and tried to laugh at her eccentricities seeing that mr pericles approved of her voice as a singer and tracy runningbrook let pass her behaviour as a girl they conceived that on the whole they were safe in sounding a trumpet loudly these gentlemen were connoisseurs each in his walk concerning her position and parentage nothing was known she had met adela's delicately searching touches in that direction with a marked reserve it was impossible to ask her point blank after probing her with a dozen suggestions for the ingenuousness of an indifferent inquiry could not then be assumed so that adela was constantly baked and felt that she must some day be excessively 'fond with her' which was annoying the girl lit up at any sign of affection a kind look gave summer depths to her dark eyes otherwise she maintained a simple discretion and walked in her own path content to look quietly pleased on everybody as one who had plenty to think of and a voice in her ear apparently she was not to be taught to understand 'limits' which must be explained as a sort of magnetic submissiveness to the variations of polar caprice so that she should move about with ease be cheerful friendly and at a signal affectionate still not failing to recognize the particular nooks where the family chalk had traced a line as the day of exhibition approached adela thought she would give her a lesson in limits she ventured to bestow a small caress on the girl after a compliment thinking that the compliment would be a check but the compliment was passed and the caress instantly replied to with two arms and a tender mouth at which adela took fright and was glad to slip away at last the pudding flowed into the bag emilia was posted by the ladies in a corner of the room receiving her assurance that she was not hungry they felt satisfied that she wanted nothing wilfrid came up to her to console her for her loneliness until mr pericles had stationed himself at the back of her chair and then wilfrid nodded languidly and attended to his graver duties who would have imagined that she had hurt him but she certainly looked with greater animation on mr pericles and when tracy runningbrook sat down by her a perfect little carol of chatter sprang up between them these two presented such a noticeable contrast side by side that the ladies had to send a message to separate them she was perhaps a little the taller of the two with smoothed hair that had the gloss of black briony leaves and eyes like burning brands in a cave while tracy's hair was red as blown flame with eyes of a grey green hue that may be seen glistening over wet sunset people who knew him asked who is she and it was not in the design of the ladies to have her noted just yet lady gosstre's exclamation on entering the room was presently heard well and where's our extraordinary genius pray let me see her immediately thereat laura tinley with gross ill breeding rushed up to arabella who was receiving her ladyship and touching her arm as if privileges were permitted her cried i'm dying to see her has she come arabella embraced the offensive girl in a hostess's smile and talked flowingly to the great lady laura tinley was punished by being requested to lead off with a favourite song in a buzz she acceded quite aware of the honour intended and sat at the piano taming as much as possible her pantomime of one that would be audible lady gosstre scanned the room while adela following her ladyship's eyeglass named the guests you get together a quaint set of men said lady gosstre women was on adela's tongue's tip she had really thought well of her men her heart sank in the country she began yes yes went my lady these were the lessons that made the ladies of brookfield put a check upon youth's tendency to feel delightful satisfaction with its immediate work and speedily conceive a discontented suspicion of anything whatsoever that served them two other sacrifices were offered at the piano after laura tinley poor victims of ambition they arranged their dresses smiled at the leaves and deliberately gave utterance to the dreadful nonsense of the laureates of our drawing rooms mr pericles and emilia exchanged scientific glances during the performance she was merciless to indifferent music wilfrid saw the glances pass so now when emilia was beckoned to the piano she passed by wilfrid and had a cold look in return for beaming eyes according to directions emilia sang a simple neapolitan air the singer was unknown and was generally taken for another sacrifice come that's rather pretty lady gosstre hailed the close it is of ze people such as zat assented mr pericles adela heard my lady ask for the singer's name she made her way to her sisters adela was ordinarily the promoter cornelia the sifter and arabella the director of schemes in this management the ladies had a moment for counsel over a music book for arabella was about to do duty at the piano during a pause mr pole lifting his white waistcoat with the effort sent a word abroad loudly and heartily regardless of its guardian aspirate like a bold faced hoyden flying from her chaperon they had dreaded it they loved their father but declined to think his grammar parental hushing together they agreed that it had been a false move to invite lady gosstre who did not care a bit for music until the success of their genius was assured by persons who did to suppose that she would recognize a genius failing a special introduction was absurd the ladies could turn upon aristocracy too when it suited them arabella had now to go through a quartett the fever of ill luck had seized the violin he would not tune then his string broke and while he was arranging it the footman came up to arabella misfortunes we know are the most united family on earth the news brought to her was that a lady of the name of mrs chump was below holding her features rigidly bound not to betray perturbation arabella confided the fact to cornelia who with a similar mental and muscular compression said instantly manoeuvre her adela remarked if you tell her the company is grand she will come and her irish once heard here will destroy us the very name of chump mrs chump was the wealthy irish widow of an alderman whose unaccountable bad taste in going to ireland for a wife yet filled the ladies with astonishment she pretended to be in difficulties with her lawyers for which reason she strove to be perpetually in consultation with her old flame and present trustee mr pole the ladies had fought against her in london and since their installation at brookfield they had announced to their father that she was not to be endured there mr pole had plaintively attempted to dilate on the virtues of martha chump in her place said the ladies and illustrated to him that amid a nosegay of flowers there was no fit room for an exuberant vegetable the old man had sighed and seemed to surrender one thing was certain mrs chump had never been seen at brookfield she never shall be save by the servants said the ladies emilia not unmarked of mr pericles had gone over to wilfrid once or twice to ask him if haply he disapproved of anything she had done mr pericles shrugged and went ah as who should say this must be stopped adela now came to her and caught her hand showering sweet whispers on her and bidding her go to her harp and do her best we love you we all love you was her parting instigation the quartett was abandoned arabella had departed with a firm countenance to combat mrs chump emilia sat by her harp the saloon was critically still so still that adela fancied she heard a faint irish protest from the parlour wilfrid was perhaps the most critical auditor present for he doubted whether she could renew that singular charm of her singing in the pale lighted woods the first smooth contralto notes took him captive he scarcely believed that this could be the raw girl whom his sisters delicately pitied a murmur of plaudits the low thunder of gathering acclamation went round lady gosstre looked a satisfied this will do wilfrid saw emilia's eyes appeal hopefully to mr pericles the connoisseur shrugged a pain lodged visibly on her black eyebrows she gripped her harp and her eyelids appeared to quiver as she took the notes again and still singing she turned her head to him the eyes of mr pericles were white as if upraised to intercede for her with the powers of harmony her voice grew unnerved on a sudden she excited herself to pitch and give volume to that note which had been the enchantment of the night in the woods it quavered one might have thought her caught by the throat emilia gazed at no one now she rose without a word or an apology keeping her eyes down fiasco cruelly cried mr pericles that was better to her than the silly kindness of the people who deemed it well to encourage her with applause emilia could not bear the clapping of hands and fled chapter v the night was warm under a slowly floating moon full of compassion for the poor girl who had moved him if she had failed in winning the assembly wilfrid stepped into the garden where he expected to find her and to be the first to pet and console her threading the scented shrubs he came upon a turn in one of the alleys from which point he had a view of her figure as she stood near a portugal laurel on the lawn mr pericles was by her side wilfrid's intention was to join them a loud sob from emilia checked his foot you are cruel he heard her say if it is good i tell it you if it is bad abominable i tell it you juste ze same responded mr pericles the others did not think it very bad ah bah mr pericles cut her short had they been talking of matters secret and too sweet wilfrid would have retired like a man of honour as it was he continued to listen the tears of his poor little friend moreover seemed to hold him there in the hope that he might afford some help yes i do not care for the others she resumed you praised me the night i first saw you it is perhaps zat you can sing to z' moon returned mr pericles but what a singer she must sing in a house to night it is warm to morrow it is cold if you sing through a cold what noise do we hear it is a nose not a voice it is a trompet emilia with a whimpering firmness replied you said i am lazy i am not not lazy mr pericles assented do i care for praise from people who do not understand music it is not true i only like to please them be a street organ mr pericles retorted i must like to see them pleased when i sing said emilia desperately and you like ze clap of ze hands yez it is quite natural yess you are a good child it is clear but look you are a voice uncultivated sauvage you go wrong i hear you and dese claps of zese noodels send you into squeaks and shrills and false false away you go it is a gallop ze wrong way here mr pericles attempted the most horrible reproduction of emilia's failure she cried out as if she had been bitten what am i to do she asked sadly not now mr pericles answered you live in london at where must i tell you certainly you must tell me but i am not going there i mean not yet you are going to sing to z' moon through z' nose yez for how long these ladies have asked me to stay with them they make me so happy when i leave them then emilia sighed and zen quoth mr pericles then while my money lasts i shall stay in the country how much money how much money have i emilia frankly and accurately summed up the condition of her treasury four pounds and nineteen shillings hom it is spent and you go to your father again yes to ze old belloni my father no cried mr pericles upon emilia's melancholy utterance he bent to her ear and rapidly spoke in an undertone what seemed to be a vivid sketch of a new course of fortune for her emilia gave one joyful outcry and now wilfrid retreated questioning within himself whether he should have remained so long but as he argued if he was convinced that the rascally greek fellow meant mischief to her was he not bound to employ every stratagem to be her safeguard the influence of mr pericles already exercised over her was immense and mysterious within ten minutes she was singing triumphantly indoors wilfrid could hear that her voice was firm and assured she was singing the song of the woods he found to his surprise that his heart dropped under some burden as if he had no longer force to sustain it by and by some of the members of the company issued forth carriages were heard on the gravel and young men in couples preparing to light the ensign of happy release from the ladies or of indemnification for their absence if you please strolled about the grounds did you see that little passage between laura tinley and bella pole said one and forthwith mimicked them laura commencing 'we must have her over to us' 'i fear we have pre engaged her' 'oh but you dear will do us the favour to come too' 'i fear dear our immediate engagements will preclude the possibility' 'surely dear miss pole we may hope that you have not abandoned us' 'that my dear miss tinley is out of the question' 'may we not name a day' 'if it depends upon us frankly we cannot bid you do so' the other joined him in laughter adding 'frankly' 's capital what absurd creatures women are how the deuce did you manage to remember it all my sister was at my elbow she repeated it word for word pon my honour women are wonderful creatures the two young men continued their remarks with a sense of perfect consistency lady gosstre as she was being conducted to her carriage had pronounced aloud that emilia was decidedly worth hearing she's better worth knowing said tracy runningbrook i see you are all bent on spoiling her if you were to sit and talk with her you would perceive that she's meant for more than to make a machine of her throat what a throat it is she has the most comical notion of things i fancy i'm looking at the budding of my own brain she's a born artist but i'm afraid everybody's conspiring to ruin her surely said adela we shall not do that if we encourage her in her art he means another kind of art said lady gosstre the term 'artist' applied to our sex signifies 'frenchwoman' with him he does not allow us to be anything but women as artists then we are largely privileged i assure you are we placed under a professor to learn the art adela inquired pleased with the subject under such high patronage each new experience is your accomplished professor said tracy one i'll call cleopatra a professor she's but an illustrious example imp you are corrupt with which my lady tapped farewell on his shoulder leaning from the carriage window she said i suppose i shall see you at richford merthyr powys is coming this week and that reminds me he would be the man to appreciate your 'born artist' bring her to me we will have a dinner i will despatch a formal invitation to morrow the season's bad out of town for getting decent people to meet you i will do my best she bowed to adela and tracy mr pole who had hovered around the unfamiliar dialogue to attend the great lady to the door here came in for a recognition and bowed obsequiously to the back of the carriage arabella did not tell her sisters what weapons she had employed to effect the rout of mrs chump she gravely remarked that the woman had consented to go and her sisters thanked her they were mystified by laura's non recognition of emilia and only suspected wilfrid so faintly that they were able to think they did not suspect him at all on the whole the evening had been a success it justified the ladies in repeating a well known brookfield phrase we may be wrong in many things but never in our judgement of the merits of any given person in the case of tracy runningbrook they had furnished a signal instance of their discernment him they had met at the house of a friend of the tinleys a colonel's wife distantly connected with great houses the tinleys laughed at his flaming head and him but the ladies of brookfield had ears and eyes for a certain tone and style about him before they learnt that he was of the blood of dukes and would be a famous poet when this was mentioned after his departure they had made him theirs and the tinleys had no chance through tracy they achieved their introduction to lady gosstre and now they were to dine with her they did not say that this was through emilia in fact they felt a little that they had this evening been a sort of background to their prodigy which was not in the design having observed she sang deliciously they dismissed her and referred to dresses gaucheries of members of the company pretensions here and there lady gosstre's walk the way to shuffle men and women how to start themes for them to converse upon and so forth not juno and her court surveying our mortal requirements in divine independence of fatigue could have been more considerate for the shortcomings of humanity and while they were legislating this and that for others they still accepted hints for their own improvement as those who have perfection in view may do lady gosstre's carriage of her shoulders and general manner were admitted to be worthy of study and did you notice when laura tinley interrupted her conversation with tracy runningbrook how quietly she replied to the fact and nothing else so that laura had not another word and did you observe her deference to papa as host and did you not see on more than one occasion with what consummate ease she would turn a current of dialogue when it had gone far enough they had all noticed seen and observed they agreed that there was a quality beyond art beyond genius beyond any special cleverness and that was the great social quality of taking as by nature without assumption a queenly position in a circle and making harmony of all the instruments to be found in it high praise of lady gosstre ensued the ladies of brookfield allowed themselves to bow to her with the greater humility owing to the secret sense they nursed of overtopping her still in that ineffable something which they alone possessed a casket little people will be wise in not hurrying our father time to open for them if they would continue to enjoy the jewel they suppose it to contain finally these energetic young ladies said their prayers by the morning twitter of the birds and went to their beds less from a desire for rest than because custom demanded it three days later emilia was a resident in the house receiving lessons in demeanour from cornelia and in horsemanship from wilfrid she expressed no gratitude for kindnesses or wonder at the change in her fortune save that pleasure sat like an inextinguishable light on her face a splendid new harp arrived one day ticketed for miss emilia belloni he does not know i have a second christian name was her first remark after an examination of the instrument 'he' quoth adela may it not have been a lady's gift emilia clearly thought not and to whom do you ascribe it who sent it to me mr pericles of course she touched the strings immediately and sighed are you discontented with the tone child asked adela no i i'll guess what it cost surely the ladies had reason to think her commonplace she explained herself better to wilfrid when he returned to brookfield after a short absence showing the harp see what mr pericles thinks me worth she said not more than that was his gallant rejoinder does it suit you yes in every way this was all she said about it in the morning after breakfast she sat at harp or piano and then ran out to gather wild flowers and learn the names of trees and birds on almost all occasions wilfrid was her companion he laughed at the little sisterly revelations the ladies confided concerning her too heartily for them to have any fear that she was other than a toy to him few women are aware with how much ease sentimental men can laugh outwardly at what is internal torment they had apprised him of their wish to know what her origin was and of her peculiar reserve on that topic whereat he assured them that she would have no secrets from him his conduct of affairs was so open that none could have supposed the gallant cornet entangled in a maze of sentiment for veritably this girl was the last sort of girl to please his fancy and he saw not a little of fair ladies by virtue of his heroic antecedents he was himself well seen of them the gallant cornet adored delicacy and a gilded refinement the female flower could not be too exquisitely cultivated to satisfy him and here he was running after a little unformed girl who had no care to conceal the fact that she was an animal nor any notion of the necessity for doing so he had good reason to laugh when his sisters talked of her it was not a pleasant note which came from the gallant cornet then but in the meadows or kindly conducting emilia's horse he yielded pretty music emilia wore arabella's riding habit adela's hat and cornelia's gloves politic as the ladies of brookfield were they were full of natural kindness and wilfrid albeit a diplomatist was not yet mature enough to control and guide a very sentimental heart there was an element of dim imagination in all the family and it was this that consciously elevated them over the world in prospect and made them unconsciously subject to what i must call the spell of the poetic power wilfrid in his soul wished that emilia should date from the day she had entered brookfield but at times it seemed to him that a knowledge of her antecedents might relieve him from his ridiculous perplexity of feeling besides though her voice struck emotion she herself was unimpressionable cold by nature he said looking at the unkindled fire she shook hands like a boy if her fingers were touched and retained they continued to be fingers for as long as you pleased murmurs and whispers passed by her like the breeze she appeared also to have no enthusiasm for her art so that not even there could wilfrid find common ground italy however he discovered to be the subject that made her light up of italy he would speak frequently and with much simulated fervour mr pericles is going to take me there said emilia he told me to keep it secret i have no secrets from my friends i am to learn in the academy at milan would you not rather let me take you not quite she shook her head no because you do not understand music as he does and are you as rich i cost a great deal of money even for eating alone but you will be glad when you hear me when i come back do you hear that nightingale it must be a nightingale she listened what things he makes us feel bending her head she walked on silently wilfrid he knew not why had got a sudden hunger for all the days of her life he caught her hand and drawing her to a garden seat said come now tell me all about yourself before i knew you do you mind i'll tell you anything you want to hear said emilia he enjoined her to begin from the beginning everything about myself she asked everything i have your permission to smoke emilia smiled i wish i had some italian cigars to give you my father sometimes has plenty given to him wilfrid did not contemplate his havannah with less favour now said emilia taking a last sniff of the flowers before surrendering her nostril to the invading smoke she looked at the scene fronting her under a blue sky with slow flocks of clouds how i like this she exclaimed i almost forget that i long for italy here beyond a plot of flowers a gold green meadow dipped to a ridge of gorse bordered by dark firs and the tips of greenest larches chapter vi my father is one of the most wonderful men in the whole world wilfrid lifted an eyelid he is one of the first violins at the italian opera the gallant cornet's critical appreciation of this impressive announcement was expressed in a spiral ebullition of smoke from his mouth he is such a proud man and i don't wonder at that he has reason to be proud again wilfrid lifted an eyelid and there is no knowing but that ideas of a connection with foreign counts cardinals and princes passed hopefully through him would you believe that he is really the own nephew of andronizetti deuce he is said wilfrid in a mist which one the composer wilfrid emitted more smoke who composed how i love him that lovely la la la la and the te de ta da te dio that pleases you out of il maladetto and i am descended from him let me hope i shall not be unworthy of him you will never tell it till people think as much of me or nearly my father says i shall never be so great because i am half english it's not my fault my mother was english but i feel that i am much more italian than english how i long for italy like a thing underground my father did something against the austrians when he was a young man would not i have done it i am sure i would i don't know what whenever i think of italy night or day pant pant goes my heart the name of italy is my nightingale i feel that somebody lives that i love and is ill treated shamefully crying out to me for help my father had to run away to save his life he was fifteen days lying in the rice fields to escape from the soldiers which makes me hate a white coat there was my father and at night he used to steal out to one of the villages where was a good true woman so they are most in italy she gave him food maize bread and wine sometimes meat sometimes a bottle of good wine when my father thinks of it he cries if there is gin smelling near him at last my father had to stop there day and night then that good woman's daughter came to him to keep him from starving she risked being stripped naked and beaten with rods to keep my father from starving when my father speaks of sandra now it makes my mother she does not like it i am named after her emilia alessandra belloni 'sandra' is short for it she did not know why i was christened that and will never call me anything but emilia though my father says sandra always my father never speaks of that dear sandra herself except when he is tipsy once i used to wish him to be tipsy for then i used to sit at my piano while he talked and i made all his words go into music one night i did it so well my father jumped right up from his chair shouting italia and he caught his wig off his head and threw it into the fire and rushed out into the street quite bald and people thought him mad it was the beginning of all our misfortunes my father was taken and locked up in a place as a tipsy man that he has never forgiven the english for it has made me and my mother miserable ever since my mother is sure it is all since that night do you know i remember though i was so young that i felt the music oh like a devil in my bosom perhaps it was and it passed out of me into him do you think it was wilfrid answered well no i shouldn't think you had anything to do with the devil indeed he was beginning to think her one of the smallest of frocked female essences i lost my piano through it she went on i could not practise i was the most miserable creature in all the world till i fell in love with my harp my father would not play to get money he sat in his chair and only spoke to ask about meal time and we had no money for food except by selling everything we had then my piano went so then i said to my mother i will advertize to give lessons as other people do and make money for us all myself so we paid money for a brass plate and our landlady's kind son put it up on the door for nothing and we waited for pupils to come i used to pray to the virgin that she would blessedly send me pupils for my poor mother's complaints were so shrill and out of tune it's impossible to tell you what i suffered but by and by my father saw the brass plate he fell into one of his dreadful passions we had to buy him another wig his passions were so expensive my mother used to say there goes our poor dinner out of the window but well he went to get employment now he can always when he pleases for such a touch on the violin as my father has you never heard you feel yourself from top to toe when my father plays i feel as if i breathed music like air one day came news from italy all in the newspaper of my father's friends and old companions shot and murdered by the austrians he read it in the evening after we had a quiet day i thought he did not mind it much for he read it out to us quite quietly and then he made me sit on his knee and read it out i cried with rage and he called to me 'sandra peace' and began walking up and down the room while my mother got the bread and cheese and spread it on the table for we were beginning to be richer i saw my father take out his violin he put it on the cloth and looked at it then he took it up and laid his chin on it like a man full of love and drew the bow across just once he whirled away the bow and knocked down our candle and in the darkness i heard something snap and break with a hollow sound when i could see he had broken it the neck from the body the dear old violin i could cry still i i was too late to save it i saw it broken and the empty belly and the loose strings it was murdering a spirit that was my father sat in a corner one whole week moping like such an old man i was nearly dead with my mother's voice by and by we were all silent for there was nothing to eat so i said to my mother i will earn money my mother cried i proposed to take a lodging for myself all by myself go there in the morning and return at night and give lessons and get money for them my landlady's good son gave me the brass plate again emilia alessandra belloni i was glad to see my name i got two pupils very quickly one an old lady and one a young one the old lady i mean she was not grey wanted a gentleman to marry her and the landlady told me i mean my pupil it makes me laugh asked him what he thought of her voice for i had been singing i earned a great deal of money two pounds ten shillings a week i could afford to pay for lessons myself i thought what an expense i had to pay ten shillings for one lesson some have to pay twenty but i would pay it to learn from the best masters and i had to make my father and mother live on potatoes and myself too of course if you buy potatoes carefully they are extremely cheap things to live upon and make you forget your hunger more than anything else i suppose added emilia you have never lived upon potatoes entirely oh no wilfrid gave a quiet negative but i was pining to learn and was obliged to keep them low i could pitch any notes and i was clear but i was always ornamenting and what i want is to be an accurate singer my music master was a german not an austrian oh no i'm sure he was not at least i don't think so for i liked him he was harsh with me but sometimes he did stretch his fingers on my head and turn it round and say words that i pretended not to think of though they sent me home burning i began to compose and this gentleman tore up the whole sheet in a rage when i showed it him but he gave me a dinner and left off charging me ten shillings only seven and then five and he gave me more time than he gave others he also did something which i don't know yet whether i can thank him for he made me know the music of the great german i used to listen i could not believe such music could come from a german he followed me about telling me i was his slave for some time i could not sleep i laughed at myself for composing he was not an austrian but when he was alive he lived in vienna the capital of austria he ate austrian bread and why god gave him such a soul of music i never can think well by and by my father wanted to know what i did in the day and why they never had anything but potatoes for dinner my mother came to me and i told her to say i took walks my father said i was an idle girl and like my mother who was a slave to work people are often unjust so my father said he would watch me i had to cross the park to give a lesson to a lady who had a husband and she wanted to sing to him to keep him at home in the evening i used to pray he might not have much ear for music one day a gentleman came behind me in the park he showed me a handkerchief and asked me if it was mine i felt for my own and found it in my pocket he was certain i had dropped it he looked in the corners for the name i told him my name emilia alessandra belloni he found afg there it was a beautiful cambric handkerchief white and smooth i told him it must be a gentleman's as it was so large but he said he had picked it up close by me and he could not take it and i must and i was obliged to keep it though i would much rather not near the end of the park he left me at this point wilfrid roused up you met him the next day near the same place he remarked she turned to him with astonishment on her features how did you know that how could you know sort of thing that generally happens said wilfrid yes he was there emilia slowly pursued controlling her inclination to question further he had forgotten about the handkerchief for when i saw him i fancied he might have found the owner we talked together he told me he was in the army and i spoke of my father's playing and my singing he was so fond of music that i promised him he should hear us both he used to examine my hand and said they were sensitive fingers for playing i knew that he had great hopes of me he said he would give me a box at the opera now and then i was mad with joy and so delighted to have made a friend i had never before made a rich friend i sang to him in the park his eyes looked beautiful with pleasure i know i enchanted him how old were you then inquired wilfrid sixteen i can sing better now i know but i had voice then and he felt that i had i forgot where we were till people stood round us and he hurried me away from them and said i must sing to him in some quiet place i promised to and he promised he would have dinner for me at richmond hill in the country and he would bring friends to hear me go on said wilfrid rather sharply she sighed i only saw him once after that it was such a miserable day it rained it was saturday i did not expect to find him in the rain but there he stood exactly where he had given me the handkerchief he smiled kindly as i came up i dislike gloomy people his face was always fresh and nice his moustache reminded me of italy i used to think of him under a great warm sky with olives and vine trees and mulberries like my father used to speak of i could have flung my arms about his neck did you the cornet gave a strangled note oh no said emilia seriously but i told him how happy the thought of going into the country made me and that it was almost like going to italy he told me he would take me to italy if i liked i could have knelt at his feet unfortunately his friends could not come still i was to go and dine and float on the water plucking flowers i determined to fancy myself in venice which is the place my husband must take me to when i am married to him i will give him my whole body and soul for his love when i am there here the cornet was capable of articulate music for a moment but it resolved itself into well well yes go on i took his arm this time it gave me my first timid feeling that i remember and he laughed at me and drove it quite away telling me his name augustus frederick what was it augustus frederick it began with g something o me have i really forgotten christian names are always easier to remember a captain he was a riding one just like you i think you are all kind extremely muttered the ironical cornet afg those are the initials on the handkerchief they are cried emilia it must have been his own handkerchief you have achieved the discovery quoth wilfrid he dropped it there overnight and found it just as you were passing in the morning that must be impossible said emilia and dismissed the subject forthwith in a feminine power of resolve to be blind to it i am afraid she took up her narrative my father is sometimes really almost mad he does such things i had walked under this gentleman's umbrella to the bridge between the park and the gardens with the sheep and beautiful flowers in beds in an instant my father came up right in our faces he caught hold of my left hand i thought he wanted to shake it for he imitates english ways at times even with us at home and shakes our hands when he comes in but he swung me round he stood looking angrily at this gentleman and cried 'yes yes' to every word he spoke the gentleman bowed to me and asked me to take his umbrella but i was afraid to and my father came to me oh madonna think of what he did i saw that his pockets were very big he snatched out potatoes and began throwing them as hard as he could throw them at the gentleman and struck him with some of them he threw nine large potatoes i begged him to think of our dinner but he cried yes it is our dinner we give to your head vagabond in his english i could not help running up to the gentleman to beg for his pardon he told me not to cry and put some potatoes he had been picking up all into my hand they were muddy but he wiped them first and he said it was not the first time he had stood fire and then said good bye and i slipped the potatoes into my pocket immediately thankful that they were not wasted my father pulled me away roughly from the laughing and staring people on the bridge but i knew the potatoes were only bruised even three potatoes will prevent you from starving they were very fine ones for i always took care to buy them good when i reached home wilfrid had risen and was yawning with a desperate grimace he bade her continue and pitched back heavily into his seat when i reached home and could be alone with my mother she told me my father had been out watching me the day before and that he had filled his pockets that morning she thought he was going to walk out in the country and get people on the road to cook them for him that is what he has done when he was miserable to make himself quite miserable i think for he loves streets best guess my surprise my mother was making my head ache with her complaints when as i drew out the potatoes to show her we had some food there was a purse at the bottom of my pocket a beautiful green purse o that kind gentleman he must have put it in my hand with the potatoes that my father flung at him how i have cried to think that i may never sing to him my best to please him my mother and i opened the purse eagerly it had ten pounds in paper money and five sovereigns and silver i think four shillings we determined to keep it a secret and then we thought of the best way of spending it and decided not to spend it all but to keep some for when we wanted it dreadfully and for a lesson or two for me now and then and a music score and perhaps a good violin for my father and new strings for him and me and meat dinners now and then and perhaps a day in the country for that was always one of my dreams as i watched the clouds flying over london they seemed to be always coming from happy places and going to happy places never stopping where i was i cannot be sorrowful long you know that song of mine that you like so much my own composing it was a song about that kind gentleman i got words to suit it as well as i could from a penny paper but they don't mean anything that i mean and they are only words she did not appear to hear the gallant cornet's denial that he cared particularly for that song what i meant was that gentleman speaks i have fought for italy i am an english hero and have fought for italy because of an italian child but now i am wounded and a prisoner when you shoot me cruel austrians i shall hear her voice and think of nothing else so you cannot hurt me emilia turned spitefully on herself at this close how i spoil it my words are always stupid when i feel well now my mother and i were quite peaceful and my father was better fed one night he brought home a jew gentleman beautifully dressed with diamonds all over him he sparkled like the christmas cakes in pastry cooks windows i sang to him and he made quite a noise about me but the man made me so uncomfortable touching my shoulders and i could not bear his hands even when he was praising me i sang to him till the landlady made me leave off because of the other lodgers who wanted to sleep he came every evening and then said i should sing at a concert it turned out to be a public house and my father would not let me go but i was sorry for in public the man could not touch me as he did it damped the voice i should like to know where that fellow lives cried the cornet i don't know i'm sure she said he lends money do you want any i heard your sisters say something one day you can always have all that i have you know a quick spirit of pity and honest kindness went through wilfrid's veins and threatened to play the woman with his eyes for a moment he took her hand and pressed it she put her lips to his fingers once she continued when the jew gentleman had left i spoke to my father of his way with me and then my father took me on his knee and the things he told me of what that man felt for me made my mother come and tear me away to bed i was obliged to submit to the jew gentleman patting and touching me always he used to crush my dreams afterwards i know my voice was going my father was so eager for me to please him i did my best but i felt dull and used to sit and shake my head at my harp crying or else i felt like an angry animal and could have torn the strings think how astonished i was when my mother came to me to say my father had money in his pockets one pound seventeen shillings she counted and he had not been playing then he brought home a new violin and he said to me 'i shall go i shall play i am orphee and dinners shall rise' i was glad and kissed him and he said 'this is sandra's gift to me' showing the violin i only knew what that meant two days afterwards is a girl not seventeen fit to be married with this abrupt and singular question she had taken an indignant figure and her eyes were fiery so that wilfrid thought her much fitter than a minute before married she exclaimed my mother told me about that you do not belong to yourself you are tied down you are a slave a drudge mustn't dream mustn't think i hate it by and by i suppose it will happen not yet and yet that man offered to take me to italy it was the jew gentleman he said i should make money if he took me and grow as rich as princesses he brought a friend to hear me another jew gentleman and he was delighted and he met me near our door the very next morning and offered me a ring with blue stones and he proposed to marry me also and take me to italy if i would give up his friend and choose him instead this man did not touch me and do you know for some time i really thought i almost very nearly might if it had not been for his face it was impossible to go to italy yes to go to heaven through that face of his that face of his was just like the pictures of dancing men with animals' hairy legs and hoofs in an old thick poetry book belonging to my mother just fancy a nose that seemed to be pecking at great fat red lips he met me and pressed me to go continually till all of a sudden up came the first jew gentleman and he cried out quite loud in the street that he was being robbed by the other and they stood and made a noise in the street and i ran away but then i heard that my father had borrowed money from the one who came first and that his violin came from that man and my father told me the violin would be taken from him and he would have to go to prison if i did not marry that man i went and cried in my mother's arms i shall never forget her kindness for though she could never see anybody crying without crying herself she did not and was quiet as a mouse because she knew how her voice hurt me there's a large print shop in one of the great streets of london with coloured views of italy i used to go there once and stand there for i don't know how long looking at them and trying to get those jew gentlemen call them jews they're not gentlemen interposed wilfrid jews she obeyed the dictate out of my mind when i saw the views of italy they danced and grinned up and down the pictures oh horrible there was no singing for me then my music died at last that oldish lady gave up her lessons and said to me 'you little rogue you will do what i do some day' for she was going to be married to that young man who thought her voice so much improved and she paid me three pounds and gave me one pound more and some ribbons and gloves i went at once to my mother and made her give me five pounds out of the gentleman's purse i took my harp and music scores i did not know where i was going but only that i could not stop my mother cried but she helped to pack my things if she disobeys me i act my father and tower over her and frown and make her mild she was such a poor good slave to me that day but i trusted her no farther than the door there i kissed her full of love and reached the railway they asked me where i was going and named places to me i did not know one i shut my eyes and prayed to be directed and chose hillford in the train i was full of music in a moment there i met farmer wilson of the farm near us where your sisters found me and he was kind and asked me about myself and i mentioned lodgings and that i longed for woods and meadows just as we were getting out of the train he said i was to come with him and i did very gladly then i met you and i am here all because i prayed to be directed i do think that emilia clasped her hands and looked pensively at the horizon sky with a face of calm gratefulness the cornet was on his legs so he said and you never saw anything more of that fellow you kissed in the park kissed that gentleman returned emilia i have not kissed him he did not want it men kiss us when we are happy and we kiss them when they are unhappy wilfrid was perhaps incompetent to test the truth of this profound aphoristic remark delivered with the simplicity of natural conviction the narrative had to his thinking quite released from him his temporary subjection to this little lady's sway all that he felt for her personally now was pity it speaks something for the strength of the sentiment with which he had first conceived her that it was not pelted to death and turned to infinite disgust by her potatoes for sentiment is a dainty delicate thing incapable of bearing much revengeful too when it is outraged bruised and disfigured it stood up still and fought against them they were very fine ones as emilia said and they hit him hard however he pitied her and that protected him like a shield he told his sisters a tale of his own concerning the strange damsel humorously enough to make them see that he enjoyed her presence as that of no common oddity chapter vii while emilia was giving wilfrid her history in the garden the ladies of brookfield were holding consultation over a matter which was well calculated to perplex and irritate them excessively mr pole had received a curious short epistle from mrs chump informing him of the atrocious treatment she had met with at the hands of his daughter and instead of reviewing the orthography incoherence and deliberate vulgarity of the said piece of writing with the contempt it deserved he had taken the unwonted course of telling arabella that she had done a thing she must necessarily repent of or in any case make apology for an eastern queen thus addressed by her minister of the treasury could not have felt greater indignation arabella had never seen her father show such perturbation of mind he spoke violently and imperiously the apology was ordered to be despatched by that night's post after having been submitted to his inspection mr pole had uttered mysterious phrases you don't know what you've been doing you think the ship'll go on sailing without wind you'll drive the horse till he drops and such like together with mutterings the words were of no import whatsoever to the ladies they were writings on the wall untranslateable but as when the earth quakes our noble edifices totter their palace of the fine shades and the nice feelings groaned and creaked and for a moment they thought where are we very soon they concluded that the speech arabella had heard was due to their darling papa's defective education in the council of three with reference to the letter of apology to mrs chump adela proposed if it pleased arabella to fight the battle of the republic she was young and wished both to fight and to lead as arabella knew she was checked it must be left to me said arabella of course you resist dear cornelia carelessly questioned assuredly i do better humiliation better anything better marriage than to submit in such a case cried adela for so united were the ladies of brookfield and so bent on their grand hazy object that they looked upon married life unfavourably and they had besides an idea that wedlock until 'late in life' the age of thirty say was the burial alive of woman intellectual toward midday the ladies put on their garden hats and went into the grounds together for no particular purpose near the west copse they beheld mr pole with wilfrid and emilia talking to a strange gentleman assuming a proper dignity they advanced when to their horror emilia ran up to them crying this is mr purcell barrett the gentleman who plays the organ at church i met him in the woods before i knew you i played for him the other sunday and i want you to know him she had hold of arabella's hand and was drawing her on there was no opportunity for retreat wilfrid looked as if he had already swallowed the dose almost precipitated into the arms of the ladies mr barrett bowed he was a tolerably youthful man as decently attired as old black cloth could help him to be a sharp inspection satisfied the ladies that his hat and boots were inoffensive whereupon they gave him the three shades of distance tempered so as not to wound his susceptible poverty the superlative polar degree appeared to invigorate mr barrett he devoted his remarks mainly to cornelia and cheerfully received her frozen monosyllables in exchange the ladies talked of organs and art emilia and opera he knew this and that great organ and all the operas but he amazed the ladies by talking as if he knew great people likewise this brought out mr pole who since he had purchased brookfield had been extinguished by them and had not once thoroughly enjoyed his money's worth a courtly poor man was a real pleasure to him giving a semicircular sweep of his arm here you see my little estate sir he said you've seen plenty bigger in germany and england too we can't get more than this handful in our tight little island unless born to it of course well we must be grateful that all our nobility don't go to the dogs we must preserve our great names i speak against my own interest he lifted adela's chin on his forefinger she kept her eyes demurely downward and then gazed at her sisters with gravity these ladies took a view of mr barrett his features wore an admirable expression of simple interest well sir suppose you dine with us to day mr pole bounced out neighbours should be neighbourly this abrupt invitation was decorously accepted plain dinner you know nothing like what you get at the tables of those erzhogs as you call 'em over in germany simple fare sound wine at all events it won't hurt you you'll come mr barrett bowed murmuring thanks this was the very man mr pole wanted to have at his board occasionally one who had known great people and would be thankful for a dinner he could depreciate himself as a mere wealthy british merchant imposingly before such a man his daughters had completely cut him off from his cronies and the sense of restriction and compression and that his own house was fast becoming alien territory to him made him pounce upon the gentlemanly organist his daughters wondered why he should in the presence of this stranger exaggerate his peculiar style of speech but the worthy merchant's consciousness of his identity was vanishing under the iron social rule of the ladies his perishing individuality prompted the inexplicable invitation and the form of it after mr barrett had departed the ladies ventured to remonstrate with their papa he at once replied by asking whether the letter to mrs chump had been written and hearing that it had not he desired that arabella should go into the house and compose it straightway the ladies coloured to adela's astonishment she found that arabella had turned joining her she said dearest what a moment you have lost we could have stood firm continually changing the theme from chump to barrett barrett to chump till papa's head would have twirled he would have begun to think mr barrett the irish widow and mrs chump the organist arabella rejoined your wit misleads you darling i know what i am about i decline a wordy contest to approach to a quarrel or say dispute with one's parent apropos of such a person is something worse than evil policy don't you think so strongly did the sisters admire this delicate way of masking a piece of rank cowardice that they forgave her the craven feeling was common to them all which made it still more difficult to forgive her of course we resist said cornelia undoubtedly we retire and retire adela remarked we waste the royal forces but dear me that makes us insurgents she laughed being slightly frivolous her elders had the proper sentimental worship of youth and its supposed quality of innocence and caressed her at the ringing of the second dinner bell mr pole ran to the foot of the stairs and shouted for arabella who returned no answer and was late in her appearance at table grace concluded mr pole said letter gone i wanted to see it you know it was as well not papa arabella replied mr pole shook his head seriously the ladies were thankful for the presence of mr barrett and lo this man was in perfect evening uniform he looked as gentlemanly a visitor as one might wish to see there was no trace of the poor organist poverty seemed rather a gold edge to his tail coat than a rebuke to it just as contrariwise great wealth is to the imagination really set off by a careless costume one need not explain how the mind acts in such cases the fact as i have put it is indisputable and let the young men of our generation mark the present chapter that they may know the virtue residing in a tail coat and cling to it whether buffeted by the waves or burnt out by the fire of evil angry fortune his tail coat safe the youthful briton is always ready for any change in the mind of the moody goddess and it is an almost certain thing that presuming her to have a damsel of condition in view for him as a compensation for the slaps he has received he must lose her he cannot enter a mutual path with her if he shall have failed to retain this article of a black tail his social passport i mean of course that he retain respect for the article in question respect for it firmly seated in his mind the tail may be said to be always handy it is fortune's uniform in britain the candlestick if i may dare to say so to the candle nor need any young islander despair of getting to himself her best gifts while he has her uniform at command as glossy as may be the ladies of brookfield were really stormed by mr barrett's elegant tail when the first glass of wine nodded over mr pole continued the discourse of the morning with allusions to french cooks and his cook their sympathies were taken captive by mr barrett's tact the door to their sympathies having been opened to him as it were by his attire they could not guess what necessity urged mr pole to assert his locked up self so vehemently but it certainly made the stranger shine with a beautiful mild lustre their spirits partly succumbed to him by a process too lengthened to explain here indeed i dare do no more than hint at these mysteries of feminine emotion i beg you to believe that when we are dealing with that wonder the human heart female the part played by a tail coat and a composed demeanour is not insignificant no doubt the ladies of brookfield would have rebutted the idea of a tail coat influencing them in any way as monstrous but why was it when mr pole again harped on his cook in almost similar words that they were drawn to meet the eyes of the stranger on whom they printed one of the most fabulously faint fleeting looks imaginable with a proportionately big meaning for him that might read it it must have been that this uniform of a tail had laid a basis of equality for the hour otherwise they never would have done so nor would he have enjoyed the chance of showing them that he could respond to the remotest mystic indications with a muffled adroitness equal to their own and so encouraged them to commence a language leading to intimacy with a rapidity that may well appear magical to the uninitiated in short the man really had the language of the very elect of polite society if you are not versed in this alphabet of mute intelligence you are in the ranks with waiters and linen drapers and are as far as ladies are concerned tail coated to no purpose mr pole's fresh allusion to his cook i hope you don't think i keep a man no no not in the country wouldn't do plays the deuce you know my opinion is mrs mallow's as clever as any man cook going i'd back her and mr barrett's speech she is an excellent person delivered briefly with no obtrusion of weariness confirmed the triumph of the latter a triumph all the greater that he seemed unconscious of it they leaped at one bound to the conclusion that there was a romance attached to him do not be startled an attested tail coat clearly out of its element must contain a story that story must be interesting until its secret is divulged the subtle essence of it spreads an aureole around the tail the ladies declared in their subsequent midnight conference that mr barrett was fit for any society they had visions of a great family reduced of a proud son choosing to earn his bread honourably and humbly by turning an exquisite taste to account many visions of him they had and were pleased patronage of those beneath much more than the courting of those above them delighted the ladies of brookfield they allowed emilia to give mr barrett invitations and he became a frequent visitor always neat pathetically well brushed and a pleasanter pet than emilia because he never shocked their niceties he was an excellent talker and was very soon engaged in regular contests with the argumentative cornelia their political views were not always the same as cornelia sometimes had read the paper before he arrived happily on questions of religion they coincided theories of education occupied them mainly in these contests mr barrett did not fail to acknowledge his errors when convicted and his acknowledgment was hearty and ample she had many clear triumphs still he could be positive a very great charm in him women cannot repose on a man who is not positive nor have they much gratification in confounding him wouldst thou man amorously inclining attract to thee superior women be positive be stupidly positive rather than dubious at all face fearful questions with a vizor of brass array thyself in dogmas show thy decisive judgement on the side of established power or thy enthusiasm in the rebel ranks if it must be so but be firm waver not if women could tolerate waverings and weakness and did not rush to the adoration of decision of mind we should not behold them turning contemptuously from philosophers in their agony to find refuge in the arms of smirking orthodoxy i do not say that mr barrett ventured to play the intelligent cornelia like a fish but such a fish was best secured by the method he adopted that of giving her signal victory in trifles while on vital matters he held his own very pleasant evenings now passed at brookfield which were not at all disturbed by the wonder expressed from time to time by mr pole that he had not heard from martha meaning mrs chump you have emilia the ladies said this being equivalent to she is one of that sort and mr pole understood it so and fastened emilia in one arm with now a kiss my dear and then a toon emilia readily gave both as often as he heard instances of her want of ladylike training he would say keep her here we'll better her mr barrett assisted the ladies to see that there was more in emilia than even mr pericles had perceived her story had become partially known to them and with two friendly dependents of the household one a gentleman and the other a genius they felt that they had really attained a certain eminence which is a thing to be felt only when we have something under our feet flying about with a desperate grip on the extreme skirts of aristocracy the ladies knew to be the elevation of dependency not true eminence and though they admired the kite they by no means wished to form a part of its tail they had brains a circle was what they wanted and they had not to learn that this is to be found or made only in the liberally educated class into the atmosphere of which they pressed like dungeoned plants the parasite completes the animal and a dependent assures us of our position the ladies of brookfield therefore let emilia cling to them remarking that it seemed to be their papa's settled wish that she should reside among them for a time consequently if the indulgence had ever to be regretted they would not be to blame in their hearts they were aware that it was emilia who had obtained for them their first invitation to lady gosstre's gratitude was not a part of their policy but when it assisted a recognition of material facts they did not repress it and if they said we can succeed in polishing her and toning her she may have something to thank us for in the event of her ultimately making a name that event being of course necessary for the development of so proper a sentiment thus the rides with wilfrid continued and the sweet quiet evenings when she sang chapter viii the windows of brookfield were thrown open to the air of may and bees wandered into the rooms gold spots of sunshine danced along the floors the garden walks were dazzling and the ladies went from flower bed to flower bed in broad garden hats that were as an occasional light glance flung at a window pane assured adela becoming sunshine had burst on them suddenly and there was no hat to be found for emilia so wilfrid placed his gold laced foraging cap on her head and the ladies after a moment's misgiving allowed her to wear it and turned to observe her now and then there was never pertness in emilia's look which on the contrary was singularly large and calm when it reposed perhaps her dramatic instinct prompted her half jaunty manner of leaning against the sunny corner of the house where the chinese honeysuckle climbed she was talking to wilfrid her laughter seemed careless and easy and in keeping with the southern litheness of her attitude to suit the cap it's all to suit the cap said adela the keen of eye yet critical as was this lady she acknowledged that it was no mere acting effort to suit the cap the philosopher i would keep him back if i could bids us mark that the crown and flower of the nervous system the head is necessarily sensitive and to that degree that whatsoever we place on it does for a certain period change and shape us of course the instant we call up the forces of the brain much of the impression departs but what remains is powerful and fine nerved woman is especially subject to it a girl may put on her brother's boots and they will not affect her spirit strongly but as soon as she puts on her brother's hat she gives him a manly nod the same philosopher who fathers his dulness on me asserts that the modern vice or fastness 'trotting on the epicene border' he has it is bred by apparently harmless practices of this description he offers to turn the current of a republican's brain by resting a coronet on his forehead for just five seconds howsoever these things be it was true that emilia's feet presently crossed and she was soon to be seen with her right elbow doubled against her head as she leaned to the wall and the little left fist stuck at her belt and i maintain that she had no sense at all of acting spanish prince disguised as page nor had she an idea that she was making her friend wilfrid's heart perform to her lightest words and actions like any trained milk white steed in a circus sunlight as well as wilfrid's braided cap had some magical influence on her he assured her that she looked a charming boy and she said do i just lifting her chin a gardener was shaving the lawn please spare those daisies cried emilia why do you cut away daisies the gardener objected that he really must make the lawn smooth emilia called to adela who came and hearing the case said now this is nice of you i like you to love daisies and wish to protect them they disfigure a lawn you know and adela stooped and picked one and called it a pet name and dropped it she returned to her sisters in the conservatory and meeting mr barren at the door made the incident a topic you know how greatly our emilia rejoices us when she shows sentiment and our thirst is to direct her to appreciate nature in its humility as well as its grandeur one expects her to have all poetical feelings said mr barrett while they walked forth to the lawn sloping to the tufted park grass cornelia said you have read mr runningbrook's story yes but the man had not brought it back and her name was in it written with her own hand are you of my opinion in the matter in the matter of the style i am and i am not your condemnation may be correct in itself but you say 'he coins words' and he certainly forces the phrase here and there i must admit the point to be considered is whether friction demands a perfectly smooth surface undoubtedly a scientific work does and a philosophical treatise should when we ask for facts simply we feel the intrusion of a style of fiction it is part in the one case the classical robe in the other any mediaeval phantasy of clothing yes true said cornelia hesitating over her argument well i must conclude that i am not imaginative on the contrary permit me to say that you are but your imagination is unpractised and asks to be fed with a spoon we english are more imaginative than most nations then why is it not manifested we are still fighting against the puritan element in literature as elsewhere your old bugbear mr barrett and more than this our language is not rich in subtleties for prose a writer who is not servile and has insight must coin from his own mint in poetry we are rich enough but in prose also we owe everything to the licence our poets have taken in the teeth of critics shall i give you examples it is not necessary our simplest prose style is nearer to poetry with us for this reason that the poets have made it read french poetry with the first couplet the sails are full and you have left the shores of prose far behind mr runningbrook coins words and risks expressions because an imaginative englishman pen in hand is the cadet and vagabond of the family an exploring adventurer whereas to a frenchman it all comes inherited like a well filled purse the audacity of the french mind and the french habit of quick social intercourse have made them nationally far richer in language let me add individually as much poorer read their stereotyped descriptions they all say the same things they have one big gallic trumpet wonderfully eloquent we feel that but the person does not speak and now you will be surprised to learn that notwithstanding what i have said i should still side with mr runningbrook's fair critic rather than with him the reason is that the necessity to write as he does is so great that a strong barrier a chevaux de frise of pen points must be raised against every newly minted word and hazardous coiner or we shall be inundated if he can leap the barrier he and his goods must be admitted so it has been with our greatest so it must be with the rest of them or we shall have a transatlantic literature by no means desirable i think yet see when a piece of transatlantic slang happens to be tellingly true something coined from an absolute experience from a fight with the elements we cannot resist it it invades us in the same way poetic rashness of the right quality enriches the language i would make it prove its quality cornelia walked on gravely his excuse for dilating on the theme prompted her to say you give me new views while all her reflections sounded from the depths and yet the man who talks thus is a hired organ player this recurring thought more than the cogency of the new views kept her from combating certain fallacies in them which had struck her why do you not write yourself mr barrett i have not the habit the habit i have not heard the call should it not come from within and how are we to know it if it calls to you loudly then i know it to be vanity but the wish to make a name is not vanity the wish to conceal a name may exist cornelia took one of those little sly glances at his features which print them on the brain the melancholy of his words threw a somber hue about him and she began to think with mournfulness of those firm thin lips fronting misfortune those sunken blue eyes under its shadow they walked up to mr pole who was standing with wilfrid and emilia on the lawn giving ear to a noise in the distance a big drum sounded on the confines of the brookfield estate soon it was seen entering the precincts at one of the principal gates followed by trombone and horn and fife in the rear trooped a regiment of sunday garmented villagers with a rambling tail of loose minded boys and girls blue and yellow ribands dangled from broad beaver hats and there were rosettes of the true blue mingled with yellow at buttonholes and there was fun on the line of march jokes plumped deep into the ribs and were answered with intelligent vivacity in the shape of hearty thwacks delivered wherever a surface was favourable a mode of repartee worthy of general adoption inasmuch as it can be passed on and so with certainty made to strike your neighbour as forcibly as yourself of which felicity of propagation verbal wit cannot always boast in the line of procession the hat of a member of the corps shot sheer into the sky from the compressed energy of his brain for he and all his comrades vociferously denied having cast it up and no other solution was possible this mysterious incident may tell you that beer was thus early in the morning abroad in fact it was the procession day of a provincial club feast or celebration of the nuptials of beef and beer whereof later you shall behold the illustrious offspring all the brookfield household were now upon the lawn awaiting the attack mr pole would have liked to impound the impouring host drum and all for the audacity of the trespass and then to have fed them liberally as a return for the compliment aware that he was being treated to the honours of a great man of the neighbourhood he determined to take it cheerfully come no laughing he said directing a glance at the maids who were ranged behind their mistresses 'hem we must look pleased we mustn't mind their music if they mean well emilia whose face was dismally screwed up at the nerve searching discord said why do they try to play anything but a drum in the country in the country mr pole emphasized we put up with this kind of thing in the country different in town but we a say nothing in the country we must encourage respect for the gentry in the country one of the penalties of a country life not much harm in it new duties in the country he continued to speak to himself in proportion as he grew aware of the unnecessary nervous agitation into which the drum was throwing him he assumed an air of repose and said to wilfrid read the paper to day and to arabella quiet family dinner i suppose yes sir he remarked to mr barrett as if resuming an old conversation i dare say you've seen better marching in foreign parts right left right left ha ha and not so bad not so bad i call it with their right left right left ha ha you've seen better no need to tell me that but in england we look to the meaning of things we're a practical people what's more we're volunteers volunteers in everything we can't make a regiment of ploughmen march like clock work in a minute and we don't want to but give me the choice i'll back a body of volunteers any day i would rather be backed by them sir said mr barrett very good i mean that honest intelligent industry backing rank and wealth that makes a nation strong look at england mr barrett observed him stand out largely as if filled by the spirit of the big drum that instrument now gave a final flourish and bang whereat sound as if knocked on the head died languishingly and behold a spokesman was seen in relief upon a background of grins that were oddly intermixed with countenances of extraordinary solemnity the same commenced his propitiatory remarks by assuring the proprietor of brookfield that he the spokesman and every man present knew they had taken a liberty in coming upon squire pole's grounds without leave or warning they knew likewise that squire pole excused them chorus of shouts from the divining brethren right glad they were to have such a gentleman as squire pole among them and if nobody gave him a welcome last year that was not the fault of the yellow and blues eh my boys groans and cheers right sure was spokesman that squire pole was the friend of the poor man and liked nothing better than to see him enjoy his holiday as why shouldn't he enjoy his holiday now and then and have a bit of relaxation as well as other men acquiescent token on the part of the new dignitary squire pole spokesman was hereby encouraged to put it boldly whether a man was not a man all the world over for a' that was sung out by some rare bookworm to rearward but no scot being present no frenzy followed the quotation it was announced that the club had come to do homage to squire pole and ladies the junction club of ipley and hillford what did junction mean junction meant harmony harmonious they were to be sure so they joined to good purpose mr barrett sought emilia's eyes smilingly but she was intent on the proceedings a cry of bundle o' sticks tom breeks don't let slip 'bout bundle o' sticks pulled spokesman up short he turned hurriedly to say all right and inflated his chest to do justice to the illustration of the faggots of aesop but mr tom breeks had either taken in too much air or the ale that had hitherto successfully prompted him was antipathetic to the nice delicacy of an apologue for now his arm began to work and his forehead had to be mopped and he lashed the words union and harmony right and left until coming on a sentence that sounded in his ears like the close of his speech he stared ahead with a dim idea that he had missed a point bundle o' sticks lustily shouted revived his apprehension but the sole effect was to make him look on the ground and lift his hat on the point of a perplexed finger he could not conceive how the bundle of sticks was to be brought in now or what to say concerning them union and harmony what more could be said mr tom breeks tried a remonstrance with his backers he declared to them that he had finished and had brought in the bundle they replied that they had not heard it that the bundle was the foundation sentiment of the club the first toast after the crown and that he must go on until the bundle had been brought in hereat the unhappy man faced squire pole again it was too abject a position for an englishman to endure tom breeks cast his hat to earth i'm dashed if i can bring in the bundle there was no telling how conduct like this might have been received by the yellow and blues if mr barrett had not spoken you mean everything when you say union and you're quite right not to be tautological you can't give such a blow with your fingers as you can with your fists can you up went a score of fists we've the fists we've the fists was shouted cornelia smiling on mr barrett asked him why he had confused the poor people with the long word tautological i threw it as a bone said he i think you will observe that they are already quieter they are reflecting on what it signifies and will by and by quarrel as to the spelling of it at any rate it occupies them cornelia laughed inwardly and marked with pain that his own humour gave him no merriment at the subsiding of the echoes that coupled squire pole and the junction club together squire pole replied he wished them well he was glad to see them and sorry he had not ale enough on the premises to regale every man of them clubs were great institutions one fist was stronger than a thousand fingers as my friend here said just now hereat the eyelids of cornelia shed another queenly smile on the happy originator of the remark squire pole then descended to business he named the amount of his donation at this practical sign of his support heaven heard the gratitude of the good fellows the drum awoke from its torpor and summoned its brethren of the band to give their various versions of the national anthem can't they be stopped emilia murmured clenching her little hands the patriotic melody delivered in sturdy democratic fashion had to be endured it died hard but did come to an end piecemeal tom breeks then retired from the front and became a unit once more there were flourishes that indicated a termination of the proceedings when another fellow was propelled in advance and he shuffling and ducking his head to the cries of out wi' it jim and where's your stomach came still further forward and showed a most obsequious grin why it's jim exclaimed emilia on whom jim's eyes were fastened stepping nearer she said do you want to speak to me jim had this to say which divested of his petition for pardon on the strength of his perfect knowledge that he took a liberty was that the young lady had promised while staying at wilson's farm that she would sing to the club fellows on the night of their feast i towl'd 'em they'd have a rare treat miss mumbled jim and they're all right mad for 't that they be bain't ye boys that they were with not a few of the gesticulations of madness too emilia said i promised i would sing to them i remember it quite well of course i will keep my promise a tumult of acclamation welcomed her words and jim looked immensely delighted she was informed by several voices that they were the yellow and blues and not the blues that she must not go to the wrong set and that their booth was on ipley common and that they the junction club only would honour her rightly for the honour she was going to do them all of which emilia said she would bear in mind jim then retired hastily having done something that stout morning ale would alone have qualified him to perform the drum in the noble belief that it was leading announced the return march and with three cheers for squire pole and a crowning one for the ladies away trooped the procession chapter ix hardly had the last sound of the drum passed out of hearing when the elastic thunder of a fresh one claimed attention the truth being that the junction club of ipley and hillford whose colours were yellow and blue was a seceder from the old established hillford club on which it had this day shamefully stolen a march by parading everywhere in the place of it and disputing not only its pasture grounds but its identity there is no instrument the sound of which proclaims such a vast internal satisfaction as the drum i know not whether it be that the sense we have of the corpulency of this instrument predisposes us to imagine it supremely content as when an alderman is heard snoring the world is assured that it listens to the voice of its own exceeding gratulation a light heart in a fat body ravishes not only the world but the philosopher if monotonous the one note of the drum is very correct like the speaking of great nature what it means is implied by the measure when the drum beats to the measure of a common human pulsation it has a conquering power inspiring us neither to dance nor to trail the members but to march as life does regularly and in hearty good order and with a not exhaustive jollity it is a sacred instrument now the drum which is heard to play in this cheerful fashion while at the same time we know that discomfiture is cruelly harrying it that its inmost feelings are wounded and that worse is in store for it affects the contemplative mind with an inexpressibly grotesque commiseration do but listen to this one which is the joint corporate voice of the men of hillford outgeneraled plundered turned to ridicule it thumps with unabated briskness here indeed might sentimentalism shed a fertile tear anticipating that it will eventually be hung up among our national symbols i proceed the drum of hillford entered the brookfield grounds as ipley had done and with a similar body of decorated clubmen sounding along until it faced the astonished proprietor who held up his hand and requested to know the purpose of the visit one sentence of explanation sufficed what cried mr pole do you think you can milk a cow twice in ten minutes several of the hillford men acknowledged that it would be rather sharp work their case was stated whereupon mr pole told them that he had just been 'milked' and regretted it but requested them to see that he could not possibly be equal to any second proceeding of the sort on their turning to consult together he advised them to bear it with fortitude all right sir they said and a voice from the ranks informed him that their word was 'jolly' then a signal was given and these indomitable fellows cheered the lord of brookfield as lustily as if they had accomplished the feat of milking him twice in an hour their lively hurrahs set him blinking in extreme discomposure of spirit and he was fumbling at his pocket when the drum a little precipitately thumped the ranks fell into order and the departure was led by the tune of the 'king of the cannibal islands' a tune that is certain to create a chorus on the march on this occasion the line oh didn't you know you were done sir became general at the winding up of the tune boys with their elders frisked as they chimed it casting an emphasis of infinite relish on the declaration 'done' as if they delighted in applying it to mr pole though at their own expense soon a verse grew up we march'd and call'd on mister pole who hadn't a penny upon his soul for ipley came and took the whole and didn't you know you were done sir i need not point out to the sagacious that hillford and not mr pole had been 'done' but this was the genius of the men who transferred the opprobrium to him nevertheless though their manner of welcoming misfortune was such i knowing that there was not a deadlier animal than a 'done' briton have shudders for ipley we relinquished the stream of an epic in turning away from these mighty drums mr pole stood questioning all who surrounded him what could i do i couldn't subscribe to both they don't expect that of a lord and i'm a commoner if these fellows quarrel and split are we to suffer for it they can't agree and want us to pay double fines this is how they serve us mr barrett rather at a loss to account for his excitement said that it must be admitted they had borne the trick played upon them with remarkable good humour yes but mr pole fumed i don't they put me in the wrong between them they make me uncomfortable i've a good mind to withdraw my subscription to those rascals who came first and have nothing to do with any of them then you see down i go for a niggardly fellow that's the reputation i get nothing of this in london you make your money pay your rates and nobody bothers a man you should have done as our darling here did papa said adela you should have hinted something that might be construed a promise or not as we please to read it if i promise i perform returned mr pole our hillford people have cause for complaint mr barrett observed and to emilia you will hardly favour one party more than another will you i am for that poor man jim said emilia he carried my harp evening after evening and would not even take sixpence for the trouble are you really going to sing there didn't you hear i promised to night yes certainly do you know what it is you have promised to sing adela glided to her sisters near at hand and these ladies presently hemmed emilia in they had a method of treating matters they did not countenance as if nature had never conceived them and such were the monstrous issue of diseased imaginations it was hard for emilia to hear that what she designed to do was utterly out of the question and not to be for one moment thought of she reiterated with the same interpreting stress that she had given her promise do you know i praised you for putting them off so cleverly said adela in tones of gentle reproach that bewildered emilia must we remind you then that you are bound by a previous promise cornelia made a counter demonstration with the word have you not promised to dine with us at lady gosstre's to night oh of course i shall keep that replied emilia i intend to i will sing there and then i will go and sing to those poor people who never hear anything but dreadful music not music at all but something that seems to tear your flesh never mind our flesh said adela pettishly melodiously remonstrating the next instant i really thought you could not be in earnest but said arabella can you find pleasure in wasting your voice and really great capabilities on such people emilia caught her up this poor man but he loves music he really knows the good from the bad he never looks proud but when i sing to him the situation was one that cornelia particularly enjoyed here was a low form of intellect to be instructed as to the precise meaning of a word the nature of a pledge there can be no harm that i see in your singing to this man she commenced you can bid him come to one of the out houses here if you desire and sing to him in the evening after his labour will be the fit time but as your friends we cannot permit you to demean yourself by going from our house to a public booth where vulgar men are smoking and drinking beer i wonder you have the courage to contemplate such an act you have pledged your word but if you had pledged your word child to swing upon that tree suspended by your arms for an hour could you keep it i think not and to recognize an impossibility economizes time and is one of the virtues of a clear understanding it is incompatible that you should dine with lady gosstre and then run away to a drinking booth society will never tolerate one who is familiar with boors if you are to succeed in life as we your friends can conscientiously say that we most earnestly hope and trust you will do you must be on good terms with society you must you pledge your word to a piece of folly emancipate yourself from it as quickly as possible do you see this is foolish it therefore cannot be decide as a sensible creature at the close of this harangue cornelia who had stooped slightly to deliver it regained her stately posture beautified in mr barrett's sight by the flush which an unwonted exercise in speech had thrown upon her cheeks emilia stood blinking like one sensible of having been chidden in a strange tongue does it offend you my going she faltered offend our concern is entirely for you observed cornelia the explanation drew out a happy sparkle from emilia's eyes she seized her hand kissed it and cried i do thank you i know i promised but indeed i am quite pleased to go mr barrett swung hurriedly round and walked some paces away with his head downward the ladies remained in a tolerant attitude for a minute or so silent they then wheeled with one accord and emilia was left to herself chapter x richford was an easy drive from brookfield through lanes of elm and white hawthorn the ladies never acted so well as when they were in the presence of a fact which they acknowledged but did not recognize albeit constrained to admit that this was the first occasion of their ever being on their way to the dinner table of a person of quality they could refuse to look the admission in the face a peculiar lightness of heart beset them for brooding ambition is richer in that first realizing step it takes insignificant though it seem than in any subsequent achievement i fear to say that the hearts of the ladies boiled because visages so sedate and voices so monotonously indifferent would witness decidedly against me the common avoidance of any allusion to richford testified to the direction of their thoughts and the absence of a sign of exultation may be accepted as a proof of the magnitude of that happiness of which they might not exhibit a feature the effort to repress it must have cost them horrible pain adela the youngest of the three transferred her inward joy to the cottage children whose staring faces from garden porch and gate flashed by the carriage windows how delighted they look she exclaimed more than once and informed her sisters that a country life was surely the next thing to paradise those children do look so happy thus did the weak one cunningly relieve herself arabella occupied her mind by giving emilia leading hints for conduct in the great house on the whole though there is no harm in your praising particular dishes as you do at home it is better in society to say nothing on those subjects until your opinion is asked and when you speak it should be as one who passes the subject by appreciate flavours but no dwelling on them the degrees of an expression of approbation naturally enough vary with age did my instinct prompt me to the discussion of these themes i should be allowed greater licence than you and here arabella was unable to resist a little bit of the indulgence adela had taken you are sure to pass a most agreeable evening and one that you will remember north pole sat high above such petty consolation seldom speaking save just to show that her ideas ranged at liberty and could be spontaneously sympathetic on selected topics their ceremonious entrance to the state room of richford accomplished the ladies received the greeting of the affable hostess quietly perturbed but not enough so to disorder their artistic contemplation of her open actions choice of phrase and by play without communication or pre arrangement each knew that the other would not let slip the opportunity and after the first five minutes of languid general converse they were mentally at work comparing notes with one another's imaginary conversations while they said yes and indeed and i think so and appeared to belong to the world about them merthyr i do you the honour to hand this young lady to your charge said lady gosstre putting on equal terms with emilia a gentleman of perhaps five and thirty years who reminded her of mr barrett but was unclouded by that look of firm sadness which characterized the poor organist mr powys was a travelled welsh squire lady gosstre's best talker on whom as brookfield learnt to see she could perfectly rely to preserve the child from any little drawing room sins or dinner table misadventures this gentleman had made sacrifices for the cause of italy in money and it was said in blood he knew the country and loved the people brookfield remarked that there was just a foreign tinge in his manner and that his smile though social to a degree unknown to the run of english faces did not give him all to you and at a second glance seemed plainly to say that he reserved much adela fell to the lot of a hussar captain a celebrated beauty not too foolish she thought it proper to punish him for his good looks till propitiated by his good temper nobody at brookfield could remember afterwards who took arabella down to dinner she declaring that she had forgotten her sisters not unwilling to see insignificance banished to annihilation said that it must have been nobody in person and that he was a very useful guest when ladies were engaged cornelia had a different lot she leaned on the right arm of the member for hillford the statistical debate sir twickenham pryme who had twice before as he ventured to remind her enjoyed the honour of conversing if not of dining with her nay more he revived their topics and i have come round to your way of thinking as regards hustings addresses he said in nine cases out of ten at least nineteen twentieths of the house will furnish instances one can only as you justly observed appeal to the comprehension of the mob by pledging oneself either to their appetites or passions and it is better plainly to state the case and put it to them in figures whether the baronet knew what he was saying is one matter he knew what he meant wilfrid was cavalier to lady charlotte chillingworth of stornley about ten miles distant from hillford ninth daughter of a nobleman who passed current as the poor marquis he having been ruined when almost a boy in paris by the late illustrious lord dartford her sisters had married captains in the army and navy lawyers and parsons impartially lady charlotte was nine and twenty years of age with clear and telling stone blue eyes firm but not unsweet lips slightly hollowed cheeks and a jaw that certainly tended to be square her colour was healthy walking or standing her figure was firmly poised her chief attraction was a bell toned laugh fresh as a meadow spring she had met wilfrid once in the hunting field so they soon had common ground to run on mr powys made emilia happy by talking to her of italy in the intervals of table anecdotes why did you leave it she said i found i had more shadows than the one allotted me by nature and as i was accustomed to a black one and not half a dozen white i was fairly frightened out of the country you mean austrians i do do you hate them not at all then how can you love the italians they themselves have taught me to do both to love them and not to hate their enemies your italians are the least vindictive of all races of men merthyr merthyr went lady gosstre lady charlotte murmuring aloud and in the third chapter of the book of paradox you will find these words we afford a practical example and forgive them do we not mr powys smiled at emilia she looked round her and reddened a little so long as you do not write that christian word with the point of a stiletto said lady charlotte you are not mad about the italians wilfrid addressed her not mad about anything i hope if i am to choose i prefer the austrians a very gentlemanly set of men at least so i find them always capital horsemen i will explain to you how it must be said mr powys to emilia an artistic people cannot hate long hotly for the time but the oppression gone and even in the dream of its going they are too human to be revengeful do we understand such very deep things said lady gosstre who was near enough to hear clearly yes for if i ask her whether she can hate when her mind is given to music she knows that she cannot she can love yet i think i have heard some italian operatic spitfires and of some said lady charlotte what opinion do you pronounce in this controversy cornelia made appeal to sir twickenham there are multitudes of cases he began and took up another end of his statement it has been computed that five and twenty murders per month to a populationto a population of ninety thousand souls is a fair reckoning in a southern latitude then we must allow for the latitude i think so and also for the space into which the ninety thousand souls are packed quoth tracy runningbrook well well went sir twickenham the knife is the law to an italian of the south said mr powys he distrusts any other because he never gets it where law is established or tolerably secure the knife is not used duels are rare there is too much bonhomie for the point of honour i should like to believe that all men are as just to their mistresses lady charlotte sighed mock earnestly presently emilia touched the arm of mr powys she looked agitated i want to be told the name of that gentleman his eyes were led to rest on the handsome hussar captain do you know him but his name do me the favour to look at me captain gambier it is captain gambier's face was resolutely kept in profile to her i hear a rumour said lady gosstre to arabella that you think of bidding for the besworth estate are you tired of brookfield not tired but brookfield is modern and i confess that besworth has won my heart i shall congratulate myself on having you nearer neighbours have you many or any rivals there is some talk of the tinleys wishing to purchase it i cannot see why what people are they asked lady charlotte do they hunt oh dear no they are to society what dissenters are to religion i can't describe them otherwise they pass before me in that description said lady gosstre besworth's an excellent centre for hunting lady charlotte remarked to wilfrid i've always had an affection for that place the house is on gravel the river has trout there's a splendid sweep of grass for the horses to exercise i think there must be sixteen spare beds at all events i know that number can be made up so that if you're too poor to live much in london you can always have your set about you the eyes of the fair economist sparkled as she dwelt on these particular advantages of besworth richford boasted a show of flowers that might tempt its guests to parade the grounds on balmy evenings wilfrid kept by the side of lady charlotte she did not win his taste a bit had she been younger less decided in tone and without a title it is very possible that she would have offended his native secret and dominating fastidiousness as much as did emilia then what made him subject at all to her influence as he felt himself beginning to be she supplied a deficiency in the youth he was growing and uncertain she was set and decisive in his soul he adored the extreme refinement of woman even up to the thin edge of inanity which neighbours what the philosopher could tell him if he would and would if it were permitted to him nothing was too white too saintly or too misty for his conception of abstract woman but the practical wants of our nature guide us best conversation with lady charlotte seemed to strengthen and ripen him he blushed with pleasure when she said i remember reading your name in the account of that last cavalry charge on the dewan you slew a chief i think that was creditable for they are swordmen cavalry in europe can't win much honour not individual honour i mean i suppose being part of a victorious machine is exhilarating i confess i should not think much of wearing that sort of feather it's right to do one's duty comforting to trample down opposition and agreeable to shed blood but when you have matched yourself man to man and beaten why then i dub you knight wilfrid bowed half laughing in a luxurious abandonment to his sensations possibly because of their rule over him then the change in him was so instant from flattered delight to vexed perplexity rounding one of the rhododendron banks just as he lifted his head from that acknowledgment of the lady's commendation he had sight of emilia with her hand in the hand of captain gambier what could it mean what right had he to hold her hand even if he knew her what right the words between emilia and captain gambier were few why did i not look at you during dinner said he was it not better to wait till we could meet then you will walk with me and talk to me all the evening no but i will try and come down here next week and meet you again are you going to night yes to night to night before it strikes a quarter to ten i am going to leave here alone if you would come with me i want a companion i know they will not hurt me but i don't like being alone i have given my promise to sing to some poor people my friends say i must not go i must go i can't break a promise to poor people and you have never heard me really sing my best come with me and i will captain gambier required certain explanations he saw that a companion and protection would be needed by his curious little friend and as she was resolved not to break her word he engaged to take her in the carriage that was to drive him to the station you make me give up an appointment in town he said ah but you will hear me sing returned emilia we will drive to brookfield and get my harp and then to ipley common i am to be sure you will be ready with the carriage at just a quarter to ten the captain gave her his assurance and they separated he to seek out adela she to wander about the calmest of conspirators against the serenity of a household meeting wilfrid and lady charlotte emilia was asked by him who it was she had quitted so abruptly that is the gentleman i told you of now i know his name it is captain gambier she was allowed to pass on what is this she says lady charlotte asked it appearssomething about a meeting somewhere accidentally in the park in london i think i really don't know she had forgotten his name lady charlotte spurred him with an interrogative yes she wanted to remember his name that's all he was kind to her but after all remonstrated lady charlotte that's only a characteristic of young men is it not no special distinction you are all kind to girls to women to anything captain gambier and adela crossed their path he spoke a passing word lady charlotte returned no answer and was silent to her companion for some minutes then she said if you feel any responsibility about this little person take my advice and don't let her have appointments and meetings they're bad in any case and for a girl who has no brother has she no well then you should make the best provision you can against the cowardice of men most men are cowards emilia sang in the drawing room brookfield knew perfectly why she looked indifferent to the plaudits and was not dissatisfied at hearing lady gosstre say that she was a little below the mark the kindly lady brought emilia between herself and mr powys saying i don't intend to let you be the star of the evening and outshine us all after which conversation commenced and brookfield had reason to admire her ladyship's practised play upon the social instrument surely the grandest of all the chords being men and women consider what an accomplishment this is albeit brookfield knew itself a student at richford adela was of too impatient a wit to refrain from little ventures toward independence if not rivalry what we do she uttered distinctively once or twice among other things she spoke of our discovery to attest her declaration that to wakeful eyes neither hillford nor any other place on earth was dull cornelia flushed at hearing the name of mr barrett pronounced publicly by her sister an organist an accomplished man lady gosstre repeated adela's words well i suppose it is possible but it rather upsets one's notions does it not yes but agreeably said adela with boldness and related how he had been introduced and hinted that he was going to be patronized the man cannot maintain himself on the income that sort of office brings him lady gosstre observed oh no said adela i fancy he does it simply for some sort of occupation one cannot help imagining a disguise personally i confess to an objection to gentlemen in disguise said lady gosstre barrett do you know the man she addressed mr powys there used to be good quartett evenings given by the barretts of bursey he said sir justinian barrett married a miss purcell who subsequently preferred the musical accomplishments of a foreign professor of the art purcell barrett is his name said adela our emilia brought him to us where is she but where can she be adela rose she pressed my hand just now said lady gosstre she was here when captain gambler quitted the room arabella remarked good heaven the exclamation came from adela oh lady gosstre i fear to tell you what i think she has done the scene of the rival clubs was hurriedly related together with the preposterous pledge given by emilia that she would sing at the ipley booth among those dreadful men they will treat her respectfully said mr powys worship her i should imagine merthyr said lady gosstre for all that she had better be away beer is not a respectful spirit i trust you will pardon her arabella pleaded everything that explanations of the impropriety of such a thing could do we have done we thought that at last we had convinced her she is quite untamed mr powys now asked where this place was that she had hurried to the unhappy ladies of brookfield quick as they were to read every sign surrounding them were for the moment too completely thrown off their balance by emilia's extraordinary exhibition of will to see that no reflex of her shameful and hideous proceeding had really fallen upon them their exclamations were increasing until adela who had been the noisiest suddenly adopted lady gosstre's tone if she has gone i suppose she must be simply fetched away do you see what has happened lady charlotte murmured to wilfrid between a phrase he stumbled over a little piece of gallantry excellent but say those things in french your dark eyed maid has eloped she left the room five minutes after captain gambier wilfrid sprang to his feet looking eagerly to the corners of the room pardon me he said and moved up to lady gosstre on the way he questioned himself why his heart should be beating at such a pace standing at her ladyship's feet he could scarcely speak yes wilfrid go after her said adela divining his object by all means go added lady gosstre now she is there you may as well let her keep her promise and then hurry her home they will saddle you a horse down below if you care to have one wilfrid thanked her ladyship and declined the horse he was soon walking rapidly under a rough sky in the direction of ipley with no firm thought that he would find emilia there etext editor's bookmarks being heard at night in the nineteenth century pleasure sat like an inextinguishable light on her face beyond a plot of flowers a gold green meadow dipped to a ridge his alien ideas were not unimpressed by the picture hushing together they agreed that it had been a false move i had to make my father and mother live on potatoes i had to cross the park to give a lesson she was perhaps a little the taller of the two the
