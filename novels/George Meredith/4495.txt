note there is a short list of bookmarks or pointers at the end of the file for those who may wish to sample the authors ideas before making an entire meal of them dw the house on the beach by george meredith a realistic tale chapter i the experience of great officials who have laid down their dignities before death or have had the philosophic mind to review themselves while still wielding the deputy sceptre teaches them that in the exercise of authority over men an eccentric behaviour in trifles has most exposed them to hostile criticism and gone farthest to jeopardize their popularity it is their achilles heel the place where their mother nature holds them as she dips them in our waters the eccentricity of common persons is the entertainment of the multitude and the maternal hand is perceived for a cherishing and endearing sign upon them but rarely can this be found suitable for the august in station only indeed when their sceptre is no more fearful than a grandmothers birch and these must learn from it sooner or later that they are uncomfortably mortal when herrings are at auction on a beach for example the man of chief distinction in the town should not step in among a poor fraternity to take advantage of an occasion of cheapness though it be done as he may protest to relieve the fishermen of a burden nor should such a dignitary as the bailiff of a cinque port carry home the spoil of victorious bargaining on his arm in a basket it is not that his conduct is in itself objectionable so much as that it causes him to be popularly weighed and during life until the best of all advocates can plead before our fellow englishmen that we are out of their way it is prudent to avoid the process mr tinman however this highstepping person in question happened to have come of a marketing mother she had started him from a small shop to a big one he by the practice of her virtues had been enabled to start himself as a gentleman he was a man of this ambition and prouder behind it but having started himself precipitately he took rank among independent incomes as they are called only to take fright at the perils of starvation besetting one who has been tempted to abandon the source of fifty per cent so if noble imagery were allowable in our time in prose might alarms and partial regrets be assumed to animate the splendid pumpkin cut loose from the suckers deprived of that prodigious nourishment of the shop in the fashionable seaport of helmstone he retired upon his native town the cinque port of crikswich where he rented the cheapest residence he could discover for his habitation the house on the beach and lived imposingly though not in total disaccord with his old mothers principles his income as he observed to his widowed sister and solitary companion almost daily in their privacy was respectable the descent from an altitude of fifty to five per cent cannot but be felt nevertheless it was a comforting midnight bolster reflection for a man turning over to the other side between a dream and a wink that he was making no bad debts and one must pay to be addressed as esquire once an esquire you are off the ground in england and on the ladder an esquire can offer his hand in marriage to a lady in her own right plain esquires have married duchesses they marry baronets daughters every day of the week thoughts of this kind were as the rise and fall of waves in the bosom of the new esquire how often in his helmstone shop had he not heard titled ladies disdaining to talk a whit more prettily than ordinary women and he had been a match for the subtlety of their pridehe understood it he knew well that at the hint of a proposal from him they would have spoken out in a manner very different to that of ordinary women the lightning only to be warded by an esquire was in them he quitted business at the age of forty that he might pretend to espousals with a born lady or at least it was one of the ideas in his mind and here i think is the moment for the epitaph of anticipation over him and the exclamation alas i would not be premature but it is necessary to create some interest in him and no one but a foreigner could feel it at present for the englishman who is bursting merely to do like the rest of his countrymen and rise above them to shake them class by class as the dust from his heels alas then anundertakers pathos is better than none at allhe was not a singleminded aspirant to our social honours the old marketing mother to whom he owed his fortunes was in his blood to confound his ambition and so contradictory was the mans nature that in revenge for disappointments there were times when he turned against the saving spirit of parsimony readers deep in greek dramatic writings will see the fatal sisters behind the chair of a man who gives frequent and bigger dinners that he may become important in his neighbourhood while decreasing the price he pays for his wine that he may miserably indemnify himself for the outlay a sip of his wine fetched the breath as when men are in the presence of the tremendous elements of nature it sounded the constitution more darklyawful and with a profounder testimony to stubborn health than the physicians instruments most of the guests at mr tinmans table were so constructed that they admired him for its powerful quality the more at his announcement of the price of it the combined strength and cheapness probably flattering them as by another mystic instance of the national energy it must have been so since his townsmen rejoiced to hail him as head of their town here and there a solitary esquire fished out of the bathing season to dine at the house on the beach was guilty of raising one of those clamours concerning subsequent headaches which spread an evil reputation as a pall a resident esquire or two in whom a reminiscence of tinmans table may be likened to the hook which some old trout has borne away from the angler as the most vivid of warnings to him to beware for the future caught up the black report and propagated it the lieutenant of the coastguard hearing the latest conscious victim or hearing of him would nod his head and say he had never dined at tinmans table without a headache ensuing and a visit to the chemists shop which he was assured was good for trade and he acquiesced as it was right to do in a man devoted to his country he dined with tinman again we try our best to be social for eight months in our year he had little choice but to dine with tinman or be a hermit attached to a telescope where are you going lieutenant his frank reply to the question was i am going to be killed and it grew notorious that this meant tinmans table we get on together as well as we can perhaps if we were an acutely calculating people we should find it preferable both for trade and our physical prosperity to turn and kill tinman in contempt of consequences but we are not and so he does the business gradually for us a generous people we must be for tinman was not detested the recollection of next morning caused him to be dimly feared tinman meanwhile was awake only to the circumstance that he made no progress as an esquire except on the envelopes of letters and in his own esteem that broad region he began to occupy to the exclusion of other inhabitants and the result of such a state of princely isolation was a plunge of his whole being into deep thoughts from the hour of his investiture as the towns chief man thoughts which were long shots took possession of him he had his wits about him he was alive to ridicule he knew he was not popular below or on easy terms with people above him and he meditated a surpassing stroke as one of the band of esq that had nothing original about it to perplex and annoy the native mind yet was dazzling few members of the privileged band dare even imagine the thing it will hardly be believed but it is historical fact that in the act of carrying fresh herrings home on his arm he entertained the idea of a visit to the first person and head of the realm and was indulging in pleasing visions of the charms of a personal acquaintance nay he had already consulted with brother jurats for you must know that one of the princesses had recently suffered betrothal in the newspapers and supposing her to deign to ratify the engagement what so reasonable on the part of a cinque port chieftain as to congratulate his liege mistress her illustrious mother these are thoughts and these are deeds which give emotional warmth and colour to the ejecter members of a population wretchedly befogged they are our sunlight and our brighter theme of conversation they are necessary to the climate and the saxon mind and it would be foolish to put them away as it is foolish not to do our utmost to be intimate with terrestrial splendours while we have themas it may be said of wardens mayors and bailiffsat command tinman was quite of this opinion they are there to relieve our dulness we have them in the place of heavenly and he would have argued that we have a right to bother them too he had a notion up in the clouds of a sailors convalescent hospital at crikswich to seduce a prince with hand him the trowel make him lay the stone and then poor prince refresh him at table but that was a matter for by and by his purchase of herrings completed mr tinman walked across the mound of shingle to the house on the beach he was rather a freshfaced man of the saxon colouring and at a distance looking goodhumoured that he should have been able to make such an appearance while doing daily battle with his wine was a proof of great physical vigour his pace was leisurely as it must needs be over pebbles where half a step is subtracted from each whole one in passing and besides he was aware of a general breath at his departure that betokened a censorious assembly why should he not market for himself he threw dignity into his retreating figure in response to the internal interrogation the moment was one when conscious rectitude pliers man should have a tail for its just display philosophers have drawn attention to the power of the human face to express pure virtue but no sooner has it passed on than the spirit erect within would seem helpless the breadth of our shoulders is apparently presented for our critics to write on poor duty is done by the simple sense of moral worth to supplant that absence of feature in the plain flat back we are below the animals in this how charged with language behind him is a dog everybody has noticed it let a dog turn away from a hostile circle and his crisp and wary tail not merely defends him it menaces it is a weapon man has no choice but to surge and boil or stiffen preposterously knowing the popular sentiment about his marketingfor men can see behind their backs though they may have nothing to speak withtinman resembled those persons of principle who decline to pay for a bless your honour from a voluble beggarwoman and obtain the reverse of it after they have gone by he was sufficiently sensitive to feel that his back was chalked as on a slate the only remark following him was there he goes he went to the seaward gate of the house on the beach made practicable in a low flint wall where he was met by his sister martha to whom he handed the basket apparently he named the cost of his purchase per dozen she touched the fish and pressed the bellies of the topmost it might be to question them tenderly concerning their roes then the couple passed out of sight herrings were soon after this despatching their odours through the chimneys of all crikswich and there was that much of concord and festive union among the inhabitants the house on the beach had been posted where it stood one supposes for the sake of the seaview from which it turned right about to face the town across a patch of grass and salt scurf looking like a square and scornful corporal engaged in the perpetual review of an awkward squad of recruits sea delighted it not nor land either marine parade fronting it to the left shaded sickly eyes under a worn green verandah from a sun that rarely appeared as the traducers of spinsters pretend those virgins are ever keenly on their guard against him that cometh not belle vue terrace stared out of lank glass panes without reserve unashamed of its yellow complexion a gaping publichouse calling itself newly hotel fell backward a step villas with the titles of royalty and bloody battles claimed five feet of garden and swelled in bowwindows beside other villas which drew up firmly commending to the attention a decent straightness and unintrusive decorum in preference on an elevated meadow to the right was the crouch the hall of elba nestled among weatherbeaten dwarf woods further toward the cliff shavenness featurelessness emptiness clamminess scurfiness formed the outward expression of a town to which people were reasonably glad to come from london in summertime for there was nothing in crikswich to distract the naked pursuit of health the sea tossed its renovating brine to the determinedly sniffing animal who went to his meals with an appetite that rendered him cordially eulogistic of the place in spite of certain frank whiffs of sewerage coming off an open deposit on the common to mingle with the brine tradition told of a french lady and gentleman entering the town to take lodgings for a month and that on the morrow they took a boat from the shore saying in their faint english to a sailor veteran of the coastguard whom they had consulted about the weather it is better zis zan zat as they shrugged between rough sea and corpselike land and they were not seen again their meaning none knew having paid their bill at the lodginghouse their conduct was ascribed to systematic madness english people came to crikswich for the pure salt sea air and they did not expect it to be cooked and dressed and decorated for them if these things are done to nature it is nature no longer that you have but something frenchified those french are for trimming neptunes beard only wait and you are sure to find variety in nature more than you may like you will find it in neptune what say you to a breach of the seawall and an inundation of the aromatic grass flat extending from the house on the beach to the tottering terraces villas cottages and publichouse transformed by its ensign to hotel along the frontage of the town such an event had occurred of old and had given the house on the beach the serious shaking great neptune in his wrath alone can give but many years had intervened groynes had been run down to intercept him and divert him he generally did his winter mischief on a mill and salt marshes lower westward mr tinman had always been extremely zealous in promoting the expenditure of what moneys the town had to spare upon the protection of the shore as it were for the propitiation or defiance of the seagod there was a kindly joke against him an that subject among brother jurats he retorted with the joke that the first thing for englishmen to look to were englands defences but it will not do to be dwelling too fondly on our eras of peace for which we make such splendid sacrifices peace saving for the advent of a german band which troubled the repose of the town at intervals had imparted to the inhabitants of crikswich within and without the likeness to its most perfect image together it must be confessed with a degree of nervousness that invested common events with some of the terrors of the last trump when one night just upon the passing of the vernal equinox something happened chapter ii a carriage stopped short in the ray of candlelight that was fitfully and feebly capering on the windy blackness outside the open workshop of crickledon the carpenter fronting the seabeach mr tinnnans house was inquired for crickledon left off planing at halfsprawl over the board he bawled out turn to the right right ahead cant mistake it he nodded to one of the cronies intent on watching his labours not unless they mean to be bait for whitingpout whos that for tinman i wonder the speculations of crickledons friends were lost in the scream of the plane one cast an eye through the door and observed that the carriage was there still gentlemans got out and walked said crickledon he was informed that somebody was visible inside gentlemans wife mayhap he said his friends indulged in their privilege of thinking what they liked and there was the usual silence of tongues in the shop he furnished them sound and motion for their amusement and now and then a scrap of conversation and the sedater spirits dwelling in his immediate neighbourhood were accustomed to step in and see him work up to supper time instead of resorting to the more turbid and costly excitement of the publichouse crickledon looked up from the measurement of a thumbline in the doorway stood a bearded gentleman who announced himself with the startling exclamation heres a pretty pickle and bustled to make way for a man well known to them as ned crummins the upholsterers man on whose back hung an article of furniture the condition of which with a condensed brevity of humour worthy of literary admiration he displayed by mutely turning himself about as he entered smashed was the general outcry i ran slap into him said the gentleman who the deuceno bones broken thats one thing the fellowthere look at him hes like a glass tortoise its a chiwal glass crickledon remarked and laid finger on the star in the centre gentleman ran slap into me said crummins depositing the frame on the floor of the shop never had such a shock in my life continued the gentleman upon my soul i took him for a door i did indeed a kind of light flashed from one of your houses here and in the pitch dark i thought i was at the door of old mart tinmans house and dash me if i did nt go incrash but what the deuce do you do carrying that great big lookingglass at night man and look here tell me how was it you happened to be going glass foremost when youd got the glass on your back well t aint my fault i knows that rejoined crummins i came along as careful as a man could i was just going to bawl out to master tinman i knows the way never fear me for i thinks i hears him call from his house do ye see the way and into me this gentleman runs all his might and smash goes the glass i was just ten steps from master tinmans gate and that careful i reckoned every foot i put down that i was i knows i did though why it was me calling im sure i cant see the way you heard me you donkey retorted the bearded gentleman what was the good of your turning that glass against me in the very nick when i dashed on you well t aint my fault i swear said crummins the wind catches voices so on a pitch dark night you never can tell whether they be on one shoulder or the other and if im to go and lose my place through no fault of mine have nt i told you sir im going to pay the damage here said the gentleman fumbling at his waistcoat here take this card read it for the first time during the scene in the carpenters shop a certain pomposity swelled the gentlemans tone his delivery of the card appeared to act on him like the flourish of a trumpet before great men van diemen smith he proclaimed himself for the assistance of ned crummins in his task the latters look of sad concern on receiving the card seeming to declare an unscholarly conscience an anxious feminine voice was heard close beside mr van diemen smith oh papa has there been an accident are you hurt not a bit netty not a bit walked into a big lookingglass in the dark thats all a matter of eight or ten pound and that wont stump us but these are what i call queer doings in old england when you cant take a step in the dark on the seashore without plunging bang into a glass and it looks like bad luck to my visit to old mart tinman can you he addressed the company tell me of a clean wholesome lodginghouse i was thinking of flinging myself body and baggage on your mayor or whatever he ismy old schoolmate but i dont so much like this beginning a couple of bedrooms and sittingroom clean sheets well aired good food well cooked payment per week in advance the pebble dropped into deep water speaks of its depth by the tardy arrival of bubbles on the surface and in like manner the very simple question put by mr van diemen smith pursued its course of penetration in the assembled mind in the carpenters shop for a considerable period with no sign to show that it had reached the bottom surely papa we can go to an inn there must be some hotel said his daughter theres good accommodation at the cliff hotel hard by said crickledon but said one of his friends if you dont want to go so far sir theres master crickledons own house next door and his wife lets lodgings and theres not a better cook along this coast then why did nt the man mention it is he afraid of having me asked mr smith a little thunderingly i may nt be known much yet in england but ill tell you you inquire the route to mr van diemen smith over there in australia yes papa interrupted his daughter only you must consider that it may not be convenient to take us in at this hourso late its not that miss begging your pardon said crickledon i make a point of never recommending my own house thats where it is otherwise youre welcome to try us i was thinking of falling bounce on my old schoolmate and putting old english hospitality to the proof mr smith meditated but its late yes and that confounded glass no well bide with you mr carpenter ill send my card across to mart tinman tomorrow and set him agog at his breakfast mr van diemen smith waved his hand for crickledon to lead the way hereupon ned crummins looked up from the card he had been turning over and over more and more like one arriving at a condemnatory judgment of a fish i cant go and give my master a card instead of his glass he remarked yes that reminds me and i should like to know what you meant by bringing that glass away from mr tinmans house at night said mr smith if im to pay for it ive a right to know whats the meaning of moving it at night eh lets hear nights not the time for moving big glasses like that im not so sure i havent got a case if youll step round to my master along o me sir said crummins perhaps hell explain crummins was requested to state who his master was and he replied phippun and company but mr smith positively refused to go with him but here said he is a crown for you for youre a civil fellow youll know where to find me in the morning and mind i shall expect phippun and company to give me a very good account of their reason for moving a big lookingglass on a night like this there be off the crownpiece in his hand effected a genial change in crummins disposition to communicate crickledon spoke to him about the glass two or three of the others present jogged him what did mr tinman want by having the glass moved so late in the day ned your master wasnt nervous about his property was he not he said crummins and began to suck down his upper lip and agitate his eyelids and stand uneasily glimmering signs of the setting in of the tide of narration he caught the eye of mr smith then looked abashed at miss crickledon saw his dilemma say whats uppermost ned never mind how you says it english is english mr tinman sent for you to take the glass away now did nt he he did said crummins and you went to him ay that i did and he fastened the chiwal glass upon your back he did that thats all plain sailing had he bought the glass no he had nt bought it hed hired it as when upon an enforced visit to the dentist people have had one tooth out the remaining offenders are more willingly submitted to the operation insomuch that a poetical licence might hazard the statement that they shed them like leaves of the tree so crummins who had shrunk from speech now volunteered whole sentences in succession and how important they were deemed by his fellowtownsman mr smith and especially miss annette smith could perceive in their ejaculations before they themselves were drawn into the strong current of interest and this was the matter tinman had hired the glass for three days latish on the very first day of the hiring close upon dark he had despatched imperative orders to phippun and company to take the glass out of his house on the spot and why because as he maintained there was a fault in the glass causing an incongruous and absurd reflection and he was at that moment awaiting the arrival of another chiwalglass cut along ned said crickledon what the deuce does he want with a chiwalglass at all cried mr smith endangering the flow of the story by suggesting to the narrator that he must hark back which to him was equivalent to the jumping of a chasm hindward happily his brain had seized a picture mr tinman hes astandin in his best court suit mr tinmaus old schoolmate gave a jump and no wonder standing he cried and as the act of standing was really not extraordinary he fixed upon the suit court so mrs cavely told me it was what he was standin in and as i found m i left m said crummins hes standing in it now said mr van diemen smith with a great gape crummins doggedly repeated the statement many would have ornamented it in the repetition but he was for bare flat truth he must be precious proud of having a court suit said mr smith and gazed at his daughter so glassily that she smiled though she was impatient to proceed to mrs crickledons lodgings oh theres where it is interjected the carpenter with a funny frown at a low word from ned crummins practicing is he mr tinmans practicing before the glass preparatory to his going to the palace in london he gave me a shillin said crummins crickledon comprehended him immediately we shant speak about it ned what did you see was thus cautiously suggested the shilling was on crummins tongue to check his betrayal of the secret scene but remembering that he had only witnessed it by accident and that mr tinman had not completely taken him into his confidence he thrust his hand down his pocket to finger the crownpiece lying in fellowship with the coin it multiplied five times and was inspired to think himself at liberty to say all i saw was when the door opened not the housedoor it was the parlourdoor i saw him walk up to the glass and walk back from the glass and when hed got up to the glass he bowed he did and he went backards just so doubtless the presence of a lady was the active agent that prevented crummins from doubling his body entirely and giving more than a rapid indication of the posture of mr tinman in his retreat before the glass but it was a glimpse of broad burlesque and though it was received with becoming sobriety by the men in the carpenters shop annette plucked at her fathers arm she could not get him to depart that picture of his old schoolmate martin tinman practicing before a chiwal glass to present himself at the palace in his court suit seemed to stupefy his australian intelligence what right has he got to go to court mr van diemen smith inquired like the foreigner he had become through exile mr tinmans bailiff of the town said crickledon and what was his objection to that glass i smashed hes rather an irritable gentleman crickledon murmured and turned to crummins crummins growled he said it was misty and gave him a twist what a big fool he must be eh mr smith glanced at crickledon and the other faces for the verdict of tinmans townsmen upon his character they had grounds for thinking differently of tinman hes no fool said crickledon another shook his head sharp at a bargain that he be said the chorus mr smith was informed that mr tinman would probably end by buying up half the town then said mr smith he can afford to pay half the money for that glass and pay he shall a serious view of the recent catastrophe was presented by his declaration in the midst of a colloquy regarding the cost of the glass during which it began to be seen by mr tinmans townsmen that there was laughing stuff for a year or so in the scene witnessed by crummins if they postponed a bit their right to the laugh and took it in doses annette induced her father to signal to crickledon his readiness to go and see the lodgings no sooner had he done it than he said what on earth made us wait all this time here im hungry my dear i want supper that is because you have had a disappointment i know you papa said annette yes its rather a damper about old mart tinman her father assented or else i have nt recovered the shock of smashing that glass and visit it on him but upon my honour hes my only friend in england i have nt a single relative that i know of and to come and find your only friend making a donkey of himself is enough to make a man think of eating and drinking annette murmured reproachfully we can hardly say he is our only friend in england papa can we do you mean that young fellow youll take my appetite away if you talk of him hes a stranger i dont believe hes worth a penny he owns hes what he calls a journalist these latter remarks were hurriedly exchanged at the threshold of crickledons house it dont look promising said mr smith i didnt recommend it said crickledon why the deuce do you let your lodgings then people who have come once come again oh i am in england annette sighed joyfully feeling at home in some trait she had detected in crickledon chapter iii the story of the shattered chiwalglass and the visit of tinmans old schoolmate fresh from australia was at many a breakfasttable before tinman heard a word of it and when he did he had no time to spare for such incidents for he was reading to his widowed sister martha in an impressive tone at a tolerably high pitch of the voice and with a suppressed excitement that shook away all things external from his mind as violently as it agitated his body not the waves without but the engine within it is which gives the shock and tremor to the crazy steamer forcing it to cut through the waves and scatter them to spray and so did martin tinman make light of the external attack of the card of van diemen smith and its pencilled line an old chum of yours eh matey even the communication of phippun co concerning the chiwal glass failed to divert him from his particular task it was indeed a public duty and the chiwalglass though pertaining to it was a private business he that has broken the glass let that man pay for it he pronouncedno doubt in simpler fashion being at his ease in his home but with the serenity of one uplifted as to the name van diemen smith he knew it not and so he said to himself while accurately recollecting the identity of the old chum who alone of men would have thought of writing eh matey mr van diemen smith did not present the card in person at crickledons he wrote apparently expecting the bailiff of the town to rush over to him before knowing who he was tinman was far too busy anybody can read plain penmanship or print but ask anybody not a cabinet minister or a lordinwaiting to read out loud and clear in a palace before a throne oh the nature of reading is distorted in a trice and as tinman said to his worthy sister i can do it but i must lose no time in preparing myself again at a reperusal he informed her i must habituate myself for this purpose he had put on the suit overnight the articulation of faultless english was his object his sister martha sat viceregally to receive his loyal congratulations on the illustrious marriage and she was pensive less nervous than her brother from not having to speak continuously yet somewhat perturbed she also had her task and it was to avoid thinking herself the person addressed by her suppliant brother while at the same time she took possession of the scholarly training and perfect knowledge of diction and rules of pronunciation which would infallibly be brought to bear on him in the terrible hour of the delivery of the address it was no small task moreover to be compelled to listen right through to the end of the address before the very gentlest word of criticism was allowed she did not exactly complain of the renewal of the rehearsal a fatigue can be endured when it is a joy what vexed her was her failing memory for the points of objection as in her imagined high seat she conceived them for in painful truth the instant her brother had finished she entirely lost her acuteness of ear and with that her recollection so there was nothing to do but to say excellent quite unobjectionable dear martin quite so she said and emphatically but the addition of the word only was printed on her contracted brow and every faculty of tinmans mind and nature being at strain just then he asked her testily what now whats the fault now she assured him with languor that there was not a fault its not your way of talking said he and what he said was true his discernment was extraordinary generally he noticed nothing not only were his perceptions quickened by the preparations for the day of great splendour day of a great furnace to be passed through likewise he was learning english at an astonishing rate into the bargain a pronouncing dictionary lay open on his table to this he flew at a hint of a contrary method and disputes verifications and triumphs on one side and the other ensued between brother and sister in his heart the agitated man believed his sister to be a misleading guide he dared not say it he thought it and previous to his african travel through the dictionary he had thought his sister infallible on these points he dared not say it because he knew no one else before whom he could practice and as it was confidence that he chiefly wantedabove all things confidence and confidence comes of practice he preferred the going on with his practice to an absolute certainty as to correctness at midday came another card from mr van diemen smith bearing the superscription alias phil r can it be possible tinman asked his sister that philip ribstone has had the audacity to return to this country i think he added i am right in treating whoever sends me this card as a counterfeit marthas advice was that he should take no notice of the card i am seriously engaged said tinman with a now then dear he resumed his labours messages had passed between tinman and phippun and in the afternoon phippun appeared to broach the question of payment for the chiwalglass he had seen mr van diemen smith had found him very strange rather impracticable he was obliged to tell tinman that he must hold him responsible for the glass nor could he send a second until payment was made for the first it really seemed as if tinman would be compelled by the force of circumstances to go and shake his old friend by the hand otherwise one could clearly see the man might be off he might be off at any minute leaving a legal contention behind him on the other hand supposing he had come to crikswich for assistance in money friendship is a good thing and so is hospitality which is an essentially english thing and consequently one that it behoves an englishman to think it his duty to perform but we do not extend it to paupers but should a pauper get so close to us as to lay hold of us vowing he was once our friend how shake him loose tinman foresaw that it might be a matter of five pounds thrown to the dogs perhaps ten counting the glass he put on his hat full of melancholy presentiments and it was exactly halfpast five oclock of the spring afternoon when he knocked at crickledons door had he looked into crickledons shop as he went by he would have perceived van diemen smith astride a piece of timber smoking a pipe van diemen saw tinman his eyes cocked and watered it is a disgraceful fact to record of him without periphrasis in truth the bearded fellow was almost a woman at heart and had come from the antipodes throbbing to slap martin tinman on the back squeeze his hand run over england with him treat him and talk of old times in the presence of a trotting regiment of champagne that affair of the chiwalglass had temporarily damped his enthusiasm the absence of a reply to his double transmission of cards had wounded him and something in the look of tinman disgusted his rough taste but the wellknown features recalled the days of youth tinman was his one living link to the country he admired as the conqueror of the world and imaginatively delighted in as the seat of pleasures and he could not discard the feeling of some love for tinman without losing his grasp of the reason why he had longed so fervently and travelled so breathlessly to return hither in the days of their youth van diemen had been tinmans cordial spirit at whom he sipped for cheerful visions of life and a good honest glow of emotion now and then whether it was odd or not that the sipper should be oblivious and the cordial spirit heartily reminiscent of those times we will not stay to inquire their meeting took place in crickledons shop tinman was led in by mrs crickledon his voice made a sound of metal in his throat and his air was that of a man buttoned up to the palate as he read from the card glancing over his eyelids mr van diemen smith i believe phil ribstone if you like said the other without rising oh ah indeed tinman temperately coughed yes dear me so it is it strikes you as odd the change of name said tinman not nature though ah have you been long in england time to run to helmstone and on here youve been lucky in business i hear thank you as things go do you think of remaining in england ive got to settle about a glass i broke last night ah i have heard of it yes i fear there will have to be a settlement i shall pay half of the damage youll have to stump up your part van diemen smiled roguishly we must discuss that said tinman smiling too as a patient in bed may smile at a doctors joke for he was as crickledon had said of him no fool on practical points and van diemens mention of the halfpayment reassured him as to his old friends position in the world and softly thawed him will you dine with me today i dont mind if i do ive a girl you remember little netty shes walking out on the beach with a young fellow named fellingham whose acquaintance we made on the voyage and has nt left us long to ourselves will you have her as well and i suppose you must ask him hes a newspaper man been round the world seen a lot tinman hesitated an electrical idea of putting sherry at fifteen shillings per dozen on his table instead of the ceremonial wine at twentyfive shillings assisted him to say hospitably oh ah yes any friend of yours and now perhaps youll shake my fist said van diemen with pleasure said tinman it was your change of name you know philip look here martin van diemen smith was a convict and my benefactor why the deuce he was so fond of that name i cant tell you but his dying wish was for me to take it and carry it on he left me his fortune for van diemen smith to enjoy life as he never did poor fellow when he was alive the money was got honestly by hard labour at a store he did evil once and repented after but by heavenvan diemen jumped up and thundered out of a broad chestthe man was one of the finest hearts that ever beat he was and im proud of him when he died i turned my thoughts home to old england and you martin oh said tinman and reminded by van diemens way of speaking that cordiality was expected of him he shook his limbs to some briskness and continued well yes we must all die in our native land if we can i hope youre comfortable in your lodgings ill give you one of mrs crickledons dinners to try youre as good as mayor of this town i hear i am the bailiff of the town said mr tinman youre going to court im told the appointment replied mr tinman will soon be made i have not yet an appointed day on the great highroad of life there is expectation and there is attainment and also there is envy mr tinmans posture stood for attainment shadowing expectation and sunning itself in the glass of envy as he spoke of the appointed day it was involuntary and naturally evanescent a momentary view of the spirit he unbent and begged to be excused for the present that he might go and apprise his sister of guests coming all right i daresay we shall see enough of one another said van diemen and almost before the creak of tinmans heels was deadened on the road outside the shop he put the funny question to crickledon do you box i make em crickledon replied because i should like to have a go in at something my friend van diemen stretched and yawned crickledon recommended the taking of a walk i think i will said the other and turned back abruptly how long do you work in the day generally all the hours of light crickledon replied and always up to suppertime youre healthy and happy nothing to complain of good appetite pretty regular you never take a holiday except sundays youd like to be working then i wont say that but youre glad to be up monday morning it feels cheerfuller in the shop and carpenterings your joy i think i may say so van diemen slapped his thigh theres life in old england yet crickledon eyed him as he walked away to the beach to look for his daughter and conceived that there was a touch of the soldier in him chapter iv annette smiths delight in her native england made her see beauty and kindness everywhere around her it put a halo about the house on the beach and thrilled her at tinmans table when she heard the thunder of the waves hard by she fancied it had been a most agreeable dinner to her father and mr herbert fellinghamespecially to the latter who had laughed very much and she was astonished to hear them at breakfast both complaining of their evening in answer to which she exclaimed oh i think the situation of the house is so romantic the situation of the host is exceedingly so said mr fellingham but i think his wine the most unromantic liquid i have ever tasted it must be that cried van diemen puzzled by novel pains in the head old martin woke up a little like his old self after dinner he drank sparingly said mr fellingham i am sure you were satirical last night annette said reproachfully on the contrary i told him i thought he was in a romantic situation but i have had a french mademoiselle for my governess and an oxford gentleman for my tutor and i know you accepted french and english from mr tinman and his sister that i should not have approved netty said van diemen has had the best instruction money could procure and if she says you were satirical you may depend on it you were oh in that case of course mr fellingham rejoined who could help it he thought himself warranted in giving the rein to his wicked satirical spirit and talked lightly of the accidental character of the letter h in tinmans pronunciation of how like somebody elses hat in a high wind it descended on somebody elses head and of how his words walked about asking one another who they were and what they were doing danced together madly snapping their fingers at signification and so forth he was flippant annette glanced at her father and dropped her eyelids mr fellingham perceived that he was enjoined to be on his guard he went one step farther in his fun upon which van diemen said with a frown if you please nothing could withstand that hang old mart tinmans wine van diemen burst out in the dead pause my heads a bullet im in a shocking bad temper i can hardly see im bilious mr fellingham counselled his lying down for an hour and he went grumbling complaining of mart tinmans incredulity about the towering beauty of a place in australia called gippsland annette confided to mr fellingham as soon as they were alone the chivalrous nature of her father in his friendships and his indisposition to hear a satirical remark upon his old schoolmate the moment he understood it to be satire fellingham pleaded the mans a perfect burlesque hes as distinctly made to be laughed at as a mask in a pantomime papa will not think so said annette and papa has been told that he is not to be laughed at as a man of business do you prize him for that i am no judge i am too happy to be in england to be a judge of anything you did not touch his wine you men attach so much importance to wine they do say that powders is a good thing after mr tinmans wine observed mrs crickledon who had come into the sittingroom to take away the breakfast things mr fellingham gave a peal of laughter but mrs crickledon bade him be hushed for mr van diemen smith had gone to lay down his poor aching head on his pillow annette ran upstairs to speak to her father about a doctor during her absence mr fellingham received the popular portrait of mr tinman from the lips of mrs crickledon he subsequently strolled to the carpenters shop and endeavoured to get a confirmation of it my wife talks too much said crickledon when questioned by a gentleman however he was naturally bound to answer to the extent of his knowledge what a funny old country it is mr fellingham said to annette on their walk to the beach she implored him not to laugh at anything english i dont i assure you said he i love the country too but when one comes back from abroad and plunges into their daily life its difficult to retain the real figure of the old country seen from outside and one has to remember half a dozen great names to right oneself and englishmen are so funny your father comes here to see his old friend and begins boasting of the gippsland he has left behind tinman immediately brags of helvellyn and they fling mountains at one another till on their first evening together theres earthquake and rupture they were nearly at fisticuffs at one time oh surely no said annette i did not hear them they were good friends when you came to the drawingroom perhaps the wine did affect poor papa if it was bad wine i wish men would never drink any how much happier they would be but then there would cease to be social meetings in england what should we do i know that is a sneer and you were nearly as enthusiastic as i was on board the vessel annette said sadly quite true i was but see what quaint creatures we have about us tinman practicing in his court suit before the chiwalglass and that good fellow the carpenter crickledon who has lived with the sea fronting him all his life and has never been in a boat and he confesses he has only once gone inland and has never seen an acorn i wish i could see oneof a real english oak said annette and after being in england a few months you will be sighing for the continent never you think you will be quite contented here i am sure i shall be may papa and i never be exiles again i did not feel it when i was three years old going out to australia but it would be like death to me now oh annette shivered as with the exiles chill on my honour said mr fellingham as softly as he could with the wind in his teeth i love the old country ten times more from your love of it that is not how i want england to be loved returned annette the love is in your hands she seemed indifferent on hearing it he should have seen that the way to woo her was to humour her prepossession by another passion he could feel that it ennobled her in the abstract but a latent spite at tinman on account of his wine to which he continued angrily to attribute as unwonted dizziness of the head and slight irascibility made him urgent in his desire that she should separate herself from tinman and his sister by the sharp division of derision annette declined to laugh at the most risible caricatures of tinman in her antagonism she forced her simplicity so far as to say that she did not think him absurd and supposing mr tinman to have proposed to the titled widow lady ray as she had heard and to other ladies young and middleaged in the neighbourhood why should he not if he wished to marry if he was economical surely he had a right to manage his own affairs her dread was lest mr tinman and her father should quarrel over the payment for the broken chiwalglass that she honestly admitted and fellingham was so indiscreet as to roar aloud not so very cordially annette thought him unkindly satirical and his thoughts of her reduced her to the condition of a commonplace girl with expressive eyes she had to return to her father mr fellingham took a walk on the springy turf along the cliffs and certainly she is a commonplace girl he began by reflecting with a side eye at the fact that his meditations were excited by tinmans poisoning of his bile a girl who cant see the absurdity of tinman must be destitute of common intelligence after a while he sniffed the fine sharp air of mingled earth and sea delightedly and he strode back to the town late in the afternoon laughing at himself in scorn of his wretched susceptibility to bilious impressions and really all but hating tinman as the cause of his weaknessin the manner of the criminal hating the detective perhaps he cast it altogether on tinman that annettes complexion of character had become discoloured to his mind for in spite of the physical freshness with which he returned to her society he was incapable of throwing off the idea of her being commonplace and it was with regret that he acknowledged he had gained from his walk only a higher opinion of himself her father was the victim of a sick headache migrainedwand lay a groaning man on his bed ministered to by mrs crickledon chiefly annette had to conduct the business with mr phippun and mr tinman as to payment for the chiwalglass she was commissioned to offer half the price for the glass on her fathers part more he would not pay tinman and phippun sat with her in crickledons cottage and mrs crickledon brought down two messages from her invalid each positive to the effect that he would fight with all the arms of english law rather than yield his point tinman declared it to be quite out of the question that he should pay a penny phippun vowed that from one or the other of them he would have the money annette naturally was in deep distress and fellingham postponed the discussion to the morrow even after such a taste of tinman as that annette could not be induced to join in deriding him privately she looked pained by mr fellinghams cruel jests it was monstrous fellingham considered that he should draw on himself a second reprimand from van diemen smith while they were consulting in entire agreement upon the case of the chiwalglass i must tell you this mister sir said van diemen i like you but ill be straightforward and truthful or im not worthy the name of englishman and i do like you or i should nt have given you leave to come down here after us two you must respect my friend if you care for my respect thats it there it is now you know my conditions i m afraid i cant sign the treaty said fellingham heres more said van diemen im a chilly man myself if i hear a laugh and think i know the aim of it ill meet what you like except scorn i cant stand contempt so i feel for another and now you know it puts a stopper on the play of fancy and checks the throwing off of steam fellingham remonstrated i promise to do my best but of all the men ive ever met in my lifetinmanthe ridiculous pray pardon me but the donkey and his lookingglass the glass was misty heas particular about his reflection in the glass as a poet with his verses advance retire bow and such murder of the queens english in the very presence if i thought he was going to take his wine with him id have him arrested for high treason youve chosen and you know what you best like said van diemen pointing his accentsby which is produced the awkward pause the pitfall of conversation and sometimes of amity thus it happened that mr herbert fellingham journeyed back to london a day earlier than he had intended and without saying what he meant to say chapter v a month later after a night of sharp frost on the verge of the warmer days of spring mr fellingham entered crikswich under a sky of perfect blue that was in brilliant harmony with the green downs the white cliffs and sparkling sea and no doubt it was the beauty before his eyes which persuaded him of his delusion in having taken annette for a commonplace girl he had come in a merely curious mood to discover whether she was one or not who but a commonplace girl would care to reside in crikswich he had asked himself and now he was full sure that no commonplace girl would ever have had the idea exquisitely simple she certainly was but that may well be a distinction in a young lady whose eyes are expressive the sound of sawing attracted him to crickledons shop and the industrious carpenter soon put him on the tide of affairs crickledon pointed to the house on the beach as the place where mr van diemen smith and his daughter were staying dear me and how does he look said fellingham our town seems to agree with him sir well i must not say any more i suppose fellingham checked his tongue how have they settled that dispute about the chiwalglass mr tinman had to give way really but crickledon stopped work mr tinman sold him a meadow i see mr smith has been buying a goodish bit of ground here they tell me hes about purchasing elba he has bought the crouch he and mr tinman are always out together theyre over at helmstone now theyve been to london are they likely to be back today certain i should think mr tinman has to be in london tomorrow crickledon looked he was not the man to look artful but there was a lighted corner in his look that revived fellinghams recollections and the latter burst out the address i d half forgotten it thats not over yet has he been practicing much no more glasses ha been broken and how is your wife crickledon shes at home sir ready for a talk if youve a mind to try her mrs crickledon proved to be very ready that tinman was her theme he had taken away her lodgers and she knew his objects mr smith repented of leaving her she knew though he dared not say it in plain words she knew miss smith was tired to death of constant companionship with mrs cavely tinmans sister she generally came once in the day just to escape from mrs cavely who would not bless you step into a cottagers house where she was not allowed to patronize fortunately miss smith had induced her father to get his own wine from the merchants a happy resolution said fellingham and a saving one he heard further that mr smith would take possession of the crouch next month and that mrs cavely hung over miss smith like a kite and that old tinman old enough to be her father said mrs crickledon she dealt in the flashes which connect ideas fellingham though a man and an englishman was nervously wakeful enough to see the connection theyll have to consult the young lady first maam if its her fathers nod shell bow to it now mark me mrs crickledon said with emphasis shes a young lady who thinks for herself but she takes her start from her father where its feeling and hes gone stone blind over that tinman while they were speaking annette appeared i saw you she said to fellingham gladly and openly in the most commonplace manner are you going to give me a walk along the beach said he she proposed the country behind the town and that was quite as much to his taste but it was not a happy walk he had decided that he admired her and the notion of having tinman for a rival annoyed him he overflowed with ridicule of tinman and this was distressing to annette because not only did she see that he would not control himself before her father but he kindled her own satirical spirit in opposition to her fathers friendly sentiments toward his old schoolmate mr tinman has been extremely hospitable to us she said a little coldly may i ask you has he consented to receive instruction in deportment and pronunciation annette did not answer if practice makes perfect he must be near the mark by this time she continued silent i dare say in domestic life hes as amiable as he is hospitable and it must be a daily gratification to see him in his court suit i have not seen him in his court suit that is his coyness people talk of those things the common people scandalize the great about whom they know nothing you mean i am sure that is true and living in courts one must be keenly aware of it but what a splendid sky andsea is it not annette echoed his false rapture with a candour that melted him he was preparing to make up for lost time when the wild waving of a parasol down a road to the right coming from the town caused annette to stop and say i think that must be mrs cavely we ought to meet her fellingham asked why she is so fond of walks anisette replied with a tooth on her lip fellingham thought she seemed fond of runs mrs cavely joined them breathless my dear the pace you go at she shouted i saw you starting i followed i ran i tore along i feared i never should catch you and to lose such a morning of english scenery is it not heavenly one cant say more fellingham observed bowing i am sure i am very glad to see you again sir you enjoy crikswich once visited always desired like venice maam may i venture to inquire whether mr tinman has presented his address the day after tomorrow the appointment is made with him said mrs cavely more officially in manner for the day after tomorrow he is excited as you may well believe but mr smith is an immense relief to himthe very distraction he wanted we have become one family you know indeed maam i did not know it said fellingham the communication imparted such satiric venom to his further remarks that annette resolved to break her walk and dismiss him for the day he called at the house on the beach after the dinnerhour to see mr van diemen smith when there was literally a duel between him and tinman for van diemens contribution to the table was champagne and that had been drunk but tinmans sherry remained tinman would insist on fellinghams taking a glass fellingham parried him with a sedate gravity of irony that was painfully perceptible to anisette van diemen at last backed tinmans hospitable intent and to fellinghams astonishment he found that he had been supposed by these two men to be bashfully retreating from a seductive offer all the time that his tricks of fence and transpiercings of one of them had been marvels of skill tinman pushed the glass into his hand you have spilt some said fellingham it wont hurt the carpet said tinman wont it fellingham gazed at the carpet as if expecting a flame to arise he then related the tale of the magnanimous alexander drinking off the potion in scorn of the slanderer to show faith in his friend alexanderwho was that said tinman foiled in his historical recollections by the absence of the surname general alexander said fellingham alexander philipson or he declared it was joveson and very fond of wine but his sherry did for him at last ah he drank too much then said tinman of his own anisette admonished the vindictive young gentleman by saying how long do you stay in crikswich mr fellingham he had grossly misconducted himself but an adversary at once offensive and helpless provokes brutality anisette prudently avoided letting her father understand that satire was in the air and neither he nor tinman was conscious of it exactly yet both shrank within themselves under the sensation of a devilish blast blowing fellingham accompanied them and certain jurats to london next day yes if you like when a mayor visits majesty it is an important circumstance and you are at liberty to argue at length that it means more than a desire on his part to show his writing power and his reading power it is full of comfort the people as an exhibition of their majesty likewise and it is an encouragement to men to strive to become mayors bailiffs or prime men of any sort but a stress in the reporting of itthe making it appear too important a circumstancewill surely breathe the intimation to a politicallyminded people that satire is in the air and however dearly they cherish the privilege of knocking at the first door of the kingdom and walking ceremoniously in to read their writings they will if they are not in one of their moods for prostration laugh they will laugh at the report all the greater reason is it that we should not indulge them at such periods and i say woes me for any brother of the pen and one in some esteem who dressed the report of that presentation of the address of congratulation by mr bailiff tinman of crikswich herbert fellingham wreaked his personal spite on tinman he should have bethought him that it involved another than tinman that is to say an officewhich the fitful beast rejoices to paw and play with contemptuously now and then one may think as a solace to his pride and an indemnification for those caprices of abject worship so strongly recalling the days we see through mr darwins glasses he should not have written the report it sent a titter over england he was so unwise as to despatch a copy of the newspaper containing it to van diemen smith van diemen perused it with satisfaction so did tinman both of these praised the able young writer but they handed the paper to the coastguard lieutenant who asked tinman how he liked it and visitors were beginning to drop in to crikswich who made a point of asking for a sight of the chief man and then came a comic publication all in the republican tone of the time with mans dignity for the standpoint and the wheezy laughter residing in old puns to back it in eulogy of the satiric report of the famous address of congratulation of the bailiff of crikswich annette van diemen said to his daughter youll not encourage that newspaper fellow to come down here any more he had his warning chapter vi one of the most difficult lessons for spirited young men to learn is that good jokes are not always good policy they have to be paid for like good dinners though dinner and joke shall seem to have been at somebody elses expense young fellingham was treated rudely by van diemen smith and with some cold reserve by annette in consequence of which he thought her more than ever commonplace he wrote her a letter of playful remonstrance followed by one that appealed to her sentiments but she replied to neither of them so his visits to crikswich came to an end shall a girl who has no appreciation of fun affect us her expressive eyes and her quaint simplicity and her enthusiasm for england haunted mr fellingham being conjured up by contrast with what he met about him but shall a girl who would impose upon us the task of holding in our laughter at tinman be much regretted there could be no companionship between us fellingham thought on an excursion to the english lakes he saw the name of van diemen smith in a visitors book and changed his ideas on the subject of companionship among mountains or on the sea or reading history annette was one in a thousand he happened to be at a public ball at helmstone in the winter season and who but annette herself came whirling before him on the arm of an officer fellingham did not miss his chance of talking to her she greeted him gaily and speaking with the excitement of the dance upon her appeared a stranger to the serious emotions he was willing to cherish she had been to the lakes and to scotland next summer she was going to wales all her experiences were delicious she was insatiable but satisfied i wish i had been with you said fellingham i wish you had said she mrs cavely was her chaperon at the ball and he was not permitted to enjoy a lengthened conversation sitting with annette what was he to think of a girl who could be submissive to mrs cavely and danced with any number of officers and had no idea save of running incessantly over england in the pursuit of pleasure her tone of saying i wish you had was that of the most ordinary of wishes distinctly if not designedly different from his own melodious depth she granted him one waltz and he talked of her father and his whimsical vagrancies and feeling he had a positive liking for van diemen and he sagaciously said so annettes eyes brightened then why do you never go to see him he has bought elba we move into the hall after christmas we are at the crouch at present papa will be sure to make you welcome do you not know that he never forgets a friend or breaks a friendship i do and i love him for it said fellingham if he was not greatly mistaken a gentle pressure on the fingers of his left hand rewarded him this determined him it should here be observed that he was by birth the superior of annettes parentage and such is the sentiment of a better blood that the flattery of her warm touch was needed for him to overlook the distinction two of his visits to crikswich resulted simply in interviews and conversations with mrs crickledon van diemen and his daughter were in london with tinman and mrs cavely purchasing furniture for elba hall mrs crickledon had no scruple in saying that mrs cavely meant her brother to inhabit the hall though mr smith had outbid him in the purchase according to her tinman and mr smith had their differences for mr smith was a very outspoken gentleman and had been known to call tinman names that no man of spirit would bear if he was not scheming fellingham returned to london where he roamed the streets famous for furniture warehouses in the vain hope of encountering the new owner of elba failing in this endeavour he wrote a loveletter to annette it was her first she had liked him her manner of thinking she might love him was through the reflection that no one stood in the way the letter opened a world to her broader than great britain fellingham begged her if she thought favourably of him to prepare her father for the purport of his visit if otherwise she was to interdict the visit with as little delay as possible and cut him adrift a decided line of conduct was imperative yet you have seen that she was not in love she was only not unwilling to be in love and fellingham was just a trifle warmed now mark what events will do to light the fires van diemen and tinman old chums reunited and both successful in life had nevertheless as mrs crickledon said their differences they commenced with an opposition to tinmans views regarding the expenditure of town moneys tinman was ever for devoting them to the patriotic defence of our shores whereas van diemen pointing in detestation of the town sewerage reeking across the common under the beach loudly called on him to preserve our lives by way of commencement then van diemen precipitately purchased elba at a high valuation and tinman had expected by waiting to buy it at his own valuation and sell it out of friendly consideration to his friend afterwards for a friendly consideration van diemen had joined the hunt tinman could not mount a horse they had not quarrelled but they had snapped about these and other affairs van diemen fancied tinman was jealous of his wealth tinman shrewdly suspected van diemen to be contemptuous of his dignity he suffered a loss in a loan of money and instead of pitying him van diemen had laughed him to scorn for expecting security for investments at ten per cent the bitterness of the pinch to tinman made him frightfully sensitive to strictures on his discretion in his anguish he told his sister he was ruined and she advised him to marry before the crash she was aware that he exaggerated but she repeated her advice she went so far as to name the person this is known because she was overheard by her housemaid a gossip of mrs crickledons the subsequently famous little jane now annette had shyly intimated to her father the nature of herbert fellinghams letter at the same time professing a perfect readiness to submit to his directions and her fathers perplexity was very great for annette had rather fervently dramatized the young mans words at the ball at helmstone which had pleasantly tickled him and besides he liked the young man on the other hand he did not at all like the prospect of losing his daughter and he would have desired her to be a lady of title he hinted at her right to claim a high position annette shrank from the prospect saying never let me marry one who might be ashamed of my father i shouldnt stomach that said van diemen more disposed in favour of the present suitor annette was now in a tremor she had a lover he was coming and if he did not come did it matter not so very much except to her pride and if he did what was she to say to him she felt like an actress who may in a few minutes be called on the stage without knowing her part this was painfully unlike love and the poor girl feared it would be her conscientious duty to dismiss himmost gently of course and perhaps should he be impetuous and picturesque relent enough to let him hope and so bring about a happy postponement of the question her father had been to a neighbouring town on business with mr tinman he knocked at her door at midnight and she in dread of she knew not whatchiefly that the hour of the scene had somehow struckstepped out to him trembling he was alone she thought herself the most childish of mortals in supposing that she could have been summoned at midnight to declare her sentiments and hardly noticed his gloomy depression he asked her to give him five minutes then asked her for a kiss and told her to go to bed and sleep but annette had seen that a great present affliction was on him and she would not be sent to sleep she promised to listen patiently to bear anything to be brave is it bad news from home she said speaking of the old home where she had not left her heart and where his money was invested its this my dear netty said van diemen suffering her to lead him into her sittingroom we shall have to leave the shores of england then we are ruined were not the rascal cant do that we might be off to the continent or we might go to america weve money but we cant stay here ill not live at any mans mercy the continent america exclaimed the enthusiast for england oh papa you love living in england so not so much as all that my dear you do that i know but i dont see how its to be managed mart tinman and i have been at tooth and claw today and half the night and he has thrown off the mask or hes dashed something from my sight i dont know which i knocked him down papa i picked him up oh cried annette has mr tinman been hurt he called me a deserter anisette shuddered she did not know what this thing was but the name of it opened a cabinet of horrors and she touched her father timidly to assure him of her constant love and a little to reassure herself of his substantial identity and i am one van diemen made the confession at the pitch of his voice i am a deserter im liable to be branded on the back and its in mart tinmans power to have me marched away tomorrow morning in the sight of crikswich and all i can say for myself as a man and a briton is i did not desert before the enemy that i swear i never would have done death if deaths in front but your poor mother was a handsome woman my child and therei could not go on living in barracks and leaving her unprotected i cant tell a young woman the tale a hundred pounds came on me for a legacy as plump in my hands out of open heaven and your poor mother and i saw our chance we consulted and we determined to risk it and i got on board with her and you and over the seas we went first to shipwreck ultimately to fortune van diemen laughed miserably they noticed in the huntingfield here i had a soldierlike seat a soldierlike seat itll be with a brand on it i shant be asked to take a soldierlike seat at any of their tables again i may at mart tinmans out of pity after ive undergone my punishment theres a year still to run out of the twenty of my term of service due he knows it hes been reckoning he has me but the worst catoninetails for me is the disgrace to have myself pointed at there goes the deserter he was a private in the carbineers and he deserted no onell say ay but he clung to the idea of his old schoolmate when abroad and came back loving him and trusted him and was deceived van diemen produced a spasmodic cough with a blow on his chest anisette was weeping there now go to bed said he i wish you might have known no more than you did of our flight when i got you on board the ship with your poor mother but youre a young woman now and you must help me to think of another cut and run and what baggage we can scrape together in a jiffy for i wont live here at mart tinmans mercy drying her eyes to weep again annette said when she could speak will nothing quiet him i was going to bother you with all sorts of silly questions poor dear papa but i see i can understand if i try will nothingis he so very angry can we not do something to pacify him he is fond of money heoh the thought of leaving england papa it will kill you you set your whole heart on england we couldi couldcould i not do you not thinkstep between you as a peacemaker mr tinman is always very courteous to me at these words of annettes van diemen burst into a short snap of savage laughter but thats far away in the background mr mart tinman he said you stick to your game i know that but youll find me flown though i leave a name to stink like your common behind me and he added as a chill reminder that name the name of my benefactor poor old van diemen he thought it a safe bequest to make it was it is we will stay we will not be exiled said annette i will do anything what was the quarrel about papa the fact is my dear i just wanted to show himand take down his prideim by my australian education a shrewder hand than his old country i bought the house on the beach while he was chaffering and then i sold it him at a rise when the town was looking uponly to make him see then he burst up about something i said of australia i will have the common clean let him live at the crouch as my tenant if he finds the house on the beach in danger papa i am sure annette repeatedsure i have influence with mr tinman there are those lips of yours shutting tight said her father just listen and they make a big o the donkey he owns youve got influence and he offers hell be silent if youll pledge your word to marry him im not sure he didnt say within the year i told him to look sharp not to be knocked down again mart tinman for my soninlaw thats an upside down of my expectations as good as being at the antipodes without a second voyage back i let him know you were engaged annette gazed at her father openmouthed as he had predicted now with a little chilly dimple at one corner of the mouth now at anotheras a breeze curves the leaden winter lake here and there she could not get his meaning into her sight and she sought by looking hard to understand it better much as when some solitary maiden lady passing into her bedchamber in the hours of darkness beholdstradition telling us she has absolutely beheld foot of burglar under bed and lo she stares and cunningly to moderate her horror doubts yet cannot but believe that there is a leg and a trunk and a head and two terrible arms bearing pistols to follow sick she palpitates she compresses her trepidation she coughs perchance she sings a bar or two of an aria glancing down again thrice horrible to her is it to discover that there is no foot for had it remained it might have been imagined a harmless empty boot but the withdrawal has a deadly significance of animal life in like manner our stricken annette perceived the object so did she gradually apprehend the fact of her being asked for tinmans bride and she could not think it credible she half scented she devised her plan of escape from another single mention of it but on her fathers remarking with a shuffle frightened by her countenance dont listen to what i said netty i wont paint him blacker than he isthen annette was sure she had been proposed for by mr tinman and she fancied her father might have revolved it in his mind that there was this means of keeping tinman silent silent for ever in his own interests it was not true when you told mr tinman i was engaged papa she said no i know that mart tinman only halfkind of hinted come i say wheres the unmarried man wouldnt like to have a girl like you netty they say hes been rejected all round a circuit of fifteen miles and hes not badlooking neitherhe looks fresh and fair but i thought it as well to let him know he might get me at a disadvantage but he couldnt you now dont think about it my love not if it is not necessary papa said annette and employed her familiar sweetness in persuading him to go to bed as though he were the afflicted one requiring to be petted chapter vii round under the cliffs by the sea facing south are warm seats in winter the sun that shines there on a day of frost wraps you as in a mantle here it was that mr herbert fellingham found annette a chalk block for her chair and a mound of chalkrubble defending her from the keentipped breath of the east now and then shadowing the smooth blue water faintly like reflections of a flight of gulls infants are said to have their ideas and why not young ladies those who write of their perplexities in descriptions comical in their length are unkind to them by making them appear the simplest of the creatures of fiction and most of us i am sure would incline to believe in them if they were only some bit more lightly touched those troubled sentiments of our young lady of the comfortable classes are quite worthy of mention her poor little eye poring as little fishlike as possible upon the intricate which she takes for the infinite has its place in our history nor should we any of us miss the pathos of it were it not that so large a space is claimed for the exposure as it is one has almost to fight a battle to persuade the world that she has downright thoughts and feelings and really a superhuman delicacy is required in presenting her that she may be credible even thenso much being accomplished the thousands accustomed to chapters of her when she is in the situation of annette will be disappointed by short sentences just as of old the continental eater of oysters would have been offended at the offer of an exchange of two live for two dozen dead ones annette was in the grand crucial position of english imaginative prose i recognize it and that to this the streamlets flow thence pours the flood but what was the plain truth she had brought herself to think she ought to sacrifice herself to tinman and her evasions with herbert manifested in tricks of coldness alternating with tones of regret ended as they had commenced in a mysterious halfsullenness she had hardly a word to say let me step in again to observe that she had at the moment no pointed intention of marrying tinman to her mind the circumstances compelled her to embark on the idea of doing so and she saw the extremity in an extreme distance as those who are taking voyages may see death by drowning still she had embarked at all events i have your word for it that you dont dislike me said herbert oh no she sighed she liked him as emigrants the land they are leaving and you have not promised your hand no she said but sighed in thinking that if she could be induced to promise it there would not be a word of leaving england then as you are not engaged and dont hate me i have a chance he said in the semiwailful interrogative of an organ making a mere windy conclusion ocean sent up a tiny wave at their feet a day like this in winter is rarer than a summer day herbert resumed encouragingly annette was replying people abuse our climate but the thought of having to go out away from this climate in the darkness of exile with her father to suffer under it worse than herself overwhelmed her and fetched the reality of her sorrow in the form of tinman swimming before her soul with the velocity of a telegraphpole to the window of the flying train it was past as soon as seen but it gave her a desperate sensation of speed she began to feel that this was life in earnest and herbert should have been more resolute fierier she needed a strong will but he was not on the rapids of the masterful passion for though going at a certain pace it was by his own impulsion and i am afraid i must with many apologies compare him to the skaterto the skater on easy slippery ice be it understood but he could perform gyrations as he went and he rather sailed along than dashed he was careful of his figuring some lovers right honest lovers never get beyond this quaint skatingstage and some ladies a right goodly number in a foggy climate deceived by their occasional runs ahead take them for vessels on the very torrent of love let them take them and let the race continue only we perceive that they are skating they are careering over a smooth icy floor and they can stop at a signal with just halfayard of grating on the heel at the outside ice and not fire nor falling water has been their medium of progression whether a man should unveil his own sex is quite another question if we are detected not solely are we done for but our lovetales too however there is not much ground for anxiety on that head each member of the other party is blind on her own account to annette the figuring of herbert was graceful but it did not catch her up and carry her it hardly touched her he spoke well enough to make her sorry for him and not warmly enough to make her forget her sorrow for herself herbert could obtain no explanation of the singularity of her conduct from annette and he went straight to her father who was nearly as inexplicable for a time at last he said if you are ready to quit the country with us you may have my consent why quit the country herbert asked in natural amazement van diemen declined to tell him but seeing the young man look stupefied and wretched he took a turn about the room and said i have nt robbed and after more turns i have nt murdered he growled in his menagerie trot within the four walls but im in a mans power will that satisfy you youll tell me because im rich to snap my fingers i cant ive got feelings im in his power to hurt me and disgrace me its the disgraceto my disgrace i say iti dread most youd be up to my reason if you had ever served in a regiment i mean disciplineif ever youd known disciplinein the police if you likeanythinganywhere where theres what we used to call spiny de cor i mean at school and im said van diemen a rank idiot double d dolt and flat as a pancake and transparent as a pane of glass you see through me anybody could i cant talk of my botheration without betraying myself what good am i among you sharp fellows in england language of this kind by virtue of its unintelligibility set mr herbert fellinghams acute speculations at work he was obliged to lean on van diemens assertion that he had not robbed and had not murdered to be comforted by the belief that he was not once a notorious bushranger or a defaulting manager of mines or any other thing that is naughtily australian and kangarooly he sat at the dinnertable at elba eating like the rest of mankind and looking like a starved beggarman all the while annette in pity of his bewilderment would have had her father take him into their confidence she suggested it covertly and next she spoke of it to him as a prudent measure seeing that mr fellingham might find out his exact degree of liability van diemen shouted he betrayed himself in his weakness as she could not have imagined him he was ready to go he saidgo on the spot give up elba fly from old england what he could not do was to let his countrymen know what he was and live among them afterwards he declared that the fact had eternally been present to his mind devouring him and annette remembered his kindness to the artillerymen posted along the shore westward of crikswich though she could recall no sign of remorse van diemen said we have to do with martin tinman thats one who has a hold on me and ones enough leak out my secret to a second fellow you double my risks he would not be taught to see how the second might counteract the first the singularity of the action of his character on her position was that though she knew not a soul to whom she could unburden her wretchedness and stood far more isolated than in her australian home fever and chill struck her blood in contemplation of the necessity of quitting england deep then was her gratitude to dear good mrs cavely for stepping in to mediate between her father and mr tinman and well might she be amazed to hear the origin of their recent dispute it was mrs cavely said that gippsland annette cried what that gippsland of yours my dear your father will praise gippsland whenever my martin asks him to admire the beauties of our neighbourhood many a time has martin come home to me complaining of it we have no doubt on earth that gippsland is a very fine place but my brother has his ideas of dignity you must know and i only wish he had been more used to contradiction you may believe me he is a lamb by nature and as he says why underrate ones own country he cannot bear to hear boasting well i put it to you dear annette is he so unimportant a person he asks to be respected and especially by his dearest friend from that to blows its the way with men they begin about trifles they drink they quarrel and one does what he is sorry for and one says more than he means all my martin desires is to shake your dear fathers hand forgive and forget to win your esteem darling annette he would humble himself in the dust will you not help me to bring these two dear old friends together once more it is unreasonable of your dear papa to go on boasting of gippsland if he is so fond of england now is it not my brother is the offended party in the eye of the law that is quite certain do you suppose he dreams of taking advantage of it he is waiting at home to be told he may call on your father rank dignity wounded feelings is nothing to him in comparison with friendship annette thought of the blow which had felled him and spoke the truth of her heart in saying he is very generous you understand him mrs cavely pressed her hand we will both go to your dear father he may she added not without a gleam of feminine archness praise gippsland above the himalayas to me what my martin so much objected to was the speaking of gippsland at all when there was mention of our lake scenery as for me i know how men love to boast of things nobody else has seen the two ladies went in company to van diemen who allowed himself to be melted he was reserved nevertheless his reception of mr tinman displeased his daughter annette attached the blackest importance to a blow of the fist in her mind it blazed fiendlike and the man who forgave it rose a step or two on the sublime especially did he do so considering that he had it in his power to dismiss her father and herself from bright beaming england before she had looked on all the cathedrals and churches the seashores and spots named in printed poetry to say nothing of the nobility papa you were not so kind to mr tinman as i could have hoped said annette mart tinman has me at his mercy and hell make me know it her father returned gloomily he may let me off with the commanderinchief hell blast my reputation some day though i shall be hanging my head in society through him van diemen imitated the disconsolate appearance of a gallows body in one of those rapid flashes of spontaneous verisimilitude which spring of an inborn horror painting itself on the outside a deserter he moaned he succeeded in impressing the terrible nature of the stigma upon annettes imagination the guest at elba was busy in adding up the sum of his own impressions and dividing it by this and that new circumstance for he was totally in the dark he was attracted by the mysterious interview of mrs cavely and annette tinmans calling and departing set him upon new calculations annette grew cold and visibly distressed by her consciousness of it she endeavoured to account for this variation of mood we have been invited to dine at the house on the beach tomorrow i would not have accepted but papa we seemed to think it a duty of course the invitation extends to you we fancy you do not greatly enjoy dining there the table will be laid for you here if you prefer herbert preferred to try the skill of mrs crickledon now for positive penetration the head prepossessed by a suspicion is unmatched for where there is no daylight this one at least goes about with a lantern herbert begged mrs crickledon to cook a dinner for him and then to give the right colour to his absence from the table of mr tinman he started for a winter days walk over the downs as sharpening a business as any young fellow blunt or keen may undertake excellent for men of the pen whether they be creative and produce or slaughtering and review good then for the silly sheep of letters and the butchers he sat down to mrs crickledons table at halfpast six she was as she had previously informed him a fortypoundayear cook at the period of her courting by crickledon that zealous and devoted husband had made his first excursion inland to drop over the downs to the great house and fetch her away as his bride on the death of her master sir alfred pooney who never would have parted with her in life and every day of that mans life he dirtied thirteen plates at dinner nor more nor less but exactly that number as if he believed there was luck in it and as crickledon said it was odd but it was always a pleasure to cook for him mrs crickledon could not abide cooking for a mean eater and when crickledon said he had never seen an acorn he might have seen one had he looked about him in the great park under the oaks on the day when he came to be married then its a standing compliment to you mrs crickledon that he did not said herbert he remarked with the sententiousness of enforced philosophy that no wine was better than bad wine mrs crickledon spoke of a bottle left by her summer lodgers who had indeed left two calling the wine invalids wine and she and her husband had opened one on the anniversary of their marriage day in october it had the taste of doctors shop they both agreed and as no friend of theirs could be tempted beyond a sip they were advised because it was called a tonic to mix it with the pigwash so that it should not be entirely lost but benefit the constitution of the pig herbert sipped at the remaining bottle and finding himself in the superior society of an old manzanilla refilled his glass nothing i knows of proves the difference between gentlefolks and poor persons as tastes in wine said mrs crickledon admiring him as she brought in a dish of cutletswith sir alfred pooneys favourite sauce soubise wherein rightly onion should be delicate as the idea of love in maidens thoughts albeit constituting the element of flavour something of such a dictum sir alfred pooney had imparted to his cook and she repeated it with the fresh elegance of such sweet sayings when transfused through the native mind he said i like as it was what you would call a young gals blush at a kiss round a corner the epicurean baronet had the habit of talking in that way herbert drank to his memory he was wellfilled he had no work to do and he was exuberant in spirits as mrs crickledon knew her countrymen should and would be under those conditions and suddenly he drew his hand across a forehead so wrinkled and dark that mrs crickledon exclaimed heart or stomach oh no said he im sound enough in both i hope that old tinmans up to one of his games she observed do you think so hes circumventing miss annette smith pooh crickledon a man of his age cant be seriously thinking of proposing for a young lady hes a wellkept man hes never racketed he had nt the rackets in him and she may nt care for him but we hear things drop what things have you heard drop crickledon in a profound silence you may hear pins in a hubbub you may hear cannonballs but i never believe in eavesdropping gossip he was heard to say to mr smith crickledon pursued and she lowered her voice he was heard to say it was when they were quarreling over that chiwal and they went at one another pretty hard before mr smith beat him and he sold mr smith that meadow he was heard to say there was worse than transportation for mr smith if he but lifted his finger they tinmans have awful tempers his old mother died malignant though she was a saving woman and never owed a penny to a christian a hour longer than it took to pay the money and old tinmans just such another transportation herbert ejaculated thats sheer nonsense crickledon im sure your husband would tell you so it was my husband brought me the words mrs crickledon rejoined with some triumph he did tell me i own to keep it shut but my speaking to you a friend of mr smiths wont do no harm he heard them under the battery over that chiwal glass and you shall pay says mr smith and i shant says old tinman mr smith said he would have it if he had to squeeze a deathbed confession from a sinner then old tinman fires out you he says you and he stammered mr smith my husband said and you never saw a man so shocked as my husband at being obliged to hear them at one another mr smith used the word damn you may laugh sir you say it so capitally crickledon and then old tinman said and a d to you and if i lift my finger its big d on your back and what did mr smith say then he said like a man shot my husband says he said my god herbert fellingham jumped away from the table you tell me crickledon your husband actually heard thatjust those wordsthe tones my husband says he heard him say my god just like a poor man shot or stabbed you may speak to crickledon if you speaks to him alone sir i say you ought to know for ive noticed mr smith since that day has never looked to me the same easyminded happy gentleman he was when we first knew him he would have had me go to cook for him at elba but crickledon thought id better be independent and mr smith said to me perhaps youre right crickledon for who knows how long i may be among you herbert took the solace of tobacco in crickledons shop thence with the story confirmed to him he sauntered toward the house on the beach chapter viii the moon was over sea coasting vessels that had run into the bay for shelter from the north wind lay with their shadows thrown shoreward on the cold smooth water almost to the verge of the beach where there was neither breath nor sound of wind only the lisp at the pebbles mrs crickledons dinner and the state of his heart made young fellingham indifferent to a wintry atmosphere it sufficed him that the night was fair he stretched himself on the shingle thinking of the manzanilla and annette and the fine flavour given to tobacco by a dry still air in moonlightthinking of his work too in the background as far as mental lassitude would allow of it the idea of taking annette to see his first play at the theatre when it should be performedwas very soothing the beach rather looked like a stage and the sea like a ghostly audience with if you will the broadside bulks of black sailing craft at anchor for representatives of the newspaper piers annette was a nice girl if a little commonplace and lowborn yet sweet what a subject he could make of her father the deserter offered a new complication fellingham rapidly sketched it in fancyvan diemen as a member of the parliament of great britain led away from the house of commons to be branded on the bank what a magnificent fall we have so few intensely dramatic positions in english real life that the meditative author grew enamoured of this one and laughed out a royal ha like a monarch reviewing his wellappointed soldiery there you are said van diemens voice i smelt your pipe youre a rum fellow to belying out on the beach on a cold night lord i dont like you the worse for it twas for the romance of the moon in my young days where is annette said fellingham jumping to his feet my daughter she s taking leave of her intended whats that fellingham gasped good heavens mr smith what do you mean pick up your pipe my lad girls choose as they please i suppose her intended did you say sir what can that mean my dear good young fellow dont make a fuss were all going to stay here and very glad to see you from time to time the fact is i oughtnt to have quarrelled with mart tinman as ive done im too peppery by nature the fact is i struck him and he forgave it i could nt have done that myself and i believe im in for a headache tomorrow upon my soul i do mart tinman would champagne us but poor old boy i struck him and i couldnt make amendsdidnt see my way and we joined hands over the glassto the deuce with the glass and the end of it is nettyshe did nt propose it but as im in his i say as i had struck him sheit was rather solemn if you had seen usshe burst into tears and there was mrs cavely and old mart and me as big a foolif im not a villain fellingham perceived a more than common effect of tin mans wine he touched van diemen on the shoulder may i beg to hear exactly what has happened upon my soul were all going to live comfortably in old england and no more quarreling and decamping was the stupid rejoinder except that i did nt exactlyi think you said i exactlyi did nt bargain for old mart as mybut hes a sound man marts my junior hes rich hes eco hes eco you knowmy lord wheres my brainsbut hes uprightnomical an economical man said fellingham with sedate impatience my dear sir im heartily obliged to you for your assistance returned van diemen here she is annette had come out of the gate in the flint wall she started slightly on seeing herbert whom she had taken for a coastguard she said he bowed he kept his head bent peering at her intrusively its the air on champagne van diemen said calling on his lungs to clear themselves and right him i was nt a bit queer in the house the air on tinmans champagne said fellingham it must be like the contact of two hostile chemical elements annette walked faster they descended from the shingle to the scantbladed grasssweep running round the salted townrefuse on toward elba van diemen sniffed ejaculating ill be best man with mart tinman about this business youll stop with us mrwhats your christian name stop with us as long as you like old friends for me the joke of it is that nelson was my man and yet i went and enlisted in the cavalry if you talk of chemical substances old mart tinman was a sneak who never cared a dump for his country and im not to speak a single sybbarel about that over there australia gippsland so down he went clean over very sorry for what we have done contrite penitent now we feel the wind a little said annette fellingham murmured allow me your shawl is flying loose he laid his hands on her arms and pressing her in a tremble said one sign its not true a word do you hate me thank you very much but i am not cold she replied and linked herself to her father van diemen immediately shouted for we are jolly boys for we are jolly boys its the air on the champagne and hang me said he as they entered the grounds of elba if i dont walk over my property annette interposed she stood like a reed in his way no my lord ill see what i sold you for he cried im an owner of the soil of old england and care no more for the title of squire than napoleon bonaparty but ill tell you what mr hubbard your mother was never so astonished at her dog as old van diemen would be to hear himself called squire in old england and a convict he was for he did wrong once but he worked his redemption and the smell of my own property makes me feel my legs again and ill tell you what mr hubbard as netty calls you when she speaks of you in private mart tinmans ideas of wine are pretty much like his ideas of healthy smells and when im bailiff of crikswich mind hell find two to one against him in our town council i love my country but hang me if i dont purify it saying this with the excitement of a high resolve a upon him van diemen bored through a shrubberybrake and fellingham said to annette have i lost you i belong to my father said she contracting and disengaging her feminine garments to step after him in the cold silverspotted dusk of the winter woods van diemen came out on a fishpond here you are young ones he said to the pair this way fellowman im clearer now and its my belief ive been talking nonsense im puffed up with money and have nt the heart i once had i say fellowman fellowbird hubbardwhats your right namefancy an old carp fished out of that pond and flung into the sea thats exile and if the girl dont mind what does it matter mr herbert fellingham i think would like to go to bed papa said annette miss smith must be getting cold fellingham hinted bounce away indoors replied van diemen and he led them like a bull annette was disinclined to leave them together in the smokingroom and under the pretext of wishing to see her father to bed she remained with them though there was a novel directness and heat of tone in herbert that alarmed her and with reason he divined in hideous outlines what had happened he was no longer figuring on easy ice but desperate at the prospect of a loss to himself and a fate for annette that tossed him from repulsion to incredulity and so back van diemen begged him to light his pipe im off to london tomorrow said fellingham i dont want to go for very particular reasons i may be of more use there i have a cousin whos a general officer in the army and if i have your permissionyou see anythings better as it seems to me than that you should depend for peace and comfort on one mans tongue not wagging especially when he is not the best of tempers if i have your permissionwithout mentioning names of courseill consult him there was a dead silence you know you may trust me sir i love your daughter with all my heart your honour and your interests are mine van diemen struggled for composure netty what have you been at he said it is untrue papa she answered the unworded accusation annette has told me nothing sir i have heard it you must brace your mind to the fact that it is known what is known to mr tinman is pretty sure to be known generally at the next disagreement that scoundrel mart van diemen muttered i am positive mr tinman did not speak of you papa said annette and turned her eyes from the halfparalyzed figure of her father on herbert to put him to proof no but he made himself heard when it was being discussed at any rate its known and the thing to do is to meet it im off ill not stop a day id rather live on the continent said van diemen shaking himself as to prepare for the step into that desert mr tinman has been most generous annette protested tearfully i wont say no i think you are deceived and lend him your own generosity said herbert can you suppose it generous that even in the extremest case he should speak of the matter to your father and talk of denouncing him he did it he was provoked a gentleman is distinguished by his not allowing himself to be provoked i am engaged to him and i cannot hear it said that he is not a gentleman the first part of her sentence annette uttered bravely at the conclusion she broke down she wished herbert to be aware of the truth that he might stay his attacks on mr tinman and she believed he had only been guessing the circumstances in which her father was placed but the comparison between her two suitors forced itself on her now when the younger one spoke in a manner so selfcontained brief and full of feeling she had to leave the room weeping has your daughter engaged herself sir said herbert talk to me tomorrow dont give us up if she has we were trapped its my opinion said van diemen theres the devil in that wine ofmart tinmans i feel it still and in the morning itll be worse what can she see in him i must quit the country carry her off how he did it i dont know it was that woman the widow the fellows sister she talked till she piped her eyetalked about our lasting union on my soul i believe i egged netty on i was in a mollified way with that wine all of a sudden the woman joins their hands and ia man of spirit will despise mewhat i thought of was now my secrets safe youve sobered me young sir i see myself if thats being sober i dont ask your opinion of me i am a deserter false to my colours a breaker of his oath only mark this i was married and a common trooper married to a handsome young woman true as steel but she was handsome and we were starvation poor and she had to endure persecution from an officer day by day bear that situation in your mind providence dropped me a hundred pounds out of the sky properly speaking it popped up out of the earth for i reaped it you may say from a relatives grave rich and poor s all right if im rich and youre poor and you may be happy though youre poor but where there are many poor young women lots of rich men are a terrible temptation to them thats my dear good wife speaking and had she been spared to me i never should have come back to old england and hearts delight and heartache i should not have known she was my backbone she was my breastcomforter too why did she stick to me because i had faith in her when appearances were against her but she never forgave this country the hurt to her womans pride youll have noticed a squarish jaw in netty thats her mother and i shall have to encounter it supposing i find mart tinman has been playing me false im blown on somehow ill think of what course ill take twixt now and morning good night young gentleman good night sir said herbert adding i will get information from the horse guards as for the people knowing it about here youre not living much in society its not other peoples feelings its my own van diemen silenced him i feel it if its in the wind ever since mart tinman spoke the thing out ive felt on my skin cold and hot he flourished his lighted candle and went to bed manifestly solaced by the idea that he was the victim of his own feelings herbert could not sleep annettes monstrous choice of tinman in preference to himself constantly assailed and shook his understanding there was the squarish jaw mentioned by her father to think of it filled him with a vague apprehension but he was unable to imagine that a young girl and an english girl and an enthusiastic young english girl could be devoid of sentiment and presuming her to have it as one must there was no fear that she would persist in her loathsome choice when she knew her father was against it chapter ix annette did not shun him next morning she did not shun the subject either but she had been exact in arranging that she should not be more than a few minutes downstairs before her father herbert found that compared with her girls of sentiment are commonplace indeed she had conceived an insane idea of nobility in tinman that blinded her to his face figure and characterhis manners likewise he had forgiven a blow silly as the delusion might be it clothed her in whimsical attractiveness it was a beauty in her to dwell so firmly upon moral quality overthrown and stunned as he was and reduced to helplessness by her brief and positive replies herbert was obliged to admire the singular young lady who spoke without much shyness of her incongruous destined mate though his admiration had an edge cutting like irony while in the turn for candour she ought to have told him that previous to her decision she had weighed the case of the diverse claims of himself and tinman and resolved them according to her predilection for the peaceful residence of her father and herself in england this she had done a little regretfully because of the natural sympathy of the young girl for the younger man but the younger man had seemed to her seriously straightforward mind too light and airy in his wooing like one of her waltzing officersvery well so long as she stepped the measure with him and not forcible enough to take her off her feet he had changed and now that he had become persuasive she feared he would disturb the serenity with which she desired and strove to contemplate her decision tinmans magnanimity was present in her imagination to sustain her though she was aware that mrs cavely had surprised her will and caused it to surrender unconsulted by her wiser intelligence i cannot listen to you she said to herbert after listening longer than was prudent if what you say of papa is true i do not think he will remain in crikswich or even in england but i am sure the old friend we used to speak of so much in australia has not wilfully betrayed him herbert would have had to say look on us two to proceed in his baffled wooing and the very ludicrousness of the contrast led him to see the folly and shame of proposing it van diemen came down to breakfast looking haggard and restless i have nt had my mornings walki cant go out to be hooted he said calling to his daughter for tea and strong tea and explaining to herbert that he knew it to be bad for the nerves but it was an antidote to bad champagne mr herbert fellingham had previously received an invitation on behalf of a sister of his to crikswich a dull sense of genuine sagacity inspired him to remind annette of it she wrote prettily to miss mary fellingham and herbert had some faint joy in carrying away the letter of her handwriting fetch her soon for we shant be here long van diemen said to him at parting he expressed a certain dread of his next meeting with mart tinman herbert speedily brought mary fellingham to elba and left her there the situation was apparently unaltered van diemen looked worn like a man who has been feeding mainly on his reflections which was manifest in his few melancholy bits of speech he said to herbert how you feel a thing when you are found out and it doesnt do for a man with a heart to do wrong he designated the two principal roads by which poor sinners come to a conscience his own would have slumbered but for discovery and as he remarked if it had not been for his heart leading him to tinman he would not have fallen into that mans power the arrival of a young lady of fashionable appearance at elba was matter of cogitation to mrs cavely she was disposed to suspect that it meant something and van diemens behaviour to her brother would of itself have fortified any suspicion he did not call at the house on the beach he did not invite martin to dinner he was rarely seen and when he appeared at the town council he once or twice violently opposed his friend martin who came home ruffled deeply offended in his interests and his dignity have you noticed any difference in annettes treatment of you dear mrs cavely inquired no said tinman none she shakes hands she asks after my health she offers me my cup of tea i have seen all that but does she avoid privacy with you dear me no why should she i hope martha i am a man who may be confided in by any young lady in england i am sure you may dear martin she has an objection to name the the day said martin i have informed her that i have an objection to long engagements i dont like her new companion she says she has been presented at court i greatly doubt it its to give herself a style you may depend i dont believe her exclaimed mrs cavely with sharp personal asperity brother and sister examined together the court guide they had purchased on the occasion at once of their largest outlay and most thrilling gratification in it they certainly found the name of general fellingham but he cant be related to a newspaperwriter said mrs cavely to which her brother rejoined unless the young man turned scamp i hate unproductive professions i hate him martin mrs cavely laughed in scorn i should say i pity him its as clear to me as the sun at noonday he wanted annette thats why i was in a hurry how i dreaded he would come that evening to our dinner when i saw him absent i could have cried out it was providence and so be carefulwe have had everything done for us from on high as yetbut be careful of your temper dear martin i will hasten on the union for its a shame of a girl to drag a man behind her till he s old at the altar temper dear if you will only think of it is the weak point now he has begun boasting to me of his australian wines tinman ejaculated bear it bear it as you do gippsland my dear you have the retort in your heartyes but have you a court in australia ha and his australian wines cost twice the amount i pay for mine quite true we are not obliged to buy them i should hope i would thougha dozenif i thought it necessary to keep him quiet tinman continued muttering angrily over the australian wines with a word of irritation at gippsland while promising to be watchful of his temper what good is australia to us he asked if it does nt bring us money its going to my dear said mrs cavely think of that when he begins boasting his australia and though its convicts money as he confesses with his convicts money tinman interjected tremblingly how long am i expected to wait rely on me to hurry on the day said mrs cavely there is no other annoyance wherever i am going to buy that man outbids me and then says its the old countrys want of pluck and dash and doing things largehanded a man whod go on his knees to stop in england tinman vociferated in a breath and fairly reddened by the effort he may have to do it yet i cant stand insult you are less able to stand insult after honours his sister said in obedience to what she had observed of him since his famous visit to london it must be so in nature but temper is everything just now remember it was by command of temper and letting her father put himself in the wrong you got hold of annette and i would abstain even from wine for sometimes after it you have owned it disagreed and i have noticed these eruptions between you and mr smithas he calls himself generally after wine always the poor the poor money for the poor tinman harped on further grievances against van diemen i say doctors have said the drain on the common is healthy its a healthy smell nourishing weve always had it and been a healthy town but the sea encroaches and i say my house and my property is in danger he buys my house over my head and offers me the crouch to live in at an advanced rent and then he sells me my house at an advanced price and i buy and then he votes against a penny for the protection of the shore and were in winter again as if he was not in my power my dear martin to elba we go and soon if you will govern your temper said mrs cavely youre an angel to let me speak of it so and its only that man that irritates you i call him sinfully ostentatious i could blow him from a gun if i spoke out and he knows it hes wanting in common gratitude let alone respect tinman snorted but he has a daughter my dear tinman slowly and crackingly subsided his main grievance against van diemen was the nonrecognition of his importance by that uncultured australian who did not seem to be conscious of the dignities and distinctions we come to in our country the moneyed daughter the prospective marriage for an economical man rejected by every lady surrounding him advised him to lock up his temper in submission to martha bring annette to dine with us he said on marthas proposing a visit to the dear young creature martha drank a glass of her brothers wine at lunch and departed on the mission annette declined to be brought her excuse was her guest miss fellingham bring her too by all meansif youll condescend i am sure mrs cavely said to mary i am much obliged to you i do not dine out at present said the london lady dear me are you ill no nothing in the family i hope my family i am sure i beg pardon said mrs cavely bridling with a spite pardonable by the severest moralist can i speak to you alone she addressed annette miss fellingham rose mrs cavely confronted her i cant allow it i cant think of it im only taking a little liberty with one i may call my future sisterin law shall i come out with you said annette in sheer lassitude assisting mary fellingham in her scheme to show the distastefulness of this lady and her brother not if you dont wish to i have no objection another time will do will you write by post indeed mrs cavely delivered a laugh supposed to be peculiar to the english stage it would be a penny thrown away said annette i thought you could send a messenger intercommunication with miss fellingham had done mischief to her high moral conception of the pair inhabiting the house on the beach mrs cavely saw it and could not conceal that she smarted her counsel to her brother after recounting the offensive scene to him in animated dialogue was to give van diemen a fright i wish i had not drunk that glass of sherry before starting she exclaimed both savagely and sagely its best after business and these gentlemens habits of yours of taking to dining late upset me im afraid i showed temper but you martin would not have borne one tenth of what i did how dare you say so her brother rebuked her indignantly and the house on the beach enclosed with difficulty a storm between brother and sister happily not heard outside because of loud winds raging nevertheless tinman pondered on marthas idea of the wisdom of giving van diemen a fright chapter x the english have been called a badtempered people but this is to judge of them by their manifestations whereas an examination into causes might prove them to be no worse tempered than that man is a bad sleeper who lies in a biting bed if a sagacious instinct directs them to discountenance realistic tales the realistic tale should justify its appearance by the discovery of an apology for the tormented souls once they sang madrigals once they danced on the green they revelled in their lusty humours without having recourse to the pun for fun an exhibition of hundreds of bare legs for jollity a sentimental wailing all in the throat for music evidence is procurable that they have been an artificiallyreared people feeding on the genius of inventors transposers adulterators instead of the products of nature for the last half century and it is unfair to affirm of them that they are positively this or that they are experiments they are the sons and victims of a desperate energy alluring by cheapness satiating with quantity that it may mount in the social scale at the expense of their tissues the land is in a state of fermentation to mount and the shop which has shot half their stars to their social zenith is what verily they would scald themselves to wash themselves free of nor is it in any degree a reprehensible sign that they should fly as from hue and cry the title of tradesman it is on the contrary the spot of sanity which bids us right cordially hope energy transferred to the moral sense may clear them yet meanwhile this beer this wine both are of a character to have killed more than the tempers of a less gifted people martin tinman invited van diemen smith to try the flavour of a wine that as he said he thought of laying down it has been hinted before of a strange effect upon the minds of men who knew what they were going to when they received an invitation to dine with tinman for the sake of a little social meeting at any cost they accepted it accepted it with a sigh midway as by engineering measurement between prospective and retrospective as nearly mechanical as things human may be like the mussulmans accustomed cry of kismet has it not been related of the little jew babe sucking at its mothers breast in jerusalem that this innocent long after the captivity would start convulsively relinquishing its feast and indulging in the purest hebrew lamentation of the most tenacious of races at the passing sound of a babylonian or a ninevite voice in some such manner did men unable to refuse deep in what remained to them of nature listen to tinman and so did van diemen sighing heavily under the operation of simple animal instinct you seem miserable said tinman not oblivious of his design to give his friend a fright do i no im all right van diemen replied im thinking of alterations at the hall before summer to accommodate guestsif i stay here i suppose you would not like to be separated from annette separated no i should think i shouldnt whod do it because i should not like to leave my good sister martha all to herself in a house so near the sea why not go to the crouch man thank you no thanks needed if you dont take advantage of the offer they were at the entrance to elba whither mr tinman was betaking himself to see his intended he asked if annette was at home and to his great stupefaction heard that she had gone to london for a week dissembling the spite aroused within him he postponed his very strongly fortified design and said you must be lonely van diemen informed him that it would be for a night only as young fellingham was coming down to keep him company at six oclock this evening then said tinman were not fashionable in winter hang me if i know when ever we were van diemen rejoined come though youd like to be youve got your ambition philip like other men respectable and respectedthat s my ambition mr mart tinman simpered with your wealth ay i m richfor a contented mind i m pretty sure you ll approve my new vintage said tinman its direct from oporto my winemerchant tells me on his word whats the price no no no try it first its rather a stiff price van diemen was partially reassured by the announcement what do you call a stiff price wellover thirty double that and you may have a chance now cried tinman exasperated how can a man from australia know anything about prices for port you cant divest your ideas of diggers prices youre like an intoxicating drink yourself on the tradesmen of our town you think it fineha ha i daresay philip i should be doing the same if i were up to your mark at my bankers we cant all of us be lords nor baronets catching up his temper thus cleverly he curbed that habitual runaway and retired from his old friends presence to explode in the society of the solitary martha annettes behaviour was as bitterly criticized by the sister as by the brother she has gone to those fellingham people and she may be thinking of jilting us mrs cavely said in that case i have no mercy cried her brother i have bornehe bowed with a professional spiritual humilityas i should but it may get past endurance i say i have borne enough and if the worst comes to the worst and i hand him over to the authoritiesi say i mean him no harm but he has struck me he beat me as a boy and he has struck me as a man and i say i have no thought of revenge but i cannot have him here and i say if i drive him out of the country back to his gippsland martin tinman quivered for speech probably for that which feedeth speech as is the way with angry men and whatwhat then said martha with the tender mellifluousness of sisterly reproach what good can you expect of letting temper get the better of you dear tinman did not enjoy her recent turn for usurping the lead in their consultations and he said tartly this good martha we shall get the hall at my price and be head people here which he raised his note which he a deserter has no right to pretend to give himself out to be what your feelings may be as an old inhabitant i dont know but i have always looked up to the people at elba hall and i say i dont like to have a deserter squandering convicts money therewith his fortypound ayear cook and his champagne at seventy a dozen its the luxury of sodom and gomorrah that does not prevent its being very nice to dine there said mrs cavely and it shall be our table for good if i have any management you mean me maam bellowed tinman not at all she breathed in dulcet contrast you are goodlooking martin but you have not half such pretty eyes as the person i mean i never ventured to dream of managing you martin i am thinking of the people at elba but why this extraordinary treatment of me martha shes a child having her head turned by those fellinghams but shes honourable she has sworn to me she would be honourable you do think i may as well give him a fright tinman inquired hungrily a sort of hint but very gentle martin do be gentlecasual likeas if you did nt want to say it get him on his gippsland then if he brings you to words you can always laugh back and say you will go to kew and see the fernery and fancy all that so high on helvellyn or the downs whymrs cavely at the end of her astute advices and cautionings as usual gave loose to her natural characterwhy that man came back to england at all with his boastings of gippsland i cant for the life of me find out it s a perfect mystery it is tinman sounded his voice at a great depth reflectively glad of taking the part she was perpetually assuming of late he put out his hand and said but it may have been ordained for our good martha true dear said she with an earnest sentiment of thankfulness to the power which had led him round to her way of thinking and feeling chapter xi annette had gone to the big metropolis which burns in colonial imaginations as the sun of cities and was about to see something of london under the excellent auspices of her new friend mary fellingham and a dense fog she was alarmed by the darkness a little in fear too of herbert and these feelings caused her to chide herself for leaving her father hearing her speak of her father sadly herbert kindly proposed to go down to crikswich on the very day of her coming she thanked him and gave him a taste of bitterness by smiling favourably on his offer but as he wished her to discern and take to heart the difference between one man and another in the light of a suitor he let her perceive that it cost him heavy pangs to depart immediately and left her to brood on his example mary fellingham liked annette she thought her a sensible girl of uncultivated sensibilities the reverse of thousands not commonplace therefore and that the sensibilities were expanding was to be seen in her gradual unreadiness to talk of her engagement to mr tinman though her intimacy with mary warmed daily she considered she was bound to marry the man at some distant date and did not feel unhappiness yet she had only felt uneasy when she had to greet and converse with her intended especially when the london young lady had been present herberts departure relieved her of the pressing sense of contrast she praised him to mary for his extreme kindness to her father and down in her unsounded heart desired that her father might appreciate it even more than she did herbert drove into crikswich at night and stopped at crickledons where he heard that van diemen was dining with tinman crickledon the carpenter permitted certain dry curves to play round his lips like miniature shavings at the name of tinman but herbert asked what is it now in vain and he went to crickledon the cook this union of the two crickledons male and female was an ideal one such as poor women dream of and men would do the same if they knew how poor they are each had a profession each was independent of the other each supported the fabric consequently there was mutual respect as between two pillars of a house each saw the others faults with a sly wink to the world and an occasional interchange of sarcasm that was tonic very strengthening to the wits without endangering the habit of affection crickledon the cook stood for her own opinions and directed the public conduct of crickledon the carpenter and if he went astray from the line she marked out she put it down to human nature to which she was tolerant he when she had not followed his advice ascribed it to the nature of women she never said she was the equal of her husband but the carpenter proudly acknowledged that she was as good as a man and he bore with foibles derogatory to such high stature by teaching himself to observe a neatness of domestic and general management that told him he certainly was not as good as a woman herbert delighted in them the cook regaled the carpenter with skilful tasty and economic dishes and the carpenter obedient to her supplications had promised in the event of his outliving her that no hands but his should have the making of her coffin it is so nice she said to think ones own husband will put together the box you are to lie in of his own make had they been even a doubtfully united pair the cooks anticipation of a comfortable coffin the work of the best carpenter in england would have kept them together and that which fine cookery does for the cementing of couples needs not to be recounted to those who have read a chapter or two of the natural history of the male sex crickledon my dear soul your husband is labouring with a bit of fun herbert said to her he would nt laugh loud at punch for fear of an action she replied he never laughs out till he gets to bed and has locked the door and when he does he says hush to me tinman is nt bailiff again just yet and where he has his bailiffs best court suit from you may ask he exercises in it off and on all the week at night and sometimes in the middle of the day herbert rallied her for her gossips credulity its truth she declared i have it from the maid of the house little jane whom he pays four pound a year for all the work of the house a clever little thing with her hands and her head she is and can read and write beautiful and shes a mind to leave em if they dont advance her she knocked and went in while he was full blaze and bowing his poll to his glass and now he turns the key and a child might know he was at it he cant be such a donkey and hes been seen at the window on the seaside whos your admiral staying at the house on the beach men have inquired as they come ashore my husband has heard it tinmans got it on his brain he might be cured by marriage to a soundheaded woman but he ll soon be wanting to walk about in silk legs if he stops a bachelor they tell me his old mother here had a dress value twenty pound and pomps inherited save as he may theres his leak herberts contempt for tinman was intense it was that of the young and ignorant who live in their imaginations like spendthrifts unaware of the importance of them as the food of life and of how necessary it is to seize upon the solider one among them for perpetual sustenance when the unsubstantial are vanishing the great event of his bailiffs term of office had become the sun of tinmans system he basked in its rays he meant to be again the proud official royally distinguished meantime though he knew not that his days were dull he groaned under the dulness and as cart or cab horses uncomplaining as a rule show their view of the nature of harness when they have release to frisk in a field it is possible that existence was made tolerable to the jogging man by some minutes of excitement in his bailiffs court suit really to pasture on our recollections we ought to dramatize them there is however only the testimony of a maid and a mariner to show that tinman did it and those are witnesses coming of particularly longbow classes given to magnify small items of fact on reaching the hall herbert found the fire alight in the smokingroom and soon after settling himself there he heard van diemens voice at the halldoor saying good night to tinman thank the lord there you are said van diemen entering the room i couldnt have hoped so much that rascal he turned round to the door he has been threatening me and then smoothing me hang his oil its combustible and hang the port hes for laying down as he calls it leave it to posterity says i why says he because the young ones ll be better able to take care of themselves says i and he insists on an explanation i gave it to him out he bursts like a wasps nest he may have said what he did say in temper he seemed sorry afterwardspoor old mart the scoundrel talked of horse guards and telegraph wires scoundrel but more ninny said herbert full of his contempt dare him to do his worst the general tells me they d be glad to overlook it at the guards even if they had all the facts branding s out of the question i swear it was done in my time cried van diemen all on fire its out of the question you might be advised to leave england for a few months as for the society here if i leave i leave for good my hearts broken im disappointed im deceived in my friend he and i in the old days whats come to him what on earth is it changes men who stop in england so it cant be the climate and did you mention my name to general fellingham certainly not said herbert but listen to me sir a moment why not get together halfadozen friends of the neighbourhood and make a clean breast of it englishmen like that kind of manliness and they are sure to ring sound to it i couldnt van diemen sighed its not a natural feeling i have about iti ve brooded on the word if i have a nightmare i see deserter written in sulphur on the black wall you cant remain at his mercy and be bullied as you are he makes you ill sir he wont do anything but hell go on worrying you id stop him at once id take the train tomorrow and get an introduction to the commanderinchief hes the very man to be kind to you in a situation like this the general would get you the introduction thats more to my taste but no i couldnt van diemen moaned in his weakness money has unmanned me i was nt this kind of man formerly nor more was mart tinman the traitor all the world seems changeing for the worse and england is nt what she used to be you let that man spoil it for you sir herbert related mrs crickledons tale of mr tinman adding hes an utter donkey i should defy him what i should do would be to let him know tomorrow morning that you dont intend to see him again blow for blow is the thing he requires hell be cringing to you in a week and youd like to marry annette said van diemen relishing nevertheless the advice whose origin and object he perceived so plainly of course i should said herbert franker still in his colour than his speech i dont see him my girls husband van diemen eyed the red hollow in the falling coals when i came first and found him a healthy man goodlooking enough for a trifle over forty i d have given her gladly she nodding yes now all my fear is shes in earnest upon my soul i had the notion old mart was a sort of a boy still playing man you know but how can you understand i fancied his airs and stiffness were put on thought i saw him burning true behind it who can tell he seems to be jealous of my buying property in his native town something frets him i ought never to have struck him theres my error and i repent it strike a friend i wonder he didnt go off to the horse guards at once i might have done it in his place if i found i couldnt lick him i should have tried kicking first yes shinning before peaching said herbert astonished almost as much as he was disgusted by the inveterate sentimental attachment of van diemen to his old friend martin tinman anticipated good things of the fright he had given the man after dinner he had undoubtedly yielded to temper forgetting pure policy which it is so exceeding difficult to practice but he had soothed the startled beast they had shaken hands at parting and tinman hoped that the week of annettes absence would enable him to mould her father young fellinghams appointment to come to elba had slipped mr tinmans memory it was annoying to see this intruder at all events hes not with annette said mrs cavely how long has her father to run on five months tinman replied he would have completed his term of service in five months and to think of his being a rich man because he deserted mrs cavely interjected oh i do call it immoral he ought to be apprehended and punished to be an example for the good of society if you lose time my dear martin your chance is gone hes wriggling now and if i could believe he talked us over to that young impudent who has nt a penny that he does nt get from his pen id say denounce him tomorrow i long for elba i hate this house it will be swallowed up some day i know it i have dreamt it elba at any cost depend upon it martin you have been foiled in your suits on account of the mean house you inhabit enter elba as that girls husband or go there to own it and girls will crawl to you you are a ridiculous woman martha said tinman not dissenting the mixture of an idea of public duty with a feeling of personal rancour is a strong incentive to the pursuit of a stern line of conduct and the glimmer of selfinterest superadded does not check the steps of the moralist nevertheless tinman held himself in he loved peace he preached it he disseminated it at a meeting in the town he strove to win van diemens voice in favour of a vote for further moneys to protect our shores van diemen laughed at him telling him he wanted a battery no said tinman ive had enough to do with soldiers hows that they might be more cautious i say they might learn to know their friends from their enemies thats it thats it said van diemen if you say much more my hearty youll find me bidding against you next week for marine parade and belle vue terrace ive a cute eye for property and this towns looking up you look about you before you speculate in land and house property here retorted tinman van diemen bore so much from him that he asked himself whether he could be an englishman the title of deserter was his raw wound he attempted to form the habit of stigmatizing himself with it in the privacy of his chamber and he succeeded in establishing the habit of talking to himself so that he was heard by the household and annette on her return was obliged to warn him of his indiscretion this development of a new weakness exasperated him rather to prove his courage by defiance than to baffle tinmans ambition to become the principal owner of houses in crikswich by outbidding him at the auction for the sale of marine parade and belle vue terrace van diemen ran the houses up at the auction and ultimately had belle vue knocked down to him so fierce was the quarrel that annette in conjunction with mrs cavely was called on to interpose with her sweetest grace my native place tinman said to her it is my native place i have a pride in it i desire to own property in it and your father opposes me he opposes me then says i may have it back at auction price after he has gone far to double the price i have bornei repeat i have borne too much are nt your properties to be equal to one said mrs cavely smiling motherlike from tinman to annette he sought to produce a fondling eye in a wry face and said yes i will remember that annette will bless you with her dear hand in a month or two at the outside mrs cavely murmured cherishingly she will tinman cracked his body to bend to her oh i cannot say do not distress me be friendly with papa the girl resumed moving to escape that is the essential said mrs cavely and continued when annette had gone the essential is to get over the next few months miss and then to snap your fingers at us martin i would force that man to sell you belle vue under the price he paid for it just to try your power tinman was not quite so forcible he obtained belle vue at auction price and his passion for revenge was tipped with fire by having it accorded as a friends favour the poisoned state of his mind was increased by a december high wind that rattled his casements and warned him of his accession of property exposed to the elements both he and his sister attributed their nervousness to the sinister behaviour of van diemen for the house on the beach had only in most distant times been threatened by the sea and no house on earth was better protected from manneptune in the shape of a coastguard being paid by government to patrol about it during the hours of darkness they had never had any fears before van diemen arrived and caused them to give thrice their ordinary number of dinners to guests per annum in fact before van diemen came the house on the beach looked on crikswich without a rival to challenge its anticipated lordship over the place and for some inexplicable reason it seemed to its inhabitants to have been a safer as well as a happier residence they were consoled by tinmans performance of a clever stroke in privately purchasing the cottages west of the town and including crickledons shop abutting on marine parade then from the house on the beach they looked at an entire frontage of their property they entered the month of february no further time was to be lost or we shall wake up to find that man has fooled us mrs cavely said tinman appeared at elba to demand a private interview with annette his hat was blown into the hall as the door opened to him and he himself was glad to be sheltered by the door so violent was the gale annette and her father were sitting together they kept the betrothed gentleman waiting a very long time at last van diemen went to him and said netty ll see you if you must i suppose you have no business with me not today tinman replied van diemen strode round the drawingroom with his hands in his pockets theres a disparity of ages he said abruptly as if desirous to pour out his lesson while he remembered it a man upwards of forty marries a girl under twenty hes over sixty before shes forty hes decaying when shes only mellow i ought never to have struck you i know and youre such an infernal bad temper at times and age does nt improve that they say and shes been educated tiptop shes sharp on grammar and a man may nt like that much when hes a husband see her if you must but she does nt take to the idea theres the truth disparity of ages and unsuitableness of dispositionswhat was it fellingham saidlike two barrelorgans grinding different tunes all day in a house i dont want to hear mr fellinghams comparisons tinman snapped oh hes nothing to the girl said van diemen she doesnt stomach leaving me my dear philip why should she leave you when we have interests in common as one household she says youre such a damned bad temper tinman was pursuing amicably when we are united but the frightful charge brought against his temper drew him up fiery i may be annette has seen i am forgiving i am a christian you have provoked me you have struck me i ll give you a couple of thousand pounds in hard money to be off the bargain and not bother the girl said van diemen now rejoined tinman i am offended i like money like most men who have made it you do philip but i dont come courting like a pauper not for ten thousand not for twenty money cannot be a compensation to me for the loss of annette i say i love annette because van diemen continued his speech you trapped us into that engagement mart you dosed me with the stuff you buy for wine while your sister sat sugaring and mollifying my girl and she did the trick in a minute taking netty by surprise when i was all heart and no head and since that you may have seen the girl turn her head from marriage like my woods from the wind mr van diemen smith tinman panted he mastered himself you shall not provoke me my introductions of you in this neighbourhood my patronage prove my friendship youll be a good old fellow mart when you get over your hopes of being knighted mr fellingham may set you against my wine philip let me tell youi know youyou would not object to have your daughter called lady with a spindleshanked husband capering in a court suit before he goes to bed every night that he may nt forget what a fine fellow he was one day bygone youre growing lean on it mart like a recollection fifty years old you have never forgiven me that day philip jealous am i take the money give up the girl and see what friends well be ill back your buyings ill advertise your sellings ill pay a painter to paint you in your court suit and hang up a copy of you in my diningroom annette is here said tinman who had been showing etnas tokens of insurgency he admired annette not till latterly had herbert fellingham been so true an admirer of annette as tinman was she looked sincere and she dressed inexpensively for these reasons she was the best example of womankind that he knew and her enthusiasm for england had the sympathetic effect on him of obscuring the rest of the world and thrilling him with the reassuring belief that he was blest in his blood and his birthplacepoints which her father with his boastings of gippsland and other people talking of scenes on the continent sometimes disturbed in his mind annette said he i come requesting to converse with you in private if you wish iti would rather not she answered tinman raised his head as often at helmstone when some offending shopwoman was to hear her doom he bent to her i see before your father then it isnt an agreeable bit of business to me van diemen grumbled frowning and shrugging i have come annette to ask you to beg you entreatbefore a third personlaughing philip the wrong side of my mouth my friend and ill tell you what were in for heavy seas and i m not sorry youve taken the house on the beach off my hands pray mr tinman speak at once if you please and i will do my best papa vexes you no no replied tinman he renewed his commencement van diemen interrupted him again hang your power over me as you call it eh old mart im a deserter ill pay a thousand pounds to the british army whether they punish me or not march me off tomorrow papa you are unjust unkind annette turned to him in tears no no said tinman i do not feel it your father has misunderstood me annette i am sure he has she said fervently and mr tinman i will faithfully promise that so long as you are good to my dear father i will not be untrue to my engagement only do not wish me to name any day we shall be such very good dear friends if you consent to this will you pausing for a space the enamoured man unrolled his voice in lamentation oh annette how long will you keep me there youll set her crying said van diemen now you can run upstairs netty by jingo mart tinman youve got a bass voice for love affairs annette tinman called to her and made her turn round as she was retiring i must know the day before the end of winter please in kind consideration my arrangements demand it do let the girl go said van diemen dine with me tonight and ill give you a wine to brisk your spirits old boy thank you when i have ordered dinner at home iand my wine agrees with me tinman replied i doubt it you shall not provoke me philip they parted stiffly mrs cavely had unpleasant domestic news to communicate to her brother in return for his tale of affliction and wrath it concerned the ungrateful conduct of their little housemaid jane who as mrs cavely said egged on by that woman crickledon had been hinting at an advance of wages she didnt dare speak but i saw what was in her when she broke a plate and wouldnt say she was sorry i know she goes to crickledon and talks us over shes a willing worker but she has no heart tinman had been accustomed in his shop at helmstonewhere heaven had blessed him with the patronage of the rich as visibly as rays of supernal light are seen selecting from above the heads of prophets in the illustrations to cheap holy booksto deal with willing workers that have no hearts before the application for an advance of wagesand he knew the signs of it cominghis method was to calculate how much he might be asked for and divide the estimated sum by the figure which as it seemed to come from a generous impulse and had been unsolicited was often humbly accepted and the willing worker pursued her lean and hungry course in his service the treatment did not always agree with his males women it suited because they do not like to lift up their voices unless they are in a passion and if you take from them the grounds of temper you take their words awayyou make chickens of them and as tinman said gratitude i never expect why not for the reason that he knew human nature he could record shocking instances of the ingratitude of human nature as revealed to him in the term of his tenure of the shop at helmstone blest from above human natures wickedness had from below too frequently besulphured and suffumigated him for his memory to be dim and though he was ever ready to own himself an example that heaven prevaileth he could cite instances of scandalmongering shop women dismissed and working him mischief in the town which pointed to him in person for a proof that the powers of good and evil were still engaged in unhappy contention witness strikes witness revolutions tell her when she lays the cloth that i advance her on account of general good conduct five shillings per annum add said tinman that i wish no thanks it is for her meritsto reward her you understand me martha quite if you think it prudent martin i do she is not to breathe a syllable to cook she will then keep your eye on cook mrs cavely promised she would do so she felt sure she was paying five shillings for ingratitude and therefore it was with humility that she owned her error when while her brother sipped his sugared acrid liquor after dinner in devotion to the doctors decree that he should take a couple of glasses rigorously as bodylashing friar she imparted to him the singular effect of the advance of wages upon little janeoh maam and me never asked you for it she informed her brother how little jane had confided to her that they were called close and how little jane had vowed she wouldthe willing little thinggo about letting everybody know their kindness yes ah tinman inhaled the praise no no i dont want to be puffed he said remember cook i have he continued meditatively rarely found my plan fail but mind i give the crickledons notice to quit tomorrow they are a pest besides i shall probably think of erecting villas how dreadful the wind is mrs cavely exclaimed i would give that girl annette one chance more try her by letter tinman despatched a business letter to annette which brought back a vague unbusinesslike reply two days afterward mrs cavely reported to her brother the presence of mr fellingham and miss mary fellingham in crikswich at her dictation he wrote a second letter this time the reply came from van diemen my dear martinplease do not go on bothering my girl she does not like the idea of leaving me and my experience tells me i could not live in the house with you so there it is take it friendly i have always wanted to be and am your friend phil tinman proceeded straight to elba that is as nearly straight as the wind would allow his legs to walk van diemen was announced to be out miss annette begged to be excused under the pretext that she was unwell and tinman heard of a dinnerparty at elba that night he met mr fellingham on the carriage drive the young londoner presumed to touch upon tinmans private affairs by pleading on behalf of the crikledons who were he said much dejected by the notice they had received to quit house and shop another time bawled tinman i cant hear you in this wind come in said fellingham the master of the house is absent was the smart retort roared at him and tinman staggered away enjoying it as he did his wine his house rocked he was backed by his sister in the assurance that he had been duped the process he supposed to be thinking which was the castigation of his brains with every sting wherewith a native touchiness could ply immediate recollection led him to conclude that he must bring van diemen to his senses and annette running to him for mercy he sat down that night amid the howling of the storm wind whistling water crashing casements rattling beach desperately dragging as by the widestretched starfish fingers of the halfengulphed he hardly knew what he wrote the man was in a state of personal terror burning with indignation at van diemen as the main cause of his jeopardy for in order to prosecute his pursuit of annette he had abstained from going to helmstone to pay moneys into his bank there and what was precious to life as well as life itself was imperilled by those two annette and her fatherwho had they been true had they been honest to say nothing of honourable would by this time have opened elba to him as a fast and safe abode his letter was addressed on a large envelope to the adjutantgeneral horse guards but if ever consigned to the post that postoffice must be in london and tinman left the letter on his desk till the morning should bring counsel to him as to the london friend to whom he might despatch it under cover for posting if he pushed it so far sleep was impossible black night favoured the tearing fiends of shipwreck and looking through a back window over sea tinman saw with dismay huge towering ghostwhite wreaths that travelled up swiftly on his level and lit the dark as they flung themselves in ruin with a gasp across the mound of shingle at his feet he undressed his sister called to him to know if they were in danger clothed in his dressinggown he slipped along to her door to vociferate to her hoarsely that she must not frighten the servants and one fine quality in the training of the couple which had helped them to prosper a form of selfcommand kept her quiet in her shivering fears for a distraction tinman pulled open the drawers of his wardrobe his glittering suit lay in one and he thought what wonderful changes there are in the world meaning between a man exposed to the wrath of the elements and the same individual reading from vellum in that suit in a palace to the head of all of us the presumption is that he must have often done it before the fact is established that he did it that night the conclusion drawn from it is that it must have given him a sense of stability and safety at any rate that he put on the suit is quite certain probably it was a work of ingratiation and degrees a feeling of the silk a trying on to one leg then a matching of the fellow with it o you revolutionists who would have no state no ceremonial and but one order of galligaskins this man must have been wooed away in spirit to forgetfulness of the tempest scourging his mighty neighbour to a bigger and a farther leap he must have obtained from the contemplation of himself in his suit that which would be the saving of all men in especial of his countrymenimagination namely certain it is as i have said that he attired himself in the suit he covered it with his dressinggown and he lay down on his bed so garbed to await the morrows light being probably surprised by sleep acting upon fatigue and nerves appeased and soothed chapter xii elba lay more sheltered from southeast winds under the slopes of down than any other house in crikswich the southcaster struck off the cliff to a martello tower and the house on the beach leaving elba to repose so that the worst wind for that coast was one of the most comfortable for the owner of the hall and he looked from his upper window on a sea of crumbling grey chalk lashed unremittingly by the featureless piping gale without fear that his elevated grounds and walls would be open at high tide to the ravage of water van diemen had no idea of calamity being at work on land when he sat down to breakfast he told herbert that he had prayed for poor fellows at sea last night mary fellingham and annette were anxious to finish breakfast and mount the down to gaze on the sea and receiving a caution from van diemen not to go too near the cliff they were inclined to think he was needlessly timorous on their account before they were half way through the meal word was brought in of great breaches in the shingle and water covering the common van diemen sent for his head gardener whose report of the state of things outside took the comprehensive form of prophecy he predicted the fall of the town nonsense what do you mean john scott said van diemen eyeing his orderly breakfast table and the man in turns it does nt seem like that yet does it the house on the beach wont stand an hour longer sir who says so its cut off from land now and waves masthigh all about it mart tinman cried van diemen all started all jumped up and there was a scampering for hats and cloaks maids and men of the house ran in and out confirming the news of inundation some in terror for the fate of relatives others pleasantly excited glad of catastrophe if it but killed monotony for at any rate it was a change of demons the view from the outer bank of elba was of water covering the space of the common up to the stones of marine parade and belle vue but at a distance it had not the appearance of angry water the ladies thought it picturesque and the house on the beach was seen standing firm a second look showed the house completely isolated and as the party led by van diemen circled hurriedly toward the town they discerned heavy cataracts of foam pouring down the wrecked mound of shingle on either side of the house why the outer walls washed away said van diemen are they in real danger asked annette her teeth chattering and the cold and other matters at her heart precluding for the moment such warmth of sympathy as she hoped soon to feel for them she was glad to hear her father say oh theyre high and dry by this time we shall find them in the town and well take them in and comfort them ten to one they have nt breakfasted they shant go to an inn while im handy he dashed ahead followed closely by herbert the ladies beheld them talking to townsfolk as they passed along the upper streets and did not augur well of their increase of speed at the head of the town water was visible part of the way up the main street and crossing it the ladies went swiftly under the old church on the tower of which were spectators through the churchyard to a high meadow that dropped to a stone wall fixed between the meadow and a grass bank above the level of the road where now salt water beat and cast some spray not less than a hundred people were in this field among them crickledon and his wife all were in silent watch of the house on the beach which was to east of the field at a distance of perhaps three stonethrows the scene was wild continuously the torrents poured through the shingleclefts and momently a thunder sounded and high leapt a billow that topped the house and folded it weltering they tell me mart tinmans in the house van diemen roared to herbert he listened to further information and bellowed theres no boat herbert answered it must be a mistake i think heres crickledon says he had a warning before dawn and managed to move most of his things and the people over there must have been awakened by the row in time to get off i cant hear a word you say van diemen tried to pitch his voice higher than the wind did you say a boat but where crickledon the carpenter made signal to herbert they stepped rapidly up the field women feels their weakness in times like these my dear mrs crickledon said to annette what with our clothes and our cowardice it do seem were not the equals of men when winds is high annette expressed the hope to her that she had not lost much property mrs crickledon said she was glad to let her know she was insured in an accident company but said she i do grieve for that poor man tinman if alive he be and comes ashore to find his property wrecked by water bless ye he wouldnt insure against anything less common than fire and my house and crickledons shop are floating timbers by this time and marine parade and belle vue are safe to go and itll be a pretty welcome for him poor man from his investments a cry at a tremendous blow of a wave on the doomed house rose from the field back and front door were broken down and the force of water drove a round volume through the channel shaking the walls i cant stand this van diemen cried annette was too late to hold him back he ran up the field she was preparing to run after when mrs crickledon touched her arm and implored her interfere not with men but let them follow their judgements when its seasons of mighty peril my dear if any ones guilty its me for minding my husband of a boat that was launched for a lifeboat here and wouldnt answer and is at the shed by the crouchleft lying there ive often said as if it was asulking my goodness a linen sheet bad been flung out from one of the windows of the house on the beach and flew loose and flapping in sign of distress it looks as if they had gone mad in that house to have waited so long for to declare theirselves poor souls mrs crickledon said sighing she was assured right and left that signals had been seen before and some one stated that the cook of mr tinman and also mrs cavely were on shore its his furniture poor man he sticks to and nothing gets round the heart so resumed mrs crickledon there goes his bedlinen the sheet was whirled and snapped away by the wind distended doubled like a flock of winter geese changeing alphabetical letters on the clouds darted this way and that and finally outspread on the waters breaking against marine parade they cannot have thought there was positive danger in remaining said annette mr tinman was waiting for the cheapest insurance office a man remarked to mrs crickledon the least to pay is to the undertaker she replied standing on tiptoe and its to be hoped he ll pay more today if only those walls dont fall and stop the chance of the boat to save him for more outlay poor man what boats was on the beach last night high up and over the ridge as they was are planks by this time and only good for carpenters half our towns done for one old man said and another followed him in a pious tone from water we came and to water we go they talked of ancient inroads of the sea none so serious as this threatened to be for them the gallant solidity of the house on the beach had withstood heavy gales it was a brave house heaven be thanked no fishing boats were out chiefly welltodo people would be the sufferersan exceptional case for it is the mysterious and unexplained dispensation that mostly heaven chastises we a knot of excited gazers drew the rest of the field to them mrs crickledon on the edge of the crowd reported what was doing to annette and miss fellingham a boat had been launched from the town praise the lord theres none but coastguard in it she exclaimed and excused herself for having her heart on her husband annette was as deeply thankful that her father was not in the boat they looked round and saw herbert beside them van diemen was in the rear panting and straining his neck to catch sight of the boat now pulling fast across a tumbled sea to where tinman himself was perceived beckoning them wildly half out of one of the windows a pound apiece to those fellows and two if they land mart tinman dry ive promised it and theyll earn it look at that quick you rascals to the east a portion of the house had fallen melted away where it stood just below the line of shingle it was now like a structure wasting on a tormented submerged reef the whole line was given over to the waves where is his sister annette shrieked to her father safe ashore and one of the women with her but mart tinman would stop the fool topoor old boy save his papers and things and has nt a head to do it martha cavely tells me theyre at him now theyve got him in theres another oh its a girl who would nt go and leave him theyll pull to the field here brave ladsby jingo why aint englishmen always in dangereh if you want to see them shine its little jane said mrs crickledon who had been joined by her husband and now that she knew him to be no longer in peril kept her hand on him to restrain him just for comforts sake the boat held under the lee of the housewreck a minute then as if shooting a small rapid came down on a wave crowned with foam to hurrahs from the townsmen theyre all right said van diemen puffing as at a mist before his eyes theyll pull westward with the wind and land him among us i remember when old mart and i were bathing once he was younger than me and could nt swim much and i saw him going down itd have been hard to see him washed off before ones eyes thirty years afterwards here they come hes all right hes in his dressinggown the crowd made way for mr van diemen smith to welcome his friend two of the coastguard jumped out and handed him to the dry bank while herbert van diemen and crickledon took him by hand and arm and hoisted him on to the flint wall preparatory to his descent into the field in this exposed situation the wind whose pranks are endless when it is once up seized and blew martin tinmans dressinggown wide as two violently flapping wings on each side of him and finally over his head van diemen turned a pair of stupefied flat eyes on herbert who cast a sly look at the ladies tinman had sprung down but not before the world in one tempestuous glimpse had caught sight of the court suit perfect gravity greeted him from the crowd safe old mart and glad to be able to say it said van diemen we are so happy said annette house furniture property everything i possess ejaculated tinman shivering fiddle man you want some hot breakfast in you your sister has gone onto elba come you too old man and wheres that plucky little girl who stood by was there a girl said tinman yes and there was a boy wanted to help van diemen pointed at herbert tinman looked and piteously asked have you examined marine parade and belle vue it depends on the tide here is little jane sir said mrs crickledon fall in van diemen said to little jane the girl was bobbing curtseys to annette on her introduction by mrs crickledon martin you stay at my house you stay at elba till you get things comfortable about you and then you shall have the crouch for a year rent free eh netty annette chimed in anything we can do anything nothing can be too much van diemen was praising little jane for her devotion to her master master have been so kind to me said little jane now march it is cold van diemen gave the word and herbert stood by mary rather dejectedly foreseeing that his prospects at elba were darkened now then mart left leg forward van diemen linked his arm in his friends i must have a look tinman broke from him and cast a forlorn look of farewell on the last of the house on the beach youve got me left to you old mart dont forget that said van diemen tinmans chest fell yes yes he responded he was touched and i told those fellows if they landed you dry they should haveid give them double pay and i do believe theyve earned their money i dont think im very wet im cold said tinman you cant help being cold so come along but philip tinman lifted his voice ive lost everything i tried to save a little i worked hard i exposed my life and all in vain the voice of little jane was heard whats the matter with the child said van diemen annette went up to her quietly but little jane was addressing her master oh if you please i did manage to save something the last thing when the boat was at the window and if you please sir all the bundles is lost but i saved you a papercutter and a letter horse guards and here they are sir the grateful little creature drew the square letter and papercutter from her bosom and held them out to mr tinman it was a letter of the imposing size with the horse guards very distinctly inscribed on it in tinmans best round hand to strike his vindictive spirit as positively intended for transmission and give him sight of his power to wound if it pleased him as it might what cried he not clearly comprehending how much her devotion had accomplished for him a letter to the horse guards cried van diemen here give it me said little janes master and grasped it nervously whats in that letter van diemen asked let me look at that letter dont tell me its private correspondence my dear philip dear friend kind thanks its not a letter said tinman not a letter why i read the address horse guards i read it as it passed into your hands now my man one look at that letter or take the consequences kind thanks for your assistance dear philip indeed oh this oh its nothing he tore it in halves his face was of the winter seacolour with the chalk wash on it tear again and i shall know what to think of the contents van diemen frowned let me see what youve said youve sworn you would do it and there it is at last by miracle but let me see it and ill overlook it and you shall be my housemate still if not tinman tore away you mistake you mistake youre entirely wrong he said as he pursued with desperation his task of rendering every word unreadable van diemen stood fronting him the accumulation of stores of petty injuries and meannesses which he had endured from this man swelled under the whip of the conclusive exhibition of treachery he looked so black that annette called papa philip said tinman philip my best friend pooh youre a poor creature come along and breakfast at elba and you can sleep at the crouch and goodnight to you crickledon he called to the houseless couple you stop at elba till i build you a shop with these words van diemen led the way walking alone herbert was compelled to walk with tinman mary and annette came behind and mary pinched annettes arm so sharply that she must have cried out aloud had it been possible for her to feel pain at that moment instead of a personal exultation flying wildly over the clash of astonishment and horror like a seabird over the foam in the first silent place they came to mary murmured the words little jane annette looked round at mrs crickledon who wound up the procession taking little jane by the hand little jane was walking demurely with a placid face annette glanced at tinman her excited feelings nearly rose to a scream of laughter for hours after mary had only to say to her little jane to produce the same convulsion it rolled her heart and senses in a headlong surge shook her to burning tears and seemed to her ideas the most wonderful running together of opposite things ever known on this earth the young lady was ashamed of her laughter but she was deeply indebted to it for never was mind made so clear by that beneficent exercise etext
