note there is a short list of bookmarks or pointers at the end of the file for those who may wish to sample the authors ideas before making an entire meal of them dw lord ormont and his aminta by george meredith book xxiv lovers mated xxxv preparations for a resolve xxvi visits of farewell xxvii a marine duet xxviii the plighting xxix aminta to her lord xxx conclusion chapter xxiv lovers mated he was benevolently martial to the extent of paternal in thinking his girl of whom he deigned to think now as his countess pardonably foolish woman for woman she was of a pattern superior to the worlds ordinary and might run the worlds elect a race but she was pitifully womanlike in her increase of dissatisfaction with the more she got women are happier enslaved men too if their despot is an ormont colonel of his regiment he proved that his men would follow him anywhere do anything grand old days before he was condemned by one knows not what extraordinary round of circumstances to cogitate on women as fluids and how to cut channels for them that they may course along in the direction good for them imagining it their pretty wanton will to go that way napoleons treatment of women is excellent example peterboroughs can be defended his aminta could not reason she nursed a rancour on account of the blow she drew on herself at steignton and she declined consolation in her being pardoned the reconcilement evidently was proposed as a finale of one of the detestable feminine storms enveloping men weak enough to let themselves be dragged through a scene for the sake of domestic tranquillity a remarkable exhibition of aminta the woman was her entire change of front since he had taken her spousal chill formerly she was passive merely stately the chiselled grande dame deferential in her bearing and speech even when argumentative and having an opinion to plant she had always the independent eye and step she now had the tongue of the graceful and native great lady fitted to rule her circle and hold her place beside the proudest of the ormonts she bore well the small shuffle with her jewelboxheld herself gallantly there had been no female feignings either affected misapprehensions gapy ignorances and snaky subterfuges and the like familiar to men who have the gentle twister in grip straight on the line of the thing to be seen she flew and struck on it and that is a womans martial action he would right heartily have called her comrade if he had been active himself a warrior pulled off his horse to sit in a chair and contemplate the minute evolutions of the sex is pettish with his part in such battle fields at the stage beyond amusement seen swimming she charmed him abstract views of a woman summon opposite advocates one can never say positively that is she but the visible fair form of a woman is hereditary queen of us we have none of your pleadings and counterpleadings and judicial summaries to obstruct a ravenous loyalty my lord beheld aminta take her three quick steps on the plank and spring and dive and ascend shaking the ends of her bound black locks and away she went with shut mouth and broad stroke of her arms into the sunny early morning river brave to see although he had to flick a bee of a question why he enjoyed the privilege of seeing and was not beside her the only answer confessed to a distaste for all exercise once pleasurable she and her little friend boated or strolled through the meadows during the day he fished when he and aminta rode out for the hour before dinner she seemed pleased she was amicable conversable all that was agreeable as a woman and she was the chillest of wives my lords observations and reflections came to one conclusion she pricked and challenged him to lead up to her desired stormy scene he met her and meant to vanquish her with the dominating patience charlotte had found too much for her women cannot stand against it to be patient in contention with women however one must have a continuous and an exclusive occupation and the tax it lays on us conduces usually to impatience with men my lord did not directly connect amintas chillness and morsfields impudence yet the sensation roused by his aminta participated in the desire to punish morsfield speedily without wishing for a duel he was moved by the social sanction it had to consider whether green youths and women might not think a grey head had delayed it too long the practice of the duel begot the peculiar animal logic of the nobler savage which tends to magnify an offence in the ratio of our vanity and hunger for a blood that is not demanded by the appetite moreover a waning practice in disfavour with the new generation will be commended to the conservative barbarian as partaking of the wisdom of his fathers further too we may have grown slothful fallen to moodiness done excess of service to omphale our tyrant lady of the glow and the chill and then undoubtedly the duel braces he left aminta for london submissive to the terms of intimacy dictated by her demeanour his unacknowledged seniority rendering their harshness less hard to endure she had not gratified him with a display of her person in the glitter of the ormont jewels and since he was under common conditions a speechless man his ineptitude for amorous remonstrances precipitated him upon deeds that he might offer additional proofs of his esteem and the assurance of her established position as his countess he proposed to engage lady charlotte in a conflict severer than the foregoing until he brought her to pay the ceremonial visit to her sisterinlaw the count of time for this final trial of his masterfulness he calculated at a week it would be an occupation miserable occupation though it was he hailed the prospect of chastising morsfield for a proof that his tussels with women prolonged study of their tricks manoeuvrings and outwittings of them had not emasculated him aminta willingly promised to write from day to day her senses had his absence insured to them by her anticipation of the task she did not conceive it would be so ponderous a task what to write to him when nothing occurred nothing did occur unless the arrival of mr weyburn was to be named an event she alluded to it mr weyburn has come expecting to find you here the dispatchbox is here is he to await you that innocent little question was a day gained one day of boating on the upper reaches of the pastoral river and walks in woods and golden meadows was felicity fallen on earth the ripe fruit of dreams a dread surrounded it as a belt not shadowing the horizon and she clasped it to her heart the more passionately like a mother her rosy infant which a dark world threatens and the universal fate love as it will be at her june of life was teaching her to know the good and bad of herself women educated to embrace principles through their timidity and their pudency discover amazed that these are not lasting qualities under loves influence the blushes and the fears take flight the principles depend much on the beloved is he a man whose contact with the world has given him understanding of lifes laws and can hold him firm to the right course in the strain and whirling of a torrent they cling to him deeply they worship and if they tempt him it is not advisedly done nature and love are busy in conjunction the timidities and pudencies have flown they may hover they are not present you deplore it you must not blame you have educated them so muscular principles are sown only out in the world and on the whole with all their errors the worldly men are the truest as well as the bravest of men her faith in his guidance was equal to her dependence the retrospect of a recent journey told her how he had been tried she could gaze tenderly betray her heart and be certain of safety can wine match that for joy she had no schemes no hopes but simply the desire to bestow the capacity to believe any wish to be enfolded by him was shapeless and unlighted unborn though now and again for some chance word or undefined thought she surprised the strange tenant of her breast at an incomprehensibly faster beat and knew it for her own and not her own the familiar the strangeran utter stranger as one who had snared her in a wreath and was pulling her off her feet she was not so guileless at the thought of little selina collett here and of selina as the letterbearer of old and the marvel that matey and browny and selina were together after all was it not a kind of summons to her to call him matey just once only once in play she burned and ached to do it she might have taxed her ingenuity successfully to induce little selina to the boldness of calling him mateyand she then repeating it as the woman who revived with a meditative effort recollections of the girl ah frightful hypocrite thoughts of the pleasure of his name aloud on her lips in his hearing dissolved through her veins and were met by matthew weyburns open face before which hypocrisy stood rent and stripped she preferred the calmer the truer pleasure of seeing him modestly take lessons in the nomenclature of weeds herbs grasses by hedge and ditch selina could instruct him as well in entomology but he knew better the swiss tyrolese and italian valleyhomes of beetle and butterfly species their simple talk was a cool zephyr fanning aminta the suggestion to unite the two came to her of course but their physical disparity denied her that chance to settle her own difficulty and a whisper of one physically the match for him punished her in stature in healthfulness they were equals perhaps not morally or intellectually and she could claim headship of him on one little point confided to her by his mother who was bearing him and startled by the boom of guns under her pillow when her husband fronted the enemy matthew weyburn the fencer boxer cricketer hunter all things manly rather shrank from firearmsat least one saw him put on a screw to manipulate them in dangeramong brigands or mutineers for example she could stand by him and prove herself his mate intellectually morally she had to bow humbly nor had she nor could she do more than lean on and catch example from his prompt spiritual valiancy it shone out from him and a crisis fulfilled the promise who could be his mate for cheerful courage for skill the ready mind easy adroitness and for selfcommand to imitate was a womans utmost matthew weyburn appeared the very matey of the first of may cricketing day among cupers boys the next morning when seen pacing down the gardenwalk he wore his white trousers of that happiest of old days the white ducks aminta and selina remembered selina beamed yes he did he always wore them but now its a frockcoat instead of a jacket but now he will be a master instead of a schoolboy said aminta let us hope he will prosper he gives me the idea of a man who must succeed selina said and she was patted rallied asked how she had the idea and kissed aminta saying she fancied it might be thought for he looked so confident only not what the boys used to call cocky said selina he wont be contemptuous of those he outstrips his choice of the schoolmasters profession points to a modesty in him does it not little woman he made me tell him while you were writing your letters yesterday all about my brother and his prospects yes that is like him and i must hear of your brother little collett dont forget sely little collett was our postman the countess of ormonts humorous reference to the circumstance passed with selina for a sign of a poetic love of the past and a present social elevation that allowed her to review it impassively she admired the great lady and good friend who could really be interested in the fortunes of a mere schoolmaster and a merchants clerk to her astonishment by some agency beyond her fathoming she found herself and hardly for her own pleasure pushing the young schoolmaster animatedly to have an account of his aims in the establishment of the foreign school weyburn smiled he set a short look at aminta and she conscious of her detected diplomacy had an inward shiver mixed of the fascination and repugnance felt by a woman who knows that under one mans eyes her character is naked and anatomized her characterher soul he held it in hand and probed it mercifully she had felt the sweet sting again and again and had shrunk from him and had crawled to him the love of him made it all fascination how did he learn to read at any moment right to the soul of a woman did experience teach him or sentimental sympathy he was too young he was too manly it must be because of his being in heart and mind the brother to the sister with women thames played round them on his pastoral pipes beenote and woodside blackbird and meadow cow and the fish of the silver rolling rings composed the leap of the music she gave her mind to his voice following whither it went half was in air higher than the swallows exalting him how is it he is the brother of women they are sisters for him because he is neither sentimentalist nor devourer he will not flatter to feed on them the one he chooses she will know love there are women who go through life not knowing love they are inanimate automatic machines who lay them down at last inquiring wherefore they were caused to move she is not of that sad flock she will be mated she will have the right to call him matey a certain browny called him matey she lived and died a certain woman apes brownys features and inherits her passion but has forfeited her rights were she under happiest conditions to put her hand in his shame would burn her for he is justhe is justice and a woman bringing him less than his due she must be a creature of the slime this was the shadowy sentiment that made the wall of division between them there was no other lord ormont had struck to fragments that barrier of the conventional oath and ceremonial union he was unjust he was injustice the weak may be wedded they cannot be married to injustice and if we have the world for the buttress of injustice then is nature the flaring rebel there is no fixed order possible laws are necessary instruments of the majority but when they grind the sane human being to dust for their maintenance their enthronement is the rule of the savages old deity sniffing bloodsacrifice there cannot be a based society upon such conditions an immolation of the naturally constituted individual arrests the general expansion to which we step decivilizes more and is more impious to the god in man than temporary revelries of a licence that nature soon checks arrows of thoughts resembling these shot over the half of amintas mind not listening her lovers head was active on the same theme while he spoke they converged to it from looks crossing or catching profiles or from tones from a motion of hand from a chance word insomuch that the third person present was kept unobservant only by her studious and humble speculations on the young schoolmasters grand project to bring the nationalities together and teach old england to the continentthe continent to old england our healthy games our scorn of the lie manliness their intellectual valour diligence considerate manners just to name a few of the things for interchange said weyburn as to method we shall be their disciples but i look forward to our fellows getting the lead no hurry why will they you ask in petto well they re emulous and they take a thrashing kindly that s the way to learn a lesson i ve seen our fellows beaten and beatennever the courage beaten out of them in the end they won and kept the field they have a lot to learnprincipally not to be afraid of ideas they lose heaps of time before they can feel at home with ideas they call themselves practical for having an addiction to the palpable it is a pretty wreath they clap on their deficiencies practical dogs are for bones horses for corn i want the practical englishman to settle his muzzle in a nosebag of ideas when he has once got hold of them he makes good stuff of them on the continent ideas have wings and pay visits here theyre stayathome then i want our fellows to have the habit of speaking from the chest they shall return to england with the whoop of the mountains in them and ready to jump out they shall have an achillean roar and they shall sing by second nature dont fear theyll give double for anything they take ive known italians to whom an englishmans honesty of mind and dealing was one of the dreams of a better humanity they had put in a box frenchmen too who when they came to know us were astonished at their epithet of perfide and loved us emile said aminta you remember emile selina the dear little french boy at mr cupers oh i do selina responded he will work with mr weyburn in switzerland oh that will be nice the girl exclaimed aminta squeezed selinas hand a shower of tears clouded her eyes she chose to fancy it was because of her envy of the modest busy peaceful girl who envied none conquers also sincerity in the sincerest she was vexed with her full breast and had as little command of her thoughts as of her feelings mr weyburn has ideas for the education of girls too she said theres the task said he its to separate them as little as possible all thepassezmoi le motdevilry between the sexes begins at their separation they re foreigners when they meet and their alliances are not always binding the chief object in life if happiness be the aim and the growing better than we are is to teach men and women how to be one for if they re not then each is a morsel for the other to prey on lady charlotte egletts view is that the greater number of them on both sides hate one another hate exclaimed selina and aminta said is lady charlotte eglett an authority she has observed and she thinks she has in the abstract the justest of minds and that is the curious point about her but one may say they are trained at present to be hostile some of them fall in love and strike a truce and still they are foreigners they have not the same standard of honour they might have it from an education in common but there must be also a lady to govern the girls selina interposed ah yes she is not yet found would it increase their mutual respector show of respect if you like said aminta with his last remark at work as the shattering bell of a citys insurrection in her breast in time under management catching and grouping them young a boy who sees a girl do what he cant and would like to do wont take refuge in his muscular superioritywhich by the way would be lessened you suppose their capacities are equal things are not equal i suppose their excellencies to make a pretty nearly equal sum in the end but we re not weighing them each the question concerns the advantage of both that seems just aminta threw no voice into the word just it was the word of the heavens assuaging earths thirst and she was earth to him her soul yearned to the man whose mind conceived it she said to selina we must plan an expedition next year or the year after and see how the school progresses all three smiled and selina touched and held amintas hand shyly visions of the unseen switzerland awed her weyburn named the spring holiday time the season of the flowering alpine robes he promised welcome pressed for a promise of the visit warmly it was given we will we will indeed i shall look forward he said there was nothing else for him or for her except to doat on the passing minute that slipped when seized the looking forward turned them to the looking back at the point they had flown from and yielded a momentary pleasure enough to stamp some section of a picture on their memories which was not the burning now love lives for in the clasp if but of hands desire of it destroyed it they swung to the future swung to the present it made the past sensible to the quick of the now they could not hold they were lovers divided lovers in presence they thought and they felt in pieces feelings and thoughts were forbidden to speech she dared look the very little of her hearts fulness without the disloyalty it would have been in him to let a small peep of his heart be seen while her hand was not clasped she could look tenderly and her fettered state her sense of unworthiness muffled in the deeps would keep her from the loosening to passion he who read through her lustrous transiently dwelling eyes had not that security his part besides the watch over the spring of his hot blood was to combat a host insidious among which was unreason calling her browny urging him to take his own to snatch her from a possessor who forfeited by undervaluing her this was the truth in a betterordered world she belonged to the man who could help her to grow and to do her work but in the world we have around us it was the distorted truth and keeping passion down he was able to wish her such happiness as pertained to safety from shipwreck and for himself that he might continue to walk in the ranks of the sober citizens oh true and right but she was gloriously beautiful day by day she surpassed the wondrous browny of old days all women were eclipsed by her she was that fire in the night which lights the night and draws the night to look at it and more this queen of women was beginning to have a mind at work one saw already the sprouting of a mind repressed she had a distinct ability the good ambition to use her qualities she needed life and airthat is comprehension of her encouragement the companion mate with what strength would she now endow him the pride in the sharp imagination of possessing her whispered a boast of the strength her mate would have from her his need and her need rushed together somewhere down the skies they could not he argued be separated eternally he had to leave her selina shocked at a boldness she could not understand in herself begged him to stay and tell her of switzerland and alpine flowers and herbs and the valleys for the gold beetle and the apollo butterfly aminta hinted that lord ormont might expect to find him there if he came the next morning but she would not try to persuade and left the decision with him loving him for the pain he inflicted by going why indeed should he stay both could ask they were one in asking anguish balanced pleasure in them both the day of the pleasure was heaven to remember heaven to hope for not so heavenly to pray for the praying for it each knew implored their joint will to decree the perilous blessing a shadowy sentiment of duty and rectitude born of what they had suffered hung between them and the prayer for a renewal that would renew the tempting they were conscious of when the sweet the strained throbbing day was over they could hope for chance to renew it and then they would be irresponsible then they would think and wish discreetly so as to have it a happiness untainted in refusing now to take another day or pray for it they deserved that chance should grant it aminta had said through selina the utmost her selfdefences could allow but the idea of a final parting cut too cruelly into her life and she murmured i shall see you before you go for good i will come here or in london i can trust quite certain a meeting of a few hasty minutes involved none of the dangers of a sunny long summer day and if it did the heart had its claims the heart had its powers of resistance otherwise we should be base verily he turned on a bow to leave her before there was a motion for the offer of her hand after many musings and frettings she reached the wisdom of that wisdom was her only nourishment now a cold lean dietary it is but he dispensed it and it fed her or kept her alive it became a proud feeling that she had been his fellow in the achievement of a piece of wisdom though the other feeling that his hands kind formal touching without pressure of hers would have warmed her to go through the next interview with her lord mocked at pure satisfaction did he distrust himself or was it to spare her but if so her heart was quite bare to him but she knew it was aminta drove her questioning heart as a vessel across blank circles of sea where there was nothing save the solitary heart for answer it answered intelligibly and comfortingly at last telling her of proof given that she could repose under his guidance with absolute faith was ever loved woman more blest than she in such belief she had it firmly and a blessedness too in this surety wavering beneath shadows of the uncertainty her eyes knew it her ears were empty of the words her heart knew it and it was unconfirmed by reason as for his venturing to love her he feared none and no sooner did that reflection surge than she stood up beside him in revolt against her lion and lord her instinct judged it impossible she could ever have yielded her heart to a man lacking courage hencewhat when cowardice appeared as the sole impediment to happiness now he had gone and the day lived again for both of thema day of sheer gold in the translation from troubled earth to the mind one anothers beauty through the visage into the character was newly perceived and worshipped and the beauties of pastoral thames the temple of peace hardly noticed in the passing of the daytaken as air to the breather until some chip of the scene round which an emotion had curled was vivid foreground and gateway to shrouded romance it might be the streams white face browning into willowdroopers or a wagtail on a waterlily leaf or the forehorse of an upriver barge at strain of legs a redfinned perch hung a foot above the pebbles in sunveined depths a kingfisher on the scud under alders the forest of the bankside weeds chapter xxv preparations for a resolve that day receded like a spent billow and lapsed among the others advancing but it left a print deeper than events would have stamped amintas pen declined to run to her lord and the dipping it in ink was no acceleration of the process a sentence bearing likeness to an artless infants trot of the halfdozen steps to mothers lap stumbled upon the full stop midway desperate determination pushed it along and there was in consequence a dead stop at the head of the next sentence a woman whose nature is insurgent against the majesty of the man to whom she must among the singular injunctions binding her regularly write sees no way between hypocrisy and rebellion for rebellion she with the pen in her hand is avowedly not yet ripe hypocrisy is abominable if she abstained from writing he might travel down to learn the cause a similar danger or worse haunted the writing frigidly she had to be the hypocrite or elseleap but an honest woman who is a feeling woman when she consents to play hypocrite cannot do it by halves from writing a short cold letter aminta wrote a short warm one or very friendly length she could avoid because she was unable to fill a page it seemed that she could not compose a friendly few lines without letting her sex be felt in them what she had put away from her so as not to feel it herself the simulation of ever so small a bit of feeling brought prominently back and where she had made a cast for flowing independent simplicity she was feminine ultrafeminine to her reading of it better take the leap than be guilty of doubledealing even on paper the nature of the leap she did not examine her keen apprehension of the price payable for his benevolent intentions caught scent of them in the air those ormont jewels shone as emblems of a detested subjection the penalty for being the beautiful woman rageing men proclaimed was there no scheme of some other sort and far less agreeable to make amends for steignton she was shrewd at divination she guessed her lords design rather than meet lady charlotte she proposed to herself the leap immediately knowing it must be a leap in the dark hoping it might be into a swimmers water she had her own pinmoney income and she loathed the chain of her title so the leap would at least be honourable as it assuredly would be unregretted whatever ensued while amintas heart held on to this debate and in her bed in her boat across the golden valley meadows beside her peaceful little friend she gathered a gradual resolution without sight of agencies or consequences lord ormont was kept from her by the struggle to master his charlotte a second timecompared with which the first was insignificant and this time it was curious he could not subdue her physique as he did before she was ready for him each day and she was animated much more voluble she was ready to jest the reason being that she fought now on plausibly good grounds on behalf of her independent action previously her intelligence of the ultimate defeat hanging over the more stubborn defence of a weak position had harassed her to deaths door she had no right to retain the family jewels she had the most perfect of established rights to refuse doing an ignominious thing she refused to visit the socalled countess of ormont or leave her card or take one step to warrant the woman in speaking of her as her sisterinlaw and noit did not signify that her brother rowsley was prohibited by her from marrying whom he pleased it meant that to judge of his acts as those of a reasoning man he would have introduced his wife to his relativesthe relatives he had not quarrelled withimmediately upon his marriage unless he was ashamed of the woman and a wife he was ashamed of was no sisterinlaw for her nor aunt for her daughters nor should she come playing the black venus among her daughters husbands lady charlotte had it in her bosom to say additionally lord ormont was disconcerted by her manifest pleasure in receiving him every day evidently she consented to the recurrence of a vexatious dissension for the enjoyment of having him with her hourly her dialectic too was cunning impetuous with meaning she forced her way to get her meaning out in a manner effective to strike her blow anything for a diversion or a triumph of the moment he made no way she was the better fencer at the tongue yet there was not any abatement of her deference to her brother and this little misunderstanding put aside he was the rowsley esteemed by her as the chief of men she foiled him it might seem to exalt him the more after he had left the house visibly annoyed and somewhat stupefied she talked of him to her husband of the soul of chivalry rowsley was the loss to his country mr eglett was a witness to one of the altercations when she having as usual the dialectical advantage praised her brother to his face for his magnanimous nature regretting only that it could be said he was weak on the woman side of himwhich was she affirmed a side proper to every man worth the name but in his case his country might complain of whatwell of a womanwhat had she done for the country to complain of herwhy then arts or graces she had bewitched and weaned him from his public duty his military service his patriotic ambition lord ormonts interrogations heightening the effect of charlottes charge appeared to mr eglett as a giving of himself over into her hands but the earl after a minute of silence proved he was a tricky combatant it was he who had drawn on charlotte that he might have his opportunity to eulogizethis lady whom you continue to call the woman after i have told you she is my wife according to him her appeals her entreaties that he should not abandon his profession or let his ambition rust had been at one period constant he spoke fervently for him eloquently and he gained his point he silenced lady charlottes tongue and impressed mr eglett when the latter and his wife were alone he let her see that the countess of ormont was becoming a personage in his consideration lady charlotte cried out hear these men where its a goodlooking woman between the winds do you take anything rowsley says for earnest you ought to know he stops at no trifle to get his advantage over you in a dispute that s the soldier in him it s victory at any costand i like him for it do you tell me you think it possible my brother rowsley would keep smothered years under a bushel the woman he can sit here magnifying because he wants to lime you and me you to take his part and me to go and call the noble creature decked out in his fine fiction my sisterinlaw nothing ll tempt me to believe my brother could behave in such a way to the woman he respected so mr eglett opined but he had been impressed he relieved his mind on the subject in a communication to lord adderwood who habitually shook out the contents of his to mrs lawrence finchley and she deeming it good for aminta to have information of the war waging for her behoof obtained her country address with the resolve to drive down a bearer of good news to the dear woman she liked to think of look at and occasionally caress besides rather tenderly pitying her now that a change of fortune rendered her former trials conspicuous an incident considered grave even in the days of the duel and the kicks against a swelling public reprehension of the practice occurred to postpone her drive for fourandtwenty hours london was shaken by rumours of a tragic mishap to a socially wellknown gentleman at the chiallo fencing rooms the rumours passing from mouth to mouth acquired in the nature of them sinister colours as they circulated lord ormont sent aminta word of what he called a bad sort of accident at chiallos without mentioning names or alluding to suspicions he treated it lightly he could not have written of it with such unconcern if it involved the secretary yet aminta did seriously ask herself whether he could and she flew rapidly over the field of his character seizing points adverse points favourably advocative balancing dubiouslymost unjustly she felt she was unjust but in her condition the heart of a woman is instantly planted in jungle when the spirits of the two men closest to her are made to stand opposed by a sudden excitement of her fears for the beloved one she cannot see widely and is one of the wild while the fit lasts and after it that savage narrow vision she had of the unbeloved retains its vivid print in permanence was she unjust aminta cited corroboration of her being accurate such was lord ormont and although his qualities of gallantry courtesy integrity honourable gentleman presented a fair lowlevel account on the other side she had so stamped his massive selfishness and icy inaccessibility to emotion on her conception of him that the repulsive figure formed by it continued towering when her mood was kinder love played on love in the womans breast her love had taken a fever from her lords communication of the accident at chiallos and she pushed her alarm to imagine the deadliest and plead for the right of confession to herself of her unrepented regrets she and matey weyburn had parted without any pressure of hands without a touch they were then unplighted if now the grave divided them no touch mere glances and she sighed not as she pleaded for the touch but for the plighting it would have been if now she had lost him he could never tell herself that since the dear old buried and nightwalking schooldays she had said once matey to him named him once to his face matey weyburn a sigh like the roll of a great wave breaking against a wall of rock came from her for the possibly lost chance of naming him to his face mateyoh and seeing his look as she said it the boldness might be fancied it could not be done agreeing with the remote inner voice of her reason so far she toned her exclamatory foolishness to question in reasons plain deep bassoprofundo accompaniment tone how much the most blessed of mortal women could do to be of acceptable service to a young schoolmaster there was no reply to the question but it became a nestling centre for the skiey flock of dreams and for really temperate soundings of her capacities tending to the depreciatory she could do little she entertained the wish to work not only for the sake of somebody as her favourite poet sang but for the sake of working and servingproving that she was helpfuller than a countess of ormont ranged with all the other countesses in china and dresden on a drawingroom mantelpiece for show she could organize manage a household manage people too she thought manage a husband the word offends perhaps invigorate him here and there perhaps inspire him if he would let her breathe husbands exist who refuse the right of breathing to their puppet wives above all as it struck her she could assist and be more than an echo of one nobler in breathing manliness high spirit into boys with that idea she grazed the shallows of reality and her dreams whirred from the nest and left it hungrily empty selina collett was writing under the verandah letters to her people in suffolk performing the task with marvellous ease aminta noted it as a mark of superior ability and she had the envy of the complex nature observing the simple it accused her of some guiltiness uncommitted and indefensible she had pushed her anxiety about the accident at chiallos to an extreme that made her the creature of her sensibilities in the midst of this quiet country life and landscape these motionless garden flowers headed by the smooth white river and her gentle little friend so homely here the contemplation of herself was like a shriek in music worse than discordant she pronounced herself inferior unfit mentally as well as bodily for the dreams of companionship with any noble soul who might have the dream of turning her into something better there are couples in the world not coupled by priestly circumstance who are close to the true union by reason of generosity on the one part grateful devotion as for the gift of life on the other for instance mrs lawrence finchley and lord adderwood which was an instance without resemblance but amintas heart beat thick for what it wanted and they were the instance of two that did not have to snap false bonds of a marriagetie in order to walk together composedly outside itin honour oh yes yes she insisted on believing it was in honour she saw the couple issue from the boathouse she had stepped into the garden full of a presentiment so she fancied the moment they were seen she had in fact heard a noise in the boathouse while thinking of them and the effect on her was to spring an idea of mysterious interventions at the sight mrs lawrence rushed to her and was embraced you re not astonished to see me adder drove me down and stopped his coach at the inn and rowed me the halfmile up we will lunch if you propose but presently my dear i have to tell you things you have heard the accident aminta tried to read in mrs lawrences eyes whether it closely concerned her those pretty eyes their cut of lids hinting at delicate affinities with the ricepaper lady of the court of china were trying to peer seriously poor man one must be sorry for him he who you ve not heard then mrs lawrence dropped her voice morsfield aminta shivered all i have heardhalf a line from my lord this morning no name it was at the fencingrooms he said yes he wouldnt write more said mrs lawrence nodding you know he would have had to do it himself if it had not been done for him adder saw him some days back in a brown consultation near his club with captain may oh but of course it was accident did he call it so in his letter to you one word of mr morsfield he is wounded past cure he has the thing he cried for spoilt boy as he was from his birth i tell you truth m aminta i grieve to lose him what with his airs of the foreigntinted punctilious courtly gentleman covering a survival of the ancient british forest boar or bear he was a picture in our modern set and piquant and he was devoted to our sex we must admit after the style of the bears they are for honey and they have a hug if he hadnt been so much of a madman i should have liked him for his courage he had plenty of that nothing to steer it a second cousin comes in for his estates he is dead aminta cried yes dear he is gone what the women think of it i cant say the general feeling among the men is that some one of them would have had to send him sooner or later the curious point adder says is his letting it be done by steel he was a dead shot dangerous with the small sword as your mr weyburn said only soon off his head but i used to be anxious about the earls meeting him with pistols he did his best to provoke it here addershe spoke over her shouldertell lady ormont all you know of the morsfieldmay affair lord adderwood bowed compliance his coolness was the masculine of mrs lawrences hardly feminine in treating of a terrible matter so that the dull red facts had to be disengaged from his manner of speech before they sank into amintas acceptance of them as credible they fought with foils buttons off preliminary ceremonies perfect salute in due order guard and at it odd thing was nobody at chiallos had a notion of the business till morsfield was pinked he wouldnt be denied went to work like a fellow meaning to be skewered if he couldnt do the trick and he tried it may had been practising some weeks hes well on the continent by this time itll blow over button off sheer accident i wasnt lucky enough to see the encounter came in just when chiallo was lashing his poll over morsfield flat on the ground he had it up to the hilt we put a buttoned foil by the side of morsfield and all swore to secrecy as it is it ll go badly against poor chiallo taste for fencing wont be much improved by the affair they quarrelled in the dressing room and fetched the foils and knocked off the buttons there a big rascal toady squire of morsfields did it for him morsfield was just up from yorkshire he said he was expecting a summons elsewhere bound to await it declined provocation for the present may filliped him on the cheek adder conveyed the information of her husbands flight to the consolable amy said mrs lawrence he had to catch the coach for dover adderwood explained his wife was at a dinnerparty i saw her at midnight fair amy was not so very greatly surprised quite the soldiers wife she said she was used to these little catastrophes but adder what did she say of her husband said she was never anxious about him for nothing would kill him mrs lawrence shook a doleful head at aminta you see my dear aminta heres another and probably her last chance of sharing the marquisate gone who can fail to pity her except old time and i m sure she likes her husband well enough she ought no woman ever had such a servant but the captain has not been known to fight without her sanction and the inference isalas woe fair amy is doomed to be the fighting captains bride to the end of the chapter adder says she looked handsome a dinnerparty suits her cosmetic complexion better than a ball the account of the inquest is in the days papers and we were tolerably rejoiced we could drive out of london without having to reply to coroners questions he diedsoon amintas voice was shaken mrs lawrence touched at her breast it might be for heart or lungs judging by amintas voice and face one could suppose she was harking back in womans way to her original sentiment for the man now that he lay prostrate aminta read the unreproachful irony in the smile addressed to her she was too convulsed by her many emotions and shouting thoughts to think of defending herself selina in the drawingroom diligently fingered and classed brownblack pressed weeds of her neophytes botanyfolios the sight of her and her occupation struck aminta as that of a person in another world beyond this world of blood strangely substantial to view and one heard her speak guiltyno but she had wished to pique her lord after the term of a length of months could it be that the unhappy man and she were punished for the halfminutes acting of some interest in him and lord ormont had been seen consulting captain may or was it giving him directions her head burned all the barren interrogations were up running and knocking for hollow responses and saving a paleness of face she cloaked any small show of the riot she was an amiable hostess she had ceased to comprehend mrs lawrence even to the degree of thinking her unfeminine she should have known that the angelical chimpanzee as a friend once told of his being a favourite with the lady had called her could not simulate a feeling and had not the slightest power of pretence to compassion for an illfated person who failed to quicken her enthusiasm in that too she was a downright boy morsfield was a kind of bedlamite to her amusing in his antics and requiring to be manoeuvred and eluded while he lived once dead just a tombstone of interest only to his family she beckoned aminta to follow her and with a smirk of indulgent fun commended lord adderwood to a study of selina colletts botanyfolios which the urbanest of indifferent gentlemen had slid his eyes over his nose to inspect before the lunch you ought to know what is going on in town my dear aminta you have won the earl to a sense of his duty and he s at work on the harder task of winning lady charlotte eglett to a sense of hers it s tremendous has been forward some days and no sign of yielding on either side mr eglett good man is between them catching it right and left and he deserves his luck for marrying her vows she makes him the best of wives if he s content i ve nothing to complain of you must be ready to receive her my lord is sure to carry the day you gulp you wont be seeing much of her i m glad to say he is condescending to terms of peace with the horse guards we hear so you may be throning it officially somewhere next year and all s well that ends well say that to me it is when the end comes aminta replied mrs lawrences cool lips were pressed to her cheek the couple and their waterman rowed away to the party they had left with the fourin hand at their inn a wind was rising the trees gave their swish of leaves the river darkened the patch of wrinkles the bordering flags amid the reedblades dipped and streamed surcharged with unassimilated news of events that made a thunder in her head aminta walked down the garden path meeting selina and bearing her on she had a witchs will to rouse gales hers was not the womans nature to be driven cowering by stories of mens bloody deeds she took the field revolted dissevering herself from the class which tolerated themactuated by a reflective moralty she believed and loathed herself for having aspired schemed to be a member of the class but it was not the class it was against her lord as representative of the class that she was now the rebel neither naming him nor imaging him her enveloping mind was black on him such as one of those hard slaughtering men could call her his own she breathed short and breathed deep her bitter reason had but the common pity for a madman despatched to his rest yet she knew hatred of her lord in his being suspected as instigator or accomplice of the hand that dealt the blow he became to her thought a python whose coils were about her person insufferable to the gaze backward moments like these are the mothers in travail of a resolve joylessly conceived undesired to clasp necessitys offspring thunderclouds have as little love of the lightnings they fling aminta was aware only of her torment the trees were bending the water hissing the grasses all this way and that like hands of a delirious people in surges of wreck she scorned the meaningless shake of the garments of earth and exclaimed if we were by the sea tonight i shall be tomorrow night said selina i shall think of you oh would you come with me would you have me my mother will indeed be honoured by your consenting to come write to her before the post is out we shall travel down together aminta nodded and smiled and selina kissed her hand in joy saying that down home she would not be so shy of calling her aminta she was bidden to haste chapter xxvi visits of farewell the noise in london over adolphus morsfields tragical end disturbed lord ormont much less than the cessation of letters from his aminta and that likewise considering his present business on her behalf he patiently shrugged at and pardoned foreseeing her penitent air he could do it lightly after going some way to pardon his offending country for aminta had not offended his robust observation of her was moved to the kindly humorous by a reflective view here and there of the downright woman her clever little shuffles exposed her to be not worse it was her sex that made her one of the gliders in grasses some of whom are venomous but she belonged to the order only as an innocuous blindworm he could pronounce her small byplay with morsfield innocent her efforts to climb the stairs into society quite innocent judging her of course by her title of woman a womans innocence has a rainbow skin set this one beside other women she comes out well fairly well well enough now that the engagement with charlotte assumed proportions of a series of battle properly to be entitled a campaign he had in his loneliness fallen into the habit of reflecting at the close of his days work and the rubbing of that unused opaque mirror hanging inside a man of action had helped him piecemeal to perceive bits of his conduct entirely approved by him which were intimately connected nevertheless with a train of circumstances that he disliked and could not charge justly upon any other shoulders than his own what was to be thought of it he would not be undergoing this botheration of the prolonged attempt to bring a stubborn woman to a sense of her duty if he had declared his marriage in the ordinary style and given his young countess her legitimate place before the world what impeded it the shameful ingratitude of his countrymen to the soldier who did it eminent service at a crisis of the destinies of our indian empire he could not condone the injury done to him by entering among them again too like the kicked cur that he retiredcall it sulked in his tent if you like his wife had to share his fortunes he being slighted she necessarily was shadowed for a while she bore it contentedly enough then began her mousy scratches to get into the room off the wainscot without blame from him she behaved according to her female nature yes but the battles with charlotte forced on his recognition once more and violently the singular consequences of his retirement and coriolanus quarrel with his countrymen he had doomed himself ever since to a contest with women first it was his queen of amazons who if vanquished was not so easily vanquished and in fact doubtfully for now to propitiate her he had challenged and must overcome or be disgraced the toughest amazonian warrior man could stand against at cast of dart or lock of arms no day scored an advantage and she did not apparently suffer fatigue he did that is to say he was worried and hurried to have the wrangle settled and charlotte at amintas feet he gained not an inch of ground his principle in a contention of the sort was to leave the woman to the practice of her obvious artifices and himself simply hammer incessantly hammer but charlotte hammered as well the modest position of the defensive negative was not to her taste the moment he presented himself she flew out upon some yesterdays part of the argument and carried the war across the borders in attacks on his character and qualitieshis weakness regarding women his incapacity to forgive and the rest she hammered on that head as for any prospect of a termination of the strife he could see none in her joyful welcome to him and regretful parting and pleased appointment of the next meeting day after day the absurdest of her devices for winding him off his aim was to harp on some new word she had got hold of as for example to point out to him his aptitudes compliment him on his aptitudes recommend him to study and learn the limitations of his aptitudes she revelled in something the word unfolded to her however here was the point she had to be beaten so if she too persisted in hammering he must employ her female weapon of artifice with her one would gladly avoid the stooping to it in a civil dispute in which one is not so gloriously absolved for lying and entrapping as in splendid war weyburns name was announced to him at an early hour on thursday morning my lord nodded to the footman he nodded to himself over a suggestion started in a tactical intelligence by the name ah you re off he accosted the young man i have come to take my leave my lord nothing new in the morning papers a report that captain may intends to return and surrender not before a month has passed if he follows my counsel to defend his character he has none his reputation he has too much these charges against him must be intolerable was he not a bit of a pupil of yours we practised two or three timesnothing more morsfield was a wasp at a feast somebody had to crush him i ve seen the kind of man twice in my life and exactly the kind of man if their law puts down duelling he rules the kingdom my lord i should venture to say the kind of man can be a common annoyance because the breach of the law is countenanced bad laws are best broken a society that cant get a scouring now and then will be a dirty set with a bend of the head in apology for speaking of himself weyburn said i have acted on my view i declined a challenge from a sort of henchman of his oh a poachers lurcher you did right fight such fellows with constables you have seen lady charlotte i am on my way to her ladyship do me this favour fourteen doors up the street of her residence my physician lives i have to consult him at once dr rewkes weyburn bowed lady charlotte could not receive him later than halfpast ten of the morning he said this morning she can said my lord you will tell dr rewkes that it is immediate i rather regret your going i shall be in a controversy with the horse guards about our cavalry saddles it would be regiments of raw backs the first fortnight of a campaign the earl discoursed on saddles and passed to high eulogy of our hanoverian auxiliary troopers in the peninsula good husbands he named them quaintly speaking of their management of their beasts thence he diverged to frederics cavalry rarely matched for shrewdness and endurance to the deeds of the liechtenstein hussars to the great things blucher did with his horsemen the subject was interesting but weyburn saw the clock at past the half after ten he gave a slight sign of restiveness and was allowed to go when the earl had finished his pro and con upon arab horses and mameluke saddles lord ormont nicked his head just as at their first interview he was known to have an objection to the english shaking of hands goodmorning he said adding a remark or two of which et cetera may stand for an explicit rendering it concerned the young mans prosperity my lords conservative plain sense was in doubt of the prospering of a giddy pate however good a worker his last look at the young man who had not served him badly held an anticipation of possibly some day seeing a tatterdemalion of shipwreck a rueful exhibition of ideas put to the business of life weyburn left the message with dr rewkes in person it had not seemed to him that lord ormont was one requiring the immediate attendance of a physician by way of accounting to lady charlotte for the lateness of his call he mentioned the summons he had delivered oh thats why he hasnt come yet said she well sit and talk till he does come i dont wonder if his bile has been stirred he cant oil me to credit what he pumps into others his lady ormont i believe in it less than ever i did morsfield or no morsfieldand now the poor wretch has got himself pinned to the plank like my grandson bobbys dragonflies i dont want to say anything further of himshe doesnt have much of a welcome at steignton if i were a woman to wager as men do i d stake a thousand pounds to five on her never stepping across the threshold of steignton all very well in london and that place he hires up at marlow he respects our home that s how i know my brother rowsley still keeps a sane man a fortune on itand so says mr eglett any reasonable person must think it he made a fool of some hamptonevey at madrid if he went through any ceremonyand that i doubt but she and old what do they call her may have insisted upon the title as much as they could he sixty she under twenty im told pagnell s the name that aunt of a goodlooking young woman sees a noble man of sixty admiring her five feet seven or soshes tallof marketable merchandise and she doesnt need telling that at sixty hell give the world to possess the girl but not his family honour he stops at that why lord ormont s made of pride hell be kind to her hell be generous he wont forsake her shell have her portion in his will and by the course of things in nature shell outlive him and marry and be happy i hope only she wont enter steignton you remember what i say you ll live when i m gone it s the thirst of her life to be mistress of steignton not shethough lord ormont would have us all open our doors to her mine too now he s about it he sets his mind on his plan and he forgets rights and dueseverything he must have it as his will dictates that s how he made such a capital soldier you know the cavalry leader he was if theyd given him a field in europe his enemies admit that twelve and my clocks five minutes or more slow what can rowsley be doing she rattled backward on the scene at steignton and her brothers handsome preservation of his dignity stood it like the king he is and to the morsfieldmay encounter which had prevented another and mrs may was rolled along in the tide with a hint of her good reason for liking lord ormont also the change of opinion shown by the press as to lord ormonts grand exploit referring to it she flushed and jigged on her chair for a saddle beneath her and that glorious indian adventure warmed her to the man who had celebrated it among his comrades when a boy at school you re to teach latin and greek you said for you re right we english cant understand the words we re speaking if we dont know a good deal of latin and some greek conversing in tokens not standard coin you said i remember and therell be a general rabble tongue unless we english are drilled in the languages we filched from lots of lords and ladies want the drilling then ill send some over to you for swiss air and roots of the english tongue oh and you told me you supported lord ormont on his pet argument for corps delite and you quoted virgil to back it let me have that line againin case of his condescending to write to the papers on the subject weyburn repeated the halfline good i wont forget now and you said the french act on that because they follow human nature and the english dont we bully it you said that was on our drive down to steignton i hope you ll succeed you ll be visiting england call on me in london or at olmeronly mind and give me warning i shall be glad to see you i ve got some ideas from you if i meet a man who helps me to read the world and men as they are i m grateful to him and most people are not you ll find they want you to show them what they d like the world to be we dont agree about a lady you re in the lists lance in rest all for chivalry you re a man and a young man have you taken your leave of her yet shell expect it as a proper compliment i propose running down to take my leave of lady ormont tomorrow replied weyburn she is handsome she is very handsome beautiful do you mean oh my lady it would only be a mans notion now that s as good an answer as could be made you re sure to succeed i m not the womans enemy but let her keep her place why rowsley cant be coming today did lord ormont look ill it did not strike me so he s between two fires a man gets fretted but i shant move a step i dare say she wont especially with that morsfield out of the way you do mean you think her a beauty well then therell soon be a successor to morsfield beauties will have their weapons and they can hit on plenty and it s nothing to me as long as i save my brother from their arts weyburn felt he had done his penance in return for kindness he bowed and rose lady charlotte stretched out her hand we shall be sending you a pupil some day she said and smiled forward your address as soon as you re settled her face gave a glimpse of its youth in a cordial farewell smile lord ormont had no capacity to do the like although they were strictly brother and sister in appearance the smallest difference in character rendered her complex and kept him simple she had a thirsting mind weyburn fancied that a close intimacy of a few months would have enabled him to lift her out of her smirching and depraving mean jealousies he speculated as he trod the street on little plots and surprises which would bring lady charlotte and lady ormont into presence and end by making friends of them supposing that could be done lady ormont might be righted by the intervention of lady charlotte after all weyburn sent his dream flying with as dreamy an afterthought funny it will be then for lady charlotte to revert to the stuff she has been droning in my ear half an hour agolook well behind and we see spots where we buzzed lowed bit and tore and not until we have cast that look and seen the brute are we human creatures a crumb of reflection such as this could brace him adding its modest maravedi to his prized storehouse of gain fortifying with assurances of his having a concrete basis for his business in life his great youthful ambition had descended to it but had sunk to climb on a firmer footing arthur abner had his next adieu they talked of lady ormont as to whose position of rightful countess of ormont mr abner had no doubt he said of lady charlotte she has a clear head but she loves her brother rowsley excessively and any excess pushes to craziness he spoke to weyburn of his prospects in the usually perhaps necessarily cheerless tone of men who recognize by contrast the one mouses nibbling at a mountain of evil to harmonize the nationalities my dear boy teach christians to look fraternally on jews david was a harper but the setting of him down to roll off a fugue on one of your cathedral organs would not impose a heavier task than you are undertaking you have my best wishes whatever aid i can supply but we re nearer to king johns time than to your ideal as far as the jews go not in england less in england abner shrugged you have beaten the christians on the field they challenged you to enter for a try they feel the pinch in their interests and their vanity that will pass i m for the two sides under the name of justice and i give the palm to whichever of the two first gets hold of the idea of justice my old schoolmates well always asking after matey weyburn he shall have my address in switzerland you and i will be corresponding now rose to view the visit to the lady who was lady ormont on the tongue aminta at heart never to be named aminta even to himself his heart broke loose at a thought of it he might say browny for that was not serious with the intense present signification the name aminta had browny was queen of the old school timeenclosed it in her name and that sphere enclosed her not excluding him and the dear name of browny played gently humorously fervently too with life not pathetically as that of aminta did when came a whisper of her situation her isolation her friendlessness hardly dissimilar to what could be imagined of a gazelle in the streets of london city the morsfields were not all slain the weyburns would be absent at the gate of his cottage garden weyburn beheld a short unfamiliar figure of a man with dimly remembered features little collett he still was in height the schoolmates had not met since the old days of cupers little collett delivered a message of invitation from selina begging mr weyburn to accompany her brother on the coach to harwich next day and spend two or three days by the sea but weyburns mind had been set in the opposite directionup thames instead of down he was about to refuse but he checked his voice and hummed words of selinas letter jumped in italics he perceived lady ormonts hand for one thing would she be at great marlow alone and he knew that hand how deftly it moved and moved others selina collett would not have invited him with underlinings merely to see a shoreside house and garden her silence regarding a particular name showed her to be under injunction one might guess at worst it would be the loss of a couple of days worth the venture they agreed to journey by coach next day facing eastward in the morning on a seat behind the coachman weyburn had a seafaring man beside him bound for the good port of harwich where his family lived and thence by his own boat to flushing weyburn set him talking of himself as the best way of making him happy for it is the theme which pricks to speech and so liberates an uncomfortably lockedup stranger who if sympathetic to human proximity is thankful they exchanged names delighted to find they were both matthews whereupon matthew of the sea demanded the paw of matthew of the land and there was a squeeze the same with little collett after hearing of him as the old schoolmate of the established new friend then there was talk little collett named felixstowe as the village of his mothers house and garden sloping to the sands that s ityou have it said the salted matthew peace is in that spot and there i ve sworn to pitch my tent when i m incapacitated for further exerciseprofitable so to speak my eldest girl has a bar of amber she picked up one wash of the tide at felixstowe and there it had been lying sparkling unseen hours the shore is that solitary what i likea quiet shore and a peopled sea ever been to brighton there it s t other way not long after he had mentioned the time of early evening for their entry into his port of harwich the coach turned quietly over on a bank of the roadside depositing outside passengers quite safely in so matterof course a way that only the screams of an uninjured lady inside repressed their roars of laughter one of the wheels had come loose half a mile off the nearest town their entry into harwich was thereby delayed until halfpast nine at night full of consideration for the new mates now fast wedded to his heart by an accident matthew shale proposed to matthew weyburn instead of the bother of crossing the ferry with a portmanteau and a bag at that late hour to sup at his house try the neighbouring inn for a short sleep and ship on board his yawl the honest susan to be rowed ashore off the swin to felixstowe sands no later than six oclock of a summers morning in time for a bath and a swim before breakfast it sounded wellit sounded sweetly weyburn suggested the counter proposal of supper for the three at the inn but the other matthew said i married a cook she expects a big appetite and she always keeps warm when i m held away no matter how late sure to be enough beds were secured at the inn after which came the introduction to mrs shale the exhibition of susan shales bar of amber the dish of fresh fried whiting the steak pudding a grog tobacco rest at the inn and a rousing bang at the sleepers doors when the unwonted supper in them withheld an answer to the intimating knock young matthew shale who had slept on board the susan conducted them to her boat his glance was much drawn to the very white duck trousers weyburn had put on for a souvenir of the approbation they had won at marlow they were on and so it was of no use for young matthew to say they were likely to bear away a token from the susan she was one among the damsels of colour and free of her tokens especially to the spotless how it occurred nobody saw though everybody saw how naturally it must occur for the white ducks to have it in the eye by the time they had been on board a quarter of an hour weyburn got some fun out of them for a counterbalance to a twitch of sentimental regret scarcely decipherable as that the last view of him should bear a likeness of brownys recollection of her first a glorious morning of flushed open sky and sun on sea chased all small thoughts out of it the breeze was from the west and the susan lightly laden took the heave of smooth rollers with a flowing currentcurtsey in the motion of her speed foresail and aft were at their gentle strain her shadow rippled fragmentarily along to the silver rivulet and boat of her wake straight she flew to the ball of fire now at spring above the waters and raining red gold on the line of her bows by comparison she was an ugly yawl and as the creature of wind and wave beautiful they passed an english defensive fort and spared its walls in obedience to matthew shales good counsel that they should forbear from sneezing little collett pointed to the roof of his mothers house twenty paces rearward of a belt of tamarisks green amid the hollowed yellows of shorebanks yet in shade crumbling to the sands weyburn was attracted by a diminutive white tent of sentrybox shape evidently a bathers quite as evidently a fair bathers he would have to walk on some way for his dip he remarked to little collett that ladies going into the water halfdressed never have more than half a bath his arms and legs flung out contempt of that style of bathing exactly in old mateys well remembered way half a mile off shore the susan was put about to flap her sails and her boat rocked with the passengers turning from a final cheer to friendly matthew weyburn at the rudder espied one of those unenfranchised ladies in marine uniform issuing through the tentslit she stepped firmly as into her element a plain look at her and a curious look and an intent look fixed her fast and ran the shock on his heart before he knew of a guess she waded she dipped a head across the breast of the waters was observed this one of them could swim she was making for sea a stones throw off the direction of the boat before his wits had grasped the certainty possessing them fiery envy and desire to be alongside her set his fingers fretting at buttons a grand smooth swell of the waters lifted her and her head rose to see her world she sank down the valley where another wave was mounding for its onward roll a gentle scene of weyburns favourite sophoclean chorus now she was given to himit was she how could it ever have been any other he handed his watch to little collett and gave him the ropes pitched coat and waistcoat on his knees stood free of boots and socks and singing out truly enough the words of a popular cry white ducks want washing went over and in chapter xxvii a marine duet she soon had to know she was chased she had seen the dive from the boat and received all illumination with a chuckle of delighted surprise like a blackbird startled she pushed seaward for joy of the effort thinking she could exult in imagination of an escape up to the moment of capture yielding then only to his greater will and she meant to try it the swim was a holiday all was newnothing came to her as the same old thing since she took her plunge she had a seamindhad left her earth mind ashore the swim and matey weyburn pursuing her passed up out of happiness through the spheres of delirium into the region where our life is as we would have it be a home holding the quiet of the heavens if but midway thither and a home of delicious animation of the whole frame equal to wings he drew on her but he was distant and she waved an arm the shout of her glee sprang from her matey he waved she heard his voice was it her name he was not so drunken of the sea as she he had not leapt out of bondage into buoyant waters into a youth without a blot without an aim satisfied in tasting the dream of the long felicity a thought brushed by her how if he were absent it relaxed her stroke of arms and legs he had doubled the salt seas rapture and he had shackled its gift of freedom she turned to float gathering her knees for the funny sullen kick until she heard him near at once her stroke was renewed vigorously she had the foot of her pursuer and she called adieu matey weyburn her bravado deserved a swifter humiliation than he was able to bring down on her she swam bravely and she was divine to see ahead as well as overtake darting to the close parallel he said what sea nymph sang me my name she smote a pang of her ecstasy into him ask mine browny they swam neither of them panted their heads were waterflowers that spoke at ease we ve run from school we wont go back we ve a kingdom heres a big wave going to be a wall off he rolls hes like the high brent broad meadow under elling wood dont let miss vincent hear you they re not waves they re sighs of the deep a poet i swim with he fell into the deep in his first of may morning ducks we used to expect him i never expected to owe them so much pride of the swimmer and the energy of her joy embraced aminta that she might nerve all her powers to gain the halfminute for speaking at her ease who d have thought of a morning like this you were looked for last night a lucky accident to our coach i made friends with the skipper of the yawl i saw the boat who could have dreamed anything may happen now for nothing further would astonish her as he rightly understood her but he said you re prepared for the rites old triton is ready float and tell me they spun about to lie on their backs her right hand at pianowork of the octaveshake was touched and taken and she did not pull it away her eyelids fell old triton waits why we re going to him yes customs of the sea tell me he joins hands we say brownymatey and it s done she splashed crying swim and after two strokes you want to beat me matey weyburn how not fair say what take my breath but yes well be happy in our own way we re sea birds we ve said adieu to land not to one another we shall be friends always this is going to last ever so long they had a spell of steady swimming companionship to inspirit it browny was allowed place a little foremost and she guessed not wherefore in her flattered emulation i m bound for france slew a point to the right southeast by south we shall hit dunkerque i dont mean to be picked up by boats well decline you see i can swim i was sure of it they stopped their talkfor the pleasure of the body to be savoured in the mind they thought and so took natures counsel to rest their voices awhile considering that she had not been used of late to long immersions and had not broken her fast and had talked much for a seanymph weyburn spied behind him on a shore seeming flat down far removed france next time he said well face to the rear now said she big with blissful conceit of her powers and incredulous of such a command from him you may be feeling tired presently the musical sincerity of her oh no not i sped through his limbs he had a willingness to go onward still some way but his words fastened the heavy land on her spirit knocked at the habit of obedience her stroke of the arms paused she inclined to his example and he set it shoreward they swam silently high low creatures of the smooth green roller he heard the watersong of her swimming she though breathing equably at the nostrils lay deep the water shocked at her chin and curled round the under lip he had a faint anxiety and not so sensible of a weight in the sight of land as she was he chattered by snatches rallied her encouraged her to continue sportive for this once letting her feel it was but a once and had its respected limit with him so it was not out of the world ah friend matey and that was right and good on land but rightness and goodness flung earths shadow across her brilliancy here and any stress on this once withdrew her liberty to revel in it putting an end to perfect holiday and silence too might hint at fatigue she began to think her muteness lost her the bloom of the enchantment robbing her of her heavenly frolic lead since friend matey resolved to be as eminently good in salt water as on land was he unaware that they were boy and girl againshe washed pure of the intervening years new born by blessing of the sea worthy of him herethat is a swimmer worthy of him his comrade in salt water youre satisfied i swim well she said it would go hard with me if we raced a long race i really was out for france i was ordered to keep you for england she gave him brownys eyes weve turned our backs on triton the ceremony was performed when the minute i spoke of it and you splashed matey matey weyburn browny farrell oh matey shes gone shes here try to beguile me then that our holidays not over you wont forget this hour no time of mine on earth will live so brightly for me i have never had one like it i could go under and be happy go to old triton and wait for you teach him to speak your proper christian name he hasnt heard it yetheard mateynever yet has been taught matthew aminta oh my friend my dear she cried in the voice of the wounded like a welling of her blood my strength will leave me i may playnot you you play with a weak vessel swim and be quiet how far do you count it under a quarter of a mile dont imagine me tired if you are hold on to me matey im for a dive he went after the ball of silver and bubbles and they came up together there is no history of events below the surface she shook off her briny blindness and settled to the full sweep of the arms quite silent now some emotion or exhaustion from the strain of the swimmers breath in speech stopped her playfulness the pleasure she still knew was a recollection of the outward swim when she had been privileged to cast away sex with the push from earth as few men will believe that women beautiful women ever wish to do and often and ardently during the run ahead they yearn for nature to grant them their one short holiday truce but aminta forgave him for bringing earth so close to her when there was yet a space of salt water between her and shore and she smiled at times that he might not think she was looking grave chapter xxviii the plighting they touched sand at the first draw of the ebb and this being earth matey addressed himself to the guardian and absolving genii of matterof fact by saying did you inquire about the tides her head shook stunned with what had passed she waded to shore after motioning for him to swim on men in comparison beside their fair fellows are so little sensationally complex that his one feeling now as to what had passed was relief at the idea of his presence having been a warrantable protectorship amintas return from the seanymph to the state of woman crossed annihiliation on the way back to sentience and picked up meaningless pebbles and shells of life between the seas verge and her tents shelter hardly her own life to her understanding yet except for the hammer memory became to strike her insensible at here and there a recollected word or nakedness of her soul he swam along by the shore to where the boat was paddled spying at her bare feet on the sand her womans form he waved and the figure in the striped tunic and trousers waved her response apparently the same person he had quitted dry and clad and decently formal under the transformation they met at mrs colletts breakfasttable and in each hung the doubt whether land was the dream or sea both owned to a swim both omitted mention of the tale of white ducks little collett had brought mateys and his portmanteau into the house by favour of the cook through the scullery he who could have been a pictorial and suggestive narrator carried a spinning head off his shoulders from this wonderful countess of ormont to matey weyburns darkeyed browny at high brent and the sunday walk in sir peter wensells park away and back his head went browny was not to be thought of as browny she was this grand countess of ormont she had married matey weyburns hero she would never admit she had been browny only she was handsome then and she is handsome now and she looks on matey weyburn now just as she did then how strange is the world or how if we are the particular person destined to encounter the strange things of the world and fancy j masner and pinnett major and young oakes liked nothing better than a pretty girl he strutted boasting at thirteen and the frenchy and the lot all popping down at the table and asked the name of the lady sitting like queen estherhow they would roar out boys of coursebut men toovery few men have a notion of the extraordinary complications and coincidences and cracker surprises life contains here s an instance matey weyburn positively will wear white ducks to play before aminta farrell on the first of may cricketingday he happens to have his white ducks on when he sees the countess of ormont swimming in the sea and so he can go in just as if they were allright bathingdrawers in he goes has a good long swim with her and when he comes out says of his dripping ducks tabula votiva avida vestimenta to remind an old schoolmate of his hopping to the booth at the end of a showery may day and dedicating them to the laundry in these words it seems marvellous it was a quaint revival an hour after breakfast for little collett to be acting as intermediary with selina to request lady ormonts grant of a five minutes interview before the churchbell summoned her she was writing letters and sent the message tell mr weyburn i obey selina delivered it uttering obey in a demurely comical way as a word of which the humour might be comprehensible to him aminta stood at the drawingroom window she was asking herself whether her recent conduct shrieked coquette to him or any of the abominable titles showered on the women who take free breath of air one day after long imprisonment she said does it mean you are leaving us the moment he was near not till evening or tomorrow as it may happen he answered i have one or two things to say if you will spare the time all my time said she smiling to make less of the hearts reply and he stepped into the room they had not long back been matey and browny and though that was in another element it would not sanction the lady ormont and mr weyburn now as little could it be aminta and matthew brother and sister they were in the spirits world but in this world the titles had a sound of imposture and with a great longing to call her by some allying name he rejected friend for its insufficiency and commonness notwithstanding the entirely friendly nature of the burden to be spoken friend was a title that ran on quicksands an excuse that tried for an excuse he distinguished in himself simultaneously that the hesitation and beating about for a name had its origin in an imperfect frankness when he sent his message the fretful desire to be with her close to her hearing her seeing her besides the true wish to serve her he sent it after swinging round abruptly from an outlook over the bordering garden tamarisks on a sea now featureless desolately empty however perceptibly silence was doing the work of a scourge and he said i have been thinking i may haveand i dont mind fighting hard to try it before i leave england on tuesday or wednesdaysome influence with lady charlotte eglett she is really one of the true women living and the heartiest of backers if she can be taught to see her course i fancy i can do that she s narrow but she is not one of the class who look on the working world below them as well say the scavenger dogs on the plains of ilium were seen by the achaeans and my failure would be no loss to you your name shall not be alluded to as empowering me to plead for her help but i want your consent or i may be haunted and weakened by the idea of playing the busybody one has to feel strong in a delicate position well you know what my position with her has beenone among the humble and she has taken contradictions accepted views from me shown me she has warmth of heart to an extreme degree aminta slightly raised her hand i will save you trouble i have written to lord ormont i have left him their eyes engaged on the thunder of this the letter has gone it was posted before my swim posted yesterday you have fully and clearly thought it out to a determination bit by biti might say blow by blow it is no small matter to break a marriagetie i have conversed with your mother yes she and the woman happiest in marriage i know it was hatred of injustice noble sympathy and she took me for one of the blest among wives she loved god she saw the difference between mens decrees for their convenience and gods laws she felt for women you have had a hard trial aminta oh my name you mean it you heard it from me this morning yes there i try to forget i lost my senses you may judge me harshly on reflection judge myself worse then you had a thousand excuses i had only my love of you theres no judgement against either of us for us to see if i read rightly we elect to be tried in the courts of the seagod now we ll sit and talk it over the next ten minutes will decide our destinies his eyes glittered otherwise he showed the coolness of the man discussing business and his blunt soberness refreshed and upheld her as a wild burst of passion would not have done side by side partly facing they began their interchange you have weighed what you abandon it weighs little that may be error you have to think into the future my sufferings and experiences are not bad guides they count how can you be sure you have all the estimates was i ever a wife you were and are the countess of ormont not to the world an unacknowledged wife is a slave surely you step down if you take the step from what once i did desire that stationhad an idea it was glorious i despise it or rather the woman who had the desire but the step down is into the working world i have means to live humbly i want no more except to be taught to work so says the minute years are before you you have weighed well that you attract she reddened and murmured how small her pout of spite at her attractions was little simulated beauty and charm are not small matters you have the gift called fatal thenlooking right forwardyou have faith in the power of resistance of the woman living alone he had struck at her breast from her breast she replied hear this of me i was persecuted with letters i read them and did not destroy them perhaps you saved me looking back i see weakness nothing worse but it is a confession yes you have courage and that comes of a great heart and therein lies the danger advise me of what is possible to a lonely woman you have resolved on the loneliness it means breathing to me you are able to see that lord ormont is a gentleman a chivalrous gentleman up to the bounds of his intelligence the bounds of his intelligence closed their four walls in a rapid narrowing slide on amintas mind and she exclaimed if only to pluck flowers in fields and know their names i must be free i say what one can laugh at and you are good and dont is the interrogatory exhausted aminta my beloved if you are free i claim you have you thought the sense of a dissolving to a fountain quivered through her veins turn the tables and examine me but have you thoughtoh i am not the girl you loved i would go through death to feel i was and give you one worthy of you that means what i wont ask you to speak at present but i must have proof he held out a hand and hers was laid in his there was more for her to say she knew it came and fled lightened and darkened she had yielded her hand to him here on land not with the licence and protection of the great holiday salt water and she was trembling from the run of his blood through hers at the pressure of hands when she said in undertones could wewe might be friends meet and part as friends you and i he replied his voice carried the answer for her his intimate look had in it the unfolding of the full flower of the woman to him as she could not conceal from such eyes and feeling that she was all avowal it is for life matthew my own words to myself when i first thought of the chance but the school i shall not consider that we are malefactors we have the world against us it will not keep us from trying to serve it and there are hints of humaner opinions its not all a huge rolling block of a juggernaut our case could be pleaded before it i dont think the just would condemn us heavily i shall have to ask you to strengthen me complete me if you love me it is your leap out of prison and without you i am from this time no better than onethird of a man i trust you to weigh the position you lose and the place we choose to take in the world it s thisi think this describes it you know the man who builds his house below the seas level has a sleepless enemy always threatening his house must be firm and he must look to the dykes we commit this indiscretion with a world against us our love and labour are constantly on trial we must have great hearts and if the world is hostile we are not to blame it in the nature of things it could not be otherwise my own soul we have to see that we dothough not publicly not insolently offend good citizenship but we believei with my whole faith and i may say it of youthat we are not offending divine law you are the woman i can help and join with think whether you can tell yourself that i am the man so then our union gives us powers to make amends to the world if the world should grant us a term of peace for the effort that is our risk consider it aminta between now and tomorrow deliberate we dont go together into a garden of roses i know i should feel shame i wish it to look dark said aminta her hand in his and yet with a fairsailing mind on the stream of the blood rationally and irrationally the mixed passion and reason in two clear heads and urgent hearts discussed the stand they made before a world defied neither of them quite perceiving what it was which coloured reason to beauty or what so convinced their intellects when passion spoke the louder i am to have a mate she will pray she may be one she is my first love amintas lips formed mine without utterance meanwhile his hand or a wizardry subdued her will allured her body she felt herself being drawn to the sign and seal of their plighting for life she said matthew softly in protest and he said never once yet she was owing to his tenderness her deepened voice murmured is this to deliberate colour flooded the beautiful dark face as of the funeral hues of a sun suffusing all the heavens firing earth chapter xxix aminta to her lord on friday on saturday on sunday lady charlotte waited for her brother rowsley until it was a diminished satisfaction that she had held her ground and baffled his mighty will to subdue her she did not sleep for thinking of him on the sunday night toward morning a fit of hazy horrors which others would have deemed imaginings drove her from her bed to sit and brood over rowsley in a chair what if it was a case of heart with him too heart disease had been in the family a man like rowsley still feeling the world before him as a man of his energies and aptitudes her humour added in the tide of his anxieties had a right to feel would not fall upon resignation like a woman she was at the physicians door at eight oclock dr rewkes reported reassuringly it was a simple disturbance in lord ormonts condition of health and he conveyed just enough of disturbance to send the impetuous lady knocking and ringing at her brothers door upon the hour of nine the announcement of lady charlottes early visit informed my lord that dr rewkes had done the spiriting required of him he descended to the library and passed under scrutiny you dont look ill rowsley she said reluctantly in the sound i am the better for seeing you here charlotte shall i order breakfast for you i am alone i know you are ive eaten rewkes tells me youve not lost appetite have i the appearance of a man who has lost anything prouder man and heartier and ruddier could not be seen she thought youre winning the country to right you that i know i dont ask it the country wants your services i have heard some talk of it that lout comes to a knowledge of his wants too late if they promoted and offered me the command in india to morrowmy lord struck the arm of his chair i live at steignton henceforth my wife is at a seaside place eastward she left the jewel case when on her journey through london for safety she is a particularly careful person forethoughtful i take her down to steignton two days after her return we entertain there in the autumn you come i dont i prefer decent society you are in her house now maam if i have to meet the person you mean i shall be civil the society youve given her i wont meet you will have to greet the countess of ormont if you care to meet your brother part then on the best terms we can i say this the woman who keeps you from serving your country she s your countrys enemy hear my answer the lady who is my wife has had to suffer for what you call my countrys treatment of me it s a choice between my country and her i give her the rest of my time thats dotage fire away your epithets sheer dotage i dont deny shes a handsome young woman youll have to admit that lady ormont takes her place in our family with the best we can name you insult my ears rowsley the world will say it when it has the honour of her acquaintance an honour suspiciously deferred thats between the world and me set your head to work youll screw the world to any pitch you like that i dont need telling lord ormonts head approved the remark now said lady charlotte you wont get the danmores the dukerlys the carminters the oxbridges any more than you get me you are wrong maam i had yesterday a reply from lady danmore to a communication of mine it s thickening but while i stand i stand for the family and i m not in it and while i stand out of it there s a doubt either of your honesty or your sanity theres a perfect comprehension of my sister i put my character in the scales against your conduct and your countess of ormonts reputation into the bargain you have called at her house it s a step you ll be running at her heels next she s not obdurate when you see me running at her heels itll be with my head off stir your hardest and let it thicken that man morsfields name mixed up with a sham countess of ormont in the stories flying abroad cant hurt anybody a true countess of ormontwe re cut to the quick we re cut your quick charlotte is known to court the knife letters of the mornings post were brought in the earl turned over a couple and took up a third saying i ll attend to you in two minutes and thinking once more queer world it is where when you sheath the sword you have to be at play with bodkins lady charlotte gazed on the carpet effervescent with retorts to his last observation rightly conjecturing that the letter he selected to read was from his aminta the letter apparently was interesting or it was of inordinate length he seemed still to be reading he reverted to the first page at the sound of the paper she discarded her cogitations and glanced up his countenance had become stony he read on some way with a sudden drop on the signature a recommencement a sound in the throat as when men grasp a comprehensible sentence of a muddled rigmarole and begin to have hopes of the remainder but the eye on the page is not the eye which reads no bad news rowsley the earls breath fell heavily lady charlotte left her chair and walked about the room rowsley i d like to hear if i can be of use maam he said and pondered on the word use staring at her i dont intend to pry i cant see my brother look like that and not ask the letter was tossed on the table to her she read these lines dated from felixstowe my dear lord the courage i have long been wanting in has come at last to break a tie that i have seen too clearly was a burden on you from the beginning i will believe that i am chiefly responsible for inducing you to contract it the alliance with an inexperienced girl of inferior birth and a perhaps immoderate ambition has taxed your generosity and though the store may be inexhaustible it is not truly the married state when a wife subjects the husband to such a trial the release is yours the sadness is for me i have latterly seen or suspected a design on your part to meet my former wishes for a public recognition of the wife of lord ormont let me now say that these foolish wishes no longer exist i rejoice to think that my staying or going will be alike unknown to the world i have the means of a livelihood in a modest way and shall trouble no one i have said the sadness is for me that is truth but i have to add that i too am sensible of the release my confession of a change of feeling to you as a wife writes the close of all relations between us i am among the dead for you and it is a relief to me to reflect on the little pain i give has she something on her conscience about that man morsfield lady charlotte cried lord ormonts prolonged ah of execration rolled her to a bundle nevertheless her human nature and her knowledge of womans would out with the words theres a man she allowed her brother to be correct in repudiating the name of the dead morsfieldchivalrous as he was on this amintas behalf to the lastand struck along several heads adderwoods weyburns randellers for the response to her suspicion a man there certainly was he would be probably a young man he would not necessarily be a handsome man or a titled or a wealthy man she might have set eyes on a gypsy somewhere round great marlowblood to blood such things have been imagining a wildish man for her rather than a handsome one and one devoted staidly to the founding of a school she overlooked weyburn or reserved him with others for subsequent speculation the remainder of amintas letter referred to her delivery of the ormont jewelcase at lord ormonts london house under charge of her maid carstairs the affairs of the household were stated very succinctly the drawer for labelled keys whatever pertained to her management in london or at great marlow she s cool lady charlotte said after reading out the orderly array of items in a tone of rasping irony to convince her brother he was well rid of a heartless wench amintas written statement of those items were stabs at the home she had given him a flashed picture of his loss nothing written by her touched him to pierce him so shrewdly nothing could have brought him so closely the breathing image in the flesh of the woman now a phantom for him will she be expecting you to answer rowsley will that forked tongue cease hissing he shouted in the agony of a strong man convulsed both to render and conceal the terrible shameful unexampled gush of tears lady charlotte beheld her bleeding giant she would rather have seen the brother of her love grimace in womans manner than let loose those rolling big drops down the face of a rock the big sob shook him and she was shaken to the dust by the sight now she was advised by her deep affection for her brother to sit patient and dumb behind shaded eyes praising in her heart the incomparable force of the mans love of the woman contrasted with the puling inclinations of the woman for the man neither opened mouth when they separated she pressed and kissed a large nerveless hand lord ormont stood up to bow her forth his ruddied skin had gone to pallor resembling the berg of ice on the edge of arctic seas when sunlight has fallen away from it chapter xxx conclusion the peaceful little home on the solitary sandy shore was assailed unwarned beneath a quiet sky some hours later by a whirlwind a dust storm and rattling volleys miss vincents discovery in the past schooldays of selina colletts wicked complicity in a clandestine correspondence had memorably chastened the girl who vowed at the time when her schoolmistress using the rod of johnsonian english for the purpose exposed the depravity of her sinfulness that she would never again be guilty of a like offence her dear and lovely countess of ormont for whom she then uncomplainingly suffered who deigned now to call her friend had spoken the kind goodbye and left the house after mr weyburns departure that same day she of course to post by harwich to london he to sail by packet from the port of harwich for flushing the card of an unknown lady a great lady the lady charlotte eglett was handed to her mother at eight oclock in the evening lady charlotte was introduced to the innocent country couple the mother knitting the daughter studying a book of the botany of the swiss alps dreaming a distant days journey over historic lands of various hues to the unimaginable spectacle of earths grandeur her visit lasted fifteen minutes from the moment of her entry the room was in such turmoil as may be seen where a watermill wheels paddles are suddenly set rounding to pour streams of foam on the smooth pool below a relentless catechism bewildered their hearing mrs collett attempted an opposition of dignity to those vehement attacks for answers it was flooded and rolled over she was put upon her honour to reply positively to positive questions whether the countess of ormont was in this house at present whether the countess of ormont left the house alone or in company whether a gentleman had come to the house during the stay of the countess of ormont whether lady ormont had left the neighbourhood the exact time of the day when she quitted the house and the stated point of her destination ultimately protesting that they were incapable of telling what they did not knowwhich lady charlotte heard with an incredulous shrugthey related piecemeal what they did know and weyburns name gave her scent she paid small heed to the tale of mr weyburns having come there in the character of young mr colletts old schoolmate mr weyburn had started for the port of harwich this day and not long subsequently lady ormont had started for the port of harwich on her way to london if we like to think it further corroboration was quite superfluous is there a night packetboat from this port of yours lady charlotte asked the household servants had to be consulted and she hurriedly craving the excuse of their tedious mistress elicited as far as she could understand them that there might be and very nearly was a night packet boat starting for flushing the cook a native of harwich sent up word of a night packetboat starting at about eleven oclock last year lady charlotte saw the chance as a windblown beaconfire under press of shades changeing her hawkish manner toward the simple pair she gave them view of a smile magical by contrast really beautifulthe smile she had in reserve for serviceable persons whom she trustedwhile thanking them and saying that her anxiety concerned lady ormonts welfare her brother had prophesied she would soon be running at his wifes heels and so she was but not with her head off as she had rejoined she might prove by intercepting his aminta that her head was on the windy beaconfire of a chance blazed at the rapid rolling of her carriagewheels and sank to stifling smoke at any petty obstruction let her but come to an interview with his aminta she would stop all that nonsense of the womans letter carry her offand her weyburn plucking at her other hand to keep her why naturally treated as she was by rowsley she dropped soft eyes on a goodlooking secretary any woman wouldconfound the young fellow but all s right yet if we get to harwich in time unless as a certain coldfish finale tone of the letter playing on the old string the irrevocable peculiar to women who are novices in situations of the kind appeared to indicate they see in their conscienceblasted minds a barrier to a return home high as the archangelical gate behind mother eve and they are down on their knees blubbering gratitude and repentance if the gate swings open to them it is just the instant granting the catastrophe to have a woman back to her duty she has only to learn she has a magnanimous husband if she learns into the bargain how he suffers how he loves herwell she despises a man like that lawrence finchley all the more for the magnanimity she has the profit of and perceives to be feebleness but there s woman in her good and her bad shell trick a man of age and if he forgives her owning his own faults in the case she wont scorn him for it the likelihood is she ll feel bound in honour to serve him faithfully for the rest of their wedded days a sketch to her of rowsleys deep love lady charlotte wandered into an amazement at it a sentence of her brothers recent speaking danced in her recollection he said of his country that lout comes to a knowledge of his wants too late true old england is always louting to the rear and has to be pricked in the rear and pulled by the neck before she s equal to the circumstances around her but what if his words were flung at him in turn short of lout it rang correctly too late we hope to clip from the end of the sentence likewise we have then if you stress itcomes to a knowledge of his wantsa fair example of the creatures men are the greatest of men who have to learn from the loss of the womanor a fear of the losshow much they really do love her well and she may learn the same or something sufficiently like it if she s caught in time called to her face countess of ormont sisterin law and smoothed petted made believe she s now understood and wont be questioned on a single particularin fact she marches back in a sort of triumph and all the past in a cupboard locked up without further inquiry her brother rowsleys revealed human appearance of the stricken man stricken right into his big heartprecipitated lady charlottes reflections and urged her to an unavailing fever of haste during the circuitous drive in moonlight to the port she alighted at the principal inn and was there informed that the packetboat with a favouring breeze and tide had started ten minutes earlier she summoned the landlord and described a lady as probably one of the passengers dark holds herself up high some such lady had dined at the inn on tea and gone aboard the boat soon after lady charlotte burned with the question alone she repressed her feminine hunger and asked to see the book of visitors but the lady had not slept at the inn so had not been requested to write her name the track of the vessel could be seen from the pier on the line of a bar of moonlight and thinking that the abominable woman if aboard she was had coolly provided herself with a continental passportor had it done for two by her accomplice that weyburn before she left londonlady charlotte sent a loathing gaze at the black figure of the boat on the water untroubled by any reminder of her share in the conspiracy of events which was to be her brothers chastisement to his end years are the teachers of the great rocky natures whom they round and sap and pierce in caverns having them on all sides and striking deep inward at moments there is no resisting the years if we have a heart and a common understanding they constitute in the sum of them the selfexamination whence issues acknowledged or not a belated self knowledge to direct our final actions she had the heart sight of the highminded proud speechless man suffering for the absence of a runaway woman not ceasing to suffer never blaming the woman and consequently it could be fancied blaming himself broke down lady charlottes defences and moved her to review her part in her brother rowsleys unhappiness for supposing him to blame himself her power to cast a shadow of blame on him went from her and therewith her vindication of her conduct he lived at olmer she read him by degrees as those who have become absolutely tongueless have to be read and so she gathered that this mortally or lastingly wounded brother of hers was pleased by an allusion to his aminta he ran his finger on the lines of a map of spain from barcelona over to granada and impressed his nail at a point appearing to be mountainous or woody lady charlotte suggested that he and his aminta had passed by there he told a story of a carriage accident added she was very brave one day when he had taken a keepsake book of englands beauties off the drawingroom table his eyes dwelt on a face awhile and he handed it with a nod followed by a slight depreciatory shrug like her not so handsome lady charlotte said he nodded again she came to a knowledge of amintas favourite colours through the dwelling of his look on orange and black deepest rose light yellow light blue her granddaughters won the satisfied look if they wore a combination touching his memory the rocky are not imaginative and have to be struck from without for a kindling of them submissive though she was to court and soothe her brother rowsley a spur of jealousy burned in the composition of her sentiments to set her going he liked visiting mrs lawrence finchley at her effaced good mans country seat brockholm in berkshire and would stay there a month at a time lady charlotte learnt why the enthusiast for aminta without upholding her to her late lord whom she liked well talked of her openly with him confessed to a fondness for her how much mrs lawrence ventured to say lady charlotte could not know but rivalry pushed her to the extreme of making aminta partially a topic and so ready was he to follow her lead in the veriest trifles recalling the handsome runaway that she had to excite his racy diatribes against the burgess english and the pulp they have made of a glorious nation in order not to think him inclining upon dotage philippas occasional scoff in fun concerning grandmamas tutor hurt lady charlotte for more reasons than one notwithstanding the justification of her forethoughtfulness the girl however was privileged she was bobby benlews dearest friend and my lord loved the boy with whom nothing could be done at school nor could a tutor at olmer control him in fine bobby saddened the family and gained the earls anxious affection by giving daily proofs of his being an ormont in a weak frame patently an ormont recurrently an invalid his moral qualities hurled him on his physical deficiencies the local doctor and dr rewkes banished him twice to the seashore where he began to bloom the first week and sickened the next for want of playfellows jolly fights and friendships ultimately they prescribed mountain air swiss air easy travelling to switzerland and several weeks of excursions at the foot of the alps bobby might possibly get an aged tutor or find an english clergyman taking pupils on the way thus it happened that seven years after his bereavement lord ormont and philippa and bobby were on the famous bernese terrace grandest of terrestrial theatres where soul of man has fronting him earths utmost majesty sublime but five minutes of it fetched sounds as of a plug in an empty phial from bobbys bosom and his heels became electrical he was observed at play with a gentleman of italian complexion past guessing how it had come about for the gentleman was an utter stranger he had at any rate the tongue of an englishman he had the style too the slang and cries and tricks of an english schoolboy though visibly a foreigner and he had the art of throwing his heart into that bit of improvised game or he would never have got hold of bobby shrewd to read a masker luggedup by the boy to my lord and the young lady he doffed and bowed forgive me pray he said i cant see an english boy without having a spin with him and i make so bold as to speak to english people

maggiore to my uncles house in milan for a halt i go to matthew before i see my own people he swept another bow of apology chiefly to philippa as representative of the sex claiming homage lord ormont had not greatly relished certain of the flowery phrases employed by this young foreigner truth his bride was damnable and if a story had to be told he liked it plain without jerks and evolutions many offences to our taste have to be overlooked in foreignersitalians considered before they were proved in fire a people classed by nature as operatic declaimers bobby had shown himself on the road out to bern a difficult boy and stupefyingly ignorant my lord had two or three ideas working to cloudy combination in his head when he put a question referring to the management of the dormitories at the school whereupon the young italian introduced himself as giulio calliani and proposed a drive to inspect the old school with its cricket and football fields lake for rowing and swimming gymnastic fixtures carpenters shed bowling alley and four european languages in the air by turns daily and the boys too all the boys rosy and jolly according to the last report received of them from his friend matthew enthusiasm struck and tightened the loose chord of scepticism in lord ormont somewhat as if a dancing beggar had entered a kenneldogs yard designing to fascinate the faithful beast it is a chord of one note that is tightened to sound by the violent summons to accept which is a provocation to deny at the same time the enthusiasts dance is rather funny he is not an ordinary beggar to see him trip himself in his dance would be rather funnier this is to say inspect the trumpeted school and retire politely my lord knew the bern of frequent visits the woman was needed beside him to inspire a feeling for scenic mountains philippas admiration of them was like a new pressed grapejuice after a draught of the ripe vintage moreover bobby was difficult the rejected of his english schools was a stiff ormont at lessons a wheezy benlew in the playground exactly the reverse of what should have been a school of four languages in bracing air if a school with healthy dormitories and a school of the trained instincts we call gentlemanly might suit master bobby for a trial an eye on the boys of the school would see in a minute what stuff they were made of supposing this young italianissimo with the english tongue to be tolerably near the mark with a deduction of twothirds of the enthusiasm bobby might stop at the school as long as his health held out or the master would keep him supposing half a dozen things and more the meeting with this mr calliand was a lucky accident but lucky accidents are anticipated only by fools lord ormont consented to visit the school he handed his card and invited his guest he had a carriage in waiting for the day he said and obedient to lady charlottes injunctions he withheld philippa from the party she and her maid were to pass the five hours of his absence in efforts to keep their monkey bobby out of the well of the solicitious bears my lord left his carriage at the inn of the village lying below the schoolhouse on a green height the young enthusiast was dancing him into the condition of livid taciturnity which could if it would flash out pungent epigrams of the actual world at operatic recitative theres the old schoolclock just in time for the halfhour before dinner said calliani chattering two hundred to the minute of the habits and usages of the school and how all had meals together the master his wife the teachers the boys and sheas for her calliani kissed finger up to the furthest skies into which a self respecting sober northener of the isles could imagine himself to kick enthusiastic gesticulators if it were polite to do so the schoolhouse faced the masters dwelling house and these with a block of building formed a threesided enclosure like barracks forth from the schoolhouse door burst a dozen shouting lads as wasps from the hole of their nest from a charge of powder out they poured whizzing and the frog he leaped and pussy ran and doubled before the hounds and hockeysticks waved and away went a ball cracks at the ball anyhow was the game for the twentyfive minutes breather before dinner french day said calliani hearing their cries then he bellowed matthewgiulio a lusty inversion of the order of the names and an oberland jodel returned his hail the school retreating caught up the alpine cry in the distance here were lungs here were sprites lord ormont bethought him of the name of the master mr matthew i think you said sir he was observing to calliani as the master came nearer and calliani replied his christian name but if the boys are naughty boys it is not the privilege mr weyburn there was not any necessity to pronounce that name calliani spoke it on the rush to his friend lord ormont and weyburn advanced the steps to the meeting neither of them flinched in eye or limb at a corridor window of the dwellinghouse a lady stood her colour was the last of a summer day over western seas her thought it has come her mind was in her sight her other powers were frozen the two men conversed there was no gesture this is one of the lightning moments of life for the woman at the meeting of the two men between whom her person has been in dispute may still be her soul being with one and that one dearer than the blood of her body imperilled by her she could ask why she exists if a question were in her grasp she would ask for the meaning of the gift of beauty to the woman making her desireable to those two men making her a cause of strife a thing of doom an incessant clamour dinned about her it has come the two men walked conversing into the schoolhouse she was unconscious of the seeing of a third though she saw and at the back of her mind believed she knew a friend in him the two disappeared she was insensible stone except for the bellclang it has come until they were in view again still conversing and the first of her thought to stir from petrifaction was life holds no secret she tried in shame of the inanimate creature she had become to force herself to think and had for a chastising result a series of geometrical figures shooting across her brain mystically expressive of the situation not communicably the most vivid and persistent was a triangle interpret who may the one beheld the two pass from view again still conversing they are on the gravel they bow they separate he of the grey head poised high has gone her arm was pressed by a hand weyburn longed to enfold her and she desired it and her soul praised him for refraining both had that delicacy you have seen my darling weyburn said it has come and we take our chance he spoke not one word beyond the affairs of the school he has a grandnephew in want of a school visited the dormitories refectory and sheds tasted the wellwater addressed me as mr matthew he had it from giulio came to look at the school of giulios friend matthew you hear him giulio little imagineswell dear love we stand with a squad in front and wait the word it maynt be spoken we have counted long before that something like it was bound to happen and you are brave ruins an empty word for us two yes dear it is we will pay what is asked of us aminta said it will be heavy if the school and i love our boys i am fit to be the schoolhousekeeper for nothing else i will go to the boys parents at the worst we can march into new territory emile will stick to us adolf too the fresh flock will come aminta cried in the voice of tears i love the old so the likelihood is we shall hear nothing further you had to bear the shock matthew whatever i bore and you saw you shared yes she said mais noublions pas que cest aujourdhui jour francais si madame vous avez assez dappetit pour diner avec nous je suis comme toujours aux ordres de monsieur she was among the bravest of women she had a full ounce of lead in her breast when she sat with the boys at their midday meal showing them her familiar pleasant face shortly after the hour of the evening meal a messenger from bern delivered a letter addressed to the headmaster weyburn and aminta were strolling to the playground thinking in common as they usually did they read the letter together these were the lines lord ormont desires to repeat his sense of obligation to mr matthew for the inspection of the school under his charge and will be thankful to mr calliani if that gentleman will do him the favour to call at his hotel at bern tomorrow at as early an hour as is convenient to him for the purpose of making arrangements agreeable to the headmasters rules for receiving his grandnephew robert benlew as a pupil at the school the two raised eyes on one another pained in their deep joy by the religion of the restraint upon their hearts to keep down the passion to embrace i thank heaven we know him to be one of the true noble men said aminta now breathing and thanking lord ormont for the free breath she drew weyburn spoke of an idea he had gathered from the earls manner but he had not imagined the proud lords greatheartedness would go so far as to trust him with the guardianship of the boy that moved and that humbled him though it was far from humiliating six months later the brief communication arrived from lady charlotte she is a widow unlikely you will hear from me again death is always next door you said once i look on the back of life tell bobby capital for him to write he has no longing for home holidays if any one can

enthusiasm struck and tightened the loose chord of scepticism exult in imagination of an escape up to the moment of capture greatest of men who have to learn from the loss of the woman he gave a
