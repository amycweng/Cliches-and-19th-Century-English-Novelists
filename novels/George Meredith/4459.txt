last of nevil beauchamp chapter l at the cottage on the common rain went with lord romfrey in a pursuing cloud all the way to bevisham and across the common to the long garden and plain little green shuttered neat white cottage of dr shrapnel carriages were driving from the door idle men with hands deep in their pockets hung near it some women pointing their shoulders under wet shawls and boys the earl was on foot with no sign of discomposure he stood at the halfopen door and sent in his card bearing the request for permission to visit his nephew the reply failing to come to him immediately he began striding to and fro that garden gate where he had flourished the righteous whip was wide footfarers over the sodden common were attracted to the gateway and lingered in it looking at the long greenextended windows apparently listening before they broke away to exchange undertone speech here and there boys had pushed up through the garden to the kitchen area from time to time a woman in a dripping bonnet whimpered aloud an air of a country churchyard on a sunday morning when the curate has commenced the service prevailed the boys were subdued by the moisture as they are when they sit in the church aisle or organloft before their members have been much cramped the whole scene and especially the behaviour of the boys betokened to lord romfrey that an event had come to pass in the chronicle of a sickness the event is death he bethought him of various means of stopping the telegraph and smothering the tale if matters should have touched the worst here he calculated abstrusely the practicable shortness of the two routes from bevisham to romfrey by posthorses on the straightest line of road or by express train on the triangle of railway in case of an extreme need requiring him to hasten back to his wife and renew his paternaldespotic system with her she had but persuaded him of the policy of a liberal openness and confidence for the moments occasion she could not turn his nature which ran to strokes of craft and blunt decision whenever the emergency smote him and he felt himself hailed to show generalship while thus occupied in thoughtfulness he became aware of the monotony of a tuneless chant as if it struck him an insane young chorister or canon were galloping straight on end hippomaniacally through the psalms there was a creak at intervals leading him to think it a machine that might have run away with the winders arm the earls humour proposed the notion to him that this perhaps was one of the forms of radical lamentation ululation possibly practised by a veteran impietist like dr shrapnel for the loss of his youngster his political cubpoor lad deriding any such paganry and aught that could be set howling lord romfrey was presently moved to ask of the small crowd at the gate what that sound was its the poor commander sir said a wetshawled woman shivering hes been at it twenty hours already sir said one of the boys twentyfoor hour he ve been at it said another a short dispute grew over the exact number of hours one boy declared that thirty hours had been reached father heerdn yesterday morning as he was aff to s work in the town afore six that brings t nigh thirty and he hant stopped yet the earl was invited to step inside the gate a little way up to the house and under the commanders window that he might obtain a better hearing he swung round walked away walked back and listened if it was indeed a voice the voice he would have said was travelling high in air along the sky yesterday he had described to his wife nevils chattering of hundreds to the minute he had not realized the description which had been only his manner of painting delirium there had been no warrant for it he heard the wild scudding voice imperfectly it reminded him of a string of winter geese changeing waters shower gusts and the wail and hiss of the rows of firtrees bordering the garden came between and allowed him a moments incredulity as to its being a human voice such a cry will often haunt the moors and wolds from above at nightfall the voice hied on sank seemed swallowed it rose as if above water in a hush of wind and trees the trees bowed their heads rageing the voice drowned once more to rise chattering thrice rapidly in a highpitched key thin shrill weird interminable like winds through a crazy chamberdoor at midnight the voice of a broomstickwitch in the clouds could not be thinner and stranger lord romfrey had some such thought dr gannet was the bearer of miss denhams excuses to lord romfrey for the delay in begging him to enter the house in the confusion of the household his lordships card had been laid on the table below and she was in the sickroom is my nephew a dead man said the earl the doctor weighed his reply he lives whether he will after the exhaustion of this prolonged fit of raving i dont dare to predict in the course of my experience i have never known anything like it he lives theres the miracle but he lives on brandy that would soon have sped him ha you have everything here that you want everything hes in your hands gannet the earl was conducted to a sittingroom where dr gannet left him for a while mindful that he was under the roof of his enemy he remained standing observing nothing the voice overheard was off at a prodigious rate like the far sound of a yell ringing on and on the earl unconsciously sought a refuge from it by turning the leaves of a book upon the table which was a complete edition of harry denhams poems with a preface by a man named lydiard and really to read the preface one would suppose that these poets were the princes of the earth lord romfrey closed the volume it was exquisitely bound and presented to miss denham by the mr lydiard the works of your illustrious father was written on the titlepage these writers deal queerly with their words of praise of one another there is no law to restrain them perhaps it is the consolation they take for the poor devils life they lead a lady addressing him familiarly invited him to go upstairs he thanked her at the foot of the stairs he turned he had recognized cecilia halkett seeing her there was more strange to him than being there himself but he bowed to facts what do you think he said she did not answer intelligibly he walked up the crazed gabbling tongue had entire possession of the house and rang through it at an amazing pitch to sustain for a single minute a reflection to the effect that dogs die more decently than we men saddened the earl but then it is true we shorten their pangs by shooting them a dismal figure loomed above him at the head of the stairs he distinguished it in the vast lean length he had once whipped and flung to earth dr shrapnel was planted against the wall outside that raving chamber at the salient angle of a common prop or buttress the edge of a shoulder and a heel were the supports to him sideways in his distorted attitude his wall arm hung dead beside his pendent frockcoat the hair of his head had gone to wildness like a field of barley whipped by tempest one hand pressed his eyeballs his unshaven jaw dropped lord romfrey passed him by the dumb consent of all present affirmed the creature lying on the bed to be nevil beauchamp face voice lank arms chicken neck what a sepulchral sketch of him it was the revelry of a corpse shudders of alarm for his wife seized lord romfrey at the sight he thought the poor thing on the bed must be going resolving to a cry unwinding itself violently in its hurricane of speech that was not speech nor exclamation rather the tongue let loose to run to the death it seemed to be out in midsea up wave and down wave a nurse was at the pillow smoothing it miss denham stood at the foot of the bed is that pain lord romfrey said low to dr gannet unconscious was the reply miss denham glided about the room and disappeared her business was to remove dr shrapnel that he might be out of the way when lord romfrey should pass him again but dr shrapnel heard one voice only and moaned my beauchamp she could not get him to stir miss denham saw him start slightly as the earl stepped forth and bowing to him said i thank you sir for permitting me to visit my nephew dr shrapnel made a motion of the hand to signify freedom of access to his house he would have spoken the effort fetched a burst of terrible chuckles he covered his face lord romfrey descended the silly old wretch had disturbed his equanimity as a composer of fiction for the comfort and sustainment of his wife and no sooner had he the front door in view than the calculation of the three strides requisite to carry him out of the house plucked at his legs much as young people are affected by a dancing measure for he had without deigning to think of matters disagreeable to him in doing so performed the duty imposed upon him by his wife and now it behoved him to ward off the coming blow from that double life at romfrey castle he was arrested in his hasty passage by cecilia halkett she handed him a telegraphic message rosamund requested him to stay two days in bevisham she said additionally perfectly well shall fear to see you returning yet have sent to tourdestelle all his friends ni espoir ni crainte mais point de deceptions lumiere ce sont les tenebres qui tuent her nimble wits had spied him on the road he was choosing and outrun him he resigned himself to wait a couple of days at bevisham cecilia begged him to accept a bed at mount laurels he declined and asked her how is it you are here i called here said she compressing her eyelids in anguish at a wilder cry of the voice overhead and forgetting to state why she had called at the house and what services she had undertaken a heap of letters in her handwriting explained the nature of her task lord romfrey asked her where the colonel was he drives me down in the morning and back at night but they will give me a bed or a sofa here tonighti cant cecilia stretched her hand out blinded to the earl he squeezed her hand these letters take away my strength crying is quite useless i know that said she glancing at a pile of letters that she had partly replied to some are from people who can hardly write there were people who distrusted him some are from people who abused him and maltreated him see those poor creatures out in the rain lord romfrey looked through the venetian blinds of the parlour window its as good as a play to them he remarked cecilia lit a candle and applied a stick of black wax to the flame saying envelopes have fallen short these letters will frighten the receivers i cannot help it i will bring letter paper and envelopes in the afternoon said lord romfrey dont use black wax my dear i can find no other i do not like to trouble miss denham letter paper has to be sealed these letters must go by the afternoon post i do not like to rob the poor anxious people of a little hope while he lives let me have note paper and envelopes quickly not blackedged plain thats right said lord romfrey black appeared to him like the torch of death flying over the country there may be hope he added she sighed oh yes gannet will do everything that man can do to save him he will i am sure you dont keep watch in the room my dear do you miss denham allows me an hour there in the day it is the only rest she takes she gives me her bedroom ha well women ejaculated the earl and paused that sounded like him at times murmured cecilia all yesterday all through the night and today hell be missed any sudden light of happier expectation that might have animated him was extinguished by the flight of chatter following the cry which had sounded like beauchamp he went out into the rain thinking that beauchamp would be missed the fellow had bothered the world but the world without him would be heavy matter the hour was midday workmens mealtime a congregation of shipyard workmen and a multitude of children crowded near the door in passing through them lord romfrey was besought for the doctors report of commander beauchamp variously named beesham bosham bitcham bewsham the earl heard his own name pronounced as he particularly disliked to hear itrumfree two or three men scowled at him it had not occurred to him ever before in his meditations to separate his blood and race from the common english and he was not of a character to dwell on fantastical and purposeless distinctions but the mispronunciation of his name and his nephews at an instant when he was thinking of nevils laying down his life for such men as these gross excessive breeders of ill shape and wooden countenance pushed him to reflections on the madness of nevil in endeavouring to lift them up and brush them up and a curious tenderness for nevils madness worked in his breast as he contrasted this muchabused nephew of his with our general englishthe socalled nobles who were sunk in the mud of the traders the traders who were sinking in the mud of the workmen the workmen who were like harbourflats at ebb tide round a stuckfast fleet of vessels big and little decidedly a fellow like nevil would be missed by him these english huddling more and more in flocks turning to lumps getting to be cut in a pattern and marked by a labelhow they bark and snap to rend an obnoxious original one may chafe at the botheration everlastingly raised by the fellow but if our england is to keep her place she must have him and many of him have him hes gone lord romfrey reasoned himself into pathetic sentiment by degrees he purchased the note paper and envelopes in the town for cecilia late in the afternoon he deposited them on the parlour table at dr shrapnels miss denham received him she was about to lie down for her hour of rest on the sofa cecilia was upstairs he inquired if there was any change in his nephews condition not any said miss denham the voice was abroad for proof of that he stood with a swelling heart jenny flung out a rug to its length beside the sofa and holding it by one end said i must have my rest to be of service my lord he bowed he was mute and surprised the young lady was like no person of her age and sex that he remembered ever to have met i will close the door he said retiring softly do not my lord the rug was over her up to her throat and her eyes were shut he looked back through the doorway in going out she was asleep some delirium gannet of good hope all in the usual course he transmitted intelligence to his wife a strong desire for wine at his dinnertable warned him of something wrong with his iron nerves chapter li in the night the delirious voice haunted him it came no longer accompanied by images and likenesses to this and that of animate nature which were relieving and distracting it came to him in its mortal nakednessan afflicting incessant ringing peal bare as deaths ribs in telling of death when would it stop and when it stopped what would succeed what ghastly silence he walked to within view of the lights of dr shrapnels at night then home to his hotel miss denhams power of commanding sleep as he could not though contrary to custom he tried it on the right side and the left set him thinking of her he owned she was pretty but that he contended was not the word and the word was undiscoverable not cecilia halkett herself had so highbred an air for cecilia had not her fineness of feature and full quick eyes of which the thin eyelids were part of the expression and cecilia sobbed snifed was patched about the face reddish bluish this girl was pliable only to service not to grief she did her work for threeandtwenty hours and fell to her sleep of one hour like a soldier lord romfrey could not recollect anything in a young woman that had taken him so much as the girls tossing out of the rug and covering herself lying down and going to sleep under his nose absolutely independent of his presence she had not betrayed any womans petulance with him for his conduct to her uncle or guardian nor had she hypocritically affected the reverse as ductile women do when they feel wanting in force to do the other she was not unlike nevils marquise in face he thought less foreign of course looking thrice as firm both were delicately featured he had a dream it was of an interminable procession of that odd lot called the people all of them were quarrelling under a deluge one party was for umbrellas one was against them and sounding the dispute with a question or two everard held it logical that there should be protection from the wet just as logical on the other hand that so frail a shelter should be discarded considering the tremendous downpour but as he himself was dry save for two or three drops he deemed them all lunatics he requested them to gag their empty chatterboxes and put the mother upon that childs cry he was now a simple unit of the procession asking naturally whither they were going he saw them point st pauls he heard in his own bosom it was and striking like the cathedral big bell several ladies addressed him sorrowfully he stood alone it had become notorious that he was to do battle and no one thought well of his chances devil an enemy to be seen he muttered yet they said the enemy was close upon him his right arm was paralyzed there was the enemy hard in front mailed vizored gauntleted he tried to lift his right hand and found it grasping an iron ring at the bottom of the deep steynham well sunk one hundred feet through the chalk but the unexampled cunning of his left arm was his little secret and acting upon this knowledge he telegraphed to his first wife at steynham that dr gannet was of good hope and thereupon he reentered the ranks of the voluminous procession already winding spirally round the dome of st pauls and there said he is the tomb of beauchamp everything occurred according to his predictions and he was entirely devoid of astonishment yet he would fain have known the titles of the slain admirals naval battles he protested he had a right to know for he was the heros uncle and loved him he assured the stupid scowling people that he loved nevil beauchamp always loved the boy and was the staunchest friend the fellow had and saying that he certainly felt himself leaning up against the cathedral rails in the attitude of dr shrapnel and crying beauchamp beauchamp and then he walked firmly out of romfrey oakwoods and at a miles distance from her related to his countess rosamund that the burial was over without much silly ceremony and that she needed to know nothing of it whatever rosamunds face awoke him it was the face of a chalkquarry featureless hollowed appalling the hour was no later than three in the morning he quitted the detestable bed where a dreamone of some halfdozen in the course of his lifehad befallen him for the maxim of the healthy man is up and have it out in exercise when sleep is for foisting base coin of dreams upon you and as the healthy only are fit to live their maxims should be law he dressed and directed his leisurely steps to the common under a black sky and stars of lively brilliancy the lights of a carriage gleamed on dr shrapnels door a footman informed lord romfrey that colonel halkett was in the house and soon afterward the colonel appeared is it over i dont hear him said lord romfrey colonel halkett grasped his hand not yet he said cissy cant be got away its killing her no hes alive you may hear him now lord romfrey bent his ear its weaker the colonel resumed by the way romfrey step out with me my dear friend the circumstances will excuse me you know im not a man to take liberties im bound to tell you what your wife writes to me she says she has it on her conscience and cant rest for it you know women she wants you to speak to the man hereshrapnel she wants nevil to hear that you and he were friendly before he dies thinks it would console the poor dear fellow thats only an idea but it concerns her you see im shocked to have to talk to you about it my dear colonel i have no feeling against the man lord romfrey replied i spoke to him when i saw him yesterday i bear no grudges where is he you can send to her to say i have spoken to him twice yes yes the colonel assented he could not imagine that lady romfrey required more of her husband well i must be off i leave blackburn tuckham here with a friend of his a man who seems to be very sweet with mrs wardourdevereux ha fetch him to me colonel i beg you to do that said lord romfrey the colonel brought out lydiard to the earl you have been at my nephews bedside mr lydiard within ten minutes my lord what is your opinion of the case my opinion is the chances are in his favour lay me under obligation by communicating that to romfrey castle at the first opening of the telegraph office tomorrow morning lydiard promised the raving has ended hardly sir but the exhaustion is less than we feared it would be gannet is there he is in an armchair in the room and dr shrapnel he does not bear speaking to he is quiet he is attached to my nephew as much as to life itself lord romfrey thanked lydiard courteously let us hope sir that some day i shall have the pleasure of entertaining you as well as another friend of yours you are very kind my lord the earl stood at the door to see colonel halkett drive off he declined to accompany him to mount laurels in the place of the carriage stood a man who growled wheres your horsewhip butcher he dogged the earl some steps across the common everard returned to his hotel and slept soundly during the remainder of the dark hours chapter lii question of a pilgrimage and an act of penance then came a glorious morning for sportsmen one sniffed the dews and could fancy fresh smells of stubble earth and dank woodland grass in the very streets of dirty bevisham sound sleep like hearty dining endows men with a sense of rectitude and sunlight following the former as a pleasant spell of conversational ease or sweet music the latter smiles a celestial approval of the performance lord romfrey dismissed his anxieties his lady slightly ruffled him at breakfast in a letter saying that she wished to join him he was annoyed at noon by a message wherein the wish was put as a request and later arrived another message bearing the character of an urgent petition true it might be laid to the account of telegraphic brevity he saw dr shrapnel and spoke to him as before to thank him for the permission to visit his nephew nevil he contemplated for the space of five minutes he cordially saluted miss denham he kissed cecilias hand all here is going on so well that i am with you for a day or two to morrow he despatched the message to his wife her case was now the gravest he could not understand why she desired to be in bevisham she must have had execrable dreamsrank poison to mothers however her constitutional strength was great and his pride in the restoration of his house by her agency flourished anew what with fair weather and a favourable report from dr gannet the weather was most propitious to the hopes of any soul bent on dispersing the shadows of death and to sportsmen from the windows of his railway carriage he beheld the happy sportsmen stalking afield the birds whirred and dropped just where he counted on their dropping the smoke of the guns threaded to dazzling silver in the sunshine say what poor old nevil will or did say previous to the sobering of his blood where is there a land like england everard rejoiced in his country temperately having nevil as wellof which fact the report he was framing in his mind to deliver to his wife assured himhe was rich and you that put yourselves forward for republicans and democrats do you deny the aristocracy of an oaklike man who is young upon the verge of eighty these were poetic flights but he knew them not by name and had not to be ashamed of them rosamund met him in the hall of the castle you have not deceived me my dear lord she said embracing him you have done what you could for me the rest is for me to do he reciprocated her embrace warmly in commendation of her fresher good looks she asked him you have spoken to dr shrapnel he answered her twice the word seemed quaint she recollected that he was quaint he repeated i spoke to him the first day i saw him and the second we are so much indebted to him said rosamund his love of nevil surpasses ours poor man poor man at least we may now hope the blow will be spared him which would have carried off his life with nevils i have later news of nevil than you good of course ah me the pleasure of the absence of pain he is not gone lord romfrey liked her calm resignation theres a mr lydiard he said a friend of nevils and a friend of louise devereuxs yes we hear from him every four hours rosamund rejoined mention him to her before me thats exactly what i was going to tell you to do before me said her husband smiling because everard is it not sowidows and she loves this gentleman certainly my dear i think with you about widows the world asks them to practise its own hypocrisy louise devereux was married to a pipe shes the widow of tobacco ash well make daylight round her how good how kind you are my lord i did not think so shrewd but benevolence is almost allseeing you said you spoke to dr shrapnel twice was he polite thoroughly upset you know what did he say what was it beauchamp beauchamp the first time and the second time he said he thought it had left off raining ah rosamund drooped her head she looked up here is louise my lord has had a long conversation with mr lydiard i trust he will come here before you leave us added the earl rosamund took her hand my lord has been more acute than i or else your friend is less guarded than you what have you seen said the blushing lady stay i have an idea you are one of the women i promised to cecil baskelett said the earl now may i tell him theres no chance oh do they spent so very pleasant an evening that the earl settled down into a comfortable expectation of the renewal of his old habits in the september and october season nevils frightful cry played on his eardrum at whiles but not too affectingly he conducted rosamund to her room kissed her hoped she would sleep well and retired to his good hard bachelors bed where he confidently supposed he would sleep the sleep of a dyspeptic with a wilder than the monstrous bevisham dream befell him causing him to rise at three in the morning and proceed to his ladys chamber to assure himself that at least she slept well she was awake i thought you might come she said he reproached her gently for indulging foolish nervous fears she replied no i do not i am easier about nevil i begin to think he will live i have something at my heart that prevents me from sleeping it concerns me whether he is to live or die i should like him to know he has not striven in vainnot in everything not where my conscience tells me he was right and we i wrongutterly wrong wickedly wrong my dear girl you are exciting yourself no feel my pulse the dead of night brings out nevil to me like the writing on the wall it shall not be said he failed in everything shame to us if it could be said he tried to make me see what my duty was and my honour he was at every man jack of us i speak of one thing i thought i might not have to go now i feel i must i remember him at steynham when colonel halkett and cecilia were there but for me cecilia would now be his wife of that there is no doubt that is not the point regrets are fruitless i see how the struggle it cost him to break with his old lovethat endearing madame de rouaillout his reneebroke his heart and then his loss of cecilia halkett but i do believe true as that i am lying here and you hold my hand my dear husband those losses were not so fatal to him as his sufferings he went through on account of his friend dr shrapnel i will not keep you here go and have some rest what i shall beg of you tomorrow will not injure my health in the slightest the reverse it will raise me from a bitter depression it shall not be said that those who loved him were unmoved by him before he comes back to life or is carried to his grave he shall know that i was not false to my love of him my dear your pulse is at ninety said the earl look lenient be kind be just my husband oh let us cleanse our hearts this great wrong was my doing i am not only quite strong enough to travel to bevisham i shall be happy in going and when i have done itsaid the wrong was all mine i shall rejoice like the pure in spirit forgiveness does not matter though i now believe that poor loving old man who waits outside his door weeping is wrongheaded only in his political views we women can read men by their power to love where love exists there is goodness but it is not for the sake of the poor old man himself that i would go it is for nevils it is for ours chiefly for me for my childs if ever rosamund turned her head on her pillow the earl patted her cheek we ll talk it over in the morning he said now go to sleep he could not say more for he did not dare to attempt cajolery with her shading his lamp he stepped softly away to wrestle with a worse nightmare than sleeps her meaning was clear and she was a woman to insist on doing it she was nevertheless a woman not impervious to reason if only he could shape her understanding to perceive that the state of her nerves incident to her delicate situation and the shock of that fellow nevils illnesspoor ladwas acting on her mind rendering her a victim of exaggerated ideas of duty and so forth naturally apart from allowing her to undertake the journey by rail he could not sanction his ladys humbling of herself so egregiously and unnecessarily shrapnel had behaved unbecomingly and had been punished for it he had spoken to shrapnel and the affair was virtually at an end with his assistance she would see that when less excited her eternal brooding over nevil was the cause of these mental vagaries lord romfrey was for postponing the appointed discussion in the morning after breakfast he pleaded business engagements none so urgent as this of mine said rosamund but we have excellent news of nevil you have gannets word for it he argued theres really nothing to distress you my heart i must be worthy of good news to know happiness she answered i will say let me go to bevisham two three four days hence if you like but there is peace for me and nowhere else my precious rosamund have you set your two eyes on it what you are asking is for permission to make an apology to shrapnel that is the word thats nevils word it is a prescription to me an apology the earls gorge rose why such an act was comparable to the circular mission of the dog if i do not make the apology the mother of your child is a coward said rosamund shes not i trust not you are a reasonable woman my dear now listen the man insulted you its past done with he insulted you he did not what he was courteous to me hospitable to me kind to me he did not insult me i belied him my dear saint youre dreaming he spoke insultingly of you to cecil is my lord that mans dupe i would stand against him before the throne of god with what little i know of his interview with dr shrapnel to confront him and expose his lie do not speak of him he stirs my evil passions and makes me feel myself the creature i was when i returned to steynham from my first visit to bevisham enraged with jealousy of dr shrapnels influence over nevil spiteful malicious oh such a nest of vileness as i pray to heaven i am not now if it is granted me to give life to another nevils misfortunes date from that she continued in reply to the earls efforts to soothe her not the loss of the election that was no misfortune but a lesson he would not have shone in parliament he runs too much from first principles to extremes you see i am perfectly reasonable everard i can form an exact estimate of character and things she smiled in his face and i know my husband too what he will grant what he would not and justly would not i know to a certainty that vexatious as i must be to you now you are conscious of my having reason for being so you carry it so farfifty miles beyond the mark said he the man roughed you and i taught him manners no she half screamed her interposition i repeat he was in no way discourteous or disobliging to me he offered me a seat at his table and heaven forgive me i believe a bed in his house that i might wait and be sure of seeing nevil because i was very anxious to see him all the same you cant go to the man i should have said so too before my destiny touched me a certain dignity of position my dear demands a corresponding dignity of conduct you cant go if i am walking in the very eye of heaven and feeling it shining on me where i go there is no question for me of human dignity such flighty talk offended lord romfrey it comes to this youre in want of a parson rosamund was too careful to hint that she would have expected succour and seconding from one or other of the better order of clergymen she shook her head to this my dear lord i have a troubled mind and it is not to listen nor to talk that i am in need of but to act yes my dear girl but not to act insanely i do love soundness of head you have it only just now youre a little astray well leave this matter for another time rosamund held him by the arm not too long both of them applied privately to mrs wardourdevereux for her opinion and counsel on the subject of the proposal to apologize to dr shrapnel she was against it with the earl and became rosamunds echo when with her when alone she was divided into two almost equal halves deeming that the countess should not insist and the earl should not refuse him she condemned for lack of sufficient spiritual insight to perceive the merits of his wifes request her she accused of some vestige of something underbred in her nature for putting such fervid stress upon the supplication ie making too much of ita trick of the vulgar and not known to the languid she wrote to lydiard for advice he condensed a paragraph into a line it should be the earl she is driving him to it intentionally or not mrs devereux doubted that the countess could have so false an idea of her husbands character as to think it possible he would ever be bent to humble himself to the man he had castigated she was right it was by honestly presenting to his mind something more loathsome still the humbling of herself that rosamund succeeded in awakening some remote thoughts of a compromise in case of necessity better i than she but the necessity was inconceivable he had really done everything required of him if anything was really required by speaking to shrapnel civilly he had spoken to shrapnel twice besides the castle was being gladdened by happier tidings of beauchamp gannet now pledged his word to the poor fellows recovery and the earls particular friends arrived and the countess entertained them october passed smoothly she said once ancestresses of yours my lord have undertaken pilgrimages as acts of penance for sin to obtain heavens intercession in their extremity i dare say they did he replied the monks got round them it is not to be laughed at if it eased their hearts timidly she renewed her request for permission to perform the pilgrimage to bevisham wait said he till nevil is on his legs have you considered where i may then be everard my love you sleep well dont you you see me every night i see you sound asleep i see you watching me lets reason said the earl and again they went through the argument upon the apology to dr shrapnel he was willing to indulge her in any amount of it and she perceived why fox she thought grand fox but fox downright for her time was shortening to days that would leave her no freewill on the other hand the exercise of her freewill in a fast resolve was growing all the more a privilege that he was bound to respect as she became sacreder and doubly precious to him the less would he venture to thwart her though he should think her mad there would be an analogy between his manner of regarding her and the way that superstitious villagers look on their crazy innocents she thought sadly and she bled for him too she grieved to hurt his pride but she had come to imagine that there was no avoidance of this deed of personal humiliation nevil had scrawled a note to her she had it in her hand one forenoon in mid november when she said to her husband i have ordered the carriage for two oclock to meet the quarter to three train to london and i have sent stanton on to get the house ready for us tonight lord romfrey levelled a marksmans eye at her why london you know my wish that it should be here at the castle i have decided to go to bevisham i have little time left none to my thinking oh i yes my heart will be light i shall gain you come with me to london you cant go dont attempt to reason with me please please i command madam my lord it is past the hour of commanding he nodded his head with the eyes up amid the puckered brows and blowing one of his long nasal expirations cried here we are in for another bout of argument no i can bear the journey rejoice in confessing my fault but more argument i cannot bear i will reason with you when i can submit to me in this feminine reasoning he interjected i have nothing better to offer it will be prudent to attend to me take my conduct for the portion i bring you before i put myself in gods care i must be clean i am unclean language like that offends you i have no better my reasoning has not touched you i am helpless except in this determination that my contrition shall be expressed to dr shrapnel if i am to have life to be worthy of living and being a mother it must be done now my dear lord see that and submit youre but one voice i am two he jumped off his chair frowning up his forehead and staring awfully at the insulting prospect an apology to the man by you away with it make allowances for me if you can my dear lord that is what i am going to do my wife going there he strode along furiously no you will not stop her theres a palsy in my arm if i dont she plucked at her watch why maam i dont know you he said coming close to her let s reason perhaps you overshot it you were disgusted with shrapnel perhaps i was hasty i get fired by an insult to a woman there was a rascal kissed a girl once against her will and i heard her cry out i laid him on his back for six months just to tell you id do the same to lord or beggar very well my dear heart well own i might have looked into the case when that dog cecil whats the matter speak on my dear husband said rosamund panting but your making the journey to bevisham is a foolish notion yes well well well wait oh have we to travel over it all again she exclaimed in despair at the dashing out of a light she had fancied you see the wrong you know the fever it is in my blood and you bid me wait drop a line to nevil to trick my conscience i might have done that and done well once do you think i dislike the task i propose to myself it is for your sake that i would shun it as for me the thought of going there is an ecstasy i shall be with nevil and be able to look in his face and how can i be actually abasing you when i am so certain that i am worthier of you in what i do her exaltation swept her on hurry there my lord if you will if you think it prudent that you should go in my place go you deprive me of a great joy but i will not put myself in your way and i consent the chief sin was mine remember that i rank it viler than cecil baskeletts and listen whencan you reckonwhen will he confess his wickedness we separate ourselves from a wretch like that pooh quoth the earl but you will go she fastened her arms round the arm nearest you or i does it matter which we are one you speak for me i should have been forced to speak for you you spare me the journey i do not in truth suppose it would have injured me but i would not run one unnecessary risk lord romfrey sighed profoundly he could not shake her off how could he refuse her how on earth had it come about that suddenly he was expected to be the person to go she would not let him elude her and her stained cheeks and her trembling on his arm pleaded most pressingly and masteringly it might be that she spoke with a knowledge of her case positive it undoubtedly was that she meant to go if he did not perhaps the hopes of his house hung on it having admitted that a wrong had been done he was not the man to leave it unamended only he would have chosen his time and the manner since nevils illness too he had once or twice been clouded with a little bit of regret at the recollection of poor innocent old shrapnel posted like a figure of total inebriation beside the doorway of the dreadful sickroom there had been women of the earls illustrious house who would have given their hands to the axe rather than conceal a stain and have to dread a scandal his rosamund after all was of their pattern even though she blew that conscience she prattled of into trifles and swelled them as women of high birth in this country out of the clutches of the priests do not do she clung to him for his promise to go he said well well that means you will said she his not denying it passed for the affirmative then indeed she bloomed with love of him yet do say yes she begged ill go maam shouted the earl ill go my love he said softly chapter liii the apology to dr shrapnel you and nevil are so alike lady romfrey said to her lord at some secret resemblance she detected and dwelt on fondly when the earl was on the point of starting a second time for bevisham to perform what she had prompted him to conceive his honourable duty without a single intimation that he loathed the task neither shrug nor grimace two ends of a stick are pretty much alike theyre all that length apart said he very little in the humour for compliments however well braced for his work his wifes admiring love was pleasant enough he preferred to have it unspoken few of us care to be eulogized in the act of taking a nauseous medical mixture for him the thing was as good as done on his deciding to think it both adviseable and right so he shouldered his load and marched off with it he could have postponed the right proceeding even after the partial recognition of his errorone drops a word or two by hazard one expresses an anxiety to afford reparation one sends a message and so forth for the satisfaction of ones conventionally gentlemanly feeling but the adviseable proceeding under stress of peculiar circumstances his clearlyawakened recognition of that impelled him unhesitatingly his wife had said it was the portion she brought him tears would not have persuaded him so powerfully that he might prove to her he was glad of her whatever the portion she brought she was a good wife a brave woman likely to be an incomparable mother at present her very virtues excited her to fancifulness nevertheless she was in his charge and he was bound to break the neck of his will to give her perfect peace of wind the child suffers from the mothers mental agitation it might be a question of a nervous or an idiot future earl of romfrey better death to the house than such a mockery of his line these reflections reminded him of the heartiness of his whipping of that poor old tumbled signpost shrapnel in the name of outraged womankind if there was no outrage assuredly if there was no outrage consideration for the state of his wife would urge him to speak the apology in the most natural manner possible she vowed there was none he never thought of blaming her for formerly deceiving him nor of blaming her for now expediting him in the presence of colonel halkett mr tuckham and mr lydiard on a fine november afternoon standing bareheaded in the firbordered garden of the cottage on the common lord romfrey delivered his apology to dr shrapnel and he said i call you to witness gentlemen i offer dr shrapnel the fullest reparation he may think fit to demand of me for an unprovoked assault on him that i find was quite unjustified and for which i am here to ask his forgiveness speech of man could not have been more nobly uttered dr shrapnel replied to the half of that sirtis over what remains is done with the hand he stretched his hand out lord romfrey closed his own on it the antagonists between whom was no pretence of their being other after the performance of a creditable ceremony bowed and exchanged civil remarks and then lord romfrey was invited to go into the house and see beauchamp who happened to be sitting with cecilia halkett and jenny denham beauchamp was thin pale and quiet but the sight of him standing and conversing after that scene of the skinny creature struggling with bareribbed obstruction on the bed was an example of constitutional vigour and a compliment to the family very gratifying to lord romfrey excepting by cecilia the earl was coldly received he had to leave early by special express for london to catch the last train to romfrey beauchamp declined to fix a day for his visit to the castle with lydiard but proposed that lydiard should accompany the earl on his return lydiard was called in and at once accepted the earls invitation and quitted the room to pack his portmanteau a faint sign of firmshutting shadowed the corners of jennys lips you have brought my nephew to life lord romfrey said to her my share in it was very small my lord gannet says that your share in it was very great and i say so with the authority of a witness added cecilia and i from my experience came from beauchamp his voice had a hollow sound unlike his natural voice the earl looked at him remembering the bright laughing lad he had once been and said why not try a month of madeira you have only to step on board the boat i dont want to lose a month of my friend said beauchamp take your friend with you after these fevers our winters are bad ive been idle too long but captain beauchamp said jenny you proposed to do nothing but read for a couple of years ay theres the voyage sighed he with a sailorinvalids vision of sunny seas dancing in the far sky you must persuade dr shrapnel to come and he will not come unless you come too and you wont go anywhere but to the alps she bent her eyes on the floor beauchamp remembered what had brought her home from the alps he cast a cold look on his uncle talking with cecilia granite as he thought and the reflux of that slight feeling of despair seemed to tear down with it in wreckage every effort he had made in life and cry failure on him yet he was hoping that he had not been created for failure he touched his uncles hand indifferently my love to the countess let me hear of her sir if you please you shall said the earl but off to madeira and up teneriffe sail the azores ill hire you a goodsized schooner there is the esperanza said cecilia and the vessel is lying idle nevil can you allow it he consented to laugh at himself and fell to coughing jenny denham saw a real human expression of anxiety cross the features of the earl at the sound of the cough lord romfrey said adieu to her he offered her his hand which she contrived to avoid taking by dropping a formal halfreverence think of the esperanza she will be coasting her nominal native land and adieu for today cecilia said to beauchamp jenny denham and he stood at the window to watch the leavetaking in the garden for a distraction they interchanged no remark of surprise at seeing the earl and dr shrapnel handlocked but jennys heart reproached her uncle for being actually servile and beauchamp accused the earl of aristocratic impudence both were overcome with remorse when colonel halkett putting his head into the room to say goodbye to beauchamp and place the esperanza at his disposal for a winter cruise chanced to mention in two or three half words the purpose of the earls visit and what had occurred he took it for known already to miss denham he remarked lord romfrey is very much concerned about your health he fears you have overdone it in nursing captain beauchamp i must be off after him said beauchamp and began trembling so that he could not stir the colonel knew the pain and shame of that condition of weakness to a man who has been strong and swift and said sevenleague boots are not to be caught youll see him soon why i thought some letter of yours had fetched him here i gave you all the credit of it no he deserves it all himselfall said beauchamp and with a dubious eye on jenny denham you see we were unfair the we meant you to her sensitiveness and probably he did mean it for you for as he would have felt so he supposed that his uncle must have felt jennys coldness was much the crueller her features which in animation were summer light playing upon smooth water could be exceedingly cold in repose the icier to those who knew her because they never expressed disdain no expression of the baser sort belonged to them beauchamp was intimate with these delicatelycut features he would have shuddered had they chilled on him he had fallen in love with his uncle he fancied she ought to have done so too and from his excess of sympathy he found her deficient in it he sat himself down to write a hearty letter to his dear old uncle everard jenny left him to go to her chamber and cry chapter liv the fruits of the apology this clear heart had cause for tears her just indignation with lord romfrey had sustained her artificially hitherto now that it was erased she sank down to weep her sentiments toward lydiard had been very like cecilia halketts in favour of mr austin with something more to warm them on the part of the gentleman he first had led her mind in the direction of balanced thought when despite her affection for dr shrapnel her timorous maiden wits unable to contend with the copious exclamatory old politician opposed him silently lydiard had helped her tongue to speak as well as her mind to rational views and there had been a bond of union in common for them in his admiration of her fathers writings she had known that he was miserably yoked and had respected him when he seemed inclined for compassion without wooing her for tenderness he had not trifled with her hardly flattered he had done no more than kindle a young girls imaginative liking the pale flower of imagination fed by dews not by sunshine was born drooping and hung secret in her bosom shy as a bell of the frail woodsorrel yet there was pain for her in the perishing of a thing so poor and lowly she had not observed the change in lydiard after beauchamp came on the scene and that may tell us how passionlessly pure the little maidenly sentiment was for do but look on the dewy woodsorrel flower it is not violet or rose inviting hands to pluck it still it is there happy in the woods and jennys feeling was that a foot had crushed it she wept thinking confusedly of lord romfrey trying to think he had made his amends tardily and that beauchamp prized him too highly for the act she had no longer anything to resent she was obliged to weep in truth as the earl had noticed she was physically depressed by the strain of her protracted watch over beauchamp as well as rather heartsick but she had been of aid and use in saving him she was not quite a valueless person sweet too was the thought that he consulted her listened to her weighed her ideas he had evidently taken to study her as if dispersing some wonderment that one of her sex should have ideas he had repeated certain of her own which had been forgotten by her his eyes were often on her with this that she thought humorous intentness she smiled she had assisted in raising him from his bed of sickness whereof the memory affrighted her and melted her the difficulty now was to keep him indoors and why he would not go even temporarily to a large house like mount laurels whither colonel halkett was daily requesting him to go she was unable to comprehend his love of dr shrapnel might account for it own jenny said beauchamp springing up to meet her as she entered the room where he and dr shrapnel sat discussing lord romfreys bearing at his visit own that my uncle everard is a true nobleman he has to make the round to the right mark but he comes to it i could not move him and i like him the better for that he worked round to it himself i ought to have been sure he would youre right i break my head with impatience no you sowed seed said dr shrapnel heed not that girl my beauchamp the old womans in the tory and the tory leads the young maid heres a fable i draw from a naturalists book and well set it against the dicta of jenny donothing jenny discretion jenny waitfor thegods once upon a time in a tropical island a man lay sick so ill that he could not rise to trouble his neighbours for help so weak that it was lifting a mountain to get up from his bed so hopeless of succour that the last spark of distraught wisdom perching on his brains advised him to lie where he was and trouble not himself since peace at least he could command before he passed upon the black highroad men call our kingdom of peace ay he lay there now it chanced that this man had a mess to cook for his nourishment and life said do it and death said to what end he wrestled with the stark limbs of death and cooked the mess and that done he had no strength remaining to him to consume it but crept to his bed like the toad into winter now meanwhile a steam arose from the mess and he lay stretched so it befel that the birds of prey of the region scented the mess and they descended and thronged at that mans windows and the mans neighbours looked up at them for it was the sign of one who is fit for the beaks of birds lying unburied fail to spread the pall one hour where suns are decisive and the pall comes down out of heaven they said the man is dead within and they went to his room and saw him and succoured him they lifted him out of death by the last uncut thread now my jenny weighwords jenny haltthere was it they who saved the man or he that saved himself the man taxed his expiring breath to sow seed of life lydiard shall put it into verse for a fable in song for our people i say it is a good fable and sung spiritedly may serve for nourishment and faith in work to many of our poor fainting fellows now you jenny said i think it is a good fable of selfhelp does it quite illustrate the case i mean the virtue of impatience but i like the fable and the moral and i think it would do good if it were made popular though it would be hard to condense it to a song it would be hard ay then we do it forthwith and you shall compose the music as for the case of impatience my dear you tether the soaring universal to your petlambs post the special i spoke of seed sown i spoke of the fruits of energy and resolution cared i for an apology i took the blows as i take hail from the cloudswhich apologize to you the moment you are in shelter if you laugh at them so good night to that matter are we to have rain this evening i must away into bevisham to the workmens hall and pay the men there will not be rain there will be frost and you must be well wrapped if you must go said jenny and tell them not to think of deputations to captain beauchamp yet no no deputations let them send killick if they want to say anything said beauchamp wrong the doctor cried wrong wrong six men wont hurt you more than one and why check them when their feelings are up they burn to be speaking some words to you trust me beauchamp if we shun to encounter the good warm soul of numbers our hearts are narrowed to them the business of our modern world is to open heart and stretch out arms to numbers in numbers we have our sinews they are our iron and gold scatter them not teach them the secret of cohesion practically since they gave you not their entire confidence once you should not rebuff them to suspicions of you as aristocrat when they rise on the effort to believe a man of as tis called birth their undivided friend meet them send them said beauchamp jenny denham fastened a vast cloak and a comforter on the doctors heedless shoulders and throat enjoining on him to return in good time for dinner he put his finger to her cheek in reproof of such supererogatory counsel to a man famous for his punctuality the day had darkened beauchamp begged jenny to play to him on the piano do you indeed care to have music said she i did not wish you to meet a deputation because your strength is not yet equal to it dr shrapnel dwells on principles forgetful of minor considerations i wish thousands did cried beauchamp when you play i seem to hear ideas your music makes me think jenny lit a pair of candles and set them on the piano waltzes she asked call in a puppetshow at once she smiled turned over some leaves and struck the opening notes of the ninth symphony of beethoven and made her selections at the finish he said now read me your fathers poem the hunt of the fates she read it to him now read the ascent from the inferno that she read and also soul and brute another of his favourites he wanted more and told her to read first lovelast love i fear i have not the tone of voice for lovepoems jenny said returning the book to him ill read it said he he read with more impressiveness than effect lydiards reading thrilled her beauchamps insisted too much on particular lines but it was worth while observing him she saw him always as in a picture remote from herself his loftier social station and strange character precluded any of those keen suspicions by which women learn that a fire is beginning to glow near them how i should like to have known your father he said i dont wonder at dr shrapnels love of him yes he was one of the great men of his day and its a higher honour to be of his blood than any that rank can give you were ten years old when you lost him describe him to me he used to play with me like a boy said jenny she described her father from a childs recollection of him dr shrapnel declares he would have been one of the first surgeons in europe and he was one of the first of poets beauchamp pursued with enthusiasm so he was doubly great i hold a good surgeon to be in the front rank of public benefactorswhere they put rich brewers bankers and speculative manufacturers now well the world is young we shall alter that in time whom did your father marry jenny answered my mother was the daughter of a london lawyer she married without her fathers approval of the match and he left her nothing beauchamp interjected lawyers money it would have been useful to my mothers household when i was an infant said jenny poor soul i suppose so yes well beauchamp sighed money never mind how it comes were in such a primitive condition that we catch at anything to keep us out of the cold dogs with a boneinstead of living as dr shrapnel prophecies for and with one another its war now and moneys the weapon of war and were the worst nation in europe for that but if we fairly recognize it we shall be the first to alter our ways theres the point well jenny i can look you in the face tonight thanks to my uncle everard at last captain beauchamp you have never been blamed i am captain beauchamp by courtesy in public my friends call me nevil i think i have heard the name on your lips when you were very ill he stood closer to her very close which was the arm that bled for me may i look at it there was a bruise have you not forgotten that trifle there is the faintest possible mark of it left i wish to see she gently defended the arm but he made it so much a matter of earnest to see the bruise of the old election missile on her fair arm that with a pardonable soft blush to avoid making much of it herself she turned her sleeve a little above the wrist he took her hand it was for me it was quite an accident no harm was intended but it was in my causefor me indeed captain beauchamp nevil we say indoors nevilbut is it not wiser to say what comes naturally to us who told you today that you had brought me to life i am here to prove it true if i had paid attention to your advice i should not have gone into the cottage of those poor creatures and taken away the fever i did no good there but the mans wife said her husband had been ruined by voting for me and it was a point of honour to go in and sit with him you are not to have your hand back it is mine dont you remember jenny how you gave me your arm on the road when i staggered two days before the fever knocked me over shall i tell you what i thought then i thought that he who could have you for a mate would have the bravest and helpfullest wife in all england and not a mere beauty for you have good looks but you have the qualities i have been in search of why do your eyes look so mournfully at me i am full of hope well sail the esperanza for the winter you and i and our best friend with us and you shall have a voice in the council be sure if you are two to one jenny said quickly to keep from faltering beauchamp pressed his mouth to the mark of the bruise on her arm he held her fast i mean it if you will join me that you and i should rejoice the heart of the dear old manwill you he has been brooding over your loneliness here if you are unmarried ever since his recovery i owe my life to you and every debt of gratitude to him now jenny oh captain beauchampnevil if you will if i may have my hand you exaggerate common kindness he loves you we both esteem you but you dont love me indeed i have no fear that i shall be unable to support myself if i am left alone but i want your help i wake from illness with my eyes open i must have your arm to lean on now and then jenny dropped a shivering sigh uncle is long absent she said her hand was released beauchamp inspected his watch he may have fallen he may be lying on the common oh cried jenny why did i let him go out without me let me have his lantern ill go and search over the common you must not go out said she i must the old man may be perishing it will be death to you nevil that s foolish i can stand the air for a few minutes i ll go said jenny unprotected no cook shall come with me two women nevil if you care a little for me be good be kind submit he is half an hour behind dinnertime and hes never late something must have happened to him way for me my dear girl she stood firm between him and the door it came to pass that she stretched her hands to arrest him and he seized the hands rather than you should go out in this cold weather anything she said in the desperation of physical inability to hold him back ah beauchamp crossed his arms round her ill wait for five minutes one went by with jenny folded broken and sobbing senseless against his breast they had not heard dr shrapnel quietly opening the hall door and hanging up his hat he looked in beauchamp he exclaimed come doctor said beauchamp and loosened his clasp of jenny considerately she disengaged herself beauchamp now i die a glad man witness doctor she s mine by her own confession uncle jenny gasped oh captain beauchamp what an error what delusion forget it i will here are more misunderstandings you shall be excused but be be you the blessedest woman alive on this earth my jenny shouted dr shrapnel you have the choice man on all the earth for husband sweetheart ay of all the earth i go with a message for my old friend harry denham to quicken him in the grave for the husband of his girl is nevil beauchamp the one thing i dared not dream of thousands is established sunlight my jenny beauchamp kissed her hand she slipped away to her chamber grovelling to find her diminished self somewhere in the midthunder of her amazement as though it were to discover a pin on the floor by the flash of lightning where was she this ensued from the apology of lord romfrey to dr shrapnel chapter lv without love at the end of november jenny denham wrote these lines to mr lydiard in reply to his request that she should furnish the latest particulars of nevil beauchamp for the satisfaction of the countess of romfrey there is everything to reassure lady romfrey in the state of captain beauchamps health and i have never seen him so placidly happy as he has been since the arrival yesterday morning of a lady from france madame la marquise de rouaillout with her brother m le comte de croisnel her husband i hear from m de croisnel dreads our climate and coffee too much to attempt the voyage i understand that she writes to lady romfrey today lady romfreys letter to her informing her of captain beauchamps alarming illness went the round from normandy to touraine and dauphiny otherwise she would have come over earlier her first inquiry of me was il est mort you would have supposed her disappointed by my answer a light went out in her eyes like that of a veilleuse in the dawn she looked at me without speaking while her beautiful eyes regained their natural expression she shut them and sighed tell him that m de croisnel and his sister are here this morning her wish to see miss halkett was gratified you know my taste was formed in france i agree with captain beauchamp in his more than admiration of frenchwomen ours though more accomplished are colder and less plastic but miss halkett is surpassingly beautiful very amiable very generous a perfect friend she is our country at its best probably she is shy of speaking french she frequently puts the italian accent madame de rouaillout begged to speak with her alone i do not know what passed miss halkett did not return to us dr shrapnel and captain beauchamp have recently been speculating on our becoming a nation of artists and authorities in science and philosophy by the time our coalfields and material wealth are exhausted that and the cataclysm are their themes they say will things end utterlyall our gains be lost the question seems to me to come of that love of earth which is recognition of god for if they cannot reconcile themselves to believe in extinction to what must they be looking it is a confirmation of your saying that love leads to god through art or in acts you will regret to hear that the project of captain beauchamps voyage is in danger of being abandoned a committee of a vacant radical borough has offered to nominate him my influence is weak madame would have him go back with her and her brother to normandy my influence is weak i suppose because he finds me constantly leaning to expediencyi am your pupil it may be quite correct that powder is intended for explosion we do not therefore apply a spark to the barrel i ventured on that he pitied me in the snares of simile and metaphor he is the same you perceive how often have we not discussed what would have become of him with that rocket brain of his in less quiet times yet when he was addressing a deputation of workmen the other day he recommended patience to them as one of the virtues that count under wisdom he is curiously impatient for knowledge one of his reasons for not accepting colonel halketts offer of his yacht is that he will not be able to have books enough on board definite instead of vast and hazy duties are to be desired for him i think most fervently i pray that he will obtain a ship and serve some years at the risk of your accusing me of sententious posing i would say that men who do not live in the present chiefly but hamper themselves with giant tasks in excess of alarm for the future however devoted and noble they may beand he is an example of one that isreduce themselves to the dimensions of pigmies they have the cry of infants you reply foresight is an element of love of country and mankind but how often is not the foresight guesswork he has not spoken of the dawn project today he is repeating one of uncles noveltiessultry tories the sultry tory sits in the sun and prophecies woefully of storm it appears your accusation that i am one at heart amuses me i am not quite able to deny it sultriness i am not conscious of but it would appear to be an epithet for the conservatives of wealth so that england being very wealthy we are to call it a sultry country you are much wanted for where there is no middleman liberal to hold the scales for them these two have it all their own way which is not good for them captain beauchamp quotes you too it seems that you once talked to him of a machine for measuring the force of blows delivered with the fist and compared his efforts to those of one perpetually practising at it and this you are said to have called the case of the constitutional realm and the extreme radical elsewhere the radical smites at iron or rotten wood in england it is a cushion on springs did you say it he quotes it as yours half acquiescingly and ruefully for visitors we have had captain baskelett for two minutes and lord palmet who stayed longer and seems to intend to come daily he attempts french with madame de r and amuses her a little a silver foot and a ball of worsted mr and mrs grancey lespel have called and lord and lady croyston colonel halkett miss halkett and mr tuckham come frequently captain beauchamp spoke to her yesterday of her marriage madame de r leaves us tomorrow her brother is a delightful gay tempered very handsome boyish frenchmannot her equal to my mind for i do not think frenchmen comparable to the women of france but she is exceedingly grave with hardly a smile and his high spirits excite nevils so it is pleasant to see them together the letter was handed to lady romfrey she read through it thoughtfully till she came to the name of nevil when she frowned on the morrow she pronounced it a disingenuous letter renee had sent her these lines i should come to you if my time were not restricted my brothers leave of absence is short i have done here what lay in my power to show you i have learnt something in the school of selfimmolation i have seen mlle halkett she is a beautiful young woman deficient only in words doubtless my labour except that it may satisfy you was the vainest of tasks she marries a ruddy monsieur of a name that i forget and of the bearing of a member of the gardes du corps without the stature enfin madame i have done my duty and do not regret it since i may hope that it will win for me some approbation and a portion of the esteem of a lady to whom i am indebted for that which is now the best of life to me and i do not undervalue it in saying i would gladly have it stamped on brass and deposited beside my fathers i have my faith i would it were nevils tooand yours should you be in need of it he will marry mlle denham if i may foretell events she will steady him she is a young person who will not feel astray in society of his rank she possesses the natural grace we do not expect to see out of our countryfrom sheer ignorance of what is beyond it for the moment she affects to consider herself unworthy and it is excuseable that she should be slightly alarmed at her prospect but nevil must have a wife i presume to think that he could not have chosen better above all make him leave england for the winter adieu dear countess nevil promises me a visit after his marriage i shall not set foot on england again but you should you ever come to our land of france will find my heart open to you at the gates of undying grateful recollection i am not skilled in writing you have looked into me once look now i am the same only i have succeeded in bringing myself to a greater likeness to the dead as it becomes a creature to be who is coupled with one of their body meanwhile i shall have news of you i trust that soon i may be warranted in forwarding congratulations to lord romfrey rosamund handed the letters to her husband not only did she think miss denham disingenuous she saw that the girl was not in love with beauchamp and the idea of a loveless marriage for him threw the mournfullest of hecates beams along the course of a career that the passionate love of a bride though she were not wellborn and not wealthy would have rosily coloured without love she exclaimed to herself she asked the earls opinion of the startling intelligence and of the character of that miss denham who could pen such a letter after engaging to give her hand to nevil lord romfrey laughed in his dumb way if nevil must have a wifeand the marquise tells you so and she ought to knowhe may as well marry a girl who wont go all the way down hill with him at his pace hell be cogged you do not object to such an alliance i m past objection theres no law against a mans marrying his nurse but she is not even in love with him i dare say not he wants a wife she accepts a husband the two women who were in love with him he wouldnt have lady romfrey sighed deeply he has lost cecilia she might still have been his but he has taken to that girl and madame de rouaillout praises the girl becauseoh i see itshe has less to be jealous of in miss denham of whose birth and blood we know nothing let that pass if only she loved him i cannot endure the thought of his marrying a girl who is not in love with him just as you like my dear i used to suspect mr lydiard perhaps hes the man oh what an end of so brilliant a beginning it strikes me my dear said the earl its the proper common sense beginning that may have a fairish end no but what i feel is that heour nevilhas accomplished hardly anything if anything he hasnt marched on london with a couple of hundred thousand men no he hasnt done that the earl said glancing back in his mind through beauchamps career and he escapes what stukely calls his nations scourge in the shape of a statue turned out by an english chisel no we havent had much public excitement out of him but one thing he did do he got me down on my knees lord romfrey pronounced these words with a sober emphasis that struck the humour of it sharply into rosamunds heart through some contrast it presented between nevils aim at the world and hit of a man the immense deal thought of it by the earl and the very little that nevil would think of itthe great domestic achievement to be boasted of by an enthusiastic devotee of politics she embraced her husband with peals of loving laughter the last laughter heard in romfrey castle for many a day chapter lvi the last of nevil beauchamp not before beauchamp was flying with the winter gales to warmer climes could rosamund reflect on his career unshadowed by her feminine mortification at the thought that he was unloved by the girl he had decided to marry but when he was away and winds blew the clouds which obscured an embracing imagination of himsuch as to be true and full and sufficient should stretch like the dome of heaven over the humblest of lives under contemplationbroke and revealed him to her as one who had other than failed rather as one in mid career in mid forest who by force of character advancing in selfconquest strikes his impress right and left around him because of his aim at stars he had faults and she gloried to think he had for the womans heart rejoiced in his portion of our common humanity while she named their prince to men but where was he to be matched in devotedness and in gallantry and what man of blood fiery as nevils ever fought so to subject it rosamund followed him like a migratory bird hovered over his vessel perched on deck beside the helm where her sailor was sure to be stationed entered his breast communed with him and wound him round and round with her love he has mine she cried her craving that he should be blest in the reward or flowercrown of his wifes love of him lessened in proportion as her brooding spirit vividly realized his deeds in fact it had been but an example of our very general craving for a climax palpable and scenic she was completely satisfied by her conviction that his wife would respect and must be subordinate to him so it had been with her as for love let him come to his rosamund for love and appreciation adoration rosamund drew nigh to her hour of peril with this torch of her love of beauchamp to illuminate her there had been a difficulty in getting him to go one day cecilia walked down to dr shrapnels with mr tuckham to communicate that the esperanza awaited captain beauchamp manned and provisioned off the pier now he would not go without dr shrapnel nor the doctor without jenny and jenny could not hold back seeing that the wish of her heart was for nevil to be at sea untroubled by political questions and prowling radical deputies so her consent was the seal of the voyage what she would not consent to was the proposal to have her finger ringed previous to the voyage altogether in the manner of a sailors bride she seemed to stipulate for a term of courtship nevil frankly told the doctor that he was not equal to it anything that was kind he was quite ready to say and anything that was pretty but nothing particularly kind and pretty occurred to him he was exactly like a juvenile correspondent facing a blank sheet of letter paperhe really did not know what to say further than the uncomplicated exposition of his case that he wanted a wife and had found the very woman how then fathom jennys mood for delaying dr shrapnels exhortations were so worded as to induce her to comport herself like a scriptural woman humbly wakeful to the surpassing splendour of the high fortune which had befallen her in being so selected and obedient at a sign but she was it appeared that she was a maid of scaly vision not perceptive of the blessedness of her lot she could have been very little perceptive for she did not understand his casual allusion to beauchamps readiness to overcome a natural repugnance for the purpose of making her his wife up to the last moment before cecilia halkett left the deck of the esperanza to step on the pier jenny remained in vague but excited expectation of something intervening to bring cecilia and beauchamp together it was not a hope it was with pure suspense that she awaited the issue cecilia was pale beauchamp shook mr tuckham by the hand and said i shall not hear the bells but send me word of it will you and he wished them both all happiness the sails of the schooner filled on a fair frosty day with a light wind ruffling from the northwest she swept away out of sight of bevisham and the island into the channel to within view of the coast of france england once below the waterline alone with beauchamp and dr shrapnel jenny denham knew her fate as soon as that grew distinctly visible in shape and colour she ceased to be reluctant all about her in air and sea and unknown coast was fresh and prompting and if she looked on beauchamp the thoughtmy husband palpitated and destroyed and remade her rapidly she underwent her transformation from doubtfullyminded woman to woman awakening cleareyed and with new sweet shivers in her temperate blood like the tremulous light seen running to the morn upon a quiet sea she fell under the charm of beauchamp at sea in view of the island of madeira jenny noticed that some trouble had come upon dr shrapnel and beauchamp both of whom had been hilarious during the gales but sailing into summer they began to wear that look which indicated one of their serious deliberations she was not taken into their confidence and after awhile they recovered partially the truth was they had been forced back upon old english ground by a recognition of the absolute necessity for her sake of handing themselves over to a parson in england possibly a civil marriage might have been proposed to the poor girl in a foreign island they would be driven not simply to accept the services of a parson but to seek him and solicit him otherwise the knot faster than any sailors in binding could not be tied decidedly it could not and how submit neither dr shrapnel nor beauchamp were of a temper to deceive the clerical gentleman only they had to think of jennys feelings alas for usthis our awful baggage in the rear of humanity these women who have not moved on their own feet one step since the primal mother taught them to suckle are perpetually pulling us backward on the march slaves of custom forms shows and superstitions they are slaves of the priests they are so in gratitude perchance as the matter works dr shrapnel admitted for at one period the priests did cherish and protect the weak from animal man but we have entered a broader daylight now when the sun of high heaven has crowned our structure with the flower of brain like him to scatter mists and penetrate darkness and shoot from end to end of earth and must we still be grinning subserviently to ancient usages and stale forms because of a baggage that it is woe to us too true we cannot cut ourselves loose from lydiard might say we are compelling the priests to fight and that they are compact foemen not always passive battle thenthe cry was valiant nevertheless jenny would certainly insist upon the presence of a parson in spite of her bridegrooms natural repugnance dr shrapnel offered to argue it with her being of opinion that a british consul could satisfactorily perform the ceremony beauchamp knew her too well moreover though tonguetied as to lovemaking he was in a hurry to be married jennys eyes were lovely her smiles were soft the fair promise of her was in bloom on her face and figure he could not wait he must off to the parson then came the question as to whether honesty and honour did not impose it on them to deal openly with that gentle and on such occasions unobtrusive official by means of a candid statement to him overnight to the effect that they were the avowed antagonists of his church which would put him on his defence and lead to an argument that would accomplish his overthrow you parsons whose cause is good marshal out the poor of the land that we may see the sort of army your stewardship has gained for you what no army only women and hoary men and in the rear rank to support you as an institution none but fanatics cowards whiteeyeballed dogmatists timeservers moneychangers mockers in their sleeves what is this but the prospect of so completely confounding the unfortunate parson warned beauchamp that he might have a shot in his locker the parson heavily trodden on will turn i suppose we must be hypocrites he said in dejection dr shrapnel was even more melancholy he again offered to try his persuasiveness upon jenny beauchamp declined to let her be disturbed she did not yield so very lightly to the invitation to go before a parson she had to be wooed after all a harry hotspurs wooing three clergymen of the established church were on the island and where wont they be where theres fine scenery and comforts abound beauchamp said to the doctor ungratefully whether a celibate clergy ruins the faith faster than a noncelibate i wont dispute replied the doctor but a noncelibate interwinds with us and is likely to keep up a onestoried edifice longer jenny hesitated she was a faltering unit against an ardent and imperative two in the council and beauchamp had shown her a letter of lady romfreys very clearly signifying that she and her lord anticipated tidings of the union marrying beauchamp was no simple adventure she feared in her bosom and resigned herself she had a taste of what it was to be at the conclusion of the service beauchamp thanked the goodnatured clergyman and spoke approvingly of him to his bride as an agreeable wellbred gentlemanly person then fronting her and taking both her hands now my darling he said you must pledge me your word to this i have stooped my head to the parson and i am content to have done that to win you though i dont think much of myself for doing it i cant look so happy as i am and this idle ceremonyhowever i thank god i have you and i thank you for taking me but you wont expect me to give in to the parson again but nevil she said fearing what was to come they are gentlemen good men yes yes they are educated men nevil jenny jenny beauchamp theyre not men theyre churchmen my experience of the priest in our country is that he has abandoned he s dead against the only cause that can justify and keep up a church the cause of the poorthe people he is a creature of the moneyed class i look on him as a pretender i go through his forms to save my wife from annoyance but there s the end of it and if ever im helpless unable to resist him i rely on your word not to let him intrude hes to have nothing to do with the burial of me hes against the cause of the people very well i make my protest to the death against him when hes a christian instead of a churchman then may my example not be followed it s little use looking for that jenny dropped some tears on her bridal day she sighed her submission so long as you do not change said she change cried nevil thats for the parson now its over we start fair my darling i have you i dont mean to bother you im sure youll see that the enemies of reason are the enemies of the human race you will see that i can wait if we can be sure that we ourselves are using reason rightly nevil not prejudice of course but dont you see my jenny we have no interest in opposing reason but have we not all grown up together and is it just or wise to direct our efforts to overthrow a solid structure that is a part he put his legal right in force to shut her mouth telling her presently she might lydiardize as much as she liked while practising this mastery he assured her he would always listen to her yes whether she lydiardized or what dr shrapnel called jennyprated that is to say dear nevil that you have quite made up your mind to a toddling chattering little nursery wife very much the contrary to anything of the sort he declared and he proved his honesty by announcing an immediate reflection that had come to him how oddly things are settled cecilia halkett and tuckham you and i now i know for certain that i have brought cecilia halkett out of her womans toryism and given her at least liberal views and she goes and marries an arrant tory while you a bit of a tory at heart more than anything else have married an ultra perhaps we may hope that the conflict will be seasonable on both sides if you give me fair play nevil as fair play as a womans lord could give her she was to have with which adieu to argumentation and controversy and all the thanks in life to the parson on a lovely island free from the seductions of care possessing a wife who instead of starting out of romance and poetry with him to the supreme honeymoon led him back to those forsaken valleys of his youth and taught him the joys of colour and sweet companionship simple delights a sister mind with a loveliness of person and nature unimagined by him beauchamp drank of a happiness that neither renee nor cecilia had promised his wooing of jenny beauchamp was a flattery richer than any the maiden jenny denham could have deemed her due and if his wonder in experiencing such strange gladness was quaintly ingenuous it was delicious to her to see and know full surely that he who was at little pains to court or please independently of the agency of the truth in him had come to be her lover through being her husband here i would stop it is beauchamps career that carries me on to its close where the lanterns throw their beams off the mudbanks by the black riverside when some few english men and women differed from the world in thinking that it had suffered a loss they sorrowed for the earl when tidings came to them of the loss of his child alive one hour in his arms rosamund caused them to be deceived as to her condition she survived she wrote to jenny bidding her keep her husband cruising lord romfrey added a brief word he told nevil that he would see no one for the present hoped he would be absent a year not a day less to render it the more easily practicable in the next packet of letters colonel halkett and cecilia begged them not to bring the esperanza home for the yachting season the colonel said his daughter was to be married in april and that bridegroom and bride had consented to take an old man off with them to italy perhaps in the autumn all might meet in venice and youve never seen venice beauchamp said to jenny everything is new to me said she penetrating and gladly joining the conspiracy to have him out of england dr shrapnel was not so compliant as the young husband where he could land and botanize as at madeira he let time fly and drum his wings on air but the cities of priests along the coast of portugal and spain roused him to a burning sense of that flight of time and the vacuity it told of in his labours greatly to his astonishment he found that it was no longer he and beauchamp against jenny but jenny and beauchamp against him what he cried to draw breath day by day and not to pay for it by striking daily at the rock iniquity are you for that beauchamp and in a land where these priests walk with hats curled like the waterlilys leaf without the flower how far will you push indolent unreason to gain the delusion of happiness there is no such thing but theres trance that talk of happiness is a carrion clamour of the creatures of prey take itand youre helping tear some poor wretch to pieces whom you might be constructing saving perchance some one some thousands you beauchamp when i met you first you were for england england for a breadth of the palm of my hand comparativelythe round of a copper penny no wider and from that you jumped at a bound to the round of this earth you were for humanity ay we sailed our planet among the icy spheres and were at bloodheat for its destiny you and i and now you hover for a wind to catch you so it is for a soul rejecting prayer this wind and that has it the wellsprings within are shut down fast i pardon my jenny my harry denhams girl she is a woman and has a brain like a bell that rings all round to the tongue it is her kingdom of the interdicted untraversed frontiers but what cares she or any woman that this age of ours should lie like a carcase against the sun what cares any woman to help to hold up life to him he breeds divinely upon life filthy upon stagnation sail you away if you will in your trance i go i go home by land alone and i await you here in this land of moles upright i do naught but execrate i am a pulpit of curses counteranathema you might call me oh i feel the comparison so for england shining spiritually bright said jenny and cut her husband adrift with the exclamation and saw him float away to dr shrapnel spiritually bright by comparison nevil theres neither spiritual nor political brightness in england but a common resolution to eat of good things and stick to them said the doctor and we two out of england theres barely a voice to cry scare to the feeders im back im home they lost him once in cadiz and discovered him on the quay looking about for a vessel in getting him to return to the esperanza they nearly all three fell into the hands of the police beauchamp gave him a great deal of his time reading and discussing with him on deck and in the cabin and projecting future enterprises to pacify his restlessness a translation of plato had become beauchamps intellectual world this philosopher singularly anticipated his ideas concerning himself he was beginning to think that he had many years ahead of him for work he was with dr shrapnel as to the battle and with jenny as to the delay in recommencing it both the men laughed at the constant employment she gave them among the greek islands in furnishing her severely accurate accounts of seafights and landfights and the scenes being before them they could neither of them protest that their taskwork was an idle labour dr shrapnel assisted in fighting marathon and salamis over again cordiallyto shield great britain from the rule of a satrapy beauchamp often tried to conjure words to paint his wife on grave subjects she had the manner of speaking of a shy scholar and between grave and playful between smiling and serious her clear head her nobly poised character seemed to him to have never had a prototype and to elude the art of picturing it in expression until he heard lydiard call her whimsically portia disrobing portia half in her doctors gown half out of it they met lydiard and his wife louise and mr and mrs tuckham in venice where upon the first day of october jenny beauchamp gave birth to a son the thrilling mother did not perceive on this occasion the gloom she cast over the father of the child and dr shrapnel the youngster would insist on his right to be sprinkled by the parson to get a legal name and please his mother at all turns in the history of our healthy relations with women we are confronted by the parson and upon my word i believe beauchamp said to lydiard those parsonsnot bad creatures in private life there was one in madeira i took a personal liking tobut theyre utterly ignorant of what men feel to themmore ignorant than women mr tuckham and mrs lydiard would not listen to his foolish objections nor were they ever mentioned to jenny apparently the commission of the act of marriage was to force beauchamp from all his positions one by one the education of that child mrs lydiard said to her husband he considered that the mother would prevail cecilia feared she would not depend upon it hell make himself miserable if he can said tuckham that gentleman however was perpetually coming fuming from arguments with beauchamp and his opinion was a controversialists his common sense was much afflicted i thought marriage would have stopped all those absurdities he said glaring angrily laughing and then frowning i ve warned him ill go out of my way to come across him if he carries on his headlong folly a man should accept his country for what it is when hes born into it dont tell me hes a good fellow i know he is but there s an ass mounted on the good fellow talks of the parsons why theyre men of education they couldnt steer a ship in a gale though oh hes a good sailor and let him go to sea said tuckham his wifes a prize hes hardly worthy of her if she manages him shell deserve a monument for doing a public service how fortunate it is for us that here and there we do not succeed in wresting our temporary treasure from the grasp of the fates this good old commonplace reflection came to beauchamp while clasping his wifes hand on the deck of the esperanza and looking up at the mountains over the gulf of venice the impression of that marvellous dawn when he and renee looked up handinhand was ineffaceable and pity for the tender hand lost to him wrought in his blood but jenny was a peerless wife and though not in the music of her tongue or in subtlety of delicate meaning did she excel renee as a sober adviser she did and as a firm speaker and she had homelier deep eyes thoughtfuller brows the father could speculate with good hope of jennys child cecilias wealth too had gone over to the tory party with her incomprehensible espousal of tuckham let it go let all go for dowerless jenny it was she dared to recollect it in her anguish jennys choice to go home in the yacht that decided her husband not to make the journey by land in company with the lydiards the voyage was favourable beauchamp had a passing wish to land on the norman coast and take jenny for a day to tourdestelle he deferred to her desire to land baby speedily now they were so near home they ran past otley river having sight of mount laurels and on to bevisham with swelling sails there they parted beauchamp made it one of his points of honour to deliver the vessel where he had taken her at her moorings in the otley one of the piermen stood before beauchamp and saluting him said he had been directed to inform him that the earl of romfrey was with colonel halkett expecting him at mount laurels beauchamp wanted his wife to return in the yacht she turned her eyes to dr shrapnel it was out of the question that the doctor should think of going husband and wife parted she saw him no more this is no time to tell of weeping the dry chronicle is fittest hard on nine oclock in the december darkness the night being still and clear jennys babe was at her breast and her ears were awake for the return of her husband a man rang at the door of the house and asked to see dr shrapnel this man was killick the radical sam of politics he said to the doctor i m going to hit you sharp sir ive had it myself please put on your hat and come out with me and close the door they mustnt hear inside and heres a fly i knew youd be off for the finding of the body commander beauchamps drowned dr shrapnel drove round by the shore of the broad water past a great hospital and ruined abbey to otley village killick had lifted him into the conveyance and he lifted him out dr shrapnel had not spoken a word lights were flaring on the river illuminating the small craft sombrely men women and children crowded the hard and landingplaces the marshy banks and the decks of colliers and trawlers neither killick nor dr shrapnel questioned them the lights were torches and lanterns the occupation of the boats moving in couples was the dragging for the dead o god lets find his body a woman called out just a word is it commander beauchamp killick said to her she was scarcely aware of a question here this one she said and plucked a little boy of eight by the hand close against her side and shook him roughly and kissed him an old man volunteered information thats the boy that boy was in his fathers boat out there with two of his brothers larking and he and another older than him fell overboard and just then commander beauchamp was rowing by and i saw him from off here where i stood jump up and dive and he swam to his boat with one of them and got him in safe that boy and he dived again after the other and was down a long time either he burst a vessel or he got cramp for hed been rowing himself from the schooner grounded down at the rivermouth and must have been hot when he jumped in either way he fetched the second up and sank with him down he went a fisherman said to killick do you hear that voice thundering thats the great lord romfrey hes been directing the dragging since five o the evening and will till he drops or drowns or up comes the body o god lets find the body the woman with the little boy called out a torch lit up lord romfreys face as he stepped ashore the flood has played us a trick he said we want more drags or with the next ebb the body may be lost for days in this infernal water the mother of the rescued boy sobbed oh my lord my lord the earl caught sight of dr shrapnel and went to him my wife has gone down to mrs beauchamp he said she will bring her and the baby to mount laurels the child will have to be handfed i take you with me you must not be alone he put his arm within the arm of the heavilybreathing man whom he had once flung to the ground to support him my lord my lord sobbed the woman and dropped on her knees what s this the earl said drawing his hand away from the womans clutch at it shes the mother my lord several explained to him mother of what my boy the woman cried and dragged the urchin to lord romfreys feet cleaning her boys face with her apron its the boy commander beauchamp drowned to save said a man all the lights of the ring were turned on the head of the boy dr shrapnels eyes and lord romfreys fell on the abashed little creature the boy struck out both arms to get his fists against his eyelids this is what we have in exchange for beauchamp it was not uttered but it was visible in the blank stare at one another of the two men who loved beauchamp after they had examined the insignificant bit of mudbank life remaining in this world in the place of him etext editors bookmarks and life said do it and death said to what end as fair play as a womans lord could give her beauchamps career dogs die more decently than we men dreads our climate and coffee too much to attempt the voyage had come to be her lover through being her husband he bowed to facts he condensed a paragraph into a line he runs too much from first principles to extremes i do not think frenchmen comparable to the women of france it would be hard ay then we do it forthwith making too much of ita trick of the vulgar more argument i cannot bear none but fanatics cowards whiteeyeballed dogmatists push indolent unreason to gain the delusion of happiness reproof of such supererogatory counsel she had no longer anything to resent she was obliged to weep slaves of the priests the healthy only are fit to live the world without him would be heavy matter this girl was pliable only to service not to grief virtue of impatience we women can read men by their power to love when hes a christian instead of a churchman where love exists there is goodness without a single intimation that he loathed the task wonderment that one of her sex should have ideas
