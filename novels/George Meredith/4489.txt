cambrian race vii the miniature viii captain con and mrs adister odonnell ix the captains cabin x the brothers xi introducing a new character chapter i wherein an excursion is made in a celtic mind a young irish gentleman of the numerous clan odonnells and a patrick hardly a distinction of him until we know him had bound himself by purchase of a railwayticket to travel direct to the borders of north wales on a visit to a notable landowner of those marches the squire adister whose familyseat was where the hills begin to lift and spy into the heart of black mountains examining his ticket with an apparent curiosity the son of a greener island debated whether it would not be better for him to follow his inclinations now that he had gone so far as to pay for the journey and stay but his inclinations were also subject to question upon his considering that he had expended pounds english for the privilege of making the journey in this very train he asked himself earnestly what was the nature of the power which forced him to do ita bad genius or a good and it seemed to him a sort of answer inasmuch as it silenced the contending parties that he had been the victim of an impetus true still his present position involved a certain outlay of money simply not at all his bondage to the instrument it had procured for him and that was true nevertheless to buy a ticket to shy it away is an incident so uncommon that if we can but pause to dwell on the singularity of the act we are unlikely to abjure our fellowship with them who would not be guilty of it and therefore by the aid of his reflections and a remainder of the impetus mr patrick odonnell stepped into a carriage of the train like any ordinary english traveller between whom and his destination there is an agreement to meet if they can it is an experience of hesitating minds be they saxon or others that when we have submitted our persons to the charge of public companies immediately as if the renouncing of our independence into their hands had given us a taste of a will of our own we are eager for the performance of their contract to do what we are only half inclined to the train cannot go fast enough to please us though we could excuse it for breaking down stoppages at stations are impertinences and the delivery of us at last on the platform is an astonishment for it is not we who have done itwe have not even desired it to be imperfectly in accord with the velocity precipitating us upon a certain point is to be going without our heads which have so much the habit of supposing it must be whither we intend when we go in a determined manner that a doubt of it distracts the understandingdecapitates us suddenly to alight moreover and find ourselves dropped at the heels of flying time like an unconsidered bundle is anything but a reconstruction of the edifice the natural revelry of the blood in speed suffers a violent shock not to speak of our notion of being left behind quite isolated and unsound or if you insist the condition shall be said to belong exclusively to celtic nature seeing that it had been drawn directly from a scion of one of those tribes young patrick jumped from the train as headless as good st denis he was a juvenile thinker and to discover himself here where he both wished and wished not to be now deeming the negative sternly in the ascendant flicked his imagination with awe of the influence of the railway service upon the destinies of man settling a mental debate about a backward flight he drove across the land so foreign to his eyes and affections and breasted a strong tide of wishes that it were in a contrary direction he would rather have looked upon the desert under a sandstorm or upon a london suburb yet he looked thirstingly each variation of landscape of the curved highway offered him in a moment decisive features he fitted them to a story he knew the whole circle was animated by a couple of pale mounted figures beneath no happy light for this was the air once breathed by adiante adister his elder brother philips love and lost love here she had been to philip flame along the hillridges his roseworld in the dustworld the saintly in his earthly and how had she rewarded him for that reverential love of her she had forborne to kill him the bitter sylph of the mountain lures men to climb till she winds them in vapour and leaves them groping innocent of the red crags below the delicate thing had not picked his bones patrick admitted it he had seen his brother hale and stout not long back but oh she was merciless she was a witch if ever queenwitch was she was the crowned one for a personal proof now he had her all round him in a strange district though he had never cast eye on her yonder bare hill she came racing up with a plume in the wind she was over the long brown moor look where he would and vividly was she beside the hurrying beck where it made edges and chattered white he had not seen he could not imagine her face angelic dashed with demon beauty was his idea of the woman and there is little of a portrait in that but he was of a world where the elemental is more individual than the concrete and unconceived of sight she was a recognised presence for the greenisland brain of a youth whose manner of hating was to conjure her spirit from the air and let fly his own in pursuit of her it has to be stated that the object of the youngsters expedition to earlsfont was perfectly simple in his mind however much it went against his nature to perform it he came for the purpose of obtaining miss adisters continental address to gather what he could of her from her relatives and then forthwith to proceed in search of her that he might plead with her on behalf of his brother philip after a four years division of the lovers could anything be simpler he had familiarised himself with the thought of his advocacy during those four years his reluctance to come would have been accountable to the adisters by a sentiment of shame at his familys dealings with theirs in fact a military captain of the odonnells had in old days played the adventurer and charmed a maid of a certain age into yielding her hand to him and the lady was the squire of earlsfonts only sister she possessed funded property shortly after the union as one that has achieved the goal of enterprise the gallant officer retired from the service nor did north western england put much to his credit the declaration of his wifes pronouncing him to be the best of husbands she naturally said it of him in eulogy his own relatives accepted it in some contempt mixed with a relish of his hospitality his wifes were constant in citing his gain by the marriage could he possibly have been less than that they exclaimed an excellent husband who might easily have been less than that he was the most devoted of cousins and the liberal expenditure of his native eloquence for the furtherance of philips lovesuit was the principal cause of the misfortune if misfortune it could subsequently be called to lose an adiante the adister family were not gifted to read into the heart of a young man of a fanciful turn patrick had not a thought of shame devolving on him from a kinsman that had shot at a mark and hit it who sees the shame of taking an apple from a garden of the hesperides and as england cultivates those golden if sometimes wrinkled fruits it would have seemed to him in thinking about it an entirely lucky thing for the finder while a question of blood would have fired his veins to rival heat of selfassertion very loftily towering there were kings in ireland cry for one of them in uladh and you will hear his name and he has descendants yet but the youth was not disposed unnecessarily to blazon his princeliness he kept it in modest reserve as common gentlemen keep their physical strength his reluctance to look on earlsfont sprang from the same source as unacknowledged craving to see the place which had precipitated him thus far upon his road he had a horror of scenes where a faithless girl had betrayed her lover love was his visionary temple and his idea of love was the solitary light in it painfully susceptible to coldair currents from the stories of love abroad over the world faithlessness he conceived to be obnoxious to nature it stained the earth and was excommunicated there could be no pardon of the crime barely any for repentance he conceived it in the feminine for men are not those holy creatures whose conduct strikes on the soul with direct edge a faithless man is but a general villain or funny monster a subject rejected of poets taking no hue in the flat chronicle of history but a faithless woman how shall we speak of her women sacredly endowed with beauty and the wonderful vibrating note about the very mention of them are criminal to hideousness when they betray cry false on them and there is an instant echo of bleeding males in many circles like the poor quavering flutehowl of transformed beasts which at some remembering touch bewail their higher state those women are sovereignly attractive too loathsomely therein you may detect the fiend our moralist had for some time been glancing at a broad handsome old country mansion on the top of a wooded hill backed by a swarm of mountain heads all purpledark under clouds flying thick to shallow as from a brush of sepia the dim silver of halflighted lakewater shot along below the terrace he knew the kind of sky having oftener seen that than any other and he knew the house before it was named to him and he had flung a discolouring thought across it he contemplated it placably and studiously perhaps because the showerfolding armies of the fields above likened its shadowed stillness to that of his irish home there had this woman lived at the name of earlsfont she became this witch snake deception earlsfont was the title and summary of her black story the reverberation of the word shook up all the chapters to pour out their poison chapter ii mr adister mr patrick odonnell drove up to the gates of earlsfont notwithstanding these emotions upon which light matter it is the habit of men of his blood too much to brood though it is for our better future to have a capacity for them and the insensible race is the oxenish but if he did so when alone the second man residing in the celt put that fellow by and at once assumed the social character on his being requested to follow his card into mr adisters library he took his impression of the hall that had heard her voice the stairs she had descended the door she had passed through and the globes she had perchance laid hand on and the old mappemonde and the severelyshining orderly regiment of books breathing of her whether she had opened them or not as he bowed to his host and in reply to so sir i am glad to see you said swimmingly that earlsfont was the first house he had visited in this country and the scenery reminded him of his part of ireland and on landing at holyhead he had gone off straight to the metropolis by appointment to meet his brother philip just returned from canada a full captain who heartily despatched his compliments and respects and hoped to hear of perfect health in this quarter of the world and captain con the same and he was very flourishing patricks opening speech concluded on the sound of a short laugh coming from mr adister it struck the young irishmans ear as injurious and scornful in relation to captain con but the remark ensuing calmed him he has no children no sir captain con wasnt born to increase the number of our clan patrick rejoined and thought by heaven i get a likeness of her out of you with a dash of the mother mayhap somewhere this was his puck manner of pulling a girdle round about from what was foremost in his head to the secret of his hosts quiet observation for guessing that such features as he beheld would be slumped on a handsome family he was led by the splendid severity of their lines to perceive an illimitable pride in the man likely to punish him in his offspring who would inherit that as well so as is the way with the livelier races whether they seize first or second the matter or the spirit of what they hear the vivid indulgence of his own ideas helped him to catch the right meaning by the tail and he was enlightened upon a domestic unhappiness although mr adister had not spoken miserably the dash of the mother was thrown in to make adiante softer and leave a loophole for her relenting the master of earlsfont stood for a promise of beauty in his issue requiring to be softened at the mouth and along the brows even in men he was tall and had clear greek outlines the lips were locked metal thin as edges of steel and his eyes when he directed them on the person he addressed or the person speaking were as little varied by motion of the lids as eyeballs of a stone bust if they expressed more because they were not sculptured eyes it was the expression of his high and frigid nature rather than any of the diversities pertaining to sentiment and shades of meaning you have had the bequest of an estate mr adister said to compliment him by touching on his affairs a small one not a quarter of a county said patrick productive sir tis a tramp of discovery sir to where bog ends and cultivation begins bequeathed to you exclusively over the head of your elder brother i understand patrick nodded assent but my purse is philips and my house and my horses not bequeathed by a member of your family by a distant cousin chancing to have been one of my godmothers women do these things mr adister said not in perfect approbation of their doings and i think too it might have gone to the elder patrick replied to his tone it is not your intention to be an idle gentleman no nor a vagrant irishman sir you propose to sit down over there when ive more brains to be of service to them and the land i do mr adister pulled the arm of his chair the professions are crammed an irish gentleman owning land might do worse i am in favour of some degree of military training for all gentlemen you hunt patricks look was give me a chance and mr adister continued good runs are to be had here you shall try them you are something of a shot i suppose we hear of gentlemen now who neither hunt nor shoot you fence thats to say ive had lessons in the art i am not aware that there is now an art of fencing taught in ireland nor am i said patrick though theres no knowing what goes on in the cabins mr adister appeared to acquiesce observations of sly import went by him like the whispering wind your priests should know he said to this patrick thought it well not to reply after a pause between them he referred to the fencing i was taught by a parisian master of the art sir you have been to paris i was educated in paris how ah mr adister corrected himself in the higher notes of recollection i think i have heard something of a jesuit seminary the fathers did me the service to knock all i know into me and call it education by courtesy said patrick basking in the unobscured frown of his host then you are accustomed to speak french the interrogation was put to extract some balm from the circumstance patrick tried his art of fence with the absurdity by saying all but like a native these jesuits taught you the use of the foils they allowed me the privilege of learning sir after meditation mr adister said you dont dance he said it speculating on the kind of gentleman produced in paris by the disciples of loyola pardon me sir you hit on another of my accomplishments these jesuits encourage dancing the square danceshort of the embracing the valse is under interdict mr adister peered into his brows profoundly for a glimpse of the devilry in that exclusion of the valse what object had those people in encouraging the young fellow to be a perfect fencer and dancer so that he should be of the school of the polite world and yet subservient to them thanks to the jesuits then you are almost a parisian he remarked provoking the retort thanks to them ive stored a little and paris is to me as pure a place as four whitewashed walls patrick added without a shadow of a monk on them perhaps it was thrown in for the comfort of mundane ears afflicted sorely and no point of principle pertained to the slur on a monk mr adister could have exclaimed that shadow of the monk had he been in an exclamatory mood he said they have not made a monk of you then patrick was minded to explain how that the jesuits are a religious order exercising worldly weapons the lack of precise words admonished him of the virtue of silence and he retreatedwith a quiet negative they have not then you are no jesuit he was asked thinking it scarcely required a response he shrugged you would not change your religion sir said mr adister in seeming anger patrick thought he would have to rise he half fancied himself summoned to change his religion or depart from the house not i said he not for the title of prince he was further pressed and he replied i dont happen to have an ambition for the title of prince or any title interjected mr adister or whatever the devil can offeror he spoke more pointedly for what fools call a brilliant marriage my religion patrick now treated the question seriously and raised his head id not suffer myself to be asked twice the sceptical northernblue eyes of his host dwelt on him with their full repellent stare the young catholic gentleman expected he might hear a frenetic zealot roar out be off he was not immediately reassured by the words dead or alive then you have a father the spectacle of a state of excitement without a show of feeling was novel to patrick he began to see that he was not implicated in a wrath that referred to some great offender and mr adister soon confirmed his view by saying you are no disgrace to your begetting sir with that he quitted his chair and hospitably proposed to conduct his guest over the house and grounds chapter iii caroline men of the adister family having taken to themselves brides of a very dusty pedigree from the principality there were curious rough heirlooms to be seen about the house shields on the armoury walls and hunting horns and drinkinghorns and spears and chainbelts bearing clasps of heads of beasts old gold ornaments torques bluestone necklaces under glasscases were in the library huge rings that must have given the wearers fearful fists a shirt of coarse linen with a pale brown spot on the breast like a fallen beechleaf and many sealed parchmentskins very precious for an inspection of which as patrick was bidden to understand history humbly knocked at the earlsfont halldoors and the proud muse made her transcripts of them kneeling he would have been affected by these wonders had any relic of adiante appeased his thirst or had there been one mention of her it would have disengaged him from the incessant speculations regarding the daughter of the house of whom not a word was uttered no portrait of her was shown why was she absent from her home so long where was she how could her name be started and was it she who was the sinner in her fathers mind but the idolatrous love between adiante and her father was once a legend they could not have been cut asunder she had offered up her love of philip as a sacrifice to it patrick recollected that and now with a softer gloom on his brooding he released her from the burden of his grand charge of unfaithfulness to the truest of lovers by acknowledging that he was in the presence of the sole rival of his brother glorious girl that she was her betrayal of philip had nothing of a womans base caprice to make it infamous she had sacrificed him to her reading of duty and that was duty to her father and the point of duty was in this instance rather a sacred one he heard voices murmur that she might be praised he remonstrated with them assuring them as one who knew that a womans first duty is her duty to her lover her parents are her second thought her lover in the consideration of a real soul among the shifty creatures is her husband and have we not the word of heaven directing her to submit herself to him who is her husband before all others that peerless adiante had previously erred in the upper sphere where she received her condemnation but such a sphere is ladder and ladder and silver ladder high above your hairsplitting pates you children of earth and it is not for you to act on the verdict in decrying her rather tis for you to raise hymns of worship to a saint thus did the ingenious patrick change his ground and gain his argument with the celerity of one who wins a game by playing it without an adversary mr adister had sprung a new sense in him on the subject of the renunciation of the religion no thought of a possible apostasy had ever occurred to the youth and as he was aware that the difference of their faith had been the main cause of the division of adiante and philip he could at least consent to think well of her down here that is on our flat surface of earth up there among the immortals he was compelled to shake his head at her still and more than sadly in certain moods of exaltation reprovingly though she interested him beyond all her sisterhood above it had to be confessed they traversed a banquetinghall hung with portraits to two or three of which the master of earlsfont carelessly pointed for his guest to be interested in them or not as he might please a receptionhall flung foldingdoors on a grand drawingroom where the fires in the grates went through the ceremony of warming nobody and made a show of keeping the house alive a modern steel cuirass helmet and plume at a corner of the armoury reminded mr adister to say that he had worn the uniform in his day he cast an odd look at the old shell containing him when he was a brilliant youth patrick was marched on to colonel arthurs rooms and to captain davids the sailor their father talked of his two sons they appeared to satisfy him if that was the case they could hardly have thrown off their religion already patrick had a dread of naming the daughter an idea struck him that she might be the person who had been guilty of it over there on the continent what if she had done it upon a review of her treatment of her lover and gone into a convent to wait for philip to come and claim hersaying philip ive put the knife to my fathers love of me love me double and so she just half swoons enough to show how the dear angel looks in her sleep a trick of kindness these heavenly women have that we heathen may get a peep of their secret roseenfolded selves and dream s no word nor drunken for the blessed mischief it works with us supposing it so it accounted for everything for her absence and her fathers abstention from a mention of her and the pretty good sort of welcome patrick had received for as yet it was unknown that she did it all for an odonnell these being his reflections he at once accepted a view of her that so agreeably quieted his perplexity and he leapt out of his tangle into the happy open spaces where the romantic things of life are as natural as the sun that rises and sets there you imagine what you will you live what you imagine an adiante meets her lover another adiante the phantom likeness of her similar to the fingertips hovers to a meeting with some one whose heart shakes your manful frame at but a thought of it but this other adiante is altogether a secondary conception barely descried and chased by you that she may interpret the mystical nature of the happiness of those two closelinked to eternity in advance you would learn it if she would expound it you are ready to learn it for the sake of knowledge and if you link yourself to her and do as those two are doing it is chiefly in a spirit of imitation in sympathy with the darting couple ahead meanwhile he conversed and seemed to a gentleman unaware of the vaporous activities of his brain a young fellow of a certain practical sense we have not much to teach you in horseflesh mr adister said quitting the stables to proceed to the gardens we must look alive to keep up our breed sir said patrick were breeding too fine and soon we shant be able to horse our troopers i call that the land for horses where the cavalrys wellmounted on a native breed you have your brothers notions of cavalry have you i leave it to philip to boast what cavalry can do on the field he knows but he knows that troopers must be mounted and were fineing more and more from bone with the sales to foreigners and the only chance of their not beating us is that theyll be so good as follow our bad example prussias well horsed and for the work its intended to do the austrian light cavalrys a model so im told ill see for myself then we sit our horses too heavy the saxon trooper runs headlong to flesh tis the beer that fattens and swells him properly to speak weve no light cavalry the french are studying it and when they take to studying they come to the fore ill pay a visit to their breeding establishments weve no studying here and not a scrap of system that i see all the country seems armed for bullying the facts till the periodical panic arrives and then it s for lying flat and roaring and well drop the curtain if you please you say we returned mr adister i hear you launched at us english by the captain your cousin who has apparently yet to learn that we are one people we re held together and a trifle intermixed i fancy its we with him and with me when were talking of army or navy said patrick but captain cons a bit of a politician a poor business when theres nothing to be done a very poor business mr adister rejoined if youd have the goodness to kindle his enthusiasm hed be for the first person plural with his cap in the air said patrick i detest enthusiasm youre not obliged to adore it to give it a wakener pray what does that mean patrick cast about to reply to the formal challenge for an explanation he began on it as it surged up to him well sir the country thats got hold of us if we re not to get loose we dont count many millions in europe and theres no shame in submitting to force majeure if a stand was once made and were mixed up tis true well or ill and were stronger both of us united than tearing to strips and so there for the past so long as we can set our eyes upon something to admire instead of a bundle squatting fat on a pile of possessions and vowing she wont budge and taking kicks from a big foot across the atlantic and shaking bayonets out of her mobcap for a little ones cock of the eye at her and shes all for the fleshpots and calls the rest of mankind fools because theyre not the same and so long as she can trim her ribands and have her hot toast and tea with a suspicion of a dram in it she doesnt mind how heavy she sits nor that s not the point nor s the land question nor the potato crop if only she wore the right sort of face to look at with a bit of brightness about it to show an idea inside striking alight from the day thats not yet nodding at us as the tops of big mountains do or if she were only braced and gallant and cried ready though i havent much outlook wed be satisfied with her for a handsome figure i dont know whether we wouldnt be satisfied with her for politeness in her manners wed like her better for a spice of devotion to alight higher up in politics and religion but the key of the difficultys a sparkle of enthusiasm its part business and the greater part sentiment we want a rousing in the heart of us or else wed be pleased with her for sitting so as not to overlap us entirely wed feel more at home and behold her more respectfully wed see the policy of an honourable union and be joined to you by more than a telegraphic cable thats captain con i think and many like him patrick finished his airy sketch of the irish case in a key signifying that he might be one among the many but unobtrusive stick to horses observed mr adister it was pronounced as the termination to sheer maundering patrick talked on the uppermost topic for the remainder of their stroll he noticed that his host occasionally allowed himself to say you irish and he reflected that the saying you english had been hinted as an offence he forgot to think that he had possibly provoked this alienation in a scornfully proud spirit the language of metaphor was to mr adister fools froth he conceded the use of it to the irish and the welsh as a right that stamped them for what they were by adopting it and they might look on a country as a she if it amused them so long as they were not recalcitrant they were to be tolerated they were a part of us doubtless the nether part yet not the less a part for which we are bound to exercise a specially considerate care or else we suffer for we are sensitive there this is justice but the indications by fiddlefaddle verbiage of anything objectionable to the whole in the part aroused an irritability that speedily endued him with the sense of sanity opposing lunacy when not having a wide command of the undecorated plain speech which enjoyed his approval he withdrew into the entrenchments of contempt patrick heard enough to let him understand why the lord of earlsfont and captain con were not on the best of terms once or twice he had a twinge or suspicion of a sting from the tone of his host though he was not political and was of a mood to pity the poor gentlemans melancholy state of solitariness with all his children absent his wife dead only a niece a young lady of twenty to lend an air of grace and warmth to his home she was a caroline and as he had never taken a liking to a caroline he classed her in the tribe of carolines to a kathleen an eveleen a nora or a bessy or an alicia he would have bowed more cordially on his introduction to her for these were names with portraits and vistas beyond that shook leaves of recollection of the happiest of lifethe sweet things dreamed undesiringly in opening youth a caroline awakened no soft association of fancies no mysterious heaven and earth the others had variously tinted skies above them their features wooed the dream led it on as the wooded glen leads the eye till we are deep in richness nor would he have throbbed had one of any of his favourite names appeared in the place of caroline adister they had not moved his heart they had only stirred the sources of wonder an eveleen had carried him farthest to imagine the splendours of an adiante and the announcement of the coming of an eveleen would perchance have sped a little wild fire to which what the world calls curiosity is frozenly akin through his veins mr adister had spoken of his niece caroline a lacquey receiving orders from his master mentioned miss adister there was but one miss adister for patrick against reason he was raised to anticipate the possible beholding of her and carolines entrance into the drawingroom brought him to the ground disappointment is a poor term for the descent from an immoderate height but the acknowledgment that we have shot up irrationally reconciles even unphilosophical youth to the necessity of the fall though we must continue sensible of a shock she was the miss adister and how and why no one else accompanied them on their march to the dinnertable patrick pursued his double task of hunting his thousand speculations and conversing fluently so that it is not astonishing if when he retired to his room the impression made on him by this young caroline was inefficient to distinguish her from the horde of her baptismal sisters and she had a pleasant face he was able to see that and some individuality in the look of it the next morning and then he remembered the niceness of her manners he supposed her to have been educated where the interfusion of a natural liveliness with a veiling retenue gives the title of lady she had enjoyed the advantage of having an estimable french lady for her governess she informed him as they sauntered together on the terrace a protestant of course patrick spoke as he thought madame dugue is a catholic of catholics and the most honourable of women that ill believe and wasnt for proselytisms said he oh no she was faithful to her trust save for the grand example that said caroline one could strive to imitate without embracing her faith theres my mind clear as print patrick exclaimed the faith of my fathers and any pattern you like for my conduct if its a good one caroline hesitated before she said you have noticed my uncle adisters prepossession i mean his extreme sensitiveness on that subject he blazed on me and he seemed to end by a sort of approval she sighed he has had cause for great unhappiness is it the colonel or the captain forgive me her head shook is it she is it his daughter i must ask you have not heard oh then i guessed it cried patrick with a flash of pride in his arrowy sagacity not a word have i heard but i thought it out for myself because i love my brother i fancy and now if youll be so good miss caroline let me beg its just the address or the city or the countrywhere she is can you tell mejust whereabouts youre surprised but i want her address to be off to see her im anxious to speak to her its anywhere she may be in a ring only show me the ring ill find her for ive a load and theres nothing like that for sending you straight though its in the dark it acts like an instinct but you know the clear address and wont let me be running blindfold shes on the continent and has been a long time and it was the capital of austria which is a catholic country and theyve irish blood in the service there or they had i could drop on my knees to you the declaration was fortunately hushed by a supplicating ardour or mr adister would have looked more surprised than his niece he stepped out of the library window as they were passing and evidently with a mind occupied by his own affairs held up an opened letter for carolines perusal she took a view of the handwriting any others she said you will consider that one enough for the day was his answer patrick descended the terrace and strolled by the waterside grieved at their having bad news and vexed with himself for being a stranger unable to console them half an hour later they were all three riding to the markettown where mr adister paid a fruitless call on his lawyer and never is at home never was known to be at home when wanted he said springing back to the saddle caroline murmured some soothing words they had a perverse effect his partner yes his partner is at home but i do not communicate upon personal business with his partner and by and by there will be i suppose a third partner i might as well deposit my family history in the hands of a club his partner is always visible it is my belief that camminy has taken a partner that he may act the independent gentleman at his leisure i meantime must continue to be the mark for these letters i shall expect soon to hear myself abused as the positive cause of the loss of a crown mr camminy will probably appear at the dinner hour said caroline claret attracts him i wish i could say as much of duty rejoined her uncle patrick managed to restrain a bubbling remark on the respective charms of claret and duty tempting though the occasion was for him to throw in a conversational word or two he was rewarded for listening devoutly mr adister burst out again and why not come over here to settle this transaction herselfprovided that i am spared the presence of her schinderhannes she could very well come i have now received three letters bearing on this matter within as many months down to the sale of her hereditary jewels i profess no astonishment the jewels may well go too if crydney and welvas are to go disrooted body and soul for a moonshine titlea gamingtable foreign knaveknown for a knavea young gentlewomana wild welsh caroline put her horse to a canter and the exclamations ended leaving patrick to shuffle them together and read the riddle they presented and toss them to the wind that they might be blown back on him by the powers of air in an intelligible form chapter iv the princess dinner and a little pianomusic and a song closed an evening that was not dull to patrick in spite of prolonged silences the quiet course of things within the house appeared to him to have a listening ear for big events outside he dreaded a single step in the wrong direction and therefore forbore to hang on any of his conjectures for he might perchance be unjust to the blessedest heroine on the surface of the eartha truly awful thought yet her name would no longer bear the speaking of it to himself it conjured up a smoky moon under confounding eclipse who was schinderhannes mr adister had said her schinderhannes patrick merely wished to be informed who the man was and whether he had a title and was much of a knave and particularly patrick would have liked to be informed of the fellows religion but asking was not easy it was not possible and there was a barrel of powder to lay a fiery head on for a pillow to confess that he had not the courage to inquire was as good as an acknowledgment that he knew too much for an innocent questioner and what did he know his brother philips fair angel forbade him to open the door upon what he knew he took a peep through fancys keyhole and delighted himself to think that he had seen nothing after a turbulent night with schinderhannes who let him go no earlier than the opening of a december day patrick hied away to one of the dusky nooks by the lake for a bracing plunge he attributed to his desire for it the strange deadness of the atmosphere and his incapacity to get an idea out of anything he looked on he had not a sensation of cold till the stinging element gripped him it is the finest school for the cure of dreamers two minutes of stout watery battle with the enemy close all round laughing but not the less inveterate convinced him that in winter at least we have only to jump out of our clothes to feel the reality of things in a trice the dip was sharpening he could say that his prescription was good for him his craving to get an idea ceased with it absolutely and he stood in far better trim to meet his redoubtable adversary of overnight but the rascal was a bandit and had robbed him of his purse that was a positive fact his vision had gone he felt himself poor and empty and rejoicing in the keenness of his hunger for breakfast singularly lean a youth despoiled of his vision and made sensible by the activity of his physical state that he is a common machine is eager for meat for excess of whatsoever you may offer him he is on the highroad of recklessness and had it been the bottle instead of carolines coffeecup patrick would soon have received a priming for a delivery of views upon the sex and upon love and the fools known as lovers acrid enough to win the applause of cynics boasting was the best relief that a young man not without modesty could find mr adister complimented him on the robustness of his habits and patrick would like to hear of the temptation that could keep him from his morning swim carolines needlethrust was provoked would not arctic weather deter you mr odonnell he hummed and her eyes filled with the sparkle short of arctic he had to say but a gallop after an arctic bath would soon spin the bloodupon an esquimaux dog of course he pursued to anticipate his critics remark on the absence of horses with a bow she smiled accepting the mental alertness he fastened on her we must perforce be critics of these tearaway wits which are moreover so threadbare to conceal the character caroline led him to vaunt his riding and his shooting and a certain time passed before she perceived that though he responded naturally to her first sly attacks his gross exaggerations upon them had not been the triumph of absurdity she supposed herself to have evoked her wish was to divert her uncle patrick discerned the intention and aided her as for entertainment he said in answer to mr adisters courteous regrets that he would have to be a prisoner in the house until his legal adviser thought proper to appear ill be perfectly happy if miss caroline will give me as much of her company as she can spare it s amusing to be shot at too by a lady who s a good marksman and birds and hares are always willing to wait for us they keep better alive i forgot to say that i can sing then i was in the presence of a connoisseur last night said caroline mr adister consulted his watch and the mantelpiece clock for a minute of difference between them remarking that he was a prisoner indeed and for the whole day unless camminy should decide to come there is the library he said if you care for books the best books on agriculture will be found there you can make your choice in the stables if you would like to explore the country i am detained here by a man who seems to think my business of less importance than his pleasures and it is not my business it is very much the reverse but i am compelled to undertake it as my own when i abhor the business it is hard for me to speak of it much more to act a part in it perhaps caroline interposed hurriedly mr odonnell would not be unwilling to begin the day with some duets patrick eagerly put on his shameface to accept her invitation protesting that his boldness was entirely due to his delight in music but ive heard said he that the best fortification for the exercise of the a voice is hearty eating so i ll pay court again to that game pie im one with the pigs for truffles his host thanked him for spreading the contagion of good appetite and followed his example robust habits and heartiness were signs with him of a conscience at peace and he thought the jesuits particularly forbearing in the amount of harm they had done to this young man so they were still at table when mr camminy was announced and ushered in the man of law murmured an excuse or two he knew his clients eye and how to thaw it no miss adister i have not breakfasted he said taking the chair placed for him i was all day yesterday at windlemont engaged in assisting to settle the succession where estates are not entailed the expectations of the family are undisciplined and certain not to be satisfied mr adister carried on the broken sentence that house will fall however you have lost no time this morningmr patrick odonnell mr camminy bowed busily somewhere in the direction between patrick and the sideboard our lawyers have us inside out like our physicians mr adister resumed talking to blunt his impatience for a private discussion with his own surgerys a little in their practice too we think in ireland said patrick mr camminy assented no doubt he was hungry and enjoyed the look of the table but the look of his client chilled the prospect considered in its genial appearance as a feast of stages having luminous extension so to ease his clients mind he ventured to say i thought it might be urgent it is urgent was the answer ah foreign domestic a frown replied caroline in haste to have her duties over that she might escape the dreaded outburst pressed another cup of tea on mr camminy and groaned to see him fill his plate she tried to start a topic with patrick the princess is well i hope mr camminy asked in the voice of discretion it concerns her highness it concerns my daughter and her inheritance from her mad grandmother mr adister rejoined loudly and he continued like a retreating thunder a princess with a title as empty as a skull at best a princess of swamps and swine that fight for acorns and men that fight for swine patrick caught a glance from caroline and the pair rose together they did that in our mountains a couple of thousand years ago said mr camminy and the cause was not so bad to judge by this ham men must fight the law is only a quieter field for them and a fatter for the ravens patrick joined in softly as if carrying on a song have at us mr odonnell im ashamed of my appetite miss adister but the mornings drive must be my excuse and im bounden to you for not forcing me to detain you yes i can finish breakfast at my leisure and talk of business which is never particularly interesting to ladies though mr camminy turned to her uncle i know miss adister has a head for it patrick hummed a bar or two of an air to hint of his being fanatico per la musica as a pretext for their departure if youll deign to give me a lesson said he as caroline came away from pressing her lips to her uncles forehead i may discover that i am about to receive one said she they quitted the room together mr camminy had seen another miss adister duetting with a young irishman and an odonnell with lamentable results to that union of voices and he permitted himself to be a little astonished at his respected clients defective memory or indifference to the admonition of identical circumstances chapter v at the piano chiefly without music barely had the door shut behind them when patrick let his heart out the princess he had a famished look and caroline glided along swiftly with her head bent like one musing his tone alarmed her she lent him her ear that she might get some understanding of his excitement suddenly as it seemed to have come on him but he was all in his hungry interrogation and as she reached her piano and raised the lid she saw it on tiptoe straining for her answer i thought you were aware of my cousins marriage was i said patrick asking it of himself for his conscience would not acknowledge an absolute ignorance no i fought it i wouldnt have a blot on her be suspected shes married shes married to one of their princesmarried for a titleand changed her religion and miss adister youre speaking of adiante my cousin adiante well did i hate the name i heard it first over in france our people wrote to me of her and its a name to set you thinking is she tender or nothing like a womana stone and i put it to my best friend there father clement whos a scholar up in everything and he said it was a name with a pretty sound and an ill meaningfar from tender and a bad history too for she was one of the fortynine danaides who killed their husbands for the sake of their father and was not likely to be the fiftieth considering the name she bore it was for her fathers sake she as good as killed her lover and the two adiantes are like enough theyre as like as a pair of hands with daggers so that was my brother philips luck shes married its done its over like death no hope and this time its against her father its against her faith theres the end of philip i could have prophesied it i did and when they broke from her casting him offtrue to her name thought i she cast him off and she couldnt wait for him and theres his heart broken and i ready to glorify her for a saint and now she must have loved the man or his title to change her religion she gives him her soul no praise to her for that but mercy what a love it must be or else its a spell but wasnt she rather one for flinging spells than melting except that were all of us hit at last and generally by our own weapon but she loved philip she loved him down to shipwreck and drowning she gave battle for him and against her father all the place here and the countrys alive with their meetings and partingsshe cant have married she wouldnt change her religion for her lover how can she have done it for this prince why its to swear false oaths unless its possible for a woman to slip out of herself and be another person after a death like that of a love like hers patrick stopped the idea demanded a scrutiny shes another person for me he said heres the worst i ever imagined of herthousands of miles and pits of sulphur beyond the worst and the very worst i thought her fickle i thought her heartless rather a black fairy perched above us not quite among the stars of heaven i had my ideas but never that she was a creature to jump herself down into a gulf and be lost for ever shes gone extinguished there she is under the penitents hoodcap with eyeholes before the faggots and thats what she has marrieda burning torment and none of the joys of martyrdom oh im not awake but i never dreamed of such a thing as thisnot the hard bare lumpofearthfactand thats the only thing to tell me im not dreaming now he subsided again then deeply beseeching asked have you by chance a portrait of the gentleman miss adister is there one anywhere caroline stood at her piano turning over the leaves of a musicbook with a pressure on her eyelids she was near upon being thrilled in spite of an astonishment almost petrifying and she could nearly have smiled so strange was his fraternal adoption amounting to a vivificationof his brothers passion he seemed quite naturally to impersonate philip she wondered too in the coolness of her alien blood whether he was a character or merely an irish character as to the unwontedness of the scene ireland was chargeable with that and ireland also a little at his expense as a citizen of the polite world relieved him of the extreme ridicule attached to his phrases and images she replied we have no portrait may i beg to know have you seen him said patrick caroline shook her head is there no telling what he is like miss adister he is not young an old man she had not said that and she wished to defend her cousin from the charge of contracting such an alliance but patricks face had brightened out of a gloom of stupefaction he assured her he was now ready to try his voice with hers only she was to excuse a touch of hoarseness he felt it slightly in his throat and could he she asked him wonder at it after his mornings bath he vindicated the saneness of the bath as well as he was able showing himself at least a good reader of music on the whole he sang pleasantly particularly french songs she complimented him with an emphasis on the french he said yes he fancied he did best in french and he had an idea of settling in france if he found that he could not live quietly in his own country and becoming a frenchmansaid caroline why not said he i m more at home with french people theyre mostly of my creed theyre amiable though they werent quite kind to poor lally tollendal i like them yes i love france and when im called upon to fix myself as i suppose i shall be some day i shant have the bother over there that i should find here she spoke reproachfully have you no pride in the title of englishman i m an irishman we are one nation and its one family where the dog is pulled by the collar there was a retort on him she saw as it were the box but the lid would not open to assist her to it and she let it go by thinking in her patriotic derision that to choose to be likened to the unwilling dog of the family was evidence of a want of saving pride besides she could not trust to the glibness of her tongue in a contest with a young gentleman to whom talking was as easy as breathing even if sometimes his volubility exposed him to attack a superior position was offered her by her being silent and critical she stationed herself on it still she was grieved to think of him as a renegade from his country and she forced herself to say captain odonnell talks in that manner captain con is constitutionally discontented because hes a bard by nature and without the right theme for his harp said patrick he has a notion of erin as the unwilling bride of mr bull because her lord is not off in heroics enough to please her and neglects her and wont let her be mistress of her own household and she cant forget that he once had the bad trick of beating her she sees the marks and you maynt believe it but the captains temper is to praise and exalt it is irony in him is only eulogy standing on its head a sort of an upside down a perversion thats our view of him at home all he desires is to have us on the march and hed be perfectly happy marching never mind the banner though a bit of green in it would put him in tune of course the banner of the cid was green miss adister or else its his pennon that was and theres a quantity of our blood in spain too weve watered many lands the poor young english ladys brain started wildly on the effort to be with him and to understand whether she listened to humour or emotion she reposed herself as well as she could in the contemplation of an electricallyflashing maze where every line ran losing itself in another he added old philip in a visible throb of pity for his brother after the scrupulous dubitation between the banner and the pennon of the cid it would have comforted her to laugh she was closer upon tears and without any reason for them in her heart such a position brings the hesitancy which says that the sitting is at an end she feared as she laid aside her musicbooks that there would be more to come about adiante but he spared her he bowed to her departing and strolled off by himself chapter vi a consultation with opinions upon welshwomen and the cambrian race later in the day she heard that he was out scouring the country on one of her uncles horses she had too many distressing matters to think of for so singular a young man to have any other place than that which is given to the fantastical in a troubled and serious mind he danced there like the whimsy sunbeam of a shaken water below what would be his opinion of adiante if he knew of her determination to sell the two fair estates she inherited from a grandmother whom she had venerated that she might furnish arms to her husband to carry out an audacious enterprise likely to involve both of them in blood and ruin would he not bound up aloft and quiver still more wildly she respected quaint though it was his imaginative heat of feeling for adiante sufficiently to associate him with her so far and she lent him in fancy her own bewilderment and grief at her cousins conduct for the soothing that his exaggeration of them afforded her she could almost hear his outcry the business of the hour demanded more of her than a seeking for refreshment she had been invited to join the consultation of her uncle with his lawyer mr adister tossed her another letter from vienna of that mornings delivery she read it with composure it became her task to pay no heed to his loss of patience and induce him to acquiesce in his legal advisers view which was to temporise further present an array of obstacles and by all possible suggestions induce the princess to come over to england where her fathers influence with her would have a chance of being established again and it might then be hoped that she who had never when under sharp temptation acted disobediently to his wishes at home and who certainly would not have dreamed of contracting the abhorred alliance had she been breathing the air of common sense peculiar to her native land would see the prudence if not the solemn obligation of retaining to herself these family possessions caroline was urgent with her uncle to act on such good counsel she marvelled at his opposition though she detected the principal basis of it mr adister had no ground of opposition but his own intemperateness the welsh grandmothers legacy of her estates to his girl overlooking her brothers colonel arthur and captain david had excessively vexed him despite the strong feeling he entertained for adiante and not simply because of the blow he received in it unexpectedly from that old lady as the last and heaviest of the long and open feud between them but also chiefly that it outraged and did permanent injury to his ideas of the proper balance of the sexes between himself and mrs winnion rhys the condition of the balance had been a point of vehement disputation she insisting to have it finer up to equality and he that the naturally lighter scale should continue to kick the beam behold now the consequence of the wilful welshwomans insanest of legacies the estates were left to adiante adister for her sole use and benefit making almost a man of her and an unshackled man owing no dues to posterity those estates in the hands of a woman are in the hands of her husband and the husband a gambler and a knave they are in the hands of the jews or gone to smoke let them go a devilish malignity bequeathed them let them go back to their infernal origin and when they were gone his girl would soon discover that there was no better place to come to than her home she would come without an asking and alone and without much prospect of the intrusion of her infamous hooknose in pursuit of her at earlsfont the money wasted the wife would be at peace here she would have leisure to repent of all the steps she had taken since that fatal one of the acceptance of the invitation to the embassy at vienna mr adister had warned her both against her going and against the influence of her friend lady wenchester our ambassadress there another welsh woman with the weathervane head of her race but the girl would accept and it was not for him to hold out it appeared to be written that the welsh particularly welsh women were destined to worry him up to the end of his days their women were a composition of wind and fire they had no reason nothing solid in their whole nature englishmen allied to them had to learn that they were dealing with broomstick witches and irresponsible sprites irishwomen were models of propriety beside them indeed irishwomen might often be patterns to their english sisterhood mr adister described the cambrian ladies as a kind of daughters of the fata morgana only half human and deceptive down to treachery unless you had them fast by their spinning fancy they called it being romantic it was the antechamber of madness mad was the word for them you pleased them you knew not how and just as little did you know how you displeased them and you were long hence to be taught that in a certain past year and a certain month and on a certain day of the month not forgetting the hour of the day to the minute of the hour and attendant circumstances to swear loud witness to it you had mortally offended them and you receive your blow you are sure to get it the one passion of those women is for vengeance they taste a wound from the lightest touch and they nurse the venom for you possibly you may in their presence have had occasion to praise the military virtues of the builder of carnarvon castle you are by and by pierced for it as hard as they can thrust or you have incidentally compared welsh mutton with southdownyou have not highly esteemed their drunken bardsyou have asked what the welsh have done in the world you are supposed to have slighted some person of their familya tenth cousinanything turns their blood or you have once looked straight at them without speaking and you discover years after that they have chosen to foist on you their idea of your idea at the moment and they have the astounding presumption to account this misreading of your look to the extent of a full justification nothing short of righteous for their treachery and your punishment o those welshwomen the muchsuffering lord of earlsfont stretched forth his open hand palm upward for a testifying instrument to the plain truth of his catalogue of charges he closed it tight and smote the table like motherand grandmother toolike daughter he said and generalised again to preserve his dignity theyre aflame in an instant you may see them quiet for years but it smoulders you dropped the spark and they time the explosion caroline said to mr camminy you are sure you can give us the day all of it he replied apologising for some show of restlessness the fact is miss adister i married a lady from over the borders and though i have never had to complain of her yet she may have a finale in store its true that i love wild wales and so do i caroline raised her eyes to imagined mountains you will pardon me camminy said mr adister the lawyer cracked his back to bow to the great gentleman so magnanimously humiliating himself sir sir he said yes welsh blood is queer blood i own they find it difficult to forgive and trifles offend and they are unhappily just as secretive as they are sensitive the pangs we cause them without our knowing it must be horrible they are born it would seem with more than the common allowance of kibes for treading on a severe misfortune for them now for their merits they have poetry in them they are valiant they are hospitable to teach the arab a lesson i do believe their life is their friends at needseriously they would lay it down for him or the wherewithal their money their property excepting the threestringed harp of three generations back worth now in current value sixpence halfpenny as a curiosity or three farthings for firewood that theyll keep against their own desire to heap on you everything they haveif they love you and you at the same time have struck their imaginations offend them however and its war declared or covert and i must admit that their best friend can too easily offend them i have lost excellent clients i have never understood why yet i respect the remains of their literature i study their language i attend their gatherings and subscribe the expenses i consume welsh mutton with relish i enjoy the triads and can come down on them with a quotation from catwg the wise but it so chanced that i trod on a kibe and i had to pay the penalty theres an arabian tale miss adister of a peaceful traveller who ate a date in the desert and flung away the stone which hit an invisible son of a genie in the eye and the poor traveller suffered for it well you commit these mortal injuries to the invisible among the welsh some of them are hurt if you call them welsh they scout it as the original saxon title for them no they are cymry cambrians they have forgiven the romans saxon and norman are still their enemies if you stir their hearts you find it so and by the way if king edward had not trampled them into the mire so thoroughly we should hear of it at times even now instead of penillions and englyns there would be days for fiery triplets say the worst of them they are soundheaded they have a ready comprehension for great thoughts the princess nikolas i remember had a special fondness for the words of catwg the wise adiante had murmured caroline to correct his indiscretion she was too late nikolas mr adister thundered hold back that name in this house title and all if you speak of my daughter i refuse admission to it here she has given up my name and she must be known by the one her featherbrained grandmother proposed for her to satisfy her pleasure in a fine sound english christian names are my preference i conceded arthur to her without difficulty she had a voice in david i recollect with very little profit to either of the boys i had no voice in adiante but i stood at my girls baptism and adiante let her be at least i saved the girl from the addition of arianrod it was to have been adiante arianrod can you credit it princepah nikolas have you a notion of the sort of prince that makes an english lady of the best blood of england his princess the lawyer had a precise notion of the sort of prince appearing to mr adister in the person of his foreign soninlaw prince nikolas had been described to him before with graphic touches upon the quality of the reputation he bore at the courts and in the gamblingsaloons of europe dreading lest his clients angry heat should precipitate him on the prince again to the confusion of a ladys ears mr camminy gave an emphatic and short affirmative you know what he is like said mr adister with a face of disgust reflected from the bare thought of the hideous likeness mr camminy assured him that the description of the princes lineaments would not be new it was as he was aware derived from a miniature of her husband transmitted by the princess on its flight out of her fathers loathing hand to the hearthstone and under his heel assisted by caroline he managed to check the famous delineation of the adventurer prince in which a not very worthy gentlemans chronic fever of abomination made him really eloquent quick to unburden himself in the teeth of decorum and my soninlaw my soninlaw ejaculated mr adister tossing his head higher and so he stimulated his amazement and abhorrence of the portrait he rather wondered at them for not desiring to have sketched for their execration of it alluringly foul as it was while they in concert drew him back to the discussion of his daughters business reiterating prudent counsel with a knowledge that they had only to wait for the ebbing of his temper let her be informed sir that by coming to england she can settle the business according to her wishes in one quarter of the time it would take a commission sent out to herif we should be authorised to send out one said mr camminy by committing the business to you i fancy i perceive your daughters disposition to consider your feelings possibly to a reluctance to do the deed unsanctioned by her father it would appear so to a cool observer notwithstanding her inattention to your remonstrances the reply was dine here and sleep here i shall be having more of these letters mr adister added profoundly sighing caroline slipped away to mark a conclusion to the debate and mr camminy saw his client redden fast and frown besides he spoke in a husky voice descending upon a subject hateful she tells me today she is not in a state to travel do you hear make what you can of it the proud and injured gentleman had the aspect of one who receives a blow that it is impossible for him to resent he could not speak the shame he felt it was literally in his flesh but the cause had been sufficiently hinted to set the lawyer staring as men do when they encounter situations of grisly humour where certain of the passions of mans developed nature are seen armed and furious against our mild prevailing ancient mother nature and the contrast is between our utter wrath and her simple exposition of the circumstances and consequences forming her laws there are situations which pass beyond the lightly stirred perceptive wits to the quiet court of the intellect to be received there as an addition to our acquaintance with mankind we know not of what substance to name them humour in its intense strain has a seat somewhere about the mouth of tragedy giving it the enigmatical faint wry pull at a corner visible at times upon the dreadful mask that mr adister should be astonished at such a communication from the princess after a year of her marriage and that he should take it for a further outrage of his paternal sentiments should actually redden and be hoarse in alluding to it the revelation of such points in our human character set the humane old lawyer staring at the reserve space within himself apart from his legal being whereon he by fits compared his own constitution with that of the individuals revealed to him by their acts and confidential utterances for him he decided that he would have rejoiced at the news granting the prince a monster however as mr adister unforcedly considered him it was not so cheering a piece of intelligence that involved him yet closer with that mans rank blood it curdled his own the marriage had shocked and stricken him cleaving in his love for his daughter a goodly tree and withering many flowers still the marriage was but adiantes gulf he might be called fatherinlaw of her spangled ruffian soninlaw the desperadorascal would never be called by him but the result of the marriage dragged him bodily into the gulf he became one of four numbering the beast twice among them the subtlety of his hatred so reckoned it for he could not deny his daughter in the fathers child he could not exclude its unhallowed father in the mothers and of this mans child he must know and own himself the grandfather if ever he saw the child if drawn to it to fondle it some part of the little animal not his daughters would partake of his embrace and if neither of his boys married and his girl gave birth to a son darkness rolled upon that avenue of vision a trespasser and usurperone of the demons brood chased his very name out of earlsfont camminy you must try to amuse yourself he said briskly anything you may be wanting at home shall be sent for i must have you here to make sure that i am acting under good advice you can take one of the keepers for an hour or two of shooting i may join you in the afternoon you will find occupation for your gun in the north covers he wandered about the house looking into several rooms and only partially at rest when he discovered caroline in one engaged upon some of her aquarelle sketches he asked where the young irishman was are you in search of him said she you like him uncle he is out riding they tell me the youngster is used to southwestern showers in that climate of his mr adister replied i dare say we could find the jesuit in him somewhere theres the seed his cousin con odonnell has filled him with stuff about ireland and england the man has no better to do than to train a parrot what do you think of him my love the judgement was not easily formed for expression he is not quite like what i remember of his brother philip he talks much more does he not he seems more irish than his brother he is very strange his feelings are strong he has not an idea of concealing them for a young man educated by the jesuits he is remarkably open the jesuits might be of service to me just now mr adister addressed his troubled soul and spoke upon another conception of them how has he shown his feelings caroline answered quickly his love of his brother anything that concerns his brother moves him it is like a touch on a musical instrument perhaps i should say a native one concerns his brother mr adister inquired and his look requesting enlightenment told her she might speak adiante she said softly she coloured her uncle mused awhile in a halfsomnolent gloom he talks of this at this present day it is not dead to him he really appears to have hoped he is extraordinary he had not heard before of her marriage i was a witness of the most singular scene this morning at the piano he gathered it from what he had heard he was overwhelmed by it i could not exaggerate it was impossible to help being a little touched though it was curious very strange her uncles attentiveness incited her to describe the scene and as it visibly relieved his melancholy she did it with a few vivid indications of the quaint young irishmans manner of speech she concluded at last he begged to see a portrait of her husband not of her said mr adister abruptly no only of her husband show him her portrait a shade of surprise was on carolines forehead shall i she had a dim momentary thought that the sight of the beautiful face would not be good for patrick yes let him see the woman who could throw herself away on that branded villain called a prince abjuring her church for a little fouler than hangman to me and every gentleman alive i desire that he should see it submission to the demands of her husbands policy required it of her she says show it him when he returns you have her miniature in your keeping and tomorrow take him to look at the fulllength of her before she left england and ceased to be a lady of our country i will order it to be placed in the armoury let him see the miniature of her this day mr adister resolved at the same time that patrick should have his portrait of the prince for a setoff to the face of his daughter he craved the relief it would be to him to lay his colours on the prince for the sparkling amazement of one whom according to carolines description he could expect to feel with him acutely which neither his niece nor his lawyer had done they never did when he painted the prince he was unstrung heavily plunged in the matter of his chagrin and grief his unhealed wound had been scraped and strewn with salt by his daughters letter he had a thirst for the kind of sympathy he supposed he would find in the young irishmans horror at the husband of the incomparable beauty now past redemption degraded by her hideous choice lost to england and to her father and to common respect for none having once had the picture of the man could dissociate them they were like heaven and its reverse everlastingly coupled in the mind by their opposition of characters and aspects her father could not and he judged of others by himself he had been all but utterly solitary since her marriage brooded on it until it saturated him too proud to speak of the thing in sadness or claim condolence for this wound inflicted on him by the daughter he had idolised other than through the indirect method of causing people to wonder at her chosen yokefellow their stupefaction refreshed him yet he was a gentleman capable of apprehending simultaneously that he sinned against his pride in the means he adopted to comfort his nature but the wound was a perpetual sickness needing soulmedicine proud as he was and unbending he was not stronger than his malady and he could disguise he could not contain the cry of immoderate grief adiante had been to him something beyond a creature beloved she had with her glorious beauty and greatheartedness been the sole object which had ever inspirited his imagination he could have thought no man not the most illustrious worthy of her and there she was voluntarily in the hands of a monster husband mr adister broke away from caroline muttering her husbands policy she was used to his interjections she sat thinking more of the strange request to her to show mr odonnell the miniature of adiante she had often thought that her uncle regretted his rejection of philip it appeared so to her now though not by any consecutive process of reasoning she went to fetch the miniature and gazing on it she tried to guess at mr odonnells thoughts when doing the same for who so inflammable as he and who woman or man could behold this lighted face with the dark raised eyes and abounding auburn tresses where the contrast of colours was in itself thrilling and not admire or more half worship or wholly worship she pitied the youth she fancied that he would not continue so ingenuously true to his brothers love of adiante after seeing it unless one might hope that the light above beauty distinguishing its noble classic lines and the energy of radiance like a morning of chivalrous promise in the eyes would subdue him to distant admiration these were her flitting thoughts under the spell of her queenly cousins visage she shut up the miniaturecase and waited to hand it to young mr odonnell chapter vii the miniature patrick returned to earlsfont very late he had but ten minutes to dress for dinner a short allowance after a heated ride across miry tracks though he would have expended some of them in spite of his punctilious respect for the bell of the house entertaining him if miss adister had been anywhere on the stairs or corridors as he rushed away to his room he had things to tell he had not been out over the country for nothing fortunately for his good social principles the butler at earlsfont was a wary supervisor of his man great guest or little guest patricks linen was prepared for him properly studded he had only to spring out of one suit into another and still more fortunately the urgency for a rapid execution of the manoeuvre prevented his noticing a large square envelope posted against the lookingglass of his toilettetable he caught sight of it first when pulling down his shirtcuffs with an air of recovered ease not to say genial triumph to think that the feat of grooming himself washing dressing and stripping the accustomed persuasive final sweep of the brush to his haircrop was done before the bell had rung his name was on the envelope and under his name in smaller letters adiante shall i said he doing the thing he asked himself about doing tearing open the paper cover of the portrait of her who had flitted in his head for years unseen and there she was remote but present his underlip dropped he had the look of those who bate breath and swarm their wits to catch a sound at last he remembered that the summoning bell had been in his ears a long time back without his having been sensible of any meaning in it he started to and fro the treasure he held declined to enter the breastpocket of his coat and the other pockets he perhaps if sentimentally justly discarded as being beneath the honour of serving for a temporary casket he locked it up with a vow to come early to rest even then he had thoughts whether it might be safe who spoke and what they uttered at the repast and his own remarks he was unaware of he turned right and left a brilliant countenance that had the glitter of frostlight it sparkled and was unreceptive no wonder miss adister deemed him wilder and stranger than ever she necessarily supposed the excess of his peculiarities to be an effect of the portrait and would have had him according to her ideas of a young man of some depth of feeling dreamier on the contrary he talked sheer commonplace he had ridden to the spur of the mountains and had put up the mare and groomed and fed her not permitting another hand to touch her all very well and his praises of the mare likewise but he had not a syllable for the sublime of the mountains he might have careered over midland flats for any susceptibility that he betrayed to the grandeur of the scenery she loved ultimately she fancied the miniature had been overlooked in his hurry to dress and that he was now merely excited by his lively gallop to a certain degree of hard brightness noticeable in hunting men at their dinner the elixir in patrick carried him higher than mountain crests adiante illumined an expanded world for him miraculous yet the real one only wanting such light to show its riches she lifted it out of darkness with swift throbs of her heavenliness as she swam to his eyelids vanished and dazzled anew and made these gleams of her and the dark intervals his dream of the winged earth on her flight from splendour to splendour secresy to secresyfollow you that can the youth whose heart is an opened mine whose head is an irradiated sky under the spell of imagined magical beauty she was bugle banner sunrise of his inmost ambition and rapture and without a warning she fled her features were lost his power of imagining them wrestled with vapour the effort contracted his outlook but if she left him blind of her she left him with no lessened bigness of heart he frankly believed in her revelation of a greater world and a livelier earth a flying earth and a world wealthier than grouped history in heroic marvels he fell back on the exultation of his having seen her and on the hope for the speedy coming of midnight when the fountain of her in the miniature would be seen and drunk of at his full leisure and his glorious elation of thrice man almost up to mounting spirit would be restored to make him worthy of the vision meanwhile caroline had withdrawn and the lord of earlsfont was fretting at his theme he had decided not to be a party in the sale of either of his daughters estates let her choose other agents if the iniquity was committed his hands would be clean of it mr adister spoke by way of prelude to the sketch of this prince whose title was a lurid delusion patrick heard of a sexagenarian rake and danube adventurer in person a description of falconcaliban containing his shagginess in a frogged hussarjacket and crimson pantaloons with hooknose foxeyes grizzled billow of frowsy moustache and chin of a beast of prey this fellow habitually one of the dogs lining the green tables of the foreign baths snapping for gold all day and half the night to spend their winnings in debauchery and howl threats of suicide never fulfilled early enough when they lost claimed his princedom on the strength of his fathers murder of a reigning prince and sitting in his place for six months till a merited shot from another pretender sent him to his account what do you say to such a nest of assassins and one of them an outcast and blackleg asking an english gentleman to acknowledge him as a member of his family i have said mr adister direct information that this gibbetbird is conspiring to dethronethey call itthe present reigning prince and the proceeds of my daughters estates are by her desireif she has not written under compulsion of the scoundrelintended to speed their bloodmongering there goes a welshwomans legacy to the sea with a herd of swine with devils in them mr camminy kept his head bent his hand on his glass of port patrick stared and the working of his troubled brows gave the unhappy gentleman such lean comfort as he was capable of taking patrick in sooth was engaged in the hard attempt at the same time to do two of the most difficult things which can be proposed to the ingenuity of sensational youth he was trying to excuse a respected senior for conduct that he could not approve while he did inward battle to reconcile his feelings with the frightful addition to his hoard of knowledge in other words he sought strenuously to mix the sketch of the prince with the dregs of the elixir coming from the portrait of adiante and now she sank into obscurity behind the blackest of brushes representing her incredible husband and now by force of some natural light she broke through the ugly mist and gave her adored the sweet lines and colours of the features he had lost there was an ebb and flow of the struggle until able to say to himself that he saw her clearly as though the portrait was in the palm of his hand the battle of the imagination ceased and she was fairer for him than if her foot had continued pure of its erratic step fairer owing to the eyes he saw with he had shaken himself free of the exacting senses which consent to the worship of women upon the condition of their possessing all the precious and the miraculous qualities among others the gift of an exquisite fragility that cannot break in short upon terms flattering to the individual devotee without knowing it he had done it and got some of the upholding strength of those noblest of honest men who not merely give souls to womenan extraordinary endowment of thembut also discourse to them with their souls patrick accepted adiantes husband the man was her husband hideous for there was no combating her fathers painting of him he was almost interesting through his alliancean example of how much earth the worshipper can swallow when he is quite sincere instead of his going under eclipse the beauty of his lady eclipsed her monster he believed in her right to choose according to her pleasure since her lover was denied her sitting alone by his fire he gazed at her for hours and bled for philip there was a riddle to be answered in her cutting herself away from philip he could not answer it her face was the vindication and the grief the usual traverses besetting true lovers were suggested to him enemies and slanders and intercepted letters he rejected them in the presence of the beautiful inscrutable small marvel that philip had loved her poor fellow patrick cried aloud and drooped on a fit of tears the sleep he had was urgently dreamridden to goals that eluded him and broadened to fresh races and chases waving something to be won which never was won albeit untiringly pursued amid a series of adventures tragic episodes wild enthusiasm the whole of it was featureless a shifting agitation yet he must have been endowed to extricate a particular meaning applied to himself out of the mass of tumbled events and closely in relation to realities for he quitted his bed passionately regretting that he had not gone through a course of drill and study of the military art he remembered mr adisters having said that military training was good for all gentlemen i could join the french foreign legion he thought adiante was as beautiful by day as by night he looked the riddle of her was more burdensome in the daylight he sighed and on another surging of his admiration launched the resolve that he would serve her blindly without one question how when where and the means and the aim he did not think of there was she and here was he and heaven and a great heart would show the way adiante at eighteen the full length of her fresh in her love of philip was not the same person to him she had not the same secret she was beautiful differently by right he should have loved the portrait best but he had not seen it first he had already lived through a life of emotions with the miniature and could besides clasp the frame and moreover he fondled an absurd notion that the miniature would be entrusted to him for a time and was almost a possession the pain of the thought of relinquishing it was the origin of this foolishness and again if it be fair to prove him so deeply true to his brother though he was admiration of a woman does thus influence the tides of our blood to render the noblest of us guilty of some unconscious wavering of our loyalty patrick dedicated the fulllength of adiante to philip and reserved the other her face and neck for himself obediently to mr adisters order the portrait had been taken from one of his private rooms and placed in the armoury the veil covering the canvas of late removed guns and spears and swords overhead and about the youthful figure of adiante was ominously encompassed caroline stood with patrick before the portrait of her cousin she expected him to show a sign of appreciation he asked her to tell him the church whose forms of faith the princess had embraced she answered that it was the greek church the greek said he gazing harder at the portrait presently she said it was a perfect likeness she named the famous artist who had painted it patricks ah was unsatisfactory we said she think it a living image of her as she was then he would not be instigated to speak you do not admire it mr odonnell she cried oh but i do thats how she looked when she was drawing on her gloves with good will to go out to meet him you cant see her there and not be sure she had a heart she part smiles she keeps her mouth shut but theres the dimple and it means a thought like a bubble bursting up from the heart in her breast shes tall she carries herself like a great french lady and nothing beats that its the same colour dark eyebrows and fair hair and not thinking of her pride she thinks of her walk and the end of it where hes waiting the eyes are not the same the same said caroline as this he tapped on the left side she did not understand it at all the bit of work done in vienna said he she blushed do you admire that so much i do we consider it not to be compared to this perhaps not i like it better but why do you like that better said caroline deeming it his wilfulness patrick put out a finger the eyes there dont seem to say im yours to make a hero of you but look he drew forth from under his waistcoat the miniature what dont they say here its a bright day for the austrian capital that has her by the river danube yours has a landscape ive made acquaintance with the country i caught the print of it on my ride yesterday and those are your mountains but mine has her all to herself while shes thinking undisturbed in her boudoir i have her and her thoughts thats next to her soul ive an idea it ought to be given to philip he craned his head round to woo some shadow of assent to the daring suggestion just to break the shock twill be to my brother miss adister if i could hand him this and say keep it for youll get nothing more of her and thats worth a kingdom caroline faltered your brother does not know pity him his blow s to come he cant or he d have spoken of it to me i was with him a couple of hours and he never mentioned a word of it nor did captain con we talked of ireland and the service and some french cousins we have ladies caroline inquired by instinct and charming said patrick real dear girls philip might have one if he would and half my property to make it right with her parents thered be little use in proposing it he was dead struck when the shaft struck him thats love so i determined the night after id shaken his hand id be off to earlsfont and try my hardest for him its hopeless now only he might have the miniature for his bride i can tell him a trifle to help him over his agony she would have had him she would miss adister if she hadnt feared hed be talked of as captain con has beenabout the neighbourhood i mean because he patrick added hurriedly he married an heiress and sank his ambition for distinction like a man who has finished his dinner im certain she would i have it on authority what authority said caroline coldly her own old nurse jenny williams the one i had it from her and how she loves her darling miss adiante she wont hear of princess she hates that marriage she was all for my brother philip she calls him our handsome lieutenant shell keep the poor fellow a subaltern all his life you went to jennys inn the earlsfont arms i went to and mrs jenny at the door watching the rain destiny directed me she caught the likeness to philip on a lift of her eye and very soon we sat conversing like old friends we were soon playing at old cronies over past times i saw the way to bring her out so i set to work and she was up in defence of her darling ready to tell me anything to get me to think well of her and that was the main reason she said why miss adiante broke with him and went abroad her dear child wouldnt have mr philip abused for fortunehunting as for the religion they could each have practised their own her father would have consented to the fact when it came on him in that undeniable shape of two made one she says miss adiante has a mighty soul she has brave ideas miss deenly she calls her ay and so has philip though the worst is theyre likely to drive him out of the army into politics and parliament and an irishman there is a barrow trolling a load of grievances ah but she would have kept him straight not a soldier alive knows the use of cavalry better than my brother he wanted just that english wife to steady him and pour drops of universal fire into him to keep him face to face with the world i mean letting him be true to his country in a fair degree but not an old rainpipe and spout she would have held him to his profession and oh dear shes a friend worth having lost to ireland i see what she could have done there something bigger than an island too has to be served in our days that is if we dont forget our duty at home poor paddy and his pig and his bit of earth if you knew what we feel for him im a landlord but im one with my people about evictions we irish take strong root and honest rent paid over to absentees through an agent if you think of it seems like flinging the money thats the sweat of the brow into a stone conduit to roll away to a giant maw hungry as the sea its the bleeding to death of our land transactions from hand to hand of warm human fleshnothing else will do i mean for men of our blood ah she would have kept my brother temperate in his notions and his plans and why absentees miss adister because weve no centre of home life the core has been taken out of us our country has no hearthfire im for union only there should be justice and a little knowledge to make allowance for the natural cravings of a different kind of people well then and i suppose that intermarriages are good for both but here comes a man the boldest and handsomest of his race and he offers himself to the handsomest and sweetest of yours and she leans to him and the family wont have him for hes an irishman and a catholic who is it then opposed the proper union of the two islands not philip he did his best and if he does worse now hes not entirely to blame the misfortune is that when he learns the total loss of her on that rock promontory hell be dashing himself upon rocks sure to shiver him theres my fear if i might take him this patrick pleaded with the miniature raised like the figure of his interrogation carolines inward smile threw a soft light of humour over her features at the simple cunning of his windup to the lecture on his countrys case which led her to perceive a similar cunning simplicity in his identification of it with philips it startled her to surprise for the reason that shed been reviewing his freakish hops from philip to ireland and to adiante and wondering in a different kind of surprise how and by what profitless ingenuity he contrived to weave them together nor was she unmoved notwithstanding her fancied perception of his jesuitry his look and his voice were persuasive his love of his brother was deep his change of sentiment toward adiante after the tale told him by her old nurse jenny stood for proof of a generous manliness before she had replied her uncle entered the armoury and patrick was pleading still and she felt herself to be a piece of damask a very fiery dye to disentangle herself she said on an impulse desperately mr odonnell begs to have the miniature for his brother patrick swung instantly to mr adister i presumed to ask for it sir to carry it to philip he is ignorant about the princess as yet he would like to have a bit of the wreck i shant be a pleasant messenger to him i should be glad to take him something it could be returned after a time she was a great deal to philipthree parts of his life he has nothing of her to call his own that said mr adister he turned to the virgin adiante sat down and shut his eyes fetching a breath he looked vacantly at patrick when you find a man purely destructive you think him a devil dont you he said a good first cousin to one patrick replied watchful for a hint to seize the connection if you think of hunting today we have not many minutes to spare before we mount the meet is at eleven five miles distant go and choose your horse caroline will drive there patrick consulted her on a glance for counsel i shall be glad to join you sir for tomorrow i must be off to my brother take it mr adister waved his hand hastily he gazed at his idol of untouched eighteen keep it safe he said discarding the sight of the princess old houses are doomed to burnings and a devil in the family may bring us to ashes and some day he could not continue his thought upon what he might be destined to wish for and ran it on to some day i shall be happy to welcome your brother when it pleases him to visit me patrick bowed oppressed by the mighty gift i havent the word to thank you with sir mr adister did not wait for it i owe this to you miss adister said patrick her voice shook my uncle loves those who loved her he could see she was trembling when he was alone his ardour of gratefulness enabled him to see into her uncles breast the inflexible frigidity lasting regrets and remorse the compassion for philip in kinship of grief and loss the angry dignity the stately generosity he saw too for he was cleareyed when his feelings were not overactive the narrow pedestal whereon the stiff figure of a man of iron pride must accommodate itself to stand in despite of tempests without and within and how the statue rocks there how much more pitiably than the common sons of earth who have the broad common field to fall down on and our good mothers milk to set them on their legs again chapter viii captain con and mrs adister odonnell riding homeward from the hunt at the leisurely trot of men who have steamed their mounts pretty well mr adister questioned patrick familiarly about his family and his estate and his brothers prospects in the army and whither he intended first to direct his travels questions which patrick understood to be kindly put for the sake of promoting conversation with a companion of unripe age by a gentleman who had wholesomely excited his blood to run they were answered except the last one patrick had no immediate destination in view leave europe behind you said mr adister warming to advise him and checking the trot of his horse try south america the lordly gentleman plotted out a scheme of colonisation and conquest in that region with the coolness of a practised freebooter no young man is worth a job he said who does not mean to be a leader and as leader to have dominion here we are fettered by ancestry and antecedents had i to recommence without those encumbrances i would try my fortune yonder i stood condemned to waste my youth in idle parades and hunting the bear and buffalo the estate you have inherited is not binding on you you can realise it and begin by taking over two or three hundred picked irish and englishhave both races capable of handling spade and musket purchasing some thousands of acres to establish a legal footing there you increase your colony from the mother country in the ratio of your prosperity until your power is respected and there is a necessity for the extension of your territory when you are feared you will be on your mettle they will favour you with provocation i should not doubt the result supposing myself to have under my sole command a trained body of men of english bloodand irish owners of the soil rejoined patrick much marvelling undoubtedly owners of the soil but owing you service they fight sir it is hardly to be specified in the calculation knowing them soldiery who have served their term particularly old artillerymen would be my choice young fellows and boys among them women would have to be taken halfbreeds are the ruin of colonists our men are born for conquest we were conquerors here and it is want of action and going physically forward that makes us a rusty people there aremr adisters intonation told of his proposing a wretched alternativethe pacific islands but they will soon be snapped up by the european and north american governments and a single one of them does not offer space it would require money and a navy he mused south america is the quarter i should decide for as a young man you are a judge of horses you ride well you would have splendid pastures over there you might raise a famous breed the air is fine it would suit our english stock we are on ground mr odonnell which my forefathers contested sharply and did not yield the owners of the soil had to do that said patrick i can show the same in my country with a difference considerably to your benefit everything has been crushed there barring the contrary opinion i could expect such a remark from a rebel im only interpreting the people sir jump out of that tinderbox as soon as you can when i was in south america it astonished me that no englishman had cast an eye on so inviting a land australia is not comparable with it and where colonisations have begun without system and without hard fighting to teach the settlers to value good leadership and respect their chiefs they tumble into republics patrick would have liked to fling a word in about the englishmans cast of his eye upon inviting lands but the trot was resumed the lord of earlsfont having delivered his mind and a minute made it happily too late for the sarcastic bolt glad that his tongue had been kept from wagging he trotted along beside his host in the dusky evening over the once contested land where the gentlemans forefathers had done their deeds and firmly fixed their descendants a remainder of dull red fire prolonged the halfday above the mountain strongholds of the former owners of the soil upon which prince and bard and priest and grappling natives never wanting for fierceness roared toarms in the beaconflames from ridge to peak and down they poured and back they were pushed by the inveterate coloniserstationing at threatened points his old artillerymen of those days and so it ends that bard and priest and prince holy poetry and divine prescription and a righteous holding are as naught against him they go like yonder embers of the winter sunset before advancing night and to morrow the beaconheaps are ashes the conquerors foot stamps on them the wind scatters them strangest of all you hear victorious lawlessness appealing solemnly to god the law patrick was too young to philosophise upon his ideas or else the series of pictures projected by the troops of sensations running through him were not of a solidity to support any structure of philosophy he reverted though rather in name than in spirit to the abstractions justice consistency right they were too hard to think of so he abandoned the puzzle of fitting them to mens acts and their consciences and he put them aside as mere titles employed for the uses of a police and a tribunal to lend an appearance of legitimacy to the decrees of them that have got the upper hand an insurrectionary rising of his breast on behalf of his country was the consequence he kept it down by turning the whole hubbub within him to the practical contemplation of a visionary south america as the region for him and a fighting tenantry with a woman to crown her queen there the prospect was fair but where dwelt the woman possessing majesty suitable to such a dream in her heart or her head the best he had known in ireland and in france preferred the charms of society to bold adventure all the same thought he its queer counsel that we should set to work by buying a bit of land to win a clean footing to rob our neighbours and his brains took another shot at mr adister this time without penetrating he could very well have seen the matter he disliked in a man that he disliked but the father of adiante had touched him with the gift of the miniature patrick was not asked to postpone his departure from earlsfont nor was he invited to come again mr adister drove him to the station in the early morning and gave him a single nod from the phaetonbox for a good bye had not caroline assured him at the leavetaking between them that he had done her uncle great good by his visit the blank of the usual ceremonial phrases would have caused him to fancy himself an intruder courteously dismissed never more to enter the grand old hall he was further comforted by hearing the stationmasters exclamation of astonishment and pleasure at the sight of the squire in his place handling the reins which had not been witnessed for many a day and so it appeared that the recent guest had been exceptionally complimented but why not a warm word instead of turning me off to decipher a bit of egyptian on baked brick he thought incurably celtic as he was from the moment when he beheld mr adisters phaeton mounting a hill that took the first leap for the cambrian highlands up to his arrival in london scarcely one of his ideas darted out before patrick as they were in the habit of doing like the enchanted bares of fairyland tempting him to pursue and changing into the form of woman ever at some turn of the chase for as he had travelled down to earlsfont in the state of ignorance and hopefulness bearing the liquid brains of that young condition so did his acquisition of a particular fact destructive of hope solidify them about it as he travelled back in other words they were digesting what they had taken in imagination would not have stirred for a thousand fleeting hares and principally it may be because he was conscious that no form of woman would anywhere come of them woman was married she had the ring on her finger he could at his option look on her in the miniature he could think of her as being in the city where she had been painted but he could not conjure her out of space she was nowhere in the ambient air secretly she was a feeling that lay half slumbering very deep down within him and he kept the secret choosing to be poor rather than call her forth he was in truth digesting with difficulty as must be the case when it is allotted to the brains to absorb what the soul abhors poor old philip was his perpetual refrain philip the girl you loved is married and heres her portrait taken in her last blush and the man who has her hasnt a share in that thus throwing in the ghost of a sigh for sympathy it seemed to patrick that the intelligence would have to be communicated bang is better thought he for bad news than snapping fire and feinting when youre bound half to kill a fellow and a manly fellow determined that bang it should be he hurried from the terminus to philips hotel where he had left him and was thence despatched to the house of captain con odonnell where he created a joyful confusion slightly dashed with rigour on the part of the regnant lady which is not to be wondered at considering that both the gentlemen attending her philip and her husband quitted her table with shouts at the announcement of his name and her husband hauled him in unwashed before her crying that the lost was found the errant returned the prodigal pat recovered by his kinsman and she had to submit to the introduction of the disturber and a bedchamber had to be thought of for the unexpected guest and the dinner to be delayed in middle course and her husband corrected between the discussions concerning the bedchamber and either the guest permitted to appear at her table in sooty daygarb or else a great gap commanded in the service of her dishes vexatious extreme for a lady composed of orderliness she acknowledged patricks profound salute and his excuses with just so many degrees in the inclining of her head as the polite deem a duty to themselves when the ruffling world has disarranged them con she called to her chattering husband we are in england if you please to be sure madam said the captain and so s patrick thanks to the stars we fancied him gone kidnapped burned made a meal of and swallowed up under the earth or the water for he forgot to give us his address in town he stood before us for an hour or so and then the fellow vanished weve waited for him gaping with your permission ill venture an opinion that hell go and dabble his hands and sit with us as he is for the once as it happens let it be so she rejoined not pacified beneath her dignity she named the bedchamber to a footman and ill accompany the boy to hurry him on said the captain hurrying patrick on as he spoke till he had him out of the diningroom when he whispered out with your key and if we can scramble you into your eveningsuit quick we shall heal the breach in the dinner you dip your hands and face ill have out the dress youve the right style for her my boy and mind she is an excellent good woman worthy of all respect but formalitys the flattery she likes a good bow and short speech here we are and the rooms lighted off to the basin give me the key and heres hot water in tripping marys hands the portmanteau opens easy quick the doors shut on rosy mary the race is for domestic peace my boy i sacrifice everything i can for it in decency tis the secret of my happiness patricks transformation was rapid enough to satisfy the impatient captain who said youll tell her you couldnt sit down in her presence undressed i married her at forty you know when a woman has reached her perfect development and leans a trifle more to ceremonies than to substance and where have you been the while ill tell you by and by said patrick tell me now and dont be smirking at the glass your neckties as neat as a ladys companysmile equal at both ends and warranted not to relax before the evening s over and mind you dont set me off talking over much downstairs i talk in her presence like the usher of the court to the judge tis the secret of my happiness where are those rascally dressboots of mine cried patrick captain con pitched the contents of the portmanteau right and left never mind the boots my boy your legs will be under the table during dinner and well institute a rummage up here between that and the procession to the drawingroom where youll be examined head to foot devil a doubt of it but say where have you been shell be asking and were in a mess already and may as well have a place to name to her somewhere to excuse the gash youve made in her dinner here they are both of m rolled in a dirty shirt patrick seized the boots and tugged them on saying earlsfont then youve been visiting earlsfont whack but thats the saving of us talk to her of her brother he sends her his love talk to her of the ancestral hallit stands as it was on the day of its foundation just wait about five minutes to let her punish us before you out with it twill come best from you what did you go down there for but dont stand answering questions come along dont heed her countenance at the going in weve got the talisman as to the dressing its a perfect trick of harlequinade and shell own it after a dose of earlsfont and by the way shes not mrs con remember shes mrs adister odonnell and thats best rolled out to mistress shes a worthy woman but she was married at forty and i had to take her shaped as she was for moulding her at all was out of the question and the soft parts of me had to be the sufferers to effect a conjunction for where one wont and cant poor t other must or the unions a mockery she was cast in bronze at her birth if she wasnt cut in bogroot anyhow youll study her consider her for my sake madam it should bemadam call her addressing her madam she hasnt a taste for jokes and she chastises absurdities and englands the foremost country of the globe indirect communication with heaven and only to be connected with such a country by the tail of it is a special distinction and a comfort for us were that part of the kitebut patrick shes a charitable soul shes a virtuous woman and an affectionate wife and doesnt frown to see me turn off to my place of worship while she drummajors it away to her own she entertains father boyle heartily like the good woman she is to good men and unfortunate females too have a friend in her a real friendthat they have and that s a wonder in a woman chaste as ice i do respect her and id like to see the man to favour me with an opportunity of proving it on him so youll not forget my boy and prepare for a cold bath the first five minutes out with earlsfont early after that all these things are trifles to an unmarried man i have to attend to m i have to be politic and give her elbowroom for her natural angles tis the secret of my happiness priming his kinsman thus up to the door of the diningroom captain con thrust him in mistress adister odonnells head rounded as by slow attraction to the clock her disciplined husband signified an equal mixture of contrition and astonishment at the passing of time he fell to work upon his plate in obedience to the immediate policy dictated to him the unbending english lady contrasted with her husband so signally that the oddly united couple appeared yoked in a common harness for a perpetual display of the opposition of the races she resembled her brother the lord of earlsfont in her remarkable height and her calm air of authority and selfsustainment from beneath a headdress built of white curls and costly lace half enclosing her high narrow forehead a pale thin straight bridge of nose descended prominently over her sunken cheeks to thin locked lips her aspect suggested the repose of a winter landscape enjoyable in pictures or on skates otherwise nipping mental directness of no greater breadth than her principal feature was the character it expressed and candour of spirit shone through the transparency she was if that mild taper could be said to shine in proof of a vitality rarely notified to the outer world by the opening of her mouth chiefly then though not malevolently to command as the portal of some snowbound monastery opens to the outcast bidding it be known that the light across the wolds was not deceptive and a glimmer of light subsists among the silent within the life sufficed to her she was like a marble effigy seated upright requiring but to be laid at her length for transport to the cover of the tomb now captain con was by nature ruddy as an indian summer flushed in all its leaves the corners of his face had everywhere a frank ambush or childs hidingplace for languages and laughter he could worm with a smile quite his own the humour out of men possessing any and even under rigorous law and it could not be disputed that there was rigour in the beneficent laws imposed upon him by his wife his genius for humour and passion for sly independence came up and curled away like the smoke of the illicit still wherein the fanciful discern fine sprites indulging in luxurious grimaces at a government longnosed to no purpose perhaps as patrick said of him to caroline adister he was a bard without a theme he certainly was a man of speech and the having fearfully to contain himself for the greater number of the hours of the day for the preservation of the domestic felicity he had learnt to value fathered the sentiment of revolt in his bosom by this time long after five minutes had elapsed the frost presiding at the table was fast withering captain con and he was irritable to hear why patrick had gone off to earlsfont and what he had done there and the adventures he had tasted on the road anything for warmth his efforts to fish the word out of patrick produced deeper crevasses in the conversation and he cried to himself hats and crapebands mightily struck by an idea that he and his cousins were a party of hired mourners over the meat they consumed patrick was endeavouring to spare his brother a mention of earlsfont before they had private talk together he answered neither to a dip of the hook nor to a pull the desert where you ve come from s good said the captain sharply nodding mrs adister odonnell ejaculated wine for a heavy comment upon one of his topics and crushed it philip saw that patrick had no desire to spread and did not trouble him good horses in the stable too said the captain patrick addressed mrs adister i have hardly excused myself to you madam her head was aloft in dumb apostrophe of wearifulness over another of her husbands topics do not excuse yourself at all she said the captain shivered he overhauled his plotting soul publicly why dont you out with it yourself and it was wonderful why he had not done so save that he was prone to petty conspiracy and had thought reasonably that the revelation would be damp gunpowder coming from him and for when he added the boys fresh from earlsfont he went down to look at the brav old house of the adisters and was nobly welcomed and entertained and made a vast impression his wife sedately remarked to patrick you have seen my brother edward and brings a message of his love to you my dear the captain bit his nail harder you have a message for me she asked and patrick replied the captain is giving a free translation i was down there and i took the liberty of calling on mr adister and i had a very kind reception we hunted we had a good day with the hounds i think i remember hearing that you go there at christmas madam our last christmas at earlsfont was a sad meeting for the family my brother edward is well i had the happiness to be told that i had been of a little service in cheering him i can believe it said mrs adister letting her eyes dwell on the young man and he was moved by the silvery tremulousness of her voice she resumed you have the art of dressing in a surprisingly short time there exclaimed captain con for no man can hear the words which prove him a prophet without showing excitement didnt i say so patricks a hero for love or war my dear he stood neat and trim from the silk socks to the sprig of necktie in six minutes by my watch and thats witness to me that you may count on him for what the great napoleon called twooclockinthemorning courage not too common even in his immortal armywhen its pitch black and frosty cold and youre buried within in a dream of home and the trumpet springs you to your legs in a trice boots and trowsers coat and swordbelt and shako and one twirl to the whiskers and away before a second snap of the fingers to where the great big bursting end of all things for you lies crouching like a javatigera ferocious beast painted undertakers colourfor a leap at you in particular out of the darknever waiting an instant to ask whats the matter and pretend you dont know thats rare philip thats bravery napoleon knew the thing and patrick has it my hands on the boys back for that the captain was permitted to discourse as he pleased his wife was wholly given to the recent visitor to earlsfont whom she informed that caroline was the youngest daughter of general adister her second brother and an excellent maiden her dear edwards mainstay in his grief at last she rose and was escorted to the door by all present but captain con rather shamefacedly explained to patrick that it was a sham departure they had to follow without a single spin to the claretjug he closed the door merely to state his position how at halfpast ten he would be a free man according to the convention to which his wife honourably adhered so he had to do likewise as regarded his share of it thereupon he apologised to the brothers bitterly regretting that with good wine in the cellar his could be no house for claret and promising them they should sit in their shirts and stretch their legs and toast the old country and open their hearts no later than the minute pointing to the time for his deliverance mrs adister accepted her husbands proffered arm unhesitatingly at the appointed stroke of the clock she said yes in agreement with him as if she had never heard him previously enunciate the formula upon his pious vociferation that there should be no trifling with her hours of rest you can find your way to my cabin he said to philip over his shoulder full of solicitude for the steps of the admirable lady now positively departing as soon as the brothers were alone philip laid his hand on patrick asking him what does it mean patrick fired his cannonshot shes married consulting his feelings immediately after he hated himself for his bluntness philip tossed his head but why did you go down there i went said patrick well i went i thought you looked wretched and i went with an idea of learning where she was and seeing if i couldnt do something its too late now alls over my dear boy ive worse than that to think of you dont mind it thats old news patrick you dont care for her any more philip you wouldnt have me caring for a married woman she has a perfect beast for a husband im sorry she didnt make a better choice hes a prince so i hear ah and what worse philip can you be having to think of affairs philip replied and made his way to the cabin of captain con followed in wonderment by patrick who would hardly have been his dupe to suppose him indifferent and his love of adiante dead had not the thought flashed on him a prospect of retaining the miniature for his own or for long in his custody chapter ix the captains cabin patrick left his brother at the second flight of stairs to run and fling on a shootingjacket into which he stuffed his treasure after one peep that eclipsed his little dream of being allowed to keep it and so he saw through philip the captains cabin was the crown of his housetop a builders addition to the roof where the detestable deeds he revelled in calling them liberty could be practised according to the convention and no one save rosy mary in her sense of smell when she came upon her morning business to clean and sweep be any the wiser of them because as it is known to the whole world smoke ascends and he was up among the chimneys here he would say to his friends and fellowsinners you can unfold unbosom explode do all you like except caper and there s a small square of lead between the tiles outside for that if the spirit of the jig comes upon you with violence as i have had it on me and eased myself mightily there to my own music and the capital of the british empire below me here we take our indemnity for subjection to the tyrannical female ear and talk like copious rivers meandering at their own sweet will here we roll like dogs in carrion and no one to sniff at our coats here we sing treason here we flout reason night is out season at halfpast ten this introductory ode to freedom was his throwing off of steam the foretaste of what he contained he rejoined his cousins chirping variations on it and attired in a green silken suit of airy ottoman volume full of incitement to the legs and arms to swing and set him up for a sultan now phil now pat he cried after tenderly pulling the door to and making sure it was shut any tale youve a mind for infamous and audacious youre licensed by the gods up here and may laugh at them too and their mothers and grandmothers if the fit seizes ye and the heartier it is the greater the exemption were pots that knock the lid and must pour out or boil over and destroy the furniture my praties are ready for peelin if ever they were in this world chuck wigs from sconces and off with your buckram decencys a dirty petticoat in the garden of innocence naked we stand boys were not afraid of nature youre in the annexe of erin pat and devil a constable at the keyhole no rats ill say that for the government though its a despotism with an iron bridle on the tongue outside to a foot of the door arctic to freeze the boldest bud of liberty id like a french chanson from ye pat to put us in tune with a right revolutionary hurling chorus that pitches kings heads into the basket like autumn apples or one of your hymns in gaelic sung ferociously to sound as horrid to the saxon the wretch his reign s not for ever he cant enter here youre in the stronghold defying him and now cigars boys pipes there are the boxes there are the bowls i cant smoke till i have done steaming ill sit awhile silently for the operation christendom hasnt such a man as your cousin con for feeling himself a pigpossessed all the blessed day acting the part of somebody else till it takes me a quarter of an hour of my enfranchisement and restoration of my natural man to know myself again for the moment im froth scum horrid boiling hissing dew of the agony of transformation i am im that pig disgorging the spirit of wickedness from his poor stomach the captain drooped to represent the state of the selfrelieving victim of the evil one but fearful lest either of his cousins should usurp the chair and thwart his chance of delivering himself he rattled away sympathetically with his posture in melancholy ay were poor creatures pigs and prophets princes and people victors and vanquished we re waves of the sea rolling over and over and calling it life theres no life save the eternal father boyles got the truth flesh is less than grass my sons tis the shadow that crosses the grass i love the grass i could sit and watch grassblades for hours i love an old turf mound where the grey grass nods and seems to know the wind and have a whisper with it of ancient times maybe and most like about the big chief lying underneath in the last must of his bones that a breath of air would scatter they just keep their skeleton shape as they are for the turf mound protects them from troubles tis the nurse to that delicate old infantwaves of the sea did i say were wash in a hog trough for father saturn to devour big chief and suckling babe we all go into it calling it life and what hope have we of reading the mystery all we can see is the straining of the old fellows hams to push his old snout deeper into the gobble and the ridiculous curl of a tail totally devoid of expression youll observe that gluttons have no feature theyre jaws and hindquarters which is the beginning and end of m and so you may say to time for his dealing with us so let it be a lesson to you not to bother your wits but leave the puzzle to the priest he understands it and why because he was told there s harmony in his elocution and theres none in the modern drivel about where were going and what we came out of no wonder they call it an age of despair when you see the big wigs filing up and down the thoroughfares with a great advertisement board on their shoulders proclaiming no information to the multitude but a blank note of interrogation addressed to providence as if an answer from above would be vouchsafed to their impudence they havent the first principles of good manners and some of m in a rage bawl the answer for themselves hear that no phil no pat no devotions good policyyoure not drinking are you both of ye asleep why do ye leave me to drone away like this when it s conversation i want as in the days of our first parents before the figleafand you might have that for scroll and figure on the social banner of the hypocritical saxon whos a gormandising animal behind his decency and nearer to the archdevourer time than anything i can imagine except that with a little exertion you can elude him the whisky youve got between you s virgin of the excise ill pay double for freepeaty any day or are you for claret my lads no im fortified up here to stand a siege in my old round tower like the son of eremon that i am lavra con con speaks at last i dont ask you pat whether you remember maen who was born dumb and had for his tutors ferkelne the bard and crafting the harper at pleasant dinree he was grandson of leary lore who was basely murdered by his brother cova and cova spared the dumb boy thinking a man without a tongue harmless as fools do being one of their savingsbank tricks to be repaid them their heirs executors administrators and assigns at compound interest have no fear so one day maen had an insult put on him and twas this for certain a ruffian fellow of the court swore he couldnt mention the name of his father and in a thundering fury maen burst his tonguetie and the court shouted lavra maen and he had to go into exile where he married in the middle of delicious loveadventures the beautiful moira through the cunning of craftine the harper theres been no harper in my instance but plenty of ruffians to swear im too comfortable to think of my country the captain holloaed do they hear that lord but wouldnt our old celtic fill the world with poetry if only we were a free people to give our minds to t instead of to the itch on our backs from the saxon horsehair shirt were forced to wear for pat as you know were a loving people were a loyal people we burn to be enthusiastic but when our skins are eternally irritated how can we sing in a freer erin id be the bard of the land never doubt it what am i here but a discontented idle lout crooning over the empty glories of our isle of saints you feel them pat phils all for his british army his capabilities of british light cavalry write me the history of the enniskillens ill read it aha my boy when they re off at the charge and youll oblige me with the tale of fontenoy why phil has an opportunity stretching forth a hand to him now more than halfway that comes to a young irishman but once in a century backed by the entire body of the priesthood of ireland too and if only he was a quarter as full of the old country as you and i his hair would stand up in fire for the splendid gallop at our head thats proposed to him his countrys gathered up like a crested billow to roll him into parliament and i say let him be there he s the very man to hurl his gauntlet and tell m parliament so long as you are parliamentary which means the speaking of our minds but if you wont have it thenand it s on your heads before europe and the two americas were dying like a nun that d be out of her cloister were panting like the wife who hears of her husband coming home to her from the field of honour for that young man and there he is or there he seems to be but hes dead and the fisherman off the west coast after dreaming of a magical haul gets more fish than disappointment in comparison with us when we cast the net for philip bring tears of vexation at the emptiness we pull back for our pains oh phil and to think of your youth we had you then at least we had your heart and we should have had the length and strength of you only for a woman fatal to us as the daughter of rhys ap tudor the beautiful nestaand beautiful she was to match the mother of the curses trooping over to ireland under strongbow that ill grant you but she reined you in when you were a real warhorse ramping and snorting flame from your nostrils challenging any other to a race for ireland ay a cuchullin you were philip culanns chainbound but she unmanned you she soaked the woman into you and squeezed the hero out of you all for adiante or a country left to slavery thats the tale and what are you now a paltry captain of hussars on the generals staff one odonnell in a thousand and what is sheyou neednt frown phil im her relative by marriage and she s a lady more than that she shot a dart or two into my breast in those days she did ill own it i had the catch of the breath that warns us of convulsions she was the morning star for beauty between night and day and the best colour of both welshmen and irishmen and englishmen tumbled into the pit which seeing her was and there we jostled for a glimpse quite companionably we were too hungry for quarrelling and to say i was one of m is a title to subsequent friendship true only mark me philip and you patrick they say she has married a prince and i say no shes took to herself a husband in her cradle shes married ambition i tell you and this prince of hers is only a step she has taken and if he chases her first mate from her bosom hell prove himself cleverer than she and i dare him to the trial for shes that fiery dragon a beautiful woman with brainswhich helen of troy hadnt combustible as we know her to have been but brains are bombshells in comparison with your oldfashioned pinebrands for kindling men and cities ambitions the husband of adiante adister and all who come nigh her are steps to her aim she never consulted her father about prince nikolas she had begun her march and she didnt mean to be arrested she simply announced her approaching union and as she couldnt have a scion of one of the royal house of europe she put her foot on prince nikolas and he s not to fancy he s in for a peaceful existence hes a stone in a sling and probably mistaken the rocking thats to launch him through the air for a condition of remarkable ease perfectly remarkable in its lullaby motion ha well and ive not heard of ambition that didnt kill its votary somehow it will tis sure to there she lies the prophetic captain pointed at the spot he then said and now im for my pipe and the blackest clay of the party with your permission ill just go to the window to see if the stars are out overhead theyre my blessed guardian angels there was a pause philip broke from a brown study to glance at his brother patrick made a queer face fun and goodfellowship tonight con said philip as the captain sadly reported no star visible have i ever flown a signal to the contrary retorted the captain no politics and i ll thank you said philip none of your early recollections be jovial you should have seen me here the other night about a month ago i smuggled up an old countrywoman of ours with the connivance of rosy mary said captain con suffused in the merriest of grins she sells apples at a stall at a corner of a street hard by and i saw her sitting pulling at her old pipe in the cold october fog morning and evening for comfort and was overwhelmed with compassion and fraternal sentiment and so i invited her to be at the door of the house at halfpast ten just to have a roll with her in irish mud and mend her torn soul with a stitch or two of rejoicing she told me stories and one was pretty good of a relative of hers or somebodysi should say a century old but she told it with a becoming air of appropriation that made it family history for shes come down in the world and this fellow had a stain of red upon him and wanted cleaning and what says the good father mika you did it in cold blood and says mika not i your riverence i got myself into a passion fore i let loose i believe she smoked this identical pipe she acknowledged the merits of my whisky as poets do hearing fine verses never clapping hands but with the expressiveness of grave absorption thats the way to make good things a part of you she was a treat i got her out and off at midnight rosy mary sneaking her down and the old girl quiet as a mouse for the funs sake the whole intrigue was exquisitely managed you run great risks philip observed i do said the captain he called on the brothers to admire the martial and fumial decorations of his round tower buzzing over the display of implements while patrick examined guns and philip unsheathed swords an ancient clay pipe from the bed of the thames and one from the bed of the boyne were laid side by side and strange to relate the irish pipe and english immediately by the mere fact of their being proximate entered into rivalry they all but leapt upon one another the captain judicially decided the case against the english pipe as a newer pipe of grosser manufacture not so curious by any means this philip held up the reputed irish pipe and scanned as he twirled it on his thumb this was dropped in boyne water by one of williams troopers it is an orange pipe i take it to be of english make if i thought that id stamp my heel on the humbug the neighbour minute said captain con wheres the sign of english marks the pipes resemble one another said philip like tails of shannon bred retrievers maybe they re both irish then the captain caught at analogy to rescue his favourite from reproach both of them are saxon not a bit of it look at the clay i look and i tell you philip its of a piece with your lukewarmness for the country or you wouldnt talk like that there is no record of pipe manufactories in ireland at the period you name there is and the jealousy of rulers caused them to be destroyed by decrees if you want historical evidence your opposition to the saxon would rob him of his pipe con let him go to the deuce with as many pipes as he can carry but he shant have this one not a tossup of difference is to be seen in the pair use your eyes the irish bowl is broken and the english has an inch longer stem o the irish bowl is broken philip sang youve the heart of a renegadeforeigner not to see it cried the captain patrick intervened saying i suspect theyre dutch well and that s possible captain con scrutinised them to calm his temper theres a dutchiness in the shape he offered philip the compromise of dutch rather plaintively but it was not accepted and the pipes would have mingled their fragments on the hearthstone if patrick had not stayed his arm saying dont hurt them and i wont the captain shook his hand gratefully but will philip odonnell tell me that ireland should lie down with england on the terms of a traveller obliged to take a bedfellow come he hasnt an answer put it to him and you pose him but he ll not stir though he admits the antagonism and ireland is asked to lie down with england on a couch blessed by the priest not she wipe out our grievances and then well begin to talk of policy good lordlove the love of ireland for the conquering country will be the celebrated ceremony in the concluding chapter previous to the inauguration of the millennium thousands of us are in a starving state at home this winter patrick and its not the fault of englandlandlordism s not who caused the ruin of all irelands industries you might as well say that it s the fault of the poor beggar to go limping and hungry because his cruel master struck him a blow to cripple him we dont want half and half doctoring and its too late in the day for half and half oratory we want freedom and well have it and we wont leave it to the saxon to think about giving it and if your brother philip wont accept this blazing fine offer then i will and youll behold me in a new attitude the fellow yawns you dont know me yet philip they tell us over here we ought to be satisfied fall upon our list of wrongs and they set to work yawning you can only move them by popping at them over hedges and roaring on platforms theyre incapable of understanding a complaint a yard beyond their noses the englishman has an island mind and when hes out of it hes at sea mad you mean said philip i repeat my words captain philip odonnell late of the staff of the general commanding in canada the irishman too has an island mind and when hes out of it hes at sea and unable to manage his craft said philip youll find more craft in him when hes buffeted than you reckoned on his cousin flung back and if that isnt the speech of a traitor sold to the enemy and now throwing off the mask traitors never did mischief in ireland why what can you discover to admire in these people isnt their army such a combination of colours in the uniforms with their yellow facings on red jackets i never saw out of a dollshop and never saw there and their horse guards weedy to a man fit for a dollshop they are by my faith and their foot guards have ye met the fellows marching with their feet turned out flat as my laundresss irons and the muscles of their calves depending on the joints to get m along for elasticity never gave those bones of theirs a springing touch and their bearskins heeling behind on their polls like pothouse churls daring the dursnt to come on of course they can fight who said no but they re not the only ones and they ll miss their ranks before they can march like our irish lads the look of their men in line is for all the world to us what lacklustre is to the eye the drill they ve had hasnt driven hodge out of them it has only stiffened the dolt and dolt wont do any longer the military machine requires intelligence in all ranks now ay the time for the celt is dawning i see it and i dont often spy a spark where there isnt soon a blaze solidity and stupidity have had their innings a precious long innings it has been and now theyre shoved aside like clods of earth from the risin flower off with our shackles weve only to determine it to be free and well bloom again and ill be the first to speak the word and mount the colours follow me will ye join in the toast to the emblem of erin the shamrock phil and pat oh certainly said philip what s that row going on patrick also called attention to the singular noise in the room i fancy the time for the celt is not dawning but setting said philip with a sharp smile and patrick wore an artful look a corner of the room was guilty of the incessant alarum captain con gazed in that direction incredulously and with remonstrance the tinkler it is he sighed but it cant be midnight yet watches were examined time stood at halfpast the midnight he groaned i must go i havent heard the tinkler for months it signifies shes cold in her bed the thing called circulations unknown to her save by the aid of outward application and i m the warming pan as legitimately i should be im her husband and her harvey in one goodbye to my hop and skip i ought by rights to have been down beside her at midnight shes the worthiest woman alive and i dont shirk my duty be quiet he bellowed at the alarum i m coming dont be in such a fright my dear he admonished it as his wife politely your handll take an hour to warm if you keep it out on the spring that sets the creature going he turned and informed his company her handll take an hour to warm dear how she runs ahead d ye hear thats the female tongue and once off it wont stop and this contrivance for fetching me from my tower to her bed was my own suggestion in a fit of generosity ireland all over i must hurry and wash my hair for she cant bear a perfume to kill a stink she carries her charitable heart that far goodnight ill be thinking of ye while im warming her sit still i cant wait tis the secret of my happiness he fled patrick struck his knee on hearing the expected balladburden recur chapter x the brothers con has learnt one secret said philip quitting his chair patrick went up to him and give us a hug he said and the hug was given they were of an equal height tall young men alert nervously braced from head to foot with the differences between soldier and civilian marked by the succintly military bearing of the elder brother whose movements were precise and prompt and whose frame was leopardlike in indolence beside him patrick seemed cubbish though beside another he would not have appeared so his features were not so brilliantly regular but were a fanciful sketch of the same design showing a wider pattern of the long square head and the forehead a wavering at the dip of the nose livelier nostrils the nostrils dilated and contracted and were exceeding alive his eyelids had to do with the look of his eyes and were often seen cutting the ball philips eyes were large on the pent of his brows open liquid and quick with the fire in him eyes of that quality are the visible mind animated both to speak it and to render it what comes within their scope they were full unshaded direct the man himself in action patricks mouth had to be studied for an additional index to the character to symbolise them they were as a swordblade lying beside book men would have thought patrick the slippery one of the two women would have inclined to confide in him the more thoroughly they bring feeling to the test and do not so much read a print as read the imprinting on themselves and the report that a certain one of us is true as steel must be unanimous at a propitious hour to assure them completely that the steel is not twoedged in the fully formed nature of a man whom they have not tried they are more at home with the unformed which lends itself to feeling and imagination besides patrick came nearer to them he showed sensibility they have it and they deem it auspicious of goodness or of the gentleness acceptable as an equivalent not the less was philip the one to inspire the deeper and the wilder passion so youve been down there said philip tell us of your welcome never mind why you went i think i see youre the patrick of fourteen who tramped across connaught for young dermot to have a sight of you before he died poor lad how did mr adister receive you patrick described the first interview philip mused over it yes those are some of his ideas gentlemen are to excel in the knightly exercises he used to fence excellently and he was a good horseman the jesuit seminary would have been hard for him to swallow once the house is a fine old house lonely i suppose patrick spoke of caroline adister and pursued his narrative philip was lost in thought at the conclusion relating to south america he raised his head and said not so foolish as it struck you patrick you and i might do thatwithout the design upon the original owner of the soil irishmen are better out of europe unless they enter one of the continental services what is it con odonnell proposes to you patrick asked him earnestly to be a speaking trumpet in parliament and to put it first among the objections i havent an independence not above two hundred a year ill make it a thousand said patrick that is if my people can pay secondly i dont want to give up my profession thirdly fourthly fifthly once there i should be boiling with the rest i never could go half way this idea of a commencement gives me a view of the finish would you care to try it if im no wiser after two or three years of the world i mean to make a better acquaintance with patrick replied over there at home one catches the fever you know they have my feelings and part of my judgement and whether thats the weaker part i cant at present decide my taste is for quiet farming and breeding friendship as far as possible union if the terms are fair said philip its only the name of union now supposing it a concession that is asked of them say sacrifice it might be made for the sake of what our people would do to strengthen the nation but they wont try to understand our people their laws and their rules their systems are forced on a race of an opposite temper who would get on well enough and thrive if they were properly consulted ireland s the sore place of england and im sorry for it we ought to be a solid square with europe in this pickle so i say sitting here what should i be saying in parliament is con at all likely do you think philip he might and become the burlesque irishman of the house there must be one and the lot would be safe to fall on him isnt he serious about it quite i fancy and that will be the fun a serious fellow talking nonsense with lively illustrations is just the man for house of commons clown your humorous rogue is not half so taking con would be the porpoise in a fish tank there inscrutably busy on his errand and watched for his tumblings better i than he and i should make a worse of itat least for myself wouldnt the secret of his happiness interfere if he has the secret inside his common sense the bulk of it i suspect to be that he enjoys his luxuries and is ashamed of his laziness and so the secret pulls both ways one day a fit of pride may have him or one of his warm impulses and if hes taken in the tide of it i shall grieve for the secret you like his wife philip i respect her they came togetheri suppose because they were near together like the two islands in spite of the rolling waves between i would not willingly see the union disturbed he warms her and she houses him and he has to control the hot blood that does the warming and she to moderate the severity of her principles which are an essential part of the housing oh shiver politics patrice i wish i had been bred in france a couple of years with your pere clement and i could have met irishmen and felt to them as an irishman whether they were disaffected or not i wish i did when i landed the other day i thought myself passably cured and could have said that rhetoric is the firewater of our country and claptrap the springboard to send us diving into it i like my comradesinarms i like the character of british officers and the men tooi get on well with them i declare to you patrice i burn to live in brotherhood with them not a rift of division at heart i never show them that there is one but our early training has us it comes on us again three or four days with con have stirred me i dont let him see it but they always do these tales of starvations and shootings all the old work just as when i left act on me like a smell of powder i was dipped in ireland for the irish and a contented irishman scarcely seems my countryman i suppose it s like what i hear of as digesting with difficulty patrick referred to the state described by his brother and not the most agreeable of food philip added it would be the secret of our happiness to discover how to make the best of it if we had to pay penance for the discovery by living in an esquimaux shanty said patrick with a frozen fish of admirable principles for wife said philip ah you give me shudders and its her guest who talks of her in that style and i hope to be thought a gentleman philip pulled himself up we may be all in the wrong the way to begin to think so is to do them an injury and forget it the sensations not unpleasant when its other than a question of good taste but politics to bed patrice my chief is rightsoldiers have nothing to do with them what are you fiddling at in your coat there something for you my dear philip patrick brought out the miniature he held it for his brother to look it was the only thing i could get mr adister sends it the young lady miss caroline seconded me they think more of the big portrait i dont and it s to be kept carefully in case of the other one getting damaged thats only fair philip drank in the face upon a swift shot of his eyes mr adister sends it his tone implied wonder at such a change in adiantes father and an invitation to you to visit him when you please that he might do said philip it was a lesser thing than to send her likeness to him patrick could not help dropping his voice isnt it very like for answer the miniature had to be inspected closely philip was a spartan for keeping his feelings under yes he said after an interval quick with fiery touches on the history of that face and his life older of course they are the features of course the likeness is not bad i suppose it resembles her as she is now or was when it was painted you re an odd fellow to have asked for it i thought you would wish to have it philip youre a good boy patrice light those candles well go to bed i want a cool head for such brains as i have and bumping the pillow all night is not exactly wholesome well cross the channel in a few days and see the nest and the mother and the girls not st georges channel mother would rather you would go to france and visit the de reuils she and the girls hope you will keep out of ireland for a time its hot judge if theyre anxious when its to stop them from seeing you philip goodnight dear boy philip checked the departing patrick you can leave that he made a sign for the miniature to be left on the table patrick laid it there his brother had not touched it and he could have defended himself for having forgotten to leave it on the plea that it might prevent his brother from having his proper share of sleep and also that philip had no great pleasure in the possession of it the two pleas however did not make one harmonious apology and he went straight to the door in an odd silence with the step of a decorous officeclerk keeping his shoulders turned on philip to conceal his look of destitution chapter xi introducing a new character letters and telegrams and morning journals lay on the breakfasttable awaiting the members of the household with combustible matter bad news from ireland came upon ominous news from india philip had ten words of mandate from his commanding officer and they signified action uncertain where he was the soldier at once buckled tight and buttoned up over his private sentiments vienna shot a line to mrs adister odonnell she communicated itthe princess nikolas has a son captain con tossed his newspaper to the floor crying today the cityll be a chimney on fire with the blacks in everybodys faces but i must go down its hen and chicks with the director of a city company i must go did you say madam patrick inquired a son said mrs adister and the military holloaing for reinforcements exclaimed con pheu phil thats what it comes to was philips answer precautionary measures eh you can make them provocative will you beg for india i shall hear in an hour have we got men always the question with us what a country sighed the captain id compose ye a song of old drowsylid except that it does no good to be singing it at the only time when you can show her the consequences of her sluggery a country of compromise goes to pieces at the first cannonshot of the advance and while shes fighting on its her poor business to be putting herself together again so she makes a mess of the beginning to a certainty if it werent that she had the army of neptune about her the worst is she may some day start awake to discover that her protecting deity s been napping tooa boy or girl did you say my dear his wife replied a son ah more births the captain appeared to be computing but this ones out of england and its a prince i suppose theyll call him and princes dont count in the population for more than finishing touches like the crossing of ts and dotting of is though true theyre the costliest like some flowers and feathers and they add to the lump on barneys back but who has any compassion for a burdened donkey unless when you see him standing immortal meek well and a child of some sort must have been expected because its no miracle after marriage worse luck for the crowded earth things may not be expected which are profoundly distasteful mrs adister remarked true said her sympathetic husband tis like reading the list of the dead after a battle where youve not had the best of iteach name s a startling new blow id offer to run to earlsfont but heres my company you would have me join for the directoring of it you know my dear to ballast me as you pretty clearly hinted and all s in the city today like a loaf with bad yeast thick as lead and sour to boot and a howl and growl coming off the wilds of old ireland were smitten today in our hearts and our pockets and it s a question where we ought to feel it most for the sake of our families do you not observe that your cousins are not eating said his wife adding to patrick i entertain the opinion that a sound breakfast appetite testifies to the proper vigour of men better than a doctors pass and to their habits likewise captain con winked at his guests begging them to steal ten minutes out of the fray for the inward fortification of them eggs in the shell and masses of eggs bacon delicately thin and curling like apollos locks at his temples and cutlets caviar anchovies in the state of oil were pressed with the captains fervid illustrations upon the brothers both meditatively nibbling toast and indifferent to the similes he drew and applied to life from the little fish which had their sharpness corrected but not cancelled by the improved liquid they swam in like an irishman in clover he said to his wife to pay her a compliment and coax an acknowledgement just the flavour of the salt of him her mind was on her brother edward and she could not look sweetoily as her husband wooed her to do with impulse to act the thing he was imagining and there is tomorrows dinnerparty to the mattocks i cannot travel to earlsfont she said patrick is a disengaged young verderer and knows the route and has a welcome face there and he might go if youre for having it performed by word of mouth but trust me my dear bad news is best communicated by telegraph which gives us no stupid articles and particles to quarrel with boy born vienna doctor smiling nurse laughing that tells it all straight to the understanding without any sickly circumlocutory stuff and theres nothing more offensive to us when were hurt at intelligence for the same reason colonel arthur couldnt go since youll want him to meet the mattocks captain cons underlip shone with a roguish thinness arthur must be here said mrs adister i cannot bring myself to write it i disapprove of telegrams she was asking to be assisted so her husband said take patrick for a secretary dictate he has a bold free hand andll supply all the fiorituri and arabesques necessary to the occasion running she gazed at patrick as if to intimate that he might be enlisted and said it will be to caroline she will break it to her uncle right madam on the part of a lady i ve never known to be wrong and so my dear i must take leave of you to hurry down to the tormented intestines of that poor racked city where the winds of panic are violently engaged in occupying the vacuum created by knocking over what the disaster left standing and it ll much resemble a colliery accident there i suspect and a rescue of dead bodies adieu my dear he pressed his lips on her thin fingers patrick placed himself at mrs adisters disposal as her secretary she nodded a gracious acceptance of him i recommended the telegraph because its my wifes own style and comes better from wires said the captain as they were putting on their overcoats in the hall you must know the family deeds not words would serve for their motto she hates writing and doesnt much love talking pat ll lengthen her sentences for her shes fond of adiante and she sympathises with her brother edward made a grandfather through the instrumentality of that foreign hooknose and patrick must turn the two dagger sentiments to a sort of loveknot and theres the task hell have to work out in his letter to miss caroline its fun about colonel arthur not going hes to meet the burning miss mattock who has gold on her crown and a lot on her treasury phil my boy but im bound in honour not to propose it and a nice girl a prize afresh healthy girl and brains the very girl but shes jotted down for the adisters if colonel arthur can look lower than his nose and wag his tongue a bit shes one to be a mother of stout ones that wont run up big doctors bills or ask assistance in growing her names plain jane and she s a girl to breed conquerors and the same you may say of her brother john who s a mighty fit man good at most things though he counts his fortune in millions which ive heard is lighter for a beggar to perform than in pounds but he can count seven and beat any of us easy by showing them millions we might do something for them at home with a million or two phil it all came from the wedding of a railway contractor who sprang from the wedding of a spade and a clodand probably called himself mattock at his birth no shame to him youre for the city said philip after they had walked down the street not i said con let them play vesuvius down there ive got another in me and i cant stop their eruption and they wouldnt relish mine i know a little of dick martin who called on the people to resist and housed the man liffey after his firing the shot and im off to peter mchristy his brotherinlaw ill see distell too i must know if it signifies the trigger or im agitated about nothing dr forberyll be able to tell how far they mean going for a patriotic song for we march in ranks to the laurelled banks on the bright horizon shining though the fields between run red on the green and many a wife goes pining will you come phil i m under orders you wont engage yourself by coming im in for the pull if i join hands and why notinside the law of course while your barney skirmishes outside and when the poor fellows craniums cracking to fling his cap in the air and physician and politician are agreed its good for him to do it or hell go mad and be a dangerous lunatic phil it must be a blow now and then for these people over here else theres no teaching their imaginations youre in earnest for theyve got heads that open only to hard raps these english and where injustice rules and youd spread a light of justice a certain lot of us must give up the ghostnaturally on both sides laws law and lifes life so long as you admit that the law is bad and in that case its big misery and chronic disease to let it be and at worst a jump and tumble into the next world of a score or two of us if we have a wrestle with him but shake the old villain hang on him and shake him bother his wig if he calls himself law that s how we dust the corruption out of him for a bite or two in return such is humanity phil and you must allow for the roundabout way of moving to get into the straight road at last and i see what youre for saying a roundabout eye wont find it youre wrong where there are dozens of corners logic like yours my boy would have you go on picking at the gordian knot till it became a jackasses race between you and the rope which was to fall to pieces lastthere s my old girl at the stall poor soul see her philip had signalled a cabman to stop he stood facing his cousin with a closelipped smile that summarised his opinion and made it readable i have no time for an introduction to her this morning he said you wont drop in on distell to hear the latest brewing and by the by phil tell us could you give us a hint for packing five or six hundred rifles and a couple of pieces of cannon philip stared he bent a lowering frown on his cousin with a twitch at his mouth oh easy con answered the look its for another place and harder to get at he was eyed suspiciously and he vowed the military weapons were for another destination entirely the opposite pole no you wouldnt be in for a crazy villainy like that said philip no nor wink to it said con but its a question about packing cannon and small arms and you might be useful in dropping a hint or two the matters innocent its not even a substitution of one form of government for another only a change of despots i suspect and heres mr john mattock himself wholl corroborate me as far as we can let you into the secret before weve consulted together and hes an englishman and a member of parliament and a liberal though a landlord a thorough stout briton and bulldog for the national integrity not likely to play at arms and ammunition where his countrys prosperity s concerned how d ye do mr mattockand opportunely since its my cousin captain philip odonnell aidedecamp to sir charles fresh from canada of whom youve heard id like to make you acquainted with previous to your meeting at my wifes table tomorrow evening philip bowed to a man whose notion of the ceremony was to nod con took him two steps aside and did all the talking mr mattock listened attentively the first halfminute after which it could be perceived that the orator was besieging a post or in other words a saxons mind made up on a point of common sense his appearance was redolently marine his pilot coat flying necktie and wideish trowsers a general airiness of style on a solid frame spoke of the element his blue eyes had dipped their fancy in from hereditary inclination the colour of a sandpit was given him by hair and whiskers of yellowred on a ruddy face no one could express a negative more emphatically without wording it though he neither frowned nor gesticulated to that effect ah said con abruptly coming to an end after an eloquent appeal and i think im of your opinion and the sea no longer dashes at the rock but makes itself a mirror to the same shell keep her money and nurse her babe and not be trying risky adventures to turn him into a reigning prince only this youll have to persuade her the thing is impossible shell not take it from any of us she looks on you as wisdom in the uniform of a great commander and if you say a thing can be done it s done the reverse too i hope said mr mattock nodding and passing on his way that i am not so sure of con remarked to himself theres a change in a man through a change in his position six months or so back phil that man came from vienna the devoted slave of the princess nikolas hed been there on his fathers business about one of the danube railways and he was ready to fill the place of the prince at the head of his phantom body of horse and foot and elsewhere we talked of his selling her estates for the purchase of arms and the enemyas many as she had money for we discussed it as a matter of business she had bewitched him and would again i dont doubt if she were here to repeat the dose but in the interim his father dies he inherits and he enters parliament and now mind you the man who solemnly calculated her chances and speculates on the transmission of rifled arms of the best manufacture and latest invention by his yacht and with his loads of rails under the noses of the authorities like a master rebel and a chivalrous gentleman to boot pooh poohs the whole affair you saw him grave as an owl the dead contrary of his former self i thought i heard you approve him said philip and i do but the poor girl has ordered her estates to be sold to cast the die and i m taking the view of her disappointment for she believes he can do anything and if i know the witch her sole comfort lying in the straw is the prospect of a bloody venture for a throne the truth is to my thinking its the only thing she has to help her to stomach her husband but its rank idiocy to suppose she can smuggle cannon cried philip but that man mattocks not an idiot and he thought she could and it s proof he was under a spell she can work one the country hasnt a port round the euxine and up the danube with the british flag at the stern i could rather enjoy the adventure and her prince is called for hes promised a good reception when he drops down the river they say a bit of a scrimmage on the landingpier may be and the first field or two and then he sits himself and he waits his turn the people change their sovereigns as rapidly as a london purse two pieces of artillery and two or three hundred men and a trumpet alter the face of the land there sometimes a trumpet blown by impudence does it alone theyre enthusiastic for any new prince hes their weekly journal or monthly magazine let them make acquaintance with adiante adister id not swear she wouldnt lay fast hold of them philip signalled to his driver and
