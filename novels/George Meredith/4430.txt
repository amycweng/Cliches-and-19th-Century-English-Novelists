evan harrington by george meredith book xix second despatch of the countess xx breakneck leap xxi tribulations and tactics of the countess xxii in which the daughters of the great mel have to digest him at dinner xxiii treats of a handkerchief xxiv the countess makes herself felt xxv in which the stream flows muddy and clear chapter xix second despatch of the countess we do not advance very far in this second despatch and it will be found chiefly serviceable for the indications it affords of our generals skill in mining and addiction to that branch of military science for the moment i must beg that a little indulgence be granted to her purely business great haste something has happened an event i know not but events may flow from it a lady is here who has run away from the conjugal abode and lady jocelyn shelters her and is hospitable to another who is more concerned in this ladys sad fate than he should be this may be morals my dear but please do not talk of portugal now a fineish woman with a great deal of hair worn as if her maid had given it one comb straight down and then rolled it up in a hurry round one finger malice would say carrots it is called gold mr forth is in a glass house and is wrong to cast his sneers at perfectly inoffensive people perfectly impossible we can remain at beckley court togetherif not dangerous any means that providence may designate i would employ it will be like exorcising a demon always excuseable i only ask a little more time for stupid evan he might have little bonner now i should not object but her family is not so good now do attend at once obtain a copy of strikes company people you understandprospectuses tell me instantly if the captain evremonde in it is captain lawson evremonde pump strike excuse vulgar words whether he is not lord laxleys halfbrother strike shall be of use to us whether he is not mad captain es address oh when i think of strikebrute and poor beautiful uncomplaining carry and her shoulder but let us indeed most fervently hope that his grace may be balm to it we must not pray for vengeance it is sinful providence will inflict that always know that providence is quite sure to it comforts exceedingly oh that strike were altogether in the past tense no knowing what the duke might doa widower and completely subjugated it makes my bosom bound the man tempts me to the wickedest frenchy ideas there we progress with dear venerable mrs bonner truly piousinterested in your louisa she dreads that my husband will try to convert me to his creed i can but weep and saynever i need not say i have my circle to hear this ridiculous boy harry jocelyn grunt under my nose when he has led me unsuspectingly away from companyharriet dearest he thinks it a sigh but there is no time for laughing my maxim in any house isnever to despise the good opinion of the nonentities they are the majority i think they all look up to me but then of course you must fix that by seducing the stars my diplomatist praises my abilitiessir john loring my stylethe rest follow and i do not withhold my smiles and they are happy and i should be but that for ungrateful evans sake i sacrificed my peace by binding myself to a dreadful sort of halfstory i know i did not quite say it it seems as if sir as ghost were going to haunt me and then i have the most dreadful fears that what i have done has disturbed him in the other world can it be so it is not money or estates we took at all dearest and these excellent young curatesi almost wish it was protestant to speak a word behind a board to them and imbibe comfort for after all it is nothing and a word even from this poor thin mopy mr parsley might be relief to a poor soul in trouble catholics tell you that what you do in a good cause is redeemable if not exactly right and you know the catholic is the oldest religion of the two i would listen to the pope staunch protestant as i am in preference to king henry the eighth though as a woman i bear him no rancour for his wives were fools point blank no man was ever so manageable my diplomatist is getting liker and liker to him every day leaner of course and does not habitually straddle whiskers and morals i mean we must be silent before our prudish sister not a prude we talk diplomacy dearest he complains of the exclusiveness of the port of oporto and would have strict alliance between portugal and england with mutual privileges i wish the alliance and think it better to maintain the exclusiveness very trifling but what is life adieu one word to leave you laughing imagine her situation this stupid miss carrington has offended me she has tried to pump conning who i do not doubt gave her as much truth as i chose she should have in her well but the quandary of the wretched creature she takes conning into her confidencea horrible malady just covered by highneck dress skin and impossible that she can tell her engagedwho isguessmr george up her name is louisa carrington there was a louisa harrington once similarity of names perhaps of course i could not let her come to the house and of course miss c is in a state of wonderment and bad passions i fear i went straight to lady racial my dear there was nothing else for it but to go and speak she is truly a noble womanserves us in every way as she shouldmuch affected by sight of evan and keeps aloof from beckley court the finger of providence is in all adieu but do pray think of miss carrington it was foolish of her to offend me drives and walksthe duke attentive description of him when i embrace you i give amiable sir franks portuguese dishes ah my dear if we had none but men to contend against and only women for our tools but this is asking for the world and nothing less open again she pursues dear carry just come in there are fairies i think where there are dukes where could it have come from could any human being have sent messengers post to london ordered and had it despatched here within this short time you shall not be mystified i do not think i even hinted but the afternoon walk i had with his grace on the first day of his arrival i did shadow it very delicately how much it was to be feared our poor carry could not that she dared not betray her liege lord in an evening dress nothing more upon my veracity and carry has this moment received the most beautiful green box containing two of the most heavenly old lace shawls that you ever beheld we divine it is to hide poor carrys matrimonial blue mark we know nothing will you imagine carry is for not accepting it priority of birth does not imply superior wits dearno allusion to you i have undertaken all arch looks but nothing pointed his grace will understand the exquisite expression of feminine gratitude it is so sweet to deal with true nobility carry has only to look as she always does one sees strike sitting on her her very pliability has rescued her from being utterly squashed long ere this the man makes one vulgar it would have been not the slightest use asking me to be a christian had i wedded strike but think of the fairy presents it has determined me not to be expelled by mr forthquite tell silva he is not forgotten but my dear between us alone men are so selfish that it is too evident they do not care for private conversations to turn upon a ladys husband not to be risked only now and then i hear that the young ladies and the young gentlemen have been out riding a race the poor little bonner girl cannot ride and she says to carry that rose wishes to break our brothers neck the child hardly wishes that but she is feelingless if evan could care for miss bonner he might have b c oh it is not so very long a shot my dear i am on the spot remember old mrs bonner is a most justminded spirit juliana is a cripple and her grandmother wishes to be sure that when she departs to her lord the poor cripple may not be chased from this home of hers rose cannot calculateharry is in disgracethere is really no knowing this is how i have reckoned l extra to rose perhaps l or nothing to h all the rest of readymoneya large sum no use guessingto lady jocelyn and b c to little bonnerit is worth l then she sells or stopspermanent resident it might be so soon for i can see worthy mrs bonner to be breaking visibly but young men will not see with wiser eyes than their own here is evan risking his neck for an indifferenttheres some word for not soft in short rose is the coldblooded novice as i have always said the most selfish of the creatures on two legs adieu would you have dreamed that major nightmares gallantry to his wife would have called forth a gallantry so truly touching and delicate can you not see providence there out of evilthe catholics again address if lord laxs halfbrother if wrong in noddle this i know you will attend to scrupulously ridiculous words are sometimes the most expressive once more may heaven bless you all i thought of you in church last sunday i may tell you this young mr laxley is here hebut it was evans utter madness was the cause and i have not ventured a word to him he compelled evan to assert his rank and mr forths face has been one concentrated sneer since then he must know the origin of the cogglesbys or something now you will understand the importance i cannot be more explicit onlythe man must go ps i have just ascertained that lady jocelyn is quite familiar with andrews origin she must think my poor harriet an eccentric woman of course i have not pretended to rank here merely gentry it is gentry in reality for had poor papa been legitimized he would have been a nobleman you know that and between the two we may certainly claim gentry i twiddle your little good andrew to assert it for us twenty times a day of all the dear little manageable men it does you infinite credit that you respect him as you do what would have become of me i do not know ps i said two shawlsa black and a white the black not so costly very well and so delicate of him to think of the mourning but the white my dear must be familymust old english point exquisitely chaste so different from that brussels poor andrew surprised you with i know it cost money but this is a question of taste the duke reconciles me to england and all my troubles he is more like poor papa than any one of the men i have yet seen the perfect gentleman i do praise myself for managing an invitation to our carry she has been a triumph admire the concluding stroke the countess calls this letter a purely business communication commercial men might hardly think so but perhaps ladies will perceive it she rambles concentrically if i may so expound her full of luxurious enjoyment of her position her mind is active and you see her at one moment marking a plot the next with a light exclamation appeasing her conscience proud that she has one again she calls up rival forms of faith that she may show the protestant its little shortcomings and that it is slightly in debt to her like providence for her constancy notwithstanding the protestant you see does not confess and she has to absolve herself and must be doing it internally while she is directing outer matters hence her slap at king henry viii in fact there is much more business in this letter than i dare to indicate but as it is both impertinent and unpopular to dive for any length of time beneath the surface especially when there are few pearls to show for it we will discontinue our examination the countess when she had dropped the letter in the bag returned to her chamber and deputed dorothy loring whom she met on the stairs to run and request rose to lend her her album to beguile the afternoon with and dorothy dances to rose saying the countess de lispylispy would be delighted to look at your album all the afternoon oh what a woman that is says rose countess de lazylazy i think the countess had she been listening would have cared little for accusations on that head idlesse was fashionable exquisite languors were a sign of breeding and she always had an idea that she looked more interesting at dinner after reclining on a couch the whole of the afternoon the great mel and his mate had given her robust health and she was able to play the highborn invalid without damage to her constitution anything amused her roses album even and the compositions of w h e h d f and f l the initials f l were diminutive and not unlike her own hand she thought they were appended to a piece of facetiousness that would not have disgraced the abilities of mr john raikes but we know that very stiff young gentlemen betray monkeyminds when sweet young ladies compel them to disport on the whole it was not a lazy afternoon that the countess passed and it was not against her wish that others should think it was chapter xx breakneck leap the august sun was in midsky when a troop of ladies and cavaliers issued from the gates of beckley court and winding through the hopgardens emerged on the cultivated slopes bordering the downs foremost on her grey cob was rose having on her right her uncle seymour and on her left ferdinand laxley behind came mrs evremonde flanked by drummond and evan then followed jenny graine supported by harry and william harvey in the rear came an open carriage in which miss carrington and the countess de saldar were borne attended by lady jocelyn and andrew cogglesby on horseback the expedition had for its object the selection of a run of ground for an amateur steeplechase the idea of which had sprung from laxleys boasts of his horsemanship and rose quick as fire had backed herself and drummond and evan to beat him the mention of the latter was quite enough for laxley if he follows me let him take care of his neck said that youth why ferdinand he can beat you in anything exclaimed rose imprudently but the truth was she was now more restless than ever she was not distant with evan but she had a feverish manner and seemed to thirst to make him show his qualities and excel and shine billiards or jumping or classical acquirements it mattered notevan must come first he had crossed the foils with laxley and disarmed him for mel his father had seen him trained for a military career rose made a noise about the encounter and laxley was eager for his opportunity which he saw in the proposed mad gallop now mr george uplift who usually rode in buckskins whether he was after the fox or fresh air was out on this particular morning and it happened that as the cavalcade wound beneath the down mr george trotted along the ridge he was a fatfaced rotund young squirea bully where he might be and an obedient creature enough where he must begoodhumoured when not interfered with fond of the table and brimful of all the jokes of the county the accent of which just seasoned his speech he had somehow plunged into a sort of halfengagement with miss carrington at his age and to ladies of miss carringtons age men unhappily do not plunge headforemost or miss carrington would have had him long before but he was at least in for it half a leg and a desperate maiden on the criminal side of thirty may make much of that previous to the visit of the countess de saldar mr george had been in the habit of trotting over to beckley three or four times a week miss carrington had a little money mr george was heir to his uncle miss carrington was lean and blueeyed mr george was blackeyed and obese by everybody except mr george the match was made but that exception goes for little in the country where half the population are talked into marriage and gossips entirely devote themselves to continuing the species mr george was certain that he had not been fighting shy of the fair carrington of late nor had he been unfaithful he had only been in an extraordinary state of occupation messages for lady racial had to be delivered and he had become her cavalier and escort suddenly the young squire was bewildered but as he was only one leg in loveif the sentiment may be thus spoken of figurativelyhis vanity in his present office kept him from remorse or uneasiness he rode at an easy pace within sight of the home of his treasure and his back turned to it presently there rose a cry from below mr george looked about the party of horsemen hallooed mr george yoicked rose set her horse to gallop up seymour jocelyn cried fox and gave the view hearing which mr george shouted and seemed inclined to surrender but the fun seized him and standing up in his stirrups he gathered his coattails in a bunch and waggled them with a jolly laugh which was taken up below and the clamp of hoofs resounded on the turf as mr george led off after once more with a jocose twist in his seat showing them the brush mockingly away went fox and a mad chase began seymour acted as master of the hunt rose evan drummond and mrs evremonde and dorothy skirted to the right all laughing and full of excitement harry bellowed the direction from above the ladies in the carriage with lady jocelyn and andrew watched them till they flowed one and all over the shoulder of the down and who may the poor hunted animal be inquired the countess george uplift said lady jocelyn pulling out her watch i give him twenty minutes providence speed him breathed the countess with secret fervour oh he hasnt a chance said lady jocelyn the squire keeps wretched beasts is there not an attraction that will account for his hasty capture said the countess looking tenderly at miss carrington who sat a little straighter and the countess hating manifestations of stiffbackedness could not forbear adding i am at war with my sympathies which should be with the poor brute flying from his persecutors she was in a bitter state of trepidation or she would have thought twice before she touched a nerve of the enamoured lady as she knew she did in calling her swain a poor brute and did again by pertinaciously pursuing does he then shun his captivity touching a nerve is one of those unforgivable small offences which in our civilized state produce the social vendettas and dramas that with savage nations spring from the spilling of blood instead of an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth we demand a nerve for a nerve thou hast touched me where i am tender thee too will i touch miss carrington had been alarmed and hurt at the strange evasion of mr george nor could she see the fun of his mimicry of the fox and his flight away from instead of into her neighbourhood she had also or she now thought it remarked that when mr george had been spoken of casually the countess had not looked a natural look perhaps it was her present inflamed fancy at any rate the countess was offensive now she was positively vulgar in consequence to the mind of miss carrington and miss carrington was drawn to think of a certain thing ferdinand laxley had said he had heard from the mouth of this ladys brother when ale was in him alas how one seed of a piece of folly will lurk and sprout to confound us though like the cock in the eastern tale we peck up zealously all but that one the carriage rolled over the turf attended by andrew and lady jocelyn and the hunt was seen mr george some forty paces ahead seymour gaining on him rose next whos that breasting rose said lady jocelyn lifting her glass my brotherinlaw harrington returned andrew he doesnt ride badly said lady jocelyn a little too military he must have been set up in england oh evan can do anything said andrew enthusiastically his father was a capital horseman and taught him fencing riding and every accomplishment you wont find such a young fellow my lady the brother like him at all asked lady jocelyn still eyeing the chase brother he hasnt got a brother said andrew lady jocelyn continued i mean the present baronet she was occupied with her glass and did not observe the flush that took hold of andrews ingenuous cheeks and his hurried glance at and off the quiet eye of the countess miss carrington did observe it mr andrew dashed his face under the palm of his hand and murmured ohyes his brotherinlaw isnt much like himha ha and then the poor little man rubbed his hands unconscious of the indignant pity for his wretched abilities in the gaze of the countess and he must have been exposedthere was a fear that the ghost of sir abraham would have darkened this day for miss carrington was about to speak when lady jocelyn cried theres a purl somebodys down the countess was unaware of the nature of a purl but she could have sworn it to be a piece of providence just by old nat hodges farm on squire coppings ground cried andrew much relieved by the particular individuals misfortune dear me my lady how old tom and i used to jump the brook there to be sure and when you were no bigger than little miss loringdo you remember old tom were all fools one time in our lives who can it be said lady jocelyn spying at the discomfited horseman im afraid its poor ferdinand they drove on to an eminence from which the plain was entirely laid open i hope my brother will enjoy his ride this day sighed the countess it will be his limit of enjoyment for a lengthened period she perceived that mr georges capture was inevitable and her heart sank for she was sure he would recognize her and at the moment she misdoubted her powers she dreamed of flight youre not going to leave us said lady jocelyn my dear countess what will the future member do without you we have your promise to stay till the election is over thanks for your extreme kind courtesy lady jocelyn murmured the countess but my husbandthe count the favour is yours returned her ladyship and if the count cannot come you at least are at liberty you are most kind said the countess andrew and his wife i should not dare to separate for more than a week said lady jocelyn he is the great british husband the proprietor my wife is his unanswerable excuse yes andrew replied cheerily i dont like division between man and wife i must say the countess dared no longer instance the count her husband she was heard to murmur that citizen feelings were not hers you suggested fallow field to melville did you not asked lady jocelyn it was the merest suggestion said the countess smiling then you must really stay to see us through it said her ladyship where are they now they must be making straight for breakneck fence theyll have him there george hasnt pluck for that hasnt what it was the countess who requested to know the name of this other piece of providence mr george uplift was deficient in pluckgo said her ladyship hastily and telling the coachman to drive to a certain spot trotted on with andrew saying to him im afraid we are thought vulgar by the countess andrew considered it best to reassure her gravely the young man her brother is wellbred said lady jocelyn and andrew was very ready to praise evan lady jocelyn herself in slimmer days a spirited horsewoman had correctly estimated mr georges pluck he was captured by harry and evan close on the leap in the act of shaking his head at it and many who inspected the leap would have deemed it a sign that wisdom weighted the head that would shake long at it for it consisted of a post and rails with a double ditch seymour jocelyn mrs evremonde drummond jenny graine and william harvey rode with mr george in quest of the carriage and the captive was duly delivered over but wheres the brush said lady jocelyn laughing and introducing him to the countess who dropped her head and with it her veil oh they leave that on for my next run said mr george bowing civilly you are going to run again miss carrington severely asked this question and mr george protested secure him louisa said lady jocelyn see here whats the matter with poor dorothy dorothy came slowly trotting up to them along the green lane and thus expressed her grief between sobs isnt it a shame rose is such a tyrant theyre going to ride a race and a jump down in the field and its breakneck leap and rose wont allow me to stop and see it though she knows im just as fond of evan as she is and if hes killed i declare it will be her fault and its all for her stupid dirty old pocket handkerchief breakneck fence said lady jocelyn thats rather mad do lets go and see it darling aunty joey pleaded the little maid lady jocelyn rode on saying to herself that girl has a great deal of devil in her the ladys thoughts were of rose black lymportd take the leap said mr george following her with the rest of the troop whos that fellow on him his names harrington quoth drummond oh harrington mr george responded but immediately laughed harrington gad if he takes the leap itll be oddanother of the name thats where old mel had his spill who drummond inquired old mel harringtonthe lymport wonder old marquis mel said mr george havent ye heard of him what the gorgeous tailor exclaimed lady jocelyn how i regret never meeting that magnificent snob that efflorescence of sublime imposture ive seen the regent but ones life doesnt seem complete without having seen his twinbrother you must give us warning when you have him down at croftlands again mr george gad hell have to come a long distancepoor old mel said mr george and was going on when seymour jocelyn stroked his moustache to cry look rosey s starting em by jove the leap which did not appear formidable from where they stood was four fields distant from the point where rose with a handkerchief in her hand was at that moment giving the signal to laxley and evan miss carrington and the countess begged lady jocelyn to order a shout to be raised to arrest them but her ladyship marked her good sense by saying let them go now theyre about it for she saw that to make a fuss now matters had proceeded so far was to be uncivil to the inevitable the start was given and off they flew harry jocelyn behind them was evidently caught by the demon and clapped spurs to his horse to have his fling as well for the fun of the thing but rose farther down the field rode from her post straight across him to the imminent peril of a mutual overset and the party on the height could see harry fuming and rose coolly looking him down and letting him understand what her will was and her mother and drummond and seymour who beheld this had a common sentiment of admiration for the gallant girl but away went the rivals black lymport was the favourite though none of the men thought he would be put at the fence the excitement became contagious the countess threw up her veil lady jocelyn and seymour and drummond galloped down the lane and mr george was for accompanying them till the line of miss carringtons back gave him her unmistakeable opinion of such a course of conduct and he had to dally and fret by her side andrews arm was tightly grasped by the countess the rivals were crossing the second field laxley a little ahead he s holding in the black marethat fellow said mr george gad it looks like going at the fence fancy harrington they were now in the fourth field a smooth shorn meadow laxley was two clear lengths in advance but seemed riding as mr george remarked more for pace than to take the jump the ladies kept plying random queries and suggestions the countess wishing to know whether they could not be stopped by a countryman before they encountered any danger in the midst of their chatter mr george rose in his stirrups crying bravo the black mare has he done it said andrew wiping his poll he no the mare shouted mr george and bolted off no longer to be restrained the countess doubly relieved threw herself back in the carriage and andrew drew a breath saying evan has beat himi saw that the others horse swerved right round i fear said mrs evremonde mr harrington has had a fall dont be alarmedit may not be much a fall exclaimed the countess equally divided between alarms of sisterly affection and a keen sense of the romance of the thing miss carrington ordered the carriage to be driven round they had not gone far when they were met by harry jocelyn riding in hot haste and he bellowed to the coachman to drive as hard as he could and stop opposite brooks farm the scene on the other side of the fence would have been a sweet one to the central figure in it had his eyes then been open surrounded by lady jocelyn drummond seymour and the rest evans duststained body was stretched along the road and his head was lying in the lap of rose who pale heedless of anything spoken by those around her and with her lips set and her eyes turning wildly from one to the other held a gory handkerchief to his temple with one hand and with the other felt for the motion of his heart but heroes dont die you know chapter xxi tribulations and tactics of the countess you have murdered my brother rose jocelyn dont say so now such was the interchange between the two that loved the senseless youth as he was being lifted into the carriage lady jocelyn sat upright in her saddle giving directions about what was to be done with evan and the mare impartially stunned and a good deal shaken i suppose lymports knees are terribly cut she said to drummond who merely nodded and seymour remarked fifty guineas knocked off her value one added nothing worse i should think and another a little damage inside perhaps difficult to say whether they spoke of evan or the brute no violent outcries no reproaches cast on the coldblooded coquette no exclamations on the heroism of her brother they could absolutely spare a thought for the animal and evan had risked his life for this and might die unpitied the countess diversified her grief with a deadly bitterness against the heartless jocelyns oh if evan dies will it punish rose sufficiently andrew expressed emotion but not of a kind the countess liked a relative to be seen exhibiting for in emotion worthy andrew betrayed to her his origin offensively go away and puke if you must she said clipping poor andrews word about his dear boy she could not help speaking in that wayhe was so vulgar a word of sympathy from lady jocelyn might have saved her from the sourness into which her many conflicting passions were resolving and might also have saved her ladyship from the rancour she had sown in the daughter of the great mel by her selection of epithets to characterize him will it punish rose at all if evan dies rose saw that she was looked at how could the countess tell that rose envied her the joy of holding evan in the carriage there rose to judge by her face was as calm as glass not so well seen through however mrs evremonde rode beside her whose fingers she caught and twined her own with them tightly once for a fleeting instant mrs evremonde wanted no further confession of her state then rose said to her mother mama may i ride to have the doctor ready ordinarily rose would have clapped heel to horse the moment the thought came she waited for the permission and flew off at a gallop waving back laxley who was for joining her franks will be a little rusty about the mare the countess heard lady jocelyn say and harry just then stooped his head to the carriage and said in his blunt fashion after all it wont show much we are not cattle exclaimed the frenzied countess within her bosom alas it was almost a democratic outcry they made her guilty of but she was driven past patience and as a further provocation evan would open his eyes she laid her handkerchief over them with loving delicacy remembering in a flash that her own face had been all the while exposed to mr george uplift and then the terrors of his presence at beckley court came upon her and the fact that she had not for the last ten minutes been the serene countess de saldar and she quite hated andrew for vulgarity in others evoked vulgarity in her which was the reason why she ranked vulgarity as the chief of the deadly sins her countenance for harry and all the others save poor andrew was soon the placid heaven confiding sisters again not before lady jocelyn had found cause to observe to drummond your countess doesnt ruffle well but a lady who is at war with two or three of the facts of providence and yet will have providence for her ally can hardly ruffle well do not imagine that the countesss love for her brother was hollow she was assured when she came up to the spot where he fell that there was no danger he had but dislocated his shoulder and bruised his head a little hearing this she rose out of her clamorous heart and seized the opportunity for a small burst of melodrama unhappily lady jocelyn who gave the tone to the rest was a spartan in matters of this sort and as she would have seen those dearest to her bear the luck of the field she could see others when the call for active help reached her you beheld a different woman the demonstrativeness the countess thirsted for was afforded her by juley bonner and in a measure by her sister caroline who loved evan passionately the latter was in riding attire about to mount to ride and meet them accompanied by the duke caroline had hastily tied up her hair a rich golden brown lump of it hung round her cheek her limpid eyes and anxiouslynerved brows impressed the countess wonderfully as she ran down the steps and bent her fine wellfilled bust forward to ask the first hurried question the countess patted her shoulder safe dear she said aloud as one who would not make much of it and in a whisper you look superb i must charge it to carolines beauty under the ducal radiance that a stream of sweet feelings entering into the countess made her forget to tell her sister that george uplift was by caroline had not been abroad and her skin was not olivehued she was a beauty and a majestic figure little altered since the day when the wooden marine marched her out of lymport the countess stepped from the carriage to go and cherish julianas petulant distress for that unhealthy little body was stamping with impatience to have the story told to her to burst into fits of pathos and while seymour and harry assisted evan to descend trying to laugh off the pain he endured caroline stood by soothing him with words and tender looks lady jocelyn passed him and took his hand saying not killed this time at your ladyships service tomorrow he replied and his hand was kindly squeezed my darling evan you will not ride again caroline cried kissing him on the steps and the duke watched the operation and the countess observed the duke that providence should select her sweetest moments to deal her wounds was cruel but the countess just then distinctly heard mr george uplift ask miss carrington is that lady a harrington you perceive a likeness was the answer mr george went whewtittittit with the profound expression of a very slow mind the scene was quickly over there was barely an hour for the ladies to dress for dinner leaving evan in the doctors hand and telling caroline to dress in her room the countess met rose and gratified her vindictiveness while she furthered her projects by saying not till my brother is quite convalescent will it be adviseable that you should visit him i am compelled to think of him entirely now in his present state he is not fit to be played with rose stedfastly eyeing her seemed to swallow down something in her throat and said i will obey you countess i hoped you would allow me to nurse him quiet above all things rose jocelyn returned the countess with the suavity of a governess who must be civil in her sourness if you would not complete this mornings achievementstay away the countess declined to see that roses lip quivered she saw an unpleasantness in the bottom of her eyes and now that her brothers decease was not even remotely to be apprehended she herself determined to punish the cold unimpressionable coquette of a girl before returning to caroline she had five minutes conversation with juliana which fully determined her to continue the campaign at beckley court commence decisive movements and not to retreat though fifty george uplofts menaced her consequently having dismissed conning on a message to harry jocelyn to ask him for a list of the names of the new people they were to meet that day at dinner she said to caroline my dear i think it will be incumbent on us to depart very quickly much to the countesss chagrin and astonishment caroline replied i shall hardly be sorry not sorry why what now dear one is it true then that a flagellated female kisses the rod are you so eager for a repetition of strike caroline with some hesitation related to her more than the countess had ventured to petition for in her prayers oh how exceedingly generous the latter exclaimed how very refreshing to think that there are nobles in your england as romantic as courteous as delicate as our own foreign ones but his grace is quite an exceptional nobleman are you not touched dearest carry caroline pensively glanced at the reflection of her beautiful arm in the glass and sighed pushing back the hair from her temples but for mercys sake resumed the countess in alarm at the sigh do not be tootoo touched do pray preserve your wits you weep caroline caroline o my goodness it is just fiveandtwenty minutes to the first dinnerbell and you are crying for gods sake think of your face are you going to be a gorgon and you show the marks twice as long as any other you fair women squinnying like this caroline for your louisas sake do not hissing which half angrily and half with entreaty the countess dropped on her knees carolines fit of tears subsided the eldest of the sisters she was the kindest the fairest the weakest not said the blandishing countess when carolines face was clearer not that my best of carrys does not look delicious in her shower cry with your hair down and you would subdue any male creature on two legs and that reminds me of that most audacious marquis de remilla he saw a dirty drab of a fruitgirl crying in lisbon streets one day as he was riding in the carriage of the duchesse de col da rosta and her husband and duena and he had a letter for herthe duchesse they loved how deliver the letter save me he cried to the duchesse catching her hand and pressing his heart as if very sick the duchesse felt the paperturned her hand over on her knee and he withdrew his what does my carry think was the excuse he tendered the duke thisand this gives you some idea of the wonderful audacity of those dear portuguesethat he he must precipitate himself and marry any woman he saw weep and be her slave for the term of his natural life unless another womans hand at the same moment restrained him there and the countesss eyes shone brightly how excessively imbecile caroline remarked hitherto a passive listener to these lusitanian contes it was the first sign she had yet given of her late intercourse with a positive duke and the countess felt it and drew back no more anecdotes for caroline to whom she quietly said you are very english dear but now the dukehis grace she went on how did he inaugurate i spoke to him of evans position god forgive mei said that was the cause of my looks being sad you could have thought of nothing better interposed the countess yes he said if he might clear them he should be happy in exquisite language carry of course no just as others talk hum went the countess and issued again brightly from a cloud of reflection with the remark it was to seem businesslikethe commerciality of the english mind to the pointi know well you perceive my sweetest that evans interests are in your hands you dare not quit the field in one week i fondly trust he will be secure what more did his grace say may we not be the repository of such delicious secresies caroline gave tremulous indications about the lips and the countess jumped to the bell and rang it for they were too near dinner for the trace of a single tear to be permitted the bell and the appearance of conning effectually checked the flood while speaking to her sister the countess had hesitated to mention george uplifts name hoping that as he had no dinnersuit he would not stop to dinner that day and would fall to the charge of lady racial once more conning however brought in a sheet of paper on which the names of the guests were written out by harry a daily piece of service he performed for the captivating dame and george uplifts name was in the list we will do the rest conningretire she said and then folding caroline in her arms murmured the moment they were alone will my carry dress her hair plain today for the love of her louisa goodness what a request exclaimed caroline throwing back her head to see if her louisa could be serious most inexplicableis it not will she do it flat dear it makes a fright of me possibly may i beg it but why dearest why if i only knew why for the love of your louy plain along the temples and a knot behind and a band along the forehead gems if they meet your favour but my cheekbones louisa they are not too prominent carry curls relieve them the change will relieve the curls dear one caroline looked in the glass at the countess as polished a reflector and fell into a chair her hair was accustomed to roll across her shoulders in heavy curls the duke would find a change of the sort singular she should not at all know herself with her hair done differently and for a lovely woman to be transformed to a fright is hard to bear in solitude or in imagination really she petitioned reallyyes or no added the countess so unaccountable a whim caroline looked in the glass dolefully and pulled up her thick locks from one cheek letting them fall on the instant she will breathed the countess i really cannot said caroline with vehemence the countess burst into laughter replying my poor child it is not my whimit is your obligation george uplift dines here today now do you divine it disguise is imperative for you mrs strike gazing in her sisters face answered slowly george but how will you meet him she hurriedly asked i have met him rejoined the countess boldly i defy him to know me i brazen him you with your hair in my style are equally safe you see there is no choice pooh contemptible puppy but i nevercaroline was going to say she never could face him i will not dine i will nurse evan you have faced him my dear said the countess and you are to change your headdress simply to throw him off his scent as she spoke the countess tripped about nodding her head like a girl triumph in the sense of her power over all she came in contact with rather elated the lady do you see why she worked her sister in this roundabout fashion she would not tell her george uplift was in the house till she was sure he intended to stay for fear of frightening her when the necessity became apparent she put it under the pretext of a whim in order to see how far caroline whose weak compliance she could count on and whose reticence concerning the duke annoyed her would submit to it to please her sister and if she rebelled positively why to be sure it was the duke she dreaded to shock and therefore the duke had a peculiar hold on her and therefore the countess might reckon that she would do more than she pleased to confess to remain with the duke and was manageable in that quarter all this she learnt without asking i need not add that caroline sighingly did her bidding we must all be victims in our turn carry said the countess evans prospectsit may be silvas restorationdepend upon your hair being dressed plain today reflect on that poor caroline obeyed but she was capable of reflecting only that her face was unnaturally lean and strange to her the sisters tended and arranged one another taking care to push their mourning a month or two ahead and the countess animadverted on the vulgar mind of lady jocelyn who would allow a gentleman to sit down at a gentlewomans table in full company in pronounced undress and caroline utterly miserable would pretend that she wore a mask and kept grimacing as they do who are not accustomed to paint on the cheeks till the countess checked her by telling her she should ask her for that before the duke after a visit to evan the sisters sailed together into the drawingroom uniformity is sometimes a gain murmured the countess as they were parting in the middle of the room she saw that their fine figures and profiles and resemblance in contrast produced an effect the duke wore one of those calmly intent looks by which men show they are aware of change in the heavens they study and are too devout worshippers to presume to disapprove mr george was standing by miss carrington and he also watched mrs strike to bewilder him yet more the countess persisted in fixing her eyes upon his heterodox apparel and mr george became conscious and uneasy miss carrington had to address her question to him twice before he heard melville jocelyn sir john loring sir franks and hamilton surrounded the countess and told her what they had decided on with regard to the election during the day for melville was warm in his assertion that they would not talk to the countess five minutes without getting a hint worth having call to us that man who is habited like a groom said the countess indicating mr george i presume he is in his right place up here whewtake care countessour best man hes good for a dozen said hamilton mr george was brought over and introduced to the countess de saldar so the oldest tory in the county is a fox she said in allusion to the hunt never did caroline strike admire her sisters fearful genius more than at that moment mr george ducked and rolled his hand over his chin with ahum and the like ended by a dry laugh are you our supporter mr uplift tory interest maummy lady and are you staunch and may be trusted pon my honour i think i have that reputation and you would not betray us if we give you any secrets say pon my honour again you launch it out so courageously the men laughed though they could not see what the countess was driving at she had for two minutes spoken as she spoke when a girl and george entirely off his guard and unsuspiciouslooked unenlightened if he knew there were hints enough for him in her words if he remained blind they might pass as air the appearance of the butler cut short his protestation as to his powers of secresy the countess dismissed him you will be taken into our confidence when we require you and she resumed her foreign air in a most elaborate and overwhelming bow she was now perfectly satisfied that she was safe from mr george and as she thoroughly detested the youthful squire she chose to propagate a laugh at him by saying with the utmost languor and clearness of voice as they descended the stairs after all a very clever fox may be a very dull dogdont you think gentlemen in front of her and behind heard it and at mr georges expense her reputation rose thus the genius of this born general prompted her to adopt the principle in tacticsboldly to strike when you are in the dark as to your enemys movements chapter xxii in which the daughters of the great mel have to digest him at dinner you must know if you would form an estimate of the countesss heroic impudence that a rumour was current in lymport that the fair and well developed louisa harrington in her sixteenth year did advisedly and with the intention of rendering the term indefinite entrust her guileless person to mr george uplifts honourable charge the rumour unflavoured by absolute malignity was such and it went on to say that the sublime mel alive to the honour of his family followed the fugitives with a pistol and with a horsewhip that he might chastise the offender according to the degree of his offence it was certain that he had not used the pistol it was said that he had used the whip the details of the interview between mel and mr george were numerous but at the same time various some declared that he put a pistol to mr georges ear and under pressure of that persuader got him into the presence of a clergyman when he turned sulky and when the pistol was again produced the ceremony would have been performed had not the outraged church cried out for help some vowed that mr george had referred all questions implying a difference between himself and mel to their mutual fists for decision at any rate mr george turned up in fallow field subsequently the fair louisa unhurt and with a quiet mind in lymport and this amount of truth the rumours can be reduced tothat louisa and mr george had been acquainted rumour and gossip know how to build they always have some solid foundation however small upwards of twelve years had run since louisa went to the wife of the brewer a period quite long enough for mr george to forget any one in and she was altogether a different creature and as it was true that mr george was a dull one she was after the test she had put him to justified in hoping that mels progeny might pass unchallenged anywhere out of lymport so with mr george facing her at table the countess sat down determined to eat and be happy a man with the education and tastes of a young country squire is not likely to know much of the character of women and of the marvellous power they have of throwing a veil of oblivion between themselves and what they dont want to remember few men know much mr george had thought when he saw mrs strike leaning to evan and heard she was a harrington that she was rather like the lymport family but the reappearance of mrs strike the attention of the duke of belfield to her and the splendid tactics of the countess which had extinguished every thought in the thought of himself drove lymport out of his mind there were some dinner guests at the tablepeople of fallow field beckley and bodley the countess had the diplomatist on one side the duke on the other caroline was under the charge of sir franks the countess almost revelling in her position opposite mr george was ambitious to lead the conversation and commenced smiling at melville we are to be spared politics today i think politics and cookery do not assimilate im afraid you wont teach the true briton to agree with you said melville shaking his head over the sums involved by this british propensity no said seymour election dinners are a part of the constitution and andrew laughed they make radicals pay as well as tories so its pretty square the topic was taken up flagged fell and was taken up again and then harry jocelyn said i say have you worked the flags yet the great mel must have his flags the flags were in the hands of ladies and ladies would look to the rosettes he was told then a lady of the name of barrington laughed lightly and said only pray my dear harry dont call your uncle the great mel at the election oh very well quoth harry why not you ll get him laughed atthat s all oh well then i wont said harry whose wits were attracted by the countesss visage mrs barrington turned to seymour her neighbour and resumed he really would be laughed at there was a tailorhe was called the great meland he tried to stand for fallow field once i believe he had the support of squire upliftgeorges uncleand others they must have done it for fun of course he did not get so far as the hustings but i believe he had flags and principles and all sorts of things worked ready he certainly canvassed a tailorcanvassedfor parliament remarked an old dowager the mother of squire copping my what are we coming to next he deserved to get in quoth aunt bel after having his principles worked ready to eject the man was infamous amazed at the mine she had sprung the countess sat through it lamenting the misery of owning a notorious father happily evan was absent on his peaceful blessed bed bowing over wine with the duke she tried another theme while still like a pertinacious cracker the great mel kept banging up and down the table we are to have a feast in the open air i hear what you call picnic the duke believed there was a project of the sort how exquisitely they do those things in portugal i suppose there would be no scandal in my telling something now at least we are out of court jurisdiction scandal of the court exclaimed his grace in mock horror the option is yours to listen the queen when young was sweetly pretty a divine complexion and a habit of smiling on everybody i presume that the young habral son of the first magistrate of lisbon was also smiled on most innocently i would swear but it operated on the wretched youth he spent all his fortune in the purchase and decoration of a fairy villa bordering on the val das rosas where the court enjoyed its rustic festivities and one day a storm all the ladies hurried their young mistress to the house where the young habral had been awaiting her for ages none so polished as he musicians started up the floors were ready and torches beneath themthere was a feast of exquisite wines and viands sparkling quite enchantment the girlqueen was in ecstasies she deigned a dance with the young habral and then all sat down to supper and in the middle of it came the cry of fire the queen shrieked the flames were seen all around and if the arms of the young habral were opened to save her or perish could she cast a thought on royalty and refuse the queen was saved the villa was burnt the young habral was ruined but if i know a portuguese he was happy till he died and well remunerated for he had held a queen to his heart so that was a picnic the duke slightly inclined his head vrai portughez derrendo he said they tell a similar story in spain of one of the queensi forget her name the difference between us and your peninsular cavaliers is that we would do as much for uncrowned ladies ah your grace the countess swam in the pleasure of a noblemans compliment whats the story interposed aunt bel an outline of it was given her thank heaven the table was now rid of the great mel for how could he have any the remotest relation with queens and peninsular picnics you shall hear lady jocelyn happened to catch a word or two of the story why said she thats english franks you remember the ballet divertissement they improvised at the bodley raceball when the magnificent footman fired a curtain and caught up lady racial and carried her heaven knows where cried sir franks i remember it perfectly it was said that the magnificent footman did it on purpose to have that pleasure ay of course hamilton took him up they talked of prosecuting the magnificent footman ay followed seymour and nobody could tell where the magnificent footman bolted he vanished into thin air ay of course melville struck in and the magic enveloped the lady for some time at this point mr george uplift gave a horselaugh he jerked in his seat excitedly bodley raceball he cried and looking at lady jocelyn was your ladyship there then whyha ha why you have seen the great mel then that tremendous footman was old mel himself lady jocelyn struck both her hands on the table and rested her large grey eyes full of humorous surprise on mr george there was a pause and then the ladies and gentlemen laughed yes mr george went on that was old mel ill swear to him and thats how it began murmured lady jocelyn mr george nodded at his plate discreetly well said lady jocelyn leaning back and lifting her face upward in the discursive fulness of her fancy i feel i am not robbed il y a des miracles et jen ai vu ones life seems more perfect when one has seen what nature can do the fellow was stupendous i conceive him present wholl fire a house for me is it my deficiency of attraction or a total dearth of gallant snobs the countess was drowned the muscles of her smiles were horribly stiff and painful caroline was getting pale could it be accident that thus resuscitated mel their father and would not let the dead man die was not malice at the bottom of it the countess though she hated mr george infinitely was clearheaded enough to see that providence alone was trying her no glances were exchanged between him and laxley or drummond again mel returned to his peace and again he had to come forth who was this singular man you were speaking about just now mrs evremonde asked lady jocelyn answered her the light of his age the embodied protest against our social prejudice combinesay mirabeau and alcibiades and the result is the lymport tailorhe measures your husband in the morning in the evening he makes love to you through a series of pantomimic transformations he was a colossal adonis and im sorry hes dead but did the man get into society said mrs evremonde how did he manage that yes indeed and what sort of a society the dowager copping interjected none but bachelortables i can assure you oh i remember him they talked of fetching him to dox hall i said no thank you tom this isnt your vauxhall a sharp retort said lady jocelyn a most conclusive rhyme but youre mistaken many families were glad to see him i hear and he only consented to be treated like a footman when he dressed like one the fellow had some capital points he fought two or three duels and behaved like a man franks wouldnt have him here or i would have received him i hear that as a conteur he was inimitable in short he was a robust brummel and the regent of low life this should have been mels final epitaph unhappily mrs melville would remark in her mincing manner that the idea of the admission of a tailor into society seemed very unnatural and aunt bel confessed that her experience did not comprehend it as to that said lady jocelyn phenomena are unnatural the rules of society are lightened by the exceptions what i like in this mel is that though he was a snob and an impostor he could still make himself respected by his betters he was honest so far he acknowledged his tastes which were those of franks melville seymour and georgethe tastes of a gentleman i prefer him infinitely to your cowardly democrat who barks for what he cant get and is generally beastly in fact im not sure that i havent a secret passion for the great tailor after all old mel wasnt so bad mr george uplift chimed in granted a tailoryou didnt see a bit of it at table ive known him taken for a lord and when he once got hold of you you couldnt give him up the squire met him first in the coach one winter he took him for a russian noblemandidnt find out what he was for a month or so says mel yes i make clothes you find the notion unpleasant guess how disagreeable it is to me the old squire laughed and was glad to have him at croftlands as often as he chose to come old mel and i used to spar sometimes but hes gone and i should like to shake his fist again then mr george told the bath story and episodes in mels career as marquis and while he held the ear of the table rose who had not spoken a word and had scarcely eaten a morsel during dinner studied the sisters with serious eyes only when she turned them from the countess to mrs strike they were softened by a shadowy drooping of the eyelids as if for some reason she deeply pitied that lady next to rose sat drummond with a face expressive of cynical enjoyment he devoted uncommon attention to the countess whom he usually shunned and overlooked he invited her to exchange bows over wine in the fashion of that day and the countess went through the performance with finished grace and ease poor andrew had all the time been brushing back his hair and making strange deprecatory sounds in his throat like a man who felt bound to assure everybody at table he was perfectly happy and comfortable material enough for a sartoriad said drummond to lady jocelyn excellent pray write it forthwith drummond replied her ladyship and as they exchanged talk unintelligible to the countess this lady observed to the duke it is a relief to have buried that subject the duke smiled raising an eyebrow but the persecuted countess perceived she had been much too hasty when drummond added ill make a journey to lymport in a day or two and master his history do said her ladyship and flourishing her hand i sing the prince of snobs oh if its about old mel i ll sing you material enough said mr george there you talk of its being unnatural his dining out at respectable tables why i believeupon my honour i believe its a facthes supped and thrown dice with the regent lady jocelyn clapped her hands a noble culmination drummond the mans an epic well i think old mel was equal to it mr george pursued he gave me pretty broad hints and this is how it was if it really happened you know old mel had a friend some say he was more well that was a fellow a great gambler i dare say you ve heard of himburley bennet him that won ryelands park of one of the royal dukesdied worth upwards of l and old mel swore he ought to have had it and would if he hadnt somehow offended him he left the money to admiral harrington and he was a relation of mels but are we then utterly mixed up with tailors exclaimed mrs barrington well those are the facts said mr george the wine made the young squire talkative it is my belief that his suspicions were not awake at that moment and that like any other young country squire having got a subject he could talk on he did not care to discontinue it the countess was past the effort to attempt to stop him she had work enough to keep her smile in the right place every dinner may be said to have its special topic just as every age has its marked reputation they are put up twice or thrice and have to contend with minor lights and to swallow them and then they command the tongues of men and flow uninterruptedly so it was with the great mel upon this occasion curiosity was aroused about him aunt bel agreed with lady jocelyn that she would have liked to know the mighty tailor mrs shorne but very imperceptibly protested against the notion and from one to another it ran his grace of belfield expressed positive approval of mel as one of the old school si ce nest pas le gentilhomme au moins cest le gentilhomme manque said lady jocelyn he is to be regretted duke you are right the stuff was in him but the fates were unkind i stretch out my hand to the pauvre diable i think one learns more from the mock magnifico than from anything else observed his grace when the lion saw the donkey in his own royal skin said aunt bel add the rhyme at your discretionhe was a wiser lion thats all and the ape that strives to copy onehes an animal of judgement said lady jocelyn we will be tolerant to the tailor and the countess must not set us down as a nation of shopkeepers philosophically tolerant the countess started and ran a little broken oh affably out of her throat dipped her lips to her tablenapkin and resumed her smile yes pursued her ladyship old mel stamps the age gone by the gallant adventurer tied to his shop alternate footman and marquis out of intermediate tailor isnt there something fine in his buffoon imitation of the real thing i feel already that old mel belongs to me where is the great man buried where have they set the funeral brass that holds his mighty ashes lady jocelyns humour was fully entered into by the men the women smiled vacantly and had a common thought that it was illbred of her to hold forth in that way at table and unfeminine of any woman to speak continuously anywhere oh come cried mr george who saw his own subject snapped away from him by sheer cleverness old mel wasnt only a buffoon my lady you know old mel had his qualities he was as much a nononsense fellow in his way as a magistrate or a minister or a king or a constable aunt bel helped his illustration or a prince a pollparrot a perigordpie added drummond whose gravity did not prevent mr george from seeing that he was laughed at well then now listen to this said mr george leaning his two hands on the table resolutely dessert was laid and with a full glass beside him and a pear to peel he determined to be heard the countesss eyes went mentally up to the vindictive heavens she stole a glance at caroline and was alarmed at her excessive pallor providence had rescued evan from this now i know this to be true mr george began when old mel was alive he and i had plenty of sparring and thatbut hes dead and ill do him justice i spoke of burley bennet just now now my lady old burley was i think mels halfbrother and he came i know somewhere out of drury laneone of the courts near the theatrei dont know much of london however old mel wouldnt have that nothing less than being born in st jamess square would content old mel and he must have a marquis for his father i neednt be more particular before ladies ahem but burley was the shrewd hand of the two ohhh such a card he knew the way to get into company without false pretences well i told you he had lots more than lsome said twoand he gave up ryelands never asked for it though he won it consequence was he commanded the services of somebody pretty high and it was he got admiral harrington made a captain posted commodore admiral and kcb all in seven years in the army it d have been half the time for the hrh was stronger in that department now i know old burley promised mel to leave him his money and called the admiral an ungrateful dog he didnt give mel much at a timenow and then a twentypounder or soi saw the cheques and old mel expected the money and looked over his daughters like a turkeycock nobody good enough for them whacking handsome galsthree used to be called the three graces of lymport and one day burley comes and visits mel and sees the girls and he puts his finger on the eldest i can tell you she was a spanker she was the handsomest gal i think ever i saw for the mothers a fine woman and what with the mother and what with old mel we wont enter into the mysteries of origin quoth lady jocelyn exactly my lady oh your servant of course before ladies a burley bennet i said long and short was he wanted to take her up to london says old mel london s a sad place place to make money says burley thats not work for a young gal says mel long and short was burley wanted to take her and mel wouldnt let her go mr george lowered his tone and mumbled dont know how to explain it very well before ladies what burley wanted wasit wasnt quite honourable you know though there was a good deal of spangles on it and whether a real hrh or a marquis or a viscount i cant say butthe offer was tempting to a tradesman no says mel like a chap planting his flagstaff and sticking to it i believe that to get her to go with him burley offered to make a will on the spot and to leave every farthing of his money and propertyupon my soul i believe it to be trueto mel and his family if hed let the gal go no says mel i like the old bird and burley got in a rage and said hed leave every farthing to the sailor says mel im a poor tradesman but i have and i always will have the feelings of a gentleman and theyre more to me than hard cash and the honour of my daughter sir is dearer to me than my blood out of the house cries mel and away old burley went and left every penny to the sailor admiral harrington who never noticed em an inch now there all had listened to mr george attentively and he had slurred the apologetic passages and emphasized the propitiatory before ladies in a way to make himself well understood a generation back bravo old mel rang the voice of lady jocelyn and a murmur ensued in the midst of which rose stood up and hurried round the table to mrs strike who was seen to rise from her chair and as she did so the ill arranged locks fell from their unnatural restraint down over her shoulders one great curl half forward to the bosom and one behind her right ear her eyes were wide her whole face neck and fingers white as marble the faintest tremor of a frown on her brows and her shut lips marked the continuation of some internal struggle as if with her last conscious force she kept down a flood of tears and a wild outcry which it was death to hold sir franks felt his arm touched and looked up and caught her as rose approached the duke and other gentlemen went to his aid and as the beautiful woman was borne out white and still as a corpse the countess had this dagger plunged in her heart from the mouth of mr george addressing miss carrington i swear i didnt do it on purpose she s carry harrington old mels daughter as sure as she s flesh and blood chapter xxiii treats of a handkerchief running through beckley park clear from the chalk a little stream gave light and freshness to its pasturage near where it entered a bathing house of white marble had been built under which the water flowed and the dive could be taken to a paved depth and you swam out over a pebbly bottom into sunlight screened by the thickweeded banks loosestrife and willowherb and mint nodding over you and in the later season longplumed yellow grasses here at sunrise the young men washed their limbs and here since her return home english rose loved to walk by night she had often spoken of the little happy stream to evan in portugal and when he came to beckley court she arranged that he should sleep in a bedroom overlooking it the view was sweet and pleasant to him for all the babbling of the water was of rose and winding in and out to east to north it wound to embowered hopes in the lovers mind to tender dreams and often at dawn when dressing his restless heart embarked on it and sailed into havens the phantom joys of which coloured his life for him all the day but most he loved to look across it when the light fell the palest solitary gleam along its course spoke to him rich promise the faint blue beam of a star chained all his longings charmed his sorrows to sleep rose like a fairy had breathed her spirit here and it was a delight to the silly luxurious youth to lie down and fix some image of a flower bending to the stream on his brain and in the cradle of fancies that grew round it slide down the tide of sleep from the image of a flower bending to the stream like his own soul to the bosom of rose evan built sweet fables it was she that exalted him that led him through glittering chapters of adventure in his dream of deeds achieved for her sake you may be sure the young man behaved worthily though he was modest when she praised him and his limbs trembled when the land whispered of his great reward to come the longer he stayed at beckley the more he lived in this world within world and if now and then the harsh outer life smote him a look or a word from rose encompassed him again and he became sensible only of a distant pain at first his hope sprang wildly to possess her to believe that after he had done deeds that would have sent ordinary men in the condition of shattered hulks to the hospital she might be his then blow upon blow was struck and he prayed to be near her till he died no more then she herself struck him to the ground and sitting in his chamber sick and weary on the evening of his mishap evans sole desire was to obtain the handkerchief he had risked his neck for to have that and hold it to his heart and feel it as a part of her seemed much over a length of the stream the red round harvestmoon was rising and the weakened youth was this evening at the mercy of the charm that encircled him the water curved and dimpled and flowed flat and the whole body of it rushed into the spaces of sad splendour the clustered trees stood like temples of darkness their shadows lengthened supernaturally and a pale gloom crept between them on the sward he had been thinking for some time that rose would knock at his door and give him her voice at least but she did not come and when he had gazed out on the stream till his eyes ached he felt that he must go and walk by it those little flashes of the hurrying tide spoke to him of a secret rapture and of a joyseeking impulse the pouring onward of all the blood of life to one illumined heart mournful from excess of love pardon me i beg enamoured young men have these notions ordinarily evan had sufficient common sense and was as prosaic as mankind could wish him but he has had a terrible fall in the morning and a young woman rages in his brain better indeed and more manly were he to strike and raise huge bosses on his forehead groan and so have done with it we must let him go his own way at the door he was met by the countess she came into the room without a word or a kiss and when she did speak the total absence of any euphuism gave token of repressed excitement yet more than her angry eyes and eager step evan had grown accustomed to her moods and if one moment she was the halcyon and another the petrel it no longer disturbed him seeing that he was a stranger to the influences by which she was affected the countess rated him severely for not seeking repose and inviting sympathy she told him that the jocelyns had one and all combined in an infamous plot to destroy the race of harrington and that caroline had already succumbed to their assaults that the jocelyns would repent it and sooner than they thought for and that the only friend the harringtons had in the house was miss bonner whom providence would liberally reward then the countess changed to a dramatic posture and whispered aloud hush she is here she is so anxious be generous my brother and let her see you she said evan faintly may she come louisa he hoped for rose i have consented to mask it returned the countess oh what do i not sacrifice for you she turned from him and to evans chagrin introduced juliana bonner five minutes remember said the countess i must not hear of more and then evan found himself alone with miss bonner and very uneasy this young lady had restless brilliant eyes and a contraction about the forehead which gave one the idea of a creature suffering perpetual headache she said nothing and when their eyes met she dropped hers in a manner that made silence too expressive feeling which evan began may i tell you that i think it is i who ought to be nursing you not you me miss bonner replied by lifting her eyes and dropping them as before murmuring subsequently would you do so most certainly if you did me the honour to select me the fingers of the young lady commenced twisting and intertwining on her lap suddenly she laughed it would not do at all you wont be dismissed from your present service till you re unfit for any other what do you mean said evan thinking more of the unmusical laugh than of the words he received no explanation and the irksome silence caused him to look through the window as an escape for his mind at least the waters streamed on endlessly into the golden arms awaiting them the low moon burnt through the foliage in the distance over a reach of the flood one tall aspen shook against the lighted sky are you in pain miss bonner asked and broke his reverie no i am going away and perhaps i sigh involuntarily you like these grounds i have never been so happy in any place with those cruel young men about you evan now laughed we dont call young men cruel miss bonner but were they not to take advantage of what rose told themit was base she had said more than she intended possibly for she coloured under his inquiring look and added i wish i could say the same as you of beckley do you know i am called roses thorn not by miss jocelyn herself certainly how eager you are to defend her but am i nottell medo i not look like a thorn in company with her there is but the difference that ill health would make ill health oh yes and rose is so much better born to that i am sure she does not give a thought not rose oh an exclamation properly lengthened convinces the feelings more satisfactorily than much logic though evan claimed only the hand kerchief he had won his heart sank at the sound miss bonner watched him and springing forward said sharply may i tell you something you may tell me what you please then whether i offend you or not you had better leave this i am going said evan i am only waiting to introduce your tutor to you she kept her eyes on him and in her voice as well there was a depth as she returned mr laxley mr forth and harry are going to lymport tomorrow evan was looking at a figure whose shadow was thrown towards the house from the margin of the stream he stood up and taking the hand of miss bonner said i thank you i may perhaps start with them at any rate you have done me a great service which i shall not forget the figure by the stream he knew to be that of rose he released miss bonners trembling moist hand and as he continued standing she moved to the door after once following the line of his eyes into the moonlight outside the door a noise was audible andrew had come to sit with his dear boy and the countess had met and engaged and driven him to the other end of the passage where he hung remonstrating with her why van he said as evan came up to him i thought you were in a profound sleep louisa said silly andrew interposed the countess do you not observe he is sleep walking now and she left them with a light laugh to go to juliana whom she found in tears the countess was quite aware of the efficacy of a little bit of burlesque lying to cover her retreat from any petty exposure evan soon got free from andrew he was under the dim stars walking to the great fire in the east the cool air refreshed him he was simply going to ask for his own before he went and had no cause to fear what would be thought by any one a handkerchief a man might fairly win that and carry it out of a very noble family without having to blush for himself i cannot say whether he inherited his feeling for rank from mel his father or that the countess had succeeded in instilling it but evan never took republican ground in opposition to those who insulted him and never lashed his manhood to assert itself nor compared the fineness of his instincts with the behaviour of titled gentlemen rather he seemed to admit the distinction between his birth and that of a gentleman admitting it to his own soul as it were and struggled simply as men struggle against a destiny the news miss bonner had given him sufficed to break a spell which could not have endured another week and andrew besides had told him of carolines illness he walked to meet rose honestly intending to ask for his own and wish her goodbye rose saw him approach and knew him in the distance she was sitting on a lower branch of the aspen that shot out almost from the root and stretched over the intervolving rays of light on the tremulous water she could not move to meet him she was not the rose whom we have hitherto known love may spring in the bosom of a young girl like helper in the evening sky a grey speck in a field of grey and not be seen or known till surely as the circle advances the faint planet gathers fire and coming nearer earth dilates and will and must be seen and known when evan lay like a dead man on the ground rose turned upon herself as the author of his death and then she felt this presence within her and her heart all day had talked to her of it and was throbbing now and would not be quieted she could only lift her eyes and give him her hand she could not speak she thought him cold and he was cold enough to think that she and her cousin were not unlike in their manner though not deep enough to reflect that it was from the same cause she was the first to find her wits but not before she spoke did she feel and start to feel how long had been the silence and that her hand was still in his why did you come out evan it was not right i came to speak to you i shall leave early tomorrow and may not see you alone you are going she checked her voice and left the thrill of it wavering in him yes rose i am going i should have gone before evan she grasped his hand and then timidly retained it you have not forgiven me i see now i did not think of any risk to you i only wanted you to beat i wanted you to be first and best if you knew how i thank god for saving you what my punishment would have been till her eyes were full she kept them on him too deep in emotion to be conscious of it he could gaze on her tears coldly i should be happy to take the leap any day for the prize you offered i have come for that for what evan but while she was speaking the colour mounted in her cheeks and she went on rapidly did you think it unkind of me not to come to nurse you i must tell you to defend myself it was the countess evan she is offended with mevery justly i dare say she would not let me come what could i do i had no claim to come rose was not aware of the import of her speech evan though he felt more in it and had some secret nerves set tingling and dancing was not to be moved from his demand do you intend to withhold it rose withhold what evan anything that you wish for is yours the handkerchief is not that mine rose faltered a word why did he ask for it because he asked for nothing else and wanted no other thing save that why did she hesitate because it was so poor a gift and so unworthy of him and why did he insist because in honour she was bound to surrender it and why did she hesitate still let her answer oh evan i would give you anything but that and if you are going away i should beg so much to keep it he must have been in a singular state not to see her heart in the refusal as was she not to see his in the request but love is blindest just when the bandage is being removed from his forehead then you will not give it me rose do you think i shall go about boasting this is miss jocelyns handkerchief and i poor as i am have won it the taunt struck aslant in roses breast with a peculiar sting she stood up i will give it you evan turning from him she drew it forth and handed it to him hurriedly it was warm it was stained with his blood he guessed where it had been nestling and now as if by revelation he saw that large sole star in the bosom of his darling and was blinded by it and lost his senses rose beloved like the flower of his nightly phantasy bending over the stream he looked and saw in her sweet face the living wonders that encircled his image she murmuring no you must hate me i love you rose and dare to say itand it s unpardonable can you forgive me she raised her face to him forgive you for loving me she said holy to them grew the stillness the ripple suffused in golden moonlight the dark edges of the leaves against superlative brightness not a chirp was heard nor anything save the cool and endless carol of the happy waters whose voices are the spirits of silence nature seemed consenting that their hands should be joined their eyes intermingling and when evan with a lovers craving wished her lips to say what her eyes said so well rose drew his fingers up and with an arch smile and a blush kissed them the simple act set his heart thumping and from the look of love she saw an expression of pain pass through him her fealtyher guileless fearless truthwhich the kissing of his hand brought vividly before him conjured its contrast as well in this that was hidden from her or but half suspected did she knowknow and love him still he thought it might be but that fell dead on her asking shall i speak to mama tonight a load of lead crushed him rose he said but could get no farther innocently or with wellmasked design rose branched off into little sweet words about his bruised shoulder touching it softly as if she knew the virtue that was in her touch and accusing her selfish self as she caressed it dearest evan you must have been sure i thought no one like you why did you not tell me before i can hardly believe it now do you know she hurried on they think me cold and heartlessam i i must be to have made you run such risk but yet im sure i could not have survived you dropping her voice rose quoted ruth as evan listened the words were like food from heaven poured into his spirit tomorrow he kept saying to himself tomorrow i will tell her all let her think well of me a few short hours but the passing minutes locked them closer each had a new linkin a word or a speechless breath or a touch and to break the marriage of their eyes there must be infinite baseness on one side or on the other disloyalty to love the moon was a silver ball high up through the aspenleaves evan kissed the hand of rose and led her back to the house he had appeased his conscience by restraining his wild desire to kiss her lips in the hall they parted rose whispered till death giving him her hands chapter xxiv the countess makes herself felt there is a peculiar reptile whose stroke is said to deprive men of motion on the day after the great mel had stalked the dinnertable of beckley court several of the guests were sensible of the effect of this creatures mysterious touch without knowing what it was that paralyzed them drummond forth had fully planned to go to lymport he had special reasons for making investigations with regard to the great mel harry who was fond of drummond offered to accompany him and laxley for the sake of a diversion fell into the scheme mr george uplift was also to be of the party and promised them fun but when the time came to start not one could be induced to move laxley was pressingly engaged by rose harry showed the rope the countess held him by mr george made a singular face and seriously advised drummond to give up the project dont rub that woman the wrong way he said in a private colloquy they had by jingo shes a tartar she was as a gal and she isnt changed lou harrington fancy now she knew me and she faced me out and made me think her a stranger gad im glad i didnt speak to the others lords sake keep it quiet dont rouse that woman now if you want to keep a whole skin drummond laughed at his extreme earnestness in cautioning him and appeared to enjoy his dread of the countess mr george would not tell how he had been induced to change his mind he repeated his advice with a very emphatic shrug of the shoulder you seem afraid of her said drummond i am i aint ashamed to confess it shes a regular viper my boy said mr george she and i once were pretty thickleast said soonest mended you know i offended her wasnt quite up to her marka tailors daughter you know gad if she didnt set an irish dragoon captain on mei went about in danger of my life the fellow began to twist his damned black moustaches the moment he clapped eyes on me bullied me till upon my soul i was almost ready to fight him oh she was a little tripping tartar of a bantam hen then shes grown since shes been countessed and does it peacocky now i give you fair warning you know shes more than any mans match i dare say i shall think the same when she has beaten me quoth cynical drummond and immediately went and gave orders for his horse to be saddled thinking that he would tread on the head of the viper but shortly before the hour of his departure mrs evremonde summoned him to her and showed him a slip of paper on which was written in an uncouth small hand madam a friend warns you that your husband is coming here deep interest in your welfare is the cause of an anonymous communication the writer wishes only to warn you in time mrs evremonde told drummond that she had received it from one of the servants when leaving the breakfastroom beyond the fact that a man on horseback had handed it to a little boy who had delivered it over to the footman drummond could learn nothing of course all thought of the journey to lymport was abandoned if but to excogitate a motive for the origin of the document drummond was forced to remain and now he had it and now he lost it again and as he was wandering about in his maze the countess met him with a good morning mr forth have i impeded your expedition by taking my friend mr harry to cavalier me today drummond smilingly assured her that she had not in any way disarranged his projects and passed with so absorbed a brow that the countess could afford to turn her head and inspect him without fear that he would surprise her in the act knocking the pearly edge of her fan on her teeth she eyed him under her joined black lashes and deliberately read his thoughts in the mere shape of his back and shoulders she read him through and through and was unconscious of the effective attitude she stood in for the space of two full minutes and even then it required one of our unhappy sex to recall her this was harry jocelyn my friend she said to him with a melancholy smile my one friend here harry went through the form of kissing her hand which he had been taught and practised cunningly as the first step of the ladder i say you looked so handsome standing as you did just now he remarked and she could see how far beneath her that effective attitude had precipitated the youth ah she sighed walking on with the step of majesty in exile what the deuce is the matter with everybody today cried harry i m hanged if i can make it out theres the carrington as you call her i met her with such a pair of eyes and old george looking as if hed been licked at her heels and theres drummond and his lady fair moping about the lawn and my mother positively getting excitedtheres a miracle and juley s sharpening her nails for somebody and if ferdinand dont look out your brother ll be walking off with rosey that s my opinion indeed said the countess you really think so well they come it pretty strong together and what constitutes the come it strong mr harry hold of hands you know the young gentleman indicated alas then must not we be more discreet oh but its different with young people one knows what that means deus exclaimed the countess tossing her head weariedly and harry perceived his slip and down he went again what wonder that a youth in such training should consent to fetch and carry to listen and relate to play the spy and know no more of his office than that it gave him astonishing thrills of satisfaction and now and then a secret sweet reward the countess had sealed miss carringtons mouth by one of her most dexterous strokes on leaving the dinnertable overnight and seeing that carolines attack would preclude their instant retreat the gallant countess turned at bay a word aside to mr george uplift and then the countess took a chair by miss carrington she did all the conversation and supplied all the smiles to it and when a lady has to do that she is justified in striking and striking hard for to abandon the pretence of sweetness is a gross insult from one woman to another the countess then led circuitously but with all the ease in the world to the story of a portuguese lady of a marvellous beauty and who was deeply enamoured of the chevalier miguel de rasadio and engaged to be married to him but alas for her in the insolence of her happiness she wantonly made an enemy in the person of a most unoffending lady and she repented it while sketching the admirable chevalier the countess drew a telling portrait of mr george uplift and gratified her humour and her wrath at once by strong truth to nature in the description and animated encomiums on the individual the portuguese lady too a little resembled miss carrington in spite of her marvellous beauty and it was odd that miss carrington should give a sudden start and a horrified glance at the countess just when the countess was pathetically relating the proceeding taken by the revengeful lady on the beautiful betrothed of the chevalier miguel de rasadio which proceeding was nothing other than to bring to the chevaliers knowledge that his beauty had a defect concealed by her apparel and that the specks in his fruit were not one or two but oh and the dreadful sequel to the story the countess could not tell preferring ingeniously to throw a tragic veil over it miss carrington went early to bed that night the courage that mounteth with occasion was eminently the attribute of the countess de saldar after that dreadful dinner she since the weaknesses of great generals should not be altogether ignored did pray for flight and total obscurity but caroline could not be left in her hysteric state and now that she really perceived that evan was progressing and on the point of sealing his chance the devoted lady resolved to hold her ground besides there was the picnic the countess had one dress she had not yet appeared in and it was for the picnic she kept it that small motives are at the bottom of many illustrious actions is a modern discovery but i shall not adopt the modern principle of magnifying the small motive till it overshadows my noble heroine i remember that the small motive is only to be seen by being borne into the range of my vision by a powerful microscope and if i do more than seeif i carry on my reflections by the aid of the glass i arrive at conclusions that must be false men who dwarf human nature do this the gods are juster the countess though she wished to remain for the picnic and felt warm in anticipation of the homage to her new dress was still a gallant general and a devoted sister and if she said to herself come what may i will stay for that picnic and they shall not browbeat me out of it it is that trifling pleasures are noisiest about the heart of human nature not that they govern us absolutely there is mobrule in minds as in communities but the countess had her appetites in excellent drill this picnic surrendered represented to her defeat in all its ignominy the largest longestheaded of schemes ask occasionally for something substantial and immediate so the countess stipulated with providence for the picnic it was a point to be passed thorough flood thorough fire in vain poor andrew cogglesby to whom the dinner had been torture and who was beginning to see the position they stood in at beckley begged to be allowed to take them away or to go alone the countess laughed him into submission as a consequence of her audacious spirits she grew more charming and more natural and the humour that she possessed but which like her other faculties was usually subordinate to her plans gave spontaneous bursts throughout the day and delighted her courtiers nor did the men at all dislike the difference of her manner with them and with the ladies i may observe that a woman who shows a marked depression in the presence of her own sex will be thought very superior by ours that is supposing she is clever and agreeable manhood distinguishes what flatters it a lady approaches we must be proper says the countess and her hearty laugh dies with suddenness and is succeeded by the maturest gravity and the countess can look a profound merriment with perfect sedateness when there appears to be an equivoque in company finely secret are her glances as if under every eyelash there lurked the shade of a meaning what she meant was not so clear all this was going on and lady jocelyn was simply amused and sat as at a play she seems to have stepped out of a book of french memoirs said her ladyship la vie galante et devotevoila la comtesse in contradistinction to the other ladies she did not detest the countess because she could not like her where s the harm in her she asked she doesnt damage the men that i can see and a person you can laugh at and with is inexhaustible and how long is she to stay here mrs shorne inquired mrs melville remarking her visit appears to be inexhaustible i suppose shell stay till the election business is over said lady jocelyn the countess had just driven with melville to fallow field in carolines black lace shawl upwards of four weeks longer mrs melville interjected lady jocelyn chuckled miss carrington was present she had been formerly sharp in her condemnation of the countessher affectedness her euphuism and her vulgarity now she did not say a word though she might have done it with impunity i suppose emily you see what rose is about said mrs melville i should not have thought it adviseable to have that young man here myself i think i let you know that one young mans as good as another responded her ladyship i ve my doubts of the one thats much better i fancy rose is as good a judge by this time as you or i mrs melville made an effort or two to open lady jocelyns eyes and then relapsed into the confident serenity inspired by evil prognostications but there really does seem some infatuation about these people exclaimed mrs shorne turning to miss current can you understand it the duke my dear things seem to be going on in the house that really and so openly thats one virtue said miss current with her imperturbable metallic voice and face like a cold clear northern sky things done in secret throw on the outsiders the onus of raising a scandal you dont believe then suggested mrs shorne miss current replied i always wait for a thing to happen first but havent you seen my dear i never see anything my dear then you must be blind my dear on the contrary that s how i keep my sight my dear i dont understand you said mrs shorne its a part of the science of optics and requires study said miss current neither with the worldly nor the unworldly woman could the ladies do anything but they were soon to have their triumph a delicious morning had followed the lovely night the stream flowed under evans eyes like something in a lower sphere now his passion took him up as if a genie had lifted him into midair and showed him the world on a palm of a hand and yet as he dressed by the window little chinks in the garden wall and nectarines under their shiny leaves and the white walks of the garden were stamped on his hot brain accurately and lastingly ruth upon the lips of rose that voice of living constancy made music to him everywhere thy god shall be my god he had heard it all through the night he had not yet broken the tender charm sufficiently to think that he must tell her the sacrifice she would have to make when partly he did the first excuse he clutched at was that he had not even kissed her on the forehead surely he had been splendidly chivalrous just as surely he would have brought on himself the scorn of the chivalrous or of the commonly balanced if he had been otherwise the grandeur of this or of any of his proceedings then was forfeited as it must needs be when we are in the false position we can have no glory though martyred the youth felt it even to the seeing of why it was and he resolved in justice to the dear girl that he would break loose from his fetters as we call our weakness behold rose met him descending the stairs and taking his hand sang unabashed by the telltale colour coming over her face a stave of a little portuguese air that they had both been fond of in portugal and he listening to it and looking in her eyes saw that his feelings in the old time had been hers instantly the old time gave him its breath the present drew back rose now that she had given her heart out had no idea of concealment she would have denied nothing to her aunts she was ready to confide it to her mother was she not proud of the man she loved when evans hand touched hers she retained it and smiled up at him frankly as it were to make him glad in her gladness if before others his eyes brought the blood to her cheeks she would perhaps drop her eyelids an instant and then glance quickly level again to reassure him and who would have thought that this boisterous boyish creature had such depths of eye cold did they call her let others think her cold the tender knowledge of herthe throbbing secret they held in common sang at his heart rose made no confidante but she attempted no mystery evan should have risen to the height of the noble girl but the dearer and sweeter her bearing became the more conscious he was of the dead weight he was dragging in truth her behaviour stamped his false position to hard print the more he admired her for it and he had shrinkings from the feminine part it imposed on him to play chapter xxv in which the stream flows muddy and clear an irish retrieverpup of the shannon breed pat by name was undergoing tuition on the sward close by the kennels roses huntingwhip being passed through his collar to restrain erratic propensities the particular point of instruction which now made poor pat hang out his tongue and agitate his crisp brown curls was the performance of the downcharge a ceremony demanding implicit obedience from the animal in the midst of volatile gambadoes and a simulation of profound repose when his desire to be up and bounding was mighty pats irish eyes were watching rose as he lay with his head couched between his forepaws in the required attitude he had but half learnt his lesson and something in his halfhumorous halfmelancholy look talked to rose more eloquently than her friend ferdinand at her elbow laxley was her assistant dog breaker rose would not abandon her friends because she had accepted a lover on the contrary rose was very kind to ferdinand and perhaps felt bound to be so today today also her face was lighted a readiness to colour and an expression of deeper knowledge which she now had made the girl dangerous to friends this was not roses fault but there is no doubt among the faculty that love is a contagious disease and we ought not to come within miles of the creatures in whom it lodges pats tail kept hinting to his mistress that a change would afford him satisfaction after a time she withdrew her wistful gaze from him and listened entirely to ferdinand and it struck her that he spoke particularly well today though she did not see so much in his eyes as in pats the subject concerned his departure and he asked rose if she should be sorry rose to make him sure of it threw a music into her voice dangerous to friends for she had given heart and soul to evan and had a sense therefore of being irredeemably in debt to her old associates and wished to be doubly kind to them pat took advantage of the diversion to stand up quietly and have a shake he then began to kiss his mistresss hand to show that all was right on both sides and followed this with a playful pretence at a bite that there might be no subsequent misunderstanding and then a bark and a whine as no attention was paid to this amount of plainspeaking pat made a bolt he got no farther than the length of the whip and all he gained was to bring on himself the terrible word of drill once more but pat had tasted liberty irish rebellion against constituted authority was exhibited pat would not his ears tossed over his head and he jumped to right and left and looked the raggedest rapparee that ever his ancestry trotted after rose laughed at his fruitless efforts to get free but ferdinand meditatively appeared to catch a sentiment in them downcharge sir will you ah pat pat youll have to obey me my boy now downcharge while rose addressed the language of reason to pat ferdinand slipped in a soft word or two presently she saw him on one knee pat wont and i will said he but pat shall and you had better not said she besides my dear ferdinand she added laughing you dont know how to do it do you want me to prostrate on all fours rose no i hope not do get up ferdinand youll be seen from the windows instead of quitting his posture he caught her hand and scared her with a declaration of all men you to be on your knees and to me ferdinand she cried in discomfort why shouldnt i rose was this youths answer he had got the idea that foreign cavalier manners would take with her but it was not so easy to make his speech correspond with his posture and he lost his opportunity which was pretty however he spoke plain english the interview ended by rose releasing pat from drill and running off in a hurry where was evan she must have his consent to speak to her mother and prevent a recurrence of these silly scenes evan was with caroline his sister it was contrary to the double injunction of the countess that caroline should receive evan during her absence or that he should disturb the dear invalid with a visit these two were not unlike both in organization and character and they had not sat together long before they found each other out now to further evans lovesuit the countess had induced caroline to continue yet awhile in the purgatory beckley court had become to her but evan in speaking of rose expressed a determination to leave her and caroline caught at it can youwill you oh dear van have you the courage ilook at meyou know the home i go to andand i think of it here as a place to be happy in what have our marriages done for us better that we had married simple stupid men who earn their bread and would not have been ashamed of us and my dearest it is not only that none can tell what our temptations are louisa has strength but i feel i have none and though dear for your true interest i would indeed sacrifice myself i would van i wouldit is not good for you to stayi know it is not for you have papas sense of honourand oh if you should learn to despise me my dear brother she kissed him her nerves were agitated by strong mental excitement he attributed it to her recent attack of illness but could not help asking while he caressed her whats that despise you it may have been that caroline felt then that to speak of something was to forfeit something a light glimmered across the dewy blue of her beautiful eyes desire to breathe it to him and have his loving aid the fear of forfeiting it evil as it was to her and at the bottom of all that doubt we choose to encourage of the harm in a pleasant sin unaccomplished these might be read in the rich dim gleam that swept like sunlight over seawater between breaks of clouds dear van do you love her so much caroline knew too well that she was shutting her own theme with iron clasps when she once touched on evans love her love rose it became an endless carol with evan caroline sighed for him from her heart you knowyou understand me dont you he said after a breathless excursion of his fancy i believe you love her dear i think i have never loved any one but my one brother his love for rose he could pour out to caroline when it came to roses love for him his blood thickened and his tongue felt guilty he must speak to her he saidtell her all yes tell her all echoed caroline do do tell her trust a woman utterly if she loves you dear go to her instantly could you bear it said evan he began to think it was for the sake of his sisters that he had hesitated bear it bear anything rather than perpetual imposture what have i not borne tell her and then if she is cold to you let us go let us go i shall be glad to ah van i love you so carolines voice deepened i love you so my dear you wont let your new love drive me out shall you always love me of that she might be sure whatever happened should you love me van if evil befel me thrice as well he swore to her but if iif i van oh my life is intolerable supposing i should ever disgrace you in any way and not turn out all you fancied me i am very weak and unhappy evan kissed her confidently with a warm smile he said a few words of the great faith he had in her words that were bitter comfort to caroline this brother who might save her to him she dared not speak did she wish to be saved she only knew that to wound evans sense of honour and the high and chivalrous veneration for her sex and pride in himself and those of his blood would be wicked and unpardonable and that no earthly pleasure could drown it thinking this with her hands joined in pale dejection caroline sat silent and evan left her to lay bare his heart to rose on his way to find rose he was stopped by the announcement of the arrival of mr raikes who thrust a bundle of notes into his hand and after speaking loudly of his curricle retired on important business as he said with a mysterious air i m beaten in many things but not in the article luck he remarked you will hear of me though hardly as a tutor in this academy scanning the bundle of notes without a reflection beyond the thought that money was in his hand and wondering at the apparition of the curricle evan was joined by harry jocelyn and harry linked his arm in evans and plunged with extraordinary spontaneity and candour into the state of his money affairs what the deuce he was to do for money he did not know from the impressive manner in which he put it it appeared to be one of natures great problems that the whole human race were bound to set their heads together to solve a hundred poundsharry wanted no more and he could not get it his uncles they were as poor as rats and all the spare money they could club was going for mels election expenses a hundred and fifty was what harry really wanted but he could do with a hundred ferdinand who had plenty would not even lend him fifty ferdinand had dared to hint at a debt already unsettled and he called himself a gentleman you wouldnt speak of moneymatters now would you harrington i dislike the subject i confess said evan and so do i harry jumped at the perfect similarity between them you cant think how it bothers one to have to talk about it you and i are tremendously alike evan might naturally suppose that a subject harry detested he would not continue but for a whole hour harry turned it over and over with grim glances at jewry you see he wound up im in a fix i want to help that poor girl and one or two things it s for that you want it cried evan brightening to him accept it from me it is a thing familiar to the experience of moneyborrowers that your last chance is the man who is to accommodate you but we are always astonished nevertheless and harry was when notes to the amount of the largest sum named by him were placed in his hand by one whom he looked upon as the last to lend what a trump you are harrington was all he could say and then he was for hurrying evan into the house to find pen and paper and write down a memorandum of the loan but evan insisted upon sparing him the trouble though harry with the admirable scruples of an inveterate borrower begged hard to be allowed to bind himself legally to repay the money pon my soul harrington you make me remember i once doubted whether you were one of usrather your own fault you know said harry bury that wont you till your doubts recur evan observed and harry burst out gad if you werent such a melancholy beggar youd be the jolliest fellow i know there go after rosey dashed if i dont think youre ahead of ferdinand long chalks your style does for girls i like women with a chuckle and a wink harry swungoff evan had now to reflect that he had just thrown away part of the price of his bondage to tailordom the mention of rose filled his mind where was she both were seeking one another rose was in the cypress walk he saw the starlike figure up the length of it between the swelling tall dark pillars and was hurrying to her resolute not to let one minute of deception blacken further the soul that loved so true a soul she saw him and stood smiling when the countess issued shadowlike from a side path and declared that she must claim her brother for a few instants would her sweet rose pardon her rose bowed coolly the hearts of the lovers were chilled not that they perceived any malice in the countess but their keen instincts felt an evil fate the countess had but to tell evan that she had met the insolvent in apples and recognized him under his change of fortune and had no doubt that at least he would amuse the company then she asked her brother the superfluous question whether he loved her which evan answered satisfactorily enough as he thought but practical ladies require proofs quick said evan seeing rose vanish what do you want ill do anything anything ah but this will be disagreeable to you name it at once i promise beforehand the countess wanted evan to ask andrew to be the very best brotherinlaw in the world and win unknown to himself her cheerful thanks by lending evan to lend to her the sum of one hundred pounds as she was in absolute distress for money really louisa this is a thing you might ask him yourself evan remonstrated it would not become me to do so dear said the countess demurely and inasmuch as she had already drawn on andrew in her own person pretty largely her views of propriety were correct in this instance evan had to consent before he could be released he ran to the end of the walk through the portal into the park rose was not to be seen she had gone in to dress for dinner the opportunity might recur but would his courage come with it his courage had sunk on a sudden or it may have been that it was worst for this young man to ask for a loan of money than to tell his beloved that he was basely born vile and unworthy and had snared her into loving him for when he and andrew were together money was not alluded to andrew however betrayed remarkable discomposure he said plainly that he wanted to leave beckley court and wondered why he didnt leave and whether he was on his head or his feet and how he had been such a fool as to come do you mean that for me said sensitive evan oh you youre a young buck returned andrew evasively we commonplace business menwe re out of our element and theres poor carry cant sit down to their dinners without an upset i thank god im a radical van one mans the same as another to me how hes born as long as hes honest and agreeable but a chap like that george uplift to look down on anybody gad ive a good mind to bring in a bill for the abolition of the squirearchy ultimately andrew somehow contrived to stick a hint or two about the terrible dinner in evans quivering flesh he did it as delicately as possible half begging pardon and perspiring profusely evan grasped his hand and thanked him carolines illness was now explained to him ill take caroline with me tomorrow he said louisa wishes to stay there s a picnic will you look to her and bring her with you my dear van replied andrew stop with louisa now in confidence its as bad as a couple of wives no disrespect to my excellent good harry at home but louisai dont know how it isbut louisa you lose your head youre in a whirl youre an automaton a teetotum i havent a notion of what ive been doing or saying since i came here my belief is i ve been lying right and left i shall be found out to a certainty oh if shes made her mind up for the picnic somebody must stop i can only tell you van its one perpetual vapourbath to me there ll be room for two in my trousers when i get back i shall have to get the tailor to take them in a full half here occurred an opening for one of those acrid pleasantries which console us when there is horrid warfare within you must give me the work said evan partly pleased with his hated self for being able to jest on the subject as a piece of preliminary selfconquest aha went andrew as if the joke were too good to be dwelt on hem and by way of diverting from it cleverly and naturally he remarked that the weather was fine this made evan allude to his letter written from lymport upon which andrew said tush pish humbug nonsense wont hear a word dont know anything about it van youre going to be a brewer i say you are youre afraid you cant i tell you sir ive got a bet on it youre not going to make me lose are youeh i have and a stiff bet too you must and shall so theres an end only we cant make arrangements just yet my boy old tomvery good old fellow but you knowmust get old tom out of the way first now go and dress for dinner and lord preserve us from the great mel today andrew mumbled as he turned away evan could not reach his chamber without being waylaid by the countess had he remembered the sister who sacrificed so much for him there there cried evan and her hand closed on the delicious golden whispers of banknotes and oh generous andrew dear good evan were the exclamations of the gratified lady there remained nearly another hundred evan laid out the notes and eyed them while dressing they seemed to say to him we have you now he was clutched by a beneficent or a most malignant magician the former seemed due to him considering the cloud on his fortunes this enigma might mean that by submitting to a temporary humiliation for a trial of himin fact by his acknowledgement of the fact loathed though it was he won a secret overlookers esteem gained a powerful ally here was the proof he held the proof he had read arabian tales and could believe in marvels especially could he believe in the friendliness of a magical thing that astounded without hurting him he sat down in his room at night and wrote a fairly manful letter to rose and it is to be said of the wretch he then saw himself that he pardoned her for turning from so vile a pretender he heard a step in the passage it was polly wheedle polly had put her young mistress to bed and was retiring to her own slumbers he made her take the letter and promise to deliver it immediately would not tomorrow morning do she asked as miss rose was very sleepy he seemed to hesitatehe was picturing how rose looked when very sleepy why should he surrender this darling and subtler questionwhy should he make her unhappy why disturb her at all in her sweet sleep well said evan tomorrow will dono take it tonight for gods sake he cried as one who bursts the spell of an opiate go at once the temptation had almost overcome him polly thought his proceedings queer and what could the letter contain a declaration of course she walked slowly along the passage meditating on love and remotely on its slave mr nicholas frim nicholas had never written her a letter but she was determined that he should some day she wondered what loveletters were like like valentines without the cupids practical valentines one might say not vapoury and wild but hot and to the point delightful things no harm in peeping at a loveletter if you do it with the eye of a friend polly spelt just a word when a door opened at her elbow she dropped her candle and curtsied to the countesss voice the countess desired her to enter and all in a tremble polly crept in her air of guilt made the countess thrill she had merely called her in to extract daily gossip the corner of the letter sticking up under pollys neck attracted her strangely and beginning with the familiar well child she talked of things interesting to polly and then exhibited the picnic dress it was a lovely halfmourning airy sorrows gauzy griefs you might imagine to constitute the wearer white delicately striped exquisitely trimmed and of a stuff to make the feminine mouth water could polly refuse to try it on when the flattering proposal met her ears blushing shamefaced adoring the lady who made her look adorable polly tried it on and the countess complimented her and made a doll of her and turned her this way and that way and intoxicated her a rich husband polly child and you are a lady ready made infamous poison to poor polly but as the thunder destroys small insects exalted schemers are to be excused for riding down their few thousands moreover the countess really looked upon domestics as being only half souls dressed in her own attire again polly felt in her pockets and at her bosom and sang out oh myoh where oh the letter was lost the letter could not be found the countess grew extremely fatigued and had to dismiss polly in spite of her eager petitions to be allowed to search under the carpets and inside the bed in the morning came evans great trial there stood rose she turned to him and her eyes were happy and unclouded you are not changed he said changed what could change me the god of true hearts bless her he could hardly believe it you are the rose i knew yesterday yes evan but youyou look as if you had not slept you will not leave me this morning before i go rose oh my darling this that you do for me is the work of an angelnothing less i have been a coward and my beloved to feel vile is agony to meit makes me feel unworthy of the hand i press now all is clear between us i go i am forgiven rose repeated his last words and then added hurriedly all is clear between us shall i speak to mama this morning dear evan it will be right that i should for the moment he could not understand why but supposing a scrupulous honesty in her said yes tell lady jocelyn all and then evan you will never need to go they separated the deeptoned sentence sang in evans heart rose and her mother were of one stamp and rose might speak for her mother to take the hands of such a pair and be lifted out of the slough he thought no shame and all through the hours of the morning the image of two angels stooping to touch a leper pressed on his brain like a reality and went divinely through his blood toward midday rose beckoned to him and led him out across the lawn into the park and along the borders of the stream evan she said shall i really speak to mama you have not yet he answered no i have been with juliana and with drummond look at this evan she showed a small black speck in the palm of her hand which turned out on your viewing it closely to be a brand of the letter l mama did that when i was a little girl because i told lies i never could distinguish between truth and falsehood and mama set that mark on me and i have never told a lie since she forgives anything but that she will be our friend she will never forsake us evan if we do not deceive her oh evan it never is of any use but deceive her and she cannot forgive you it is not in her nature evan paused before he replied you have only to tell her what i have told you you know everything rose gave him a flying look of pain everything evan what do i know ah rose do you compel me to repeat it bewildered rose thought have i slept and forgotten it he saw the persistent grieved interrogation of her eyebrows well she sighed resignedly i am yours you know that evan but he was a lover and quarrelled with her sigh it may well make you sad now rose sad no that does not make me sad no but my hands are tied i cannot defend you or justify myself and induce mama to stand by us oh evan you love me why can you not open your heart to me entirely and trust me more cried evan can i trust you more he spoke of the letter rose caught his hand i never had it evan you wrote it last night and all was written in it i never saw itbut i know all their eyes fronted the gates of roses were wide open and he saw no hurtful beasts or lurking snakes in the happy garden within but love like a fixed star then you know why i must leave rose leave leave me on the contrary you must stay by me and support me why evan we have to fight a battle much as he worshipped her this intrepid directness of soul startled him almost humbled him and her eyes shone with a firm cheerful light as she exclaimed it makes me so happy to think you were the first to mention this you meant to be and thats the same thing i heard it this morning you wrote it last night its you i love evan your birth and what you were obliged to dothats nothing of course im sorry for it dear but im more sorry for the pain i must have sometimes put you to it happened through my mothers father being a merchant and that side of the family the men and women are quite sordid and unendurable and thats how it came that i spoke of disliking tradesmen i little thought i should ever love one sprung from that class she turned to him tenderly and in spite of what my birth is you love me rose theres no spite in it evan i do hard for him while his heart was melting to caress her the thought that he had snared this bird of heaven in a net rose gave him no time for reflection or the moony imagining of their raptures lovers love to dwell upon you gave the letter to polly of course yes oh naughty polly i must punish you rose apostrophized her you might have divided us for ever well we shall have to fight a battle you understand that will you stand by me would he not risk his soul for her very well evan thenbut dont be sensitive oh how sensitive you are i see it all now this is what we shall have to do we shall have to speak to mama todaythis morning drummond has told me he is going to speak to her and we must be first that s decided i begged a couple of hours you must not be offended with drummond he does it out of pure affection for us and i can see hes rightor at least not quite wrong he ought i think to know that he cannot change me very well we shall win mama by what we do my mother has ten times my wits and yet i manage her like a feather i have only to be honest and straightforward then mama will gain over papa papa of course wont like it hes quiet and easy but he likes blood but he also likes peace better and i think he loves roseyas well as somebodyalmost look dear there is our seat where wewhere you would rob me of my handkerchief i cant talk any more rose had suddenly fallen from her prattle soft and shortbreathed then dear she went on we shall have to fight the family aunt shorne will be terrible my poor uncles i pity them but they will come round they always have thought what i did was right and why should they change their minds now i shall tell them that at their time of life a change of any kind is very unwise and bad for them then there is grandmama bonner she can hurt us really if she pleases oh my dear evan if you had only been a curate why isnt your name parsley then my grandmama the countess of elburne well we have a countess on our side havent we and that reminds me evan if were to be happy and succeed you must promise one thing you will not tell the countess your sister dont confide this to her will you promise evan assured her he was not in the habit of pouring secrets into any bosom the countesss as little as anothers very well then evan its unpleasant while it lasts but we shall gain the day uncle melville will give you an appointment and then yes rose he said i will do this though i dont think you can know what i shall have to endurenot in confessing what i am but in feeling that i have brought you to my level does it not raise me she cried he shook his head but in reality evanapart from mere appearancesin reality it does it does men will not think so rose nor can i oh my rose how different you make me up to this hour i have been so weak torn two ways you give me double strength then these lovers talked of distant dayscompared their feelings on this and that occasion with mutual wonder and delight then the old hours lived anew anddid you really think that evan andoh rose was that your dream and the meaning of that bygone look was it what they fancied and such and such a tone of voice would it bear the wished interpretation thus does love avenge himself on the unsatisfactory past and call out its essence could evan do less than adore her she knew all and she loved him since he was too shy to allude more than once to his letter it was natural that he should not ask her how she came to know and how much the all that she knew comprised in his letter he had told all the condition of his parents and his own honestly now what with his dazzled state of mind his deep inward happiness and loves endless delusions he abstained from touching the subject further honestly therefore as far as a lover can be honest so they toyed and then rose setting her fingers loose whispered are you ready and evan nodded and rose to make him think light of the matter in hand laughed pluck not quite up yet quite my rose said evan and they walked to the house not quite knowing what they were going to do on the steps they met drummond with mrs evremonde little imagining how heart and heart the two had grown and that evan would understand him drummond called to rose playfully times up is it rose answered and to mrs evremonde give drummond a walk poor drummond is going silly evan looked into his eyes calmly as he passed where are you going rose said mrs evremonde going to give my maid polly a whipping for losing a letter she ought to have delivered to me last night said rose in a loud voice looking at drummond and then going to mama pleasure firstduty after isnt that the proverb drummond she kissed her fingers rather scornfully to her old friend etext editors bookmarks admirable scruples of an inveterate borrower an obedient creature enough where he must be bound to assure everybody at table he was perfectly happy confident serenity inspired by evil prognostications enamoured young men have these notions gossip always has some solid foundation however small he kept saying to himself tomorrow i will tell i always wait for a thing to happen first i never see anything my dear love is a contagious disease never to despise the good opinion of the nonentities one seed of a piece of folly will lurk and sprout to confound us secrets throw on the outsiders the onus of raising a scandal she did not detest the countess because she could not like her thus does love avenge himself on the unsatisfactory past touching a nerve unfeminine of any woman to speak continuously anywhere vulgarity in others evoked vulgarity in her
