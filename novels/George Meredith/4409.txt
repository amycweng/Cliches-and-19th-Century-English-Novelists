and david widger widgercecometnet the ordeal of richard feverel by george meredith book xxviii relates how preparations for action were conducted under the april of lovers xix in which the last act of the comedy takes the place of the first xxx celebrates the breakfast xxxi the philosopher appears in person xxxii procession of the cake xxxiii nursing the devil chapter xxviii beauty of course is for the hero nevertheless it is not always he on whom beauty works its most conquering influence it is the dull commonplace man into whose slow brain she drops like a celestial light and burns lastingly the poet for instance is a connoisseur of beauty to the artist she is a model these gentlemen by much contemplation of her charms wax critical the days when they had hearts being gone they are haply divided between the blonde and the brunette the aquiline nose and the proserpine this shaped eye and that but go about among simple unprofessional fellows boors dunderheads and here and there you shall find some barbarous intelligence which has had just strength enough to conceive and has taken beauty as its goddess and knows but one form to worship in its poor stupid fashion and would perish for her nay more the man would devote all his days to her though he is dumb as a dog and indeed he is beautys dog almost every beauty has her dog the hero possesses her the poet proclaims her the painter puts her upon canvas and the faithful old dog follows her and the end of it all is that the faithful old dog is her single attendant sir hero is revelling in the wars or in armidas bowers mr poet has spied a wrinkle the brush is for the rose in its season she turns to her old dog then she hugs him and he who has subsisted on a bone and a pat till there he squats decrepit he turns his grateful old eyes up to her and has not a notion that she is hugging sad memories in him hero poet painter in one scrubby one then is she buried and the village hears languid howls and there is a paragraph in the newspapers concerning the extraordinary fidelity of an old dog excited by suggestive recollections of nooredeen and the fair persian and the change in the obscure monotony of his life by his having quarters in a crack hotel and living familiarly with westend peopleliving on the fat of the land which forms a stout portion of an honest youths romance ripton thompson breakfasted next morning with his chief at halfpast eight the meal had been fixed overnight for seven but ripton slept a great deal more than the nightingale and to chronicle his exact state even halfpast eight rather afflicted his new aristocratic senses and reminded him too keenly of law and bondage he had preferred to breakfast at algernons hour who had left word for eleven him however it was richards object to avoid so they fell to and ripton no longer envied hippias in bed breakfast done they bequeathed the consoling information for algernon that they were off to hear a popular preacher and departed how happy everybody looks said richard in the quiet sunday streets yesjolly said ripton when imwhen this is over ill see that they are tooas many as i can make happy said the hero adding softly her blind was down at a quarter to six i think she slept well youve been there this morning ripton exclaimed and an idea of what love was dawned upon his dull brain will she see me ricky yes shell see you today she was tired last night positively richard assured him that the privilege would be his here he said coming under some trees in the park heres where i talked to you last night what a time it seems how i hate the night on the way that richard might have an exalted opinion of him ripton hinted decorously at a somewhat intimate and mysterious acquaintance with the sex headings of certain random adventures he gave well said his chief why not marry her then was ripton shocked and cried oh and had a taste of the feeling of superiority destined that day to be crushed utterly he was again deposited in mrs berrys charge for a term that caused him dismal fears that the fair persian still refused to show her face but richard called out to him and up ripton went unaware of the transformation he was to undergo hero and beauty stood together to receive him from the bottom of the stairs he had his vivaciously agreeable smile ready for them and by the time he entered the room his cheeks were painfully stiff and his eyes had strained beyond their exact meaning lucy with one hand anchored to her lover welcomed him kindly he relieved her shyness by looking so extremely silly they sat down and tried to commence a conversation but ripton was as little master of his tongue as he was of his eyes after an interval the fair persian having done duty by showing herself was glad to quit the room her lord and possessor then turned inquiringly to ripton you dont wonder now rip he said no richard ripton waited to reply with sufficient solemnity indeed i dont he spoke differently he looked differently he had the old dogs eyes in his head they watched the door she had passed through they listened for her as dogs eyes do when she came in bonneted for a walk his agitation was doglike when she hung on her lover timidly and went forth he followed without an idea of envy or anything save the secret raptures the sight of her gave him which are the old dogs own for beneficent nature requites him his sensations cannot be heroic but they have a fulness and a wagging delight as good in their way and this capacity for humble unaspiring worship has its peculiar guerdon when ripton comes to think of miss random now what will he think of himself let no one despise the old dog through him doth beauty vindicate her sex it did not please ripton that others should have the bliss of beholding her and as to his perceptions everybody did and observed her offensively and stared and turned their heads back and interchanged comments on her and became in a minute madly in love with her he had to smother low growls they strolled about the pleasant gardens of kensington all the morning under the young chestnut buds and round the windless waters talking and soothing the wild excitement of their hearts if lucy spoke ripton pricked up his ears she too made the remark that everybody seemed to look happy and he heard it with thrills of joy so everybody is where you are he would have wished to say if he dared but was restrained by fears that his burning eloquence would commit him ripton knew the people he met twice it would have been difficult to persuade him they were the creatures of accident from the gardens in contempt of riptons frowned protest richard boldly struck into the park where solitary carriages were beginning to perform the circuit here ripton had some justification for his jealous pangs the young girls golden locks of hair her sweet now dreamily sad face her gentle graceful figure in the black straight dress she wore a sort of halfconventual air she hada mark of something not of class that was partly beautys partly maiden innocence growing conscious partly remorse at her weakness and dim fear of the future it was sowingdid attract the eyeglasses ripton had to learn that eyes are bearable but eyeglasses an abomination they fixed a spell upon his courage for somehow the youth had always ranked them as emblems of our nobility and hearing two exquisite eyeglasses who had been to front and rear several times drawl in gibberish generally imputed to lords that his heroine was a charming little creature just the size but had no stylehe was abashed he did not fly at them and tear them he became dejected beautys dog is affected by the eyeglass in a manner not unlike the common animals terror of the human eye richard appeared to hear nothing or it was homage that he heard he repeated to lucy diaper sandoes verses the cockneys nod to each other aside the coxcombs lift their glasses and projected hiring a horse for her to ride every day in the park and shine among the highest they had turned to the west against the sky glittering through the bare trees across the water and the brightedged rack the lover his imagination just then occupied in clothing earthly glories in celestial felt where his senses were sharpest the hand of his darling falter and instinctively looked ahead his uncle algernon was leisurely jolting towards them on his one sound leg the dismembered guardsman talked to a friend whose arm supported him and speculated from time to time on the fair ladies driving by the two white faces passed him unobserved unfortunately ripton coming behind went plump upon the captains live toeor so he pretended crying confound it mr thompson you might have chosen the other the horrible apparition did confound ripton who stammered that it was extraordinary not at all said algernon everybody makes up to that fellow instinct i suppose he had not to ask for his nephew richard turned to face the matter sorry i couldnt wait for you this morning uncle he said with the coolness of relationship i thought you never walked so far his voice was in perfect tonethe heroic mask admirable algernon examined the downcast visage at his side and contrived to allude to the popular preacher he was instantly introduced to riptons sister miss thompson the captain bowed smiling melancholy approval of his nephews choice of a minister after a few stray remarks and an affable salute to miss thompson he hobbled away and then the three sealed volcanoes breathed and lucys arm ceased to be squeezed quite so much up to the heroic pitch this incident quickened their steps homeward to the sheltering wings of mrs berry all that passed between them on the subject comprised a stammered excuse from ripton for his conduct and a goodhumoured rejoinder from richard that he had gained a sister by it at which ripton ventured to wish aloud miss desborough would only think so and a faint smile twitched poor lucys lips to please him she hardly had strength to reach her cage she had none to eat of mrs berrys nice little dinner to be alone that she might cry and ease her heart of its accusing weight of tears was all she prayed for kind mrs berry slipping into her bedroom to take off her things found the fair body in a fevered shudder and finished by undressing her completely and putting her to bed just an hours sleep or so the mellifluous woman explained the case to the two anxious gentlemen a quiet sleep and a cup of warm tea goes for more than twenty doctors it dowhen theres the flutters she pursued i know it by myself and a good cry beforehands better than the best of medicine she nursed them into a makebelieve of eating and retired to her softer charge and sweeter babe reflecting lord lord the three of em dont make fifty im as old as two and a half of em to say the least mrs berry used her apron and by virtue of their tender years took them all three into her heart left alone neither of the young men could swallow a morsel did you see the change come over her richard whispered ripton fiercely accused his prodigious stupidity the lover flung down his knife and fork what could i do if i had said nothing we should have been suspected i was obliged to speak and she hates a lie see it has struck her down god forgive me ripton affected a serene mind it was a fright richard he said thats what mrs berry means by flutters those old women talk in that way you heard what she said and these old women know ill tell you what it is its this richardits because youve got a fool for your friend she regrets it muttered the lover good god i think she fears me he dropped his face in his hands ripton went to the window repeating energetically for his comfort its because youve got a fool for your friend sombre grew the street they had last night aroused the sun was buried alive in cloud ripton saw himself no more in the opposite window he watched the deplorable objects passing on the pavement his aristocratic visions had gone like his breakfast beauty had been struck down by his egregious folly and there he stooda wretch richard came to him dont mumble on like that rip he said nobody blames you ah youre very kind richard interposed the wretch moved at the face of misery he beheld listen to me rip i shall take her home tonight yes if shes happier away from medo you think me a brute ripton rather than have her shed a tear idill take her home tonight ripton suggested that it was sudden adding from his larger experience people perhaps might talk the lover could not understand what they should talk about but he said if i give him who came for her yesterday the clue if no one sees or hears of me what can they say o rip ill give her up im wrecked for ever what of that yeslet them take her the world in arms should never have torn her from me but when she criesyes alls over ill find him at once he searched in outoftheway corners for the hat of resolve ripton looked on wretcheder than ever the idea struck himsuppose richard she doesnt want to go it was a moment when perhaps one who sided with parents and guardians and the old wise world might have inclined them to pursue their righteous wretched course and have given small cupid a smack and sent him home to his naughty mother alasit is the pilgrims scrip interjecting women are the born accomplices of mischief in bustles mrs berry to clear away the refection and finds the two knights helmed and sees though tis dusk that they wear doubtful brows and guesses bad things for her dear god hymen in a twinkling dear dear she exclaimed and neither of you eaten a scrap and theres my dear young lady off into the prettiest sleep you ever see ha cried the lover illuminated soft as a baby mrs berry averred i went to look at her this very moment and theres not a bit of trouble in her breath it come and it go like the sweetest regular instrument ever made the black ox havent trod on her foot yet most like it was the air of london but only fancy if you had called in a doctor why i shouldnt have let her take any of his quackery now there ripton attentively observed his chief and saw him doff his hat with a curious caution and peer into its recess from which during mrs berrys speech he drew forth a little glovedropped there by some freak of chance keep me keep me now you have me sang the little glove and amused the lover with a thousand conceits when will she wake do you think mrs berry he asked oh we mustnt go for disturbing her said the guileful good creature bless ye let her sleep it out and if you young gentlemen was to take my advice and go and take a walk for to get a appetiteeverybody should eat its their sacred duty no matter what their feelings be and i say it whom no chickenill frickashee thiswhich is a chickenagainst your return im a cook i can assure ye the lover seized her two hands youre the best old soul in the world he cried mrs berry appeared willing to kiss him we wont disturb her let her sleep keep her in bed mrs berry will you and well call to inquire after her this evening and come and see her tomorrow im sure youll be kind to her there there mrs berry was preparing to whimper i trust her to you you see goodbye you dear old soul he smuggled a handful of gold into her keeping and went to dine with his uncles happy and hungry before they reached the hotel they had agreed to draw mrs berry into their confidence telling her with embellishments all save their names so that they might enjoy the counsel and assistance of that trump of a woman and yet have nothing to fear from her lucy was to receive the name of letitia riptons youngest and bestlooking sister the heartless fellow proposed it in cruel mockery of an old weakness of hers letitia mused richard i like the name both begin with l theres something softwomanlikein the ls material ripton remarked that they looked like pounds on paper the lover roamed through his golden groves lucy feverel that sounds better i wonder where ralph is i should like to help him hes in love with my cousin clare hell never do anything till he marries no man can im going to do a hundred things when its over we shall travel first i want to see the alps one doesnt know what the earth is till one has seen the alps what a delight it will be to her i fancy i see her eyes gazing up at them and oh your dear blue eyes

a friend of my fathers i intend to find him and make them friends again you dont care for poetry its no use your trying to swallow it rip it sounds very nice said ripton modestly shutting his mouth the alps italy rome and then i shall go to the east the hero continued shes ready to go anywhere with me the dear brave heart oh the glorious golden east i dream of the desert i dream im chief of an arab tribe and we fly all white in the moonlight on our mares and hurry to the rescue of my darling and we push the spears and we scatter them and i come to the tent where she crouches and catch her to my saddle and awayrip what a life ripton strove to imagine he could enjoy it and then we shall come home and i shall lead austins life with her to help me first be virtuous rip and then serve your country heart and soul a wise man told me that i think i shall do something sunshine and cloud cloud and sunshine passed over the lover now life was a narrow ring now the distances extended were winged flew illimitably an hour ago and food was hateful now he manfully refreshed his nature and joined in algernons encomiums on miss letitia thompson meantime beauty slept watched by the veteran volunteer of the heros band lucy awoke from dreams which seemed reality to the reality which was a dream she awoke calling for some friend margaret and heard one say my name is bessy berry my love not margaret then she asked piteously where she was and where was margaret her dear friend and mrs berry whispered sure youve got a dearer ah sighed lucy sinking on her pillow overwhelmed by the strangeness of her state mrs berry closed the frill of her nightgown and adjusted the bedclothes quietly her name was breathed yes my love she said is he here hes gone my dear goneoh where the young girl started up in disorder gone to be back my love ah that young gentleman mrs berry chanted not a morsel have he eat not a drop have he drunk o mrs berry why did you not make him lucy wept for the faminestruck hero who was just then feeding mightily mrs berry explained that to make one eat who thought the darling of his heart like to die was a sheer impossibility for the cleverest of women and on this deep truth lucy reflected with her eyes wide at the candle she wanted one to pour her feelings out to she slid her hand from under the bedclothes and took mrs berrys and kissed it the good creature required no further avowal of her secret but forthwith leaned her consummate bosom to the pillow and petitioned heaven to bless them boththen the little bride was alarmed and wondered how mrs berry could have guessed it why said mrs berry your love is out of your eyes and out of everything ye do and the little bride wondered more she thought she had been so very cautious not to betray it the common woman in them made cheer together after their own april fashion following which mrs berry probed for the sweet particulars of this beautiful lovematch but the little brides lips were locked she only said her lover was above her in station and youre a catholic my dear yes mrs berry and him a protestant yes mrs berry dear dearand why shouldnt ye be she ejaculated seeing sadness return to the bridal babe so as you was born so shall ye be but youll have to make your arrangements about the children the girls to worship with yet the boys with him its the same god my dear you mustnt blush at it though you do look so pretty if my young gentleman could see you now please mrs berry lucy murmured why he will you know my dear oh please mrs berry and you that cant bear the thoughts of it well i do wish there was fathers and mothers on both sides and dockments signed and bridesmaids and a breakfast but love is love and ever will be in spite of them she made other and deeper dives into the little heart but though she drew up pearls they were not of the kind she searched for the one fact that hung as a fruit upon her tree of love lucy had given her she would not in fealty to her lover reveal its growth and history however sadly she yearned to pour out all to this dear old mother confessor her conduct drove mrs berry from the rosy to the autumnal view of matrimony generally heralded by the announcement that it is a lottery and when you see your ticket said mrs berry you shant know whether its a prize or a blank and lord knows some go on thinking its a prize when it turns on em and tears em im one of the blanks my dear i drew a blank in berry he was a black berry to me my dear smile away he truly was and i aprizin him as proud as you can conceive my dear mrs berry pressed her hands flat on her apron we hadnt been a three months man and wife when that manit wasnt the honeymoon which some cant saythat manyes he kicked me his wedded wife he kicked ah she sighedto lucys large eyes i could have borne that a blow dont touch the heart the poor creature tapped her sensitive side i went on loving of him for im a soft one tall as a grenadier he is and when out of service grows his moustache i used to call him my bodyguardsman like a queen i flattered him like the fools we women are for take my word for it my dear theres nothing here below so vain as a man that i know but i didnt deserve it im a superior cook i did not deserve that noways mrs berry thumped her knee and accentuated up her climax i mended his linen i saw to his adornmentshe called his clothes the bad man i was a servant to him my dear and thereit was nine monthsnine months from the day he swear to protect and cherish and thatnine calendar months and my gentleman is off with another woman bone of his bonepish exclaimed mrs berry reckoning her wrongs over vividly heres my ring a pretty ornament what do it mean im for tearin it off my finger a dozen times in the day its a symbol i call it a tomfoolery for the deadalive to wear it thats a widow and not a widow and havent got a name for what she is in any dixonary ive looked my dear andshe spread out her armsjohnson havent got a name for me at this impressive woe mrs berrys voice quavered into sobs lucy spoke gentle words to the poor outcast from johnson the sorrows of autumn have no warning for april the little bride for all her tender pity felt happier when she had heard her landladys moving tale of the wickedness of man which cast in bright relief the glory of that one hero who was hers then from a short flight of inconceivable bliss she fell shot by one of her hundred arguseyed fears o mrs berry im so young think of meonly just seventeen mrs berry immediately dried her eyes to radiance young my dear nonsense theres no so much harm in being young here and there i knew an irish lady was married at fourteen her daughter married close over fourteen she was a grandmother by thirty when any strange man began she used to ask him what pattern caps grandmothers wore theyd stare bless you the grandmother could have married over and over again it was her daughters fault not hers you know she was three years younger mused lucy she married beneath her my dear ran off with her fathers bailiffs son ah berry shed say if i hadnt been foolish i should be my lady nownot granny her father never forgave herleft all his estates out of the family did her husband always love her lucy preferred to know in his way my dear he did said mrs berry coming upon her matrimonial wisdom he couldnt help himself if he left off he began again she was so clever and did make him so comfortable cook there wasnt such another cook out of a aldermans kitchen no indeed and she a born lady that tells ye its the duty of all women she had her saying when the parlour fire gets low put coals on the ketchen fire and a good saying it is to treasure such is man no use in havin their hearts if ye dont have their stomachs perceiving that she grew abstruse mrs berry added briskly you know nothing about that yet my dear only mind me and mark me dont neglect your cookery kissing dont last cookery do here with an aphorism worthy a place in the pilgrims scrip she broke off to go posseting for her dear invalid lucy was quite well very eager to be allowed to rise and be ready when the knock should come mrs berry in her loving considerateness for the little bride positively commanded her to lie down and be quiet and submit to be nursed and cherished for mrs berry well knew that ten minutes alone with the hero could only be had while the little bride was in that unattainable position thanks to her strategy as she thought her object was gained the night did not pass before she learnt from the heros own mouth that mr richards the father of the hero and a stern lawyer was adverse to his union with this young lady he loved because of a ward of his heiress to an immense property whom he desired his son to espouse and because his darling letitia was a catholicletitia the sole daughter of a brave naval officer deceased and in the hands of a savage uncle who wanted to sacrifice this beauty to a brute of a son mrs berry listened credulously to the emphatic narrative and spoke to the effect that the wickedness of old people formed the excuse for the wildness of young ones the ceremonious administration of oaths of secrecy and devotion over she was enrolled in the heros band which now numbered three and entered upon the duties with feminine energy for there are no conspirators like women riptons lieutenancy became a sinecure his rank merely titular he had never been marriedhe knew nothing about licences except that they must be obtained and were not difficulthe had not an idea that so many days warning must be given to the clergyman of the parish where one of the parties was resident how should he all his forethought was comprised in the ring and whenever the discussion of arrangements for the great event grew particularly hot and important he would say with a shrewd nod we mustnt forget the ring you know mrs berry and the new member was only prevented by natural complacence from shouting oh drat ye and your ring too mrs berry had acted conspicuously in fifteen marriages by banns and by licence and to have such an obvious requisite dinned in her ears was exasperating they could not have contracted alliance with an auxiliary more invaluable an authority so profound and they acknowledged it to themselves the hero marched like an automaton at her bidding lieutenant thompson was rejoiced to perform services as errandboy in the enterprise its in hopes youll be happier than me i do it said the devout and charitable berry marriages is made in heaven they say and if thats the case i say they dont take much account of us below her own woeful experiences had been given to the hero in exchange for his story of cruel parents richard vowed to her that he would henceforth hold it a duty to hunt out the wanderer from wedded bonds and bring him back bound and suppliant oh hell come said mrs berry pursing prophetic wrinkles hell come of his own accord never anywhere will he meet such a cook as bessy berry and he know her value in his heart of hearts and i do believe when he do come i shall be opening these arms to him again and not slapping his impidence in the faceim that soft i always wasin matrimony mr richards as when nations are secretly preparing for war the docks and arsenals hammer night and day and busy contractors measure time by inches and the air hums around for leagues as it were myriads of bees so the house and neighbourhood of the matrimonial soft one resounded in the heroic style and knew little of the changes of light decreed by creation mrs berry was the general of the hour down to doctors commons she expedited the hero instructing him how boldly to face the law and fib for that the law never could mist a fib and a bold face down the hero went and proclaimed his presence and lo the law danced to him its sedatest lovely bearsdance think ye the lawless susceptible to him than flesh and blood with a beautiful confidence it put the few familiar questions to him and nodded to his replies then stamped the bond and took the fee it must be an old vagabond at heart that can permit the irrevocable to go so cheap even to a hero for only mark him when he is petitioned by heroes and heroines to undo what he does so easily that small archway of doctors commons seems the eye of a needle through which the lean purse has a way somehow of slipping more readily than the portly but once through all are camels alike the lean purse an especially big camel dispensing tremendous marriage as it does the law can have no conscience i hadnt the slightest difficulty said the exulting hero of course not returns mrs berry its as easy if yere in earnest as buying a plum bun likewise the ambassador of the hero went to claim the promise of the church to be in attendance on a certain spot on a certain day and there hear oath of eternal fealty and gird him about with all its forces which the church receiving a wink from the law obsequiously engaged to do for less than the price of a plumcake meantime while craftsmen and skilled women directed by mrs berry were toiling to deck the day at hand raynham and belthorpe sleptthe former soundly and one day was as another to them regularly every morning a letter arrived from richard to his father containing observations on the phenomena of london remarks mainly cynical on the speeches and acts of parliament and reasons for not having yet been able to call on the grandisons they were certainly rather monotonous and spiritless the baronet did not complain that cold dutiful tone assured him there was no internal trouble or distraction the letters of a healthful physique he said to lady blandish with sure insight complacently he sat and smiled little witting that his sons ordeal was imminent and that his sons ordeal was to be his own hippias wrote that his nephew was killing him by making appointments which he never kept and altogether neglecting him in the most shameless way so that his ganglionic centre was in a ten times worse state than when he left raynham he wrote very bitterly but it was hard to feel compassion for his offended stomach on the other hand young tom blaize was not forthcoming and had despatched no tidings whatever farmer blaize smoked his pipe evening after evening vastly disturbed london was a large placeyoung tom might be lost in it he thought and young tom had his weaknesses a wolf at belthorpe he was likely to be a sheep in london as yokels have proved but what had become of lucy this consideration almost sent farmer blaize off to london direct and he would have gone had not his pipe enlightened him a young fellow might play truant and get into a scrape but a young man and a young woman were sure to be heard of unless they were acting in complicity why of course young tom had behaved like a man the rascal and married her outright there while he had the chance it was a long guess still it was the only reasonable way of accounting for his extraordinary silence and therefore the farmer held to it that he had done the deed he argued as modern men do who think the hero the upsetter of ordinary calculations is gone from us so after despatching a letter to a friend in town to be on the outlook for son tom he continued awhile to smoke his pipe rather elated than not and mused on the shrewd manner he should adopt when master honeymoon did appear toward the middle of the second week of richards absence tom bakewell came to raynham for cassandra and privately handed a letter to the eighteenth century containing a request for money and a round sum the eighteenth century was as good as her word and gave tom a letter in return enclosing a cheque on her bankers amply providing to keep the heroic engine in motion at a moderate pace tom went back and raynham and lobourne slept and dreamed not of the morrow the system wedded to time slept and knew not how he had been outragedanticipated by seven pregnant seasons for time had heard the hero swear to that legalizing instrument and had also registered an oath ah me venerable hebrew time he is unforgiving half the confusion and fever of the world comes of this vendetta he declares against the hapless innocents who have once done him a wrong they cannot escape him they will never outlive it the father of jokes he is himself no joke which it seems the business of men to discover the days roll round he is their servant now mrs berry has a new satin gown a beautiful bonnet a gold brooch and sweet gloves presented to her by the hero wherein to stand by his bride at the altar tomorrow and instead of being an old wary hen she is as much a chicken as any of the party such has been the magic of these articles fathers she sees accepting the facts produced for them by their children a world content to be carved out as it pleases the hero at last time brings the bridal eve and is blest as a benefactor the final arrangements are made the bridegroom does depart and mrs berry lights the little bride to her bed lucy stops on the landing where there is an old clock eccentrically correct that night tis the palpitating pause before the gates of her transfiguration mrs berry sees her put her rosy finger on the one about to strike and touch all the hours successively till she comes to the twelve that shall sound wife in her ears on the morrow moving her lips the while and looking round archly solemn when she has done and that sight so catches at mrs berrys heart that not guessing time to be the poor childs enemy she endangers her candle by folding lucy warmly in her arms whimpering bless you for a darling you innocent lamb you shall be happy you shall old time gazes grimly ahead chapter xxix although it blew hard when caesar crossed the rubicon the passage of that river is commonly calm calm as acheron so long as he gets his fare the ferryman does not need to be told whom he carries he pulls with a will and heroes may be over in halfanhour only when they stand on the opposite bank do they see what a leap they have taken the shores they have relinquished shrink to an infinite remoteness there they have dreamed here they must act there lie youth and irresolution here manhood and purpose they are veritably in another land a moral acheron divides their life their memories scarce seem their own the philosophical geography about to be published observes that each man has one time or other a little rubicona clear or a foul water to cross it is asked him wilt thou wed this fate and give up all behind thee and i will firmly pronounced speeds him over the above named manuscript authority informs us that by far the greater number of caresses rolled by this heroic flood to its sister stream below are those of fellows who have repented their pledge and have tried to swim back to the bank they have blotted out for though every man of us may be a hero for one fatal minute very few remain so after a days march even and who wonders that madam fate is indignant and wears the features of the terrible universal fate to him fail before her either in heart or in act and lo how the alluring loves in her visage wither and sicken to what it is modelled on be your rubicon big or small clear or foul it is the same you shall not return onor to acheron i subscribe to that saying of the pilgrims scrip the danger of a little knowledge of things is disputable but beware the little knowledge of ones self richard feverel was now crossing the river of his ordeal already the mists were stealing over the land he had left his life was cut in two and he breathed but the air that met his nostrils his father his fathers love his boyhood and ambition were shadowy his poetic dreams had taken a living attainable shape he had a distincter impression of the autumnal berry and her household than of anything at raynham and yet the young man loved his father loved his home and i daresay caesar loved rome but whether he did or no caesar when he killed the republic was quite bald and the hero we are dealing with is scarce beginning to feel his despotic moustache did he know what he was made of doubtless nothing at all but honest passion has an instinct that can be safer than conscious wisdom he was an arrow drawn to the head flying from the bow his audacious mendacities and subterfuges did not strike him as in any way criminal for he was perfectly sure that the winning and securing of lucy would in the end be boisterously approved of and in that case were not the means justified not that he took trouble to argue thus as older heroes and selfconvicting villains are in the habit of doing to deduce a clear conscience conscience and lucy went together it was a soft fair day the rubicon sparkled in the morning sun one of those days when london embraces the prospect of summer and troops forth all its babies the pavement the squares the parks were early alive with the cries of young britain violet and primrose girls and organ boys with military monkeys and systematic bands very determined in tone if not in tune filled the atmosphere and crowned the blazing procession of omnibuses freighted with business men cityward where a column of reddish brown smokeblown aloft by the southwest marked the scene of conflict to which these persistent warriors repaired richard had seen much of early london that morning his plans were laid he had taken care to ensure his personal liberty against accidents by leaving his hotel and his injured uncle hippias at sunrise today or tomorrow his father was to arrive farmer blaize tom bakewell reported to him was raging in town another day and she might be torn from him but today this miracle of creation would be his and then from those glittering banks yonder let them summon him to surrender her who dared the position of things looked so propitious that he naturally thought the powers waiting on love conspired in his behalf and she toosince she must cross this river she had sworn to him to be brave and do him honour and wear the true gladness of her heart in her face without a suspicion of folly in his acts or fear of results richard strolled into kensington gardens breakfasting on the foreshadow of his great joy now with a vision of his bride now of the new life opening to him mountain masses of clouds rounded in sunlight swung up the blue the flowering chestnut pavilions overhead rustled and hummed a sound in his ears as of a banner unfolding in the joyful distance lulled him he was to meet his bride at the church at a quarter past eleven his watch said a quarter to ten he strolled on beneath the longstemmed trees toward the well dedicated to a saint obscure some people were drinking at the well a florid lady stood by a younger one who had a little silver mug halfway to her mouth and evinced undisguised dislike to the liquor of the salutary saint drink child said the maturer lady that is only your second mug i insist upon your drinking three full ones every morning were in town your constitution positively requires iron but mama the other expostulated its so nasty i shall be sick drink was the harsh injunction nothing to the german waters my dear here let me taste she took the mug and gave it a flying kiss i declare i think it almost nicenot at all objectionable pray taste it she said to a gentleman standing below them to act as cupbearer an unmistakable cisrubicon voice replied certainly if its good fellowship though i confess i dont think mutual sickness a very engaging ceremony can one never escape from ones relatives richard ejaculated inwardly without a doubt those people were mrs doria clare and adrian he had them under his eyes clare peeping up from her constitutional dose to make sure no man was near to see the possible consequence of it was the first to perceive him her hand dropped now pray drink and do not fuss said mrs doria mama clare gasped richard came forward and capitulated honourably since retreat was out of the question mrs doria swam to meet him my own boy my dear richard profuse of exclamations clare shyly greeted him adrian kept in the background why we were coming for you today richard said mrs doria smiling effusion and rattled on we want another cavalier this is delightful my dear nephew you have grown from a boy to a man and theres down on his lip and what brings you here at such an hour in the morning poetry i suppose here take my arm childclare finish that mug and thank your cousin for sparing you the third i always bring her when we are by a chalybeate to take the waters before breakfast we have to get up at unearthly hours think my dear boy mothers are sacrifices and so youve been alone a fortnight with your agreeable uncle a charming time of it you must have had poor hippias what may be his last nostrum nephew adrian stretched his head round to the couple doses of nephew taken morning and night fourteen days and he guarantees that it shall destroy an iron constitution in a month richard mechanically shook adrians hand as he spoke quite well ricky yes well enough richard answered well resumed his vigorous aunt walking on with him while clare and adrian followed i really never saw you looking so handsome theres something about your facelook at meyou neednt blush youve grown to an apollo that blue buttonedup frock coat becomes you admirably and those gloves and that easy necktie your style is irreproachable quite a style of your own and nothing eccentric you have the instinct of dress dress shows blood my dear boy as much as anything else boyyou see i cant forget old habits you were a boy when i left and nowdo you see any change in him clare she turned half round to her daughter richard is looking very well mama said clare glancing at him under her eyelids i wish i could say the same of you my deartake my arm richard are you afraid of your aunt i want to get used to you wont it be pleasant our being all in town together in the season how fresh the opera will be to you austin i hear takes stalls you can come to the foreys box when you like we are staying with the foreys close by here i think its a little too far out you know but they like the neighbourhood this is what i have always said give him more liberty austin has seen it at last how do you think clare looking the question had to be repeated richard surveyed his cousin hastily and praised her looks pale mrs doria sighed rather pale aunt grown very muchdont you think richard very tall girl indeed aunt if she had but a little more colour my dear richard im sure i give her all the iron she can swallow but that pallor still continues i think she does not prosper away from her old companion she was accustomed to look up to you richard did you get ralphs letter aunt richard interrupted her absurd mrs doria pressed his arm the nonsense of a boy why did you undertake to forward such stuff im certain he loves her said richard in a serious way the maternal eyes narrowed on him life my dear richard is a game of crosspurposes she observed dropping her fluency and was rather angered to hear him laugh he excused himself by saying that she spoke so like his father you breakfast with us she freshened off again the foreys wish to see you the girls are dying to know you do you know you have a reputation on account of thatshe crushed an intruding adjective system you were brought up on you mustnt mind it for my part i think you look a credit to it dont be bashful with young women mind as much as you please with the old ones you know how to behave among men there you have your drawingroom guide im sure i shall be proud of you am i not mrs doria addressed his eyes coaxingly a benevolent idea struck richard that he might employ the minutes to spare in pleading the case of poor ralph and as he was drawn along he pulled out his watch to note the precise number of minutes he could dedicate to this charitable office pardon me said mrs doria you want manners my dear boy i think it never happened to me before that a man consulted his watch in my presence richard mildly replied that he had an engagement at a particular hour up to which he was her servant fiddlededee the vivacious lady sang now ive got you i mean to keep you oh ive heard all about you this ridiculous indifference that your father makes so much of why of course you wanted to see the world a strong healthy young man shut up all his life in a lonely houseno friends no society no amusements but those of rustics of course you were indifferent your intelligence and superior mind alone saved you from becoming a dissipated country boorwhere are the others clare and adrian came up at a quick pace my damozel dropped something adrian explained her mother asked what it was nothing mama said clare demurely and they proceeded as before overborne by his aunts fluency of tongue and occupied in acute calculation of the flying minutes richard let many pass before he edged in a word for ralph when he did mrs doria stopped him immediately i must tell you child that i refuse to listen to such rank idiotcy its nothing of the kind aunt the fancy of a boy hes not a boy hes halfayear older than i am you silly child the moment you fall in love you all think yourselves men on my honour aunt i believe he loves her thoroughly did he tell you so child men dont speak openly of those things said richard boys do said mrs doria but listen to me in earnest aunt i want you to be kind to ralph dont drive him toyou maybe sorry for it let himdo let him write to her and see her i believe women are as cruel as men in these things i never encourage absurdity richard what objection have you to ralph aunt oh theyre both good families its not that absurdity richard it will be to his credit to remember that his first fancy wasnt a dairymaid mrs doria pitched her accent tellingly it did not touch her nephew dont you want clare ever to marry he put the last point of reason to her mrs doria laughed i hope so child we must find some comfortable old gentleman for her what infamy mutters richard and i engage ralph shall be ready to dance at her wedding or eat a hearty breakfastwe dont dance at weddings now and very properly its a horrid sad business not to be treated with levityis that his regiment she said as they passed out of the hussarsentinelled gardens tush tush child master ralph will recover ashem others have done a little headacheyou call it heartacheand up you rise again looking better than ever no doubt to have a grain of sense forced into your brains you poor dear children must be painful girls suffer as much as boys i assure you more for their heads are weaker and their appetites less constant do i talk like your father now whatever makes the boy fidget at his watch so richard stopped short time spoke urgently i must go he said his face did not seem good for trifling mrs doria would trifle in spite listen clare richard is going he says he has an engagement what possible engagement can a young man have at eleven oclock in the morningunless its to be married mrs doria laughed at the ingenuity of her suggestion is the church handy ricky said adrian you can still give us half anhour if it is the celibate hours strike at twelve and he also laughed in his fashion wont you stay with us richard clare asked she blushed timidly and her voice shook something indefinitea sharpedged thrill in the tones made the burning bridegroom speak gently to her indeed i would clare i should like to please you but i have a most imperative appointmentthat is i promisedi must go i shall see you again mrs doria took forcible possession of him now do come and dont waste words i insist upon your having some breakfast first and then if you really must go you shall look theres the house at least you will accompany your aunt to the door richard conceded this she little imagined what she required of him two of his golden minutes melted into nothingness they were growing to be jewels of price one by one more and more precious as they ran and now so costlyrarerich as his blood not to kindest relations dearest friends could he give another the die is cast ferryman push off goodbye he cried nodding bluffly at the three as one and fled they watched his abrupt muscular stride through the grounds of the house he looked like resolution on the march mrs doria as usual with her out of her brothers hearing began rating the system see what becomes of that nonsensical education the boy really does not know how to behave like a common mortal he has some paltry appointment or is mad after some ridiculous idea of his own and everything must be sacrificed to it thats what austin calls concentration of the faculties i think its more likely to lead to downright insanity than to greatness of any kind and so i shall tell austin its time he should be spoken to seriously about him hes an engine my dear aunt said adrian he isnt a boy or a man but an engine and he appears to have been at high pressure since he came to townout all day and half the night hes mad mrs doria interjected not at all extremely shrewd is master ricky and carries as open an eye ahead of him as the ships before troy hes more than a match for any of us he is for me i confess then said mrs doria he does astonish me adrian begged her to retain her astonishment till the right season which would not be long arriving their common wisdom counselled them not to tell the foreys of their hopeful relatives ungracious behaviour clare had left them when mrs doria went to her room her daughter was there gazing down at something in her hand which she guiltily closed in answer to an inquiry why she had not gone to take off her things clare said she was not hungry mrs doria lamented the obstinacy of a constitution that no quantity of iron could affect and eclipsed the lookingglass saying take them off here child and learn to assist yourself she disentangled her bonnet from the array of her spreading hair talking of richard and his handsome appearance and extraordinary conduct clare kept opening and shutting her hand in an attitude halfpensive halflistless she did not stir to undress a joyless dimple hung in one pale cheek and she drew long even breaths mrs doria assured by the glass that she was ready to show came to her daughter now really she said you are too helpless my dear you cannot do a thing without a dozen women at your elbow what will become of you you will have to marry a millionairewhats the matter with you child clare undid her tightshut fingers as if to some attraction of her eyes and displayed a small gold hoop on the palm of a green glove a weddingring exclaimed mrs doria inspecting the curiosity most daintily there on clares pale green glove lay a weddingring rapid questions as to where when how it was found beset clare who replied in the gardens mama this morning when i was walking behind richard are you sure he did not give it you clare oh no mama he did not give it me of course not only he does such absurd things ithought perhaps these boys are so exceedingly ridiculous mrs doria had an idea that it might have been concerted between the two young gentlemen richard and ralph that the former should present this token of hymeneal devotion from the latter to the young lady of his love but a moments reflection exonerated boys even from such preposterous behaviour now i wonder she speculated on clares cold face i do wonder whether its lucky to find a weddingring what very quick eyes you have my darling mrs doria kissed her she thought it must be lucky and the circumstance made her feel tender to her child her child did not move to the kiss lets see whether it fits said mrs doria almost infantine with surprise and pleasure clare suffered her glove to be drawn off the ring slid down her long thin finger and settled comfortably it does mrs doria whispered to find a wedding ring is open to any woman but to find a weddingring that fits may well cause a superstitious emotion moreover that it should be found while walking in the neighbourhood of the identical youth whom a mother has destined for her daughter gives significance to the gentle perturbation of ideas consequent on such a hint from fortune it really fits she pursued now i never pay any attention to the nonsense of omens and that kind of thing had the ring been a horseshoe mrs doria would have pinked it up and dragged it obediently home but this i must say is oddto find a ring that fitssingular it never happened to me sixpence is the most i ever discovered and i have it now mind you keep it clarethis ring and she laughed offer it to richard when he comes say you think he must have dropped it the dimple in clares cheek quivered mother and daughter had never spoken explicitly of richard mrs doria by exquisite management had contrived to be sure that on one side there would be no obstacle to her project of general happiness without as she thought compromising her daughters feelings unnecessarily it could do no harm to an obedient young girl to hear that there was no youth in the world like a certain youth he the prince of his generation she might softly consent when requested to be his princess and if never requested for mrs doria envisaged failure she might easily transfer her softness to squires of lower degree clare had always been blindly obedient to her mother adrian called them mrs doria battledoria and the fair shuttlecockiana and her mother accepted in this blind obedience the text of her entire character it is difficult for those who think very earnestly for their children to know when their children are thinking on their own account the exercise of their volition we construe as revolt our love does not like to be invalided and deposed from its command and here i think yonder old thrush on the lawn who has just kicked the last of her lank offspring out of the nest to go shift for itself much the kinder of the two though sentimental people do shrug their shoulders at these unsentimental acts of the creatures who never wander from nature now excess of obedience is to one who manages most exquisitely as bad as insurrection happily mrs doria saw nothing in her daughters manner save a want of iron her pallor her lassitude the tremulous nerves in her face exhibited an imperious requirement of the mineral the reason why men and women are mysterious to us and prove disappointing we learn from the pilgrims scrip is that we will read them from our own book just as we are perplexed by reading ourselves from theirs mrs doria read her daughter from her own book and she was gay she laughed with adrian at the breakfasttable and mockseriously joined in his jocose assertion that clare was positively and by all hymeneal auspices betrothed to the owner of that ring be he who he may and must whenever he should choose to come and claim her give her hand to him for everybody agreed the owner must be masculine as no woman would drop a weddingring and follow him whither he listed all the world over amiable giggling forey girls called clare the betrothed dark man or fair was mooted adrian threw off the first strophe of clares fortune in burlesque rhymes with an insinuating gipsy twang her aunt forey warned her to have her dresses in readiness her grandpapa forey pretended to grumble at bridal presents being expected from grandpapas this one smelt orangeflower another spoke solemnly of an old shoe the finding of a weddingring was celebrated through all the palpitating accessories and rosy ceremonies involved by that famous instrument in the midst of the general hilarity clare showed her deplorable want of iron by bursting into tears did the poor mockedat heart divine what might be then enacting perhaps dimly as we say that is without eyes at an altar stand two fair young creatures ready with their oaths they are asked to fix all time to the moment and they do so if there is hesitation at the immense undertaking it is but maidenly she conceives as little mental doubt of the sanity of the act as he over them hangs a cool young curate in his raiment of office behind are two apparently lucid people distinguished from each other by sex and age the foremost a bunch of simmering black satin under her shadow a cockrobin in the dress of a gentleman big joy swelling out his chest and pert satisfaction cocking his head these be they who stand here in place of parents to the young couple all is well the service proceeds firmly the bridegroom tells forth his words this hour of the complacent giant at least is his and that he means to hold him bound through the eternities men may hear clearly and with brave modesty speaks she no less firmly though her body trembles her voice just vibrating while the tone travels on like a smitten vase time hears sentence pronounced on him the frail hands bind his huge limbs and lock the chains he is used to it he lets them do as they will then comes that period when they are to give their troth to each other the man with his right hand takes the woman by her right hand the woman with her right hand takes the man by his right handdevils dare not laugh at whom angels crowd to contemplate their hands are joined their blood flows as one stream adam and fair eve front the generations are they not lovely purer fountains of life were never in two bosoms and then they loose their hands and the cool curate doth bid the man to put a ring on the womans fourth finger counting thumb and the man thrusts his hand into one pocket and into another forward and back many times into all his pockets he remembers that he felt for it and felt it in his waistcoat pocket when in the gardens and his hand comes forth empty and the man is ghastly to look at yet though angels smile shall not devils laugh the curate deliberates the black satin bunch ceases to simmer he in her shadow changes from a beaming cockrobin to an inquisitive sparrow eyes multiply questions lips have no reply time ominously shakes his chain and in the pause a sound of mockery stings their ears think ye a hero is one to be defeated in his first battle look at the clock there are but seven minutes to the stroke of the celibate hours the veteran is surely lifting his two hands to deliver fire and his shot will sunder them in twain so nearly united all the jewellers of london speeding down with sacks full of the nuptial circlet cannot save them the battle must be won on the field and what does the hero now it is an inspiration for who else would dream of such a reserve in the rear none see what he does only that the blacksatin bunch is remonstratingly agitated stormily shaken and subdued and as though the menacing cloud had opened and dropped the dear token from the skies at his demand he produces the symbol of their consent and the service proceeds with this ring i thee wed they are prayed over and blest for good or for ill this deed is done the names are registered fees fly right and left they thank and salute the curate whose official coolness melts into a smile of monastic gallantry the beadle on the steps waves off a gaping world as they issue forth bridegroom and bridesman recklessly scatter gold on him carriage doors are banged to the coachmen drive off and the scene closes everybody happy chapter xxx and the next moment the bride is weeping as if she would dissolve to one of dians virgin fountains from the clasp of the sungod she has nobly preserved the mask imposed by comedies till the curtain has fallen and now she weeps streams with tears have patience o impetuous young man it is your profession to be a hero this poor heart is new to it and her duties involve such wild acts such brigandage such terrors and tasks she is quite unnerved she did you honour till now bear with her now she does not cry the cry of ordinary maidens in like cases while the struggle went on her tender face was brave but alas omens are against her she holds an everpresent dreadful one on that fatal fourth finger of hers which has coiled itself round her dream of delight and takes her in its clutch like a horrid serpent and yet she must love it she dares not part from it she must love and hug it and feed on its strange honey and all the bliss it gives her casts all the deeper shadow on what is to come say is it not enough to cause feminine apprehension for a woman to be married in another womans ring you are amazons ladies at saragossa and a thousand citadelswherever there is strife and time is to be taken by the throat then shall few men match your sublime fury but what if you see a vulture visible only to yourselves hovering over the house you are gaily led by the torch to inhabit will you not crouch and be cowards as for the hero in the hour of victory he pays no heed to omens he does his best to win his darling to confidence by caresses is she not his is he not hers and why when the battle is won does she weep does she regret what she has done oh never never her soft blue eyes assure him steadfast love seen swimming on clear depths of faith in them through the shower he is silenced by her exceeding beauty and sits perplexed waiting for the shower to pass alone with mrs berry in her bedroom lucy gave tongue to her distress and a second character in the comedy changed her face o mrs berry mrs berry what has happened what has happened my darlin child the bridal berry gazed at the finger of doleful joy id forgot all about it and thats whatve made me feel so queer ever since then ive been seemin as if i wasnt myself somehow without my ring dear dear what a wilful young gentleman we aint a match for men in that statelord help us mrs berry sat on the edge of a chair lucy on the edge of the bed what do you think of it mrs berry is it not terrible i cant say i should a liked it myself my dear mrs berry candidly responded oh why why why did it happen the young bride bent to a flood of fresh tears murmuring that she felt already oldforsaken havent you got a comfort in your religion for all accidents mrs berry inquired none for this i know its wrong to cry when i am so happy i hope he will forgive me mrs berry vowed her bride was the sweetest softest beautifulest thing in life ill cry no more said lucy leave me mrs berry and come back when i ring she drew forth a little silver cross and fell upon her knees to the bed mrs berry left the room tiptoe when she was called to return lucy was calm and tearless and smiled kindly to her its over now she said mrs berry sedately looked for her ring to follow he does not wish me to go in to the breakfast you have prepared mrs berry i begged to be excused i cannot eat mrs berry very much deplored it as she had laid out a superior nuptial breakfast but with her mind on her ring she nodded assentingly we shall not have much packing to do mrs berry no my dear its pretty well all done we are going to the isle of wight mrs berry and a very suitable spot yeve chose my dear he loves the sea he wishes to be near it dont ye cross tonight if its anyways rough my dear it isnt advisable mrs berry sank her voice to say dont ye be soft and give way to him there or youll both be repenting it lucy had only been staving off the unpleasantness she had to speak she saw mrs berrys eyes pursuing her ring and screwed up her courage at last mrs berry yes my dear mrs berry you shall have another ring another my dear berry did not comprehend ones quite enough for the objeck she remarked i mean lucy touched her fourth finger i cannot part with this she looked straight at mrs berry that bewildered creature gazed at her and at the ring till she had thoroughly exhausted the meaning of the words and then exclaimed horrorstruck deary me now you dont say that youre to be married again in your own religion the young wife repeated i can never part with it but my dear the wretched berry wrung her hands divided between compassion and a sense of injury my dear she kept expostulating like a mute i know all that you would say mrs berry i am very grieved to pain you it is mine now and must be mine i cannot give it back there she sat suddenly developed to the most inflexible little heroine in the three kingdoms from her first perception of the meaning of the young brides words mrs berry a shrewd physiognomist knew that her case was hopeless unless she treated her as she herself had been treated and seized the ring by force of arms and that she had not heart for what she gasped faintly ones own lawful weddingring you wouldnt give back to a body because it is mine mrs berry it was yours but it is mine now you shall have whatever you ask for but that pray forgive me it must be so mrs berry rocked on her chair and sounded her hands together it amazed her that this soft little creature could be thus firm she tried argument dont ye know my dear its the fatalest thing youre inflictin upon me reelly dont ye know that bein bereft of ones own lawful wedding rings the fatalest thing in life and theres no prosperity after it for what stands in place o that when thats gone my dear and what could ye give me to compensate a body for the loss o that dont ye knowoh deary me the little brides face was so set that poor berry wailed off in despair i know it said lucy i know it all i know what i do to you dear dear mrs berry forgive me if i parted with my ring i know it would be fatal so this fair young freebooter took possession of her argument as well as her ring berry racked her distracted wits for a further appeal but my child she counterargued you dont understand it aint as you think it aint a hurt to you now not a bit it aint it makes no difference now any ring does while the wearers a maid and your mr richard will find the very ring he intended for ye and of course thats the one youll wear as his wife its all the same now my dear its no shame to a maid now donow dotheres a darlin wheedling availed as little as argument mrs berry said lucy you know what myhe spoke with this ring i thee wed it was with this ring then how could it be with another berry was constrained despondently to acknowledge that was logic she hit upon an artful conjecture wont it be unlucky your wearin of the ring which served me so think o that it may it may it may cried lucy and arnt you rushin into it my dear mrs berry lucy said again it was this ring it cannotit never can be another it was this what it brings me i must bear i shall wear it till i die then what am i to do the illused woman groaned what shall i tell my husband when he come back to me and see ive got a new ring waitin for him wont that be a welcome quoth lucy how can he know it is not the same in a plain gold ring you never see so keen a eyed man in joolry as my berry returned his solitary spouse not know my dear why any one would know thatve got eyes in his head theres as much difference in weddingrings as theres in wedding people now do pray be reasonable my own sweet pray do not ask me pleads lucy pray do think better of it urges berry pray pray mrs berry pleads lucy and not leave your old berry all forlorn just when youre so happy indeed i would not you dear kind old creature lucy faltered mrs berry thought she had her just when youre going to be the happiest wife on earthall you want yours she pursued the tender strain a handsome young gentleman love and fortune smilin on ye lucy rose up mrs berry she said i think we must not lose time in getting ready or he will be impatient poor berry surveyed her in abject wonder from the edge of her chair dignity and resolve were in the ductile form she had hitherto folded under her wing in an hour the heroine had risen to the measure of the hero without being exactly aware what creature she was dealing with berry acknowledged to herself it was not one of the common run and sighed and submitted its like a divorce that it is she sobbed after putting the corners of her apron to her eyes berry bustled humbly about the packing then lucy whose heart was full to her came and kissed her and berry bumped down and regularly cried this over she had recourse to fatalism i suppose it was to be my dear its my punishment for meddlin wi such matters no im not sorry bless ye both whod a thought you was so wilfulyou that any one might have taken for one of the silly softs youre a pair my dear indeed you are you was made to meet but we mustnt show him weve been cryingmen dont like it when theyre happy lets wash our faces and try to bear our lot so saying the blacksatin bunch careened to a renewed deluge she deserved some sympathy for if it is sad to be married in another persons ring how much sadder to have ones own old accustomed lawful ring violently torn off ones finger and eternally severed from one but where you have heroes and heroines these terrible complications ensue they had now both fought their battle of the ring and with equal honour and success in the chamber of banquet richard was giving ripton his last directions though it was a private wedding mrs berry had prepared a sumptuous breakfast chickens offered their breasts pies hinted savoury secrets things mystic in a mash with gallic appellatives jellies creams fruits strewed the table as a tower in the midst the cake colossal the priestly vesture of its nuptial white relieved by hymeneal splendours many hours much labour and anxiety of mind mrs berry had expended upon this breakfast and why there is one who comes to all feasts that have their basis in folly whom criminals of trained instinct are careful to provide against who will speak and whose hateful voice must somehow be silenced while the feast is going on this personage is the philosopher mrs berry knew him she knew that he would come she provided against him in the manner she thought most efficacious that is by cheating her eyes and intoxicating her conscience with the due and proper glories incident to weddings where fathers dilate mothers collapse and marriage settlements are flourished on high by the family lawyer and had there been no show of the kind to greet her on her return from the church she would and she foresaw she would have stared at squalor and emptiness and repented her work the philosopher would have laid hold of her by the ear and called her bad names entrenched behind a breakfasttable so legitimately adorned mrs berry defied him in the presence of that cake he dared not speak above a whisper and there were wines to drown him in should he still think of protesting fiery wines and cool claret sent purposely by the bridegroom for the delectation of his friend for one good hour therefore the labour of many hours kept him dumb ripton was fortifying himself so as to forget him altogether and the world as well till the next morning ripton was excited overdone with delight he had already finished one bottle and listened pleasantly flushed to his emphatic and more abstemious chief he had nothing to do but to listen and to drink the hero would not allow him to shout victory or hear a word of toasts and as from the quantity of oil poured on it his eloquence was becoming a natural force in his bosom the poor fellow was afflicted with a sort of elephantiasis of suppressed emotion at times he halfrose from his chair and fell vacuously into it again or he chuckled in the face of weighty severelyworded instructions tapped his chest stretched his arms yawned and in short behaved so singularly that richard observed it and said on my soul i dont think you know a word im saying every word ricky ripton spirted through the opening im going down to your governor and tell him sir austin heres your only chance of being a happy fatherno nooh dont you fear me ricky i shall talk the old gentleman over his chief said look here you had better not go down tonight go down the first thing tomorrow by the six oclock train give him my letter listen to megive him my letter and dont speak a word till he speaks his eyebrows will go up and down he wont say much i know him if he asks you about her dont be a fool but say what you think of her sensibly no cork could hold in ripton when she was alluded to he shouted shes an angel richard checked him speak sensibly i sayquietly you can say how gentle and good she ismy fleurdeluce and say this was not her doing if any ones to blame its i i made her marry me then go to lady blandish if you dont find her at the house you may say whatever you please to her give her my letter and tell her i want to hear from her immediately she has seen lucy and i know what she thinks of her you will then go to farmer blaize i told you lucy happens to be his nieceshe has not lived long there she lived with her aunt desborough in france while she was a child and can hardly be called a relative to the farmertheres not a point of likeness between them poor darling she never knew her mother go to mr blaize and tell him you will treat him just as you would treat any other gentleman if you are civil he is sure to be and if he abuses me for my sake and hers you will still treat him with respect you hear and then write me a full account of all that has been said and done you will have my address the day after tomorrow by the way tom will be here this afternoon write out for him where to call on you the day after tomorrow in case you have heard anything in the morning you think i ought to know at once as tom will join me that night dont mention to anybody about my losing the ring ripton i wouldnt have adrian get hold of that for a thousand pounds how on earth i came to lose it how well she bore it rip how beautifully she behaved ripton again shouted an angel throwing up the heels of his second bottle he said you may trust your friend richard aha when you pulled at old mrs berry i didnt know what was up i do wish youd let me drink her health heres to penelope said richard just wetting his mouth the carriage was at the door a couple of dire organs each grinding the same tune and a vulturescented itinerant band from which not the secretest veiled wedding can escape worked harmoniously without in the production of discord and the noise acting on his nervous state made him begin to fume and send in messages for his bride by the maid by and by the lovely young bride presented herself dressed for her journey and smiling from stained eyes mrs berry was requested to drink some wine which ripton poured out for her enabling mrs berry thereby to measure his condition the bride now kissed mrs berry and mrs berry kissed the bridegroom on the plea of her softness lucy gave ripton her hand with a musical goodbye mr thompson and her extreme graciousness made him just sensible enough to sit down before he murmured his fervent hopes for her happiness i shall take good care of him said mrs berry focussing her eyes to the comprehension of the company farewell penelope cried richard i shall tell the police everywhere to look out for your lord oh my dears goodbye and heaven bless ye both berry quavered touched with compunction at the thoughts of approaching loneliness ripton his mouth drawn like a bow to his ears brought up the rear to the carriage receiving a fair slap on the cheek from an old shoe precipitated by mrs berrys enthusiastic female domestic white handkerchiefs were waved the adieux had fallen to signs they were off then did a thought of such urgency illumine mrs berry that she telegraphed hand in air awakening riptons lungs for the coachman to stop and ran back to the house richard chafed to be gone but at his brides intercession he consented to wait presently they beheld the old blacksatin bunch stream through the streetdoor down the bit of garden and up the astonished street halting panting capless at the carriage door a book in her handa muchused dogleaved steamy greasy book which at the same time calling out in breathless jerks there never ye mind looks i aint got a new one read it and dont ye forget it she discharged into lucys lap and retreated to the railings a signal for the coachman to drive away for good how richard laughed at the berrys bridal gift lucy too lost the omen at her heart as she glanced at the title of the volume it was dr kitchener on domestic cookery chapter xxxi general withdrawing of heads from streetwindows emigration of organs and bands and a relaxed atmosphere in the circle of mrs berrys abode proved that dan cupid had veritably flown to suck the life of fresh regions with a pensive mind she grasped riptons arm to regulate his steps and returned to the room where her creditor awaited her in the interval he had stormed her undefended fortress the cake from which altitude he shook a dolorous head at the guilty woman she smoothed her excited apron sighing let no one imagine that she regretted her complicity she was ready to cry torrents but there must be absolute castigation before this criminal shall conceive the sense of regret and probably then she will cling to her wickedness the moresuch is the born pagans tenacity mrs berry sighed and gave him back his shake of the head o you wanton improvident creature said he o you very wise old gentleman said she he asked her the thing she had been doing she enlightened him with the fatalists reply he sounded a bogeys alarm of contingent grave results she retreated to the entrenched camp of the fact she had helped to make its done she exclaimed how could she regret what she felt comfort to know was done convinced that events alone could stamp a mark on such stubborn flesh he determined to wait for them and crouched silent on the cake with one finger downwards at riptons incision there showing a crumbling chasm and gloomy rich recess the eloquent indication was understood dear dear cried mrs berry what a heap o cake and no one to send it to ripton had resumed his seat by the table and his embrace of the claret clear ideas of satisfaction had left him and resolved to a boiling geysir of indistinguishable transports he bubbled and waggled and nodded amicably to nothing and successfully though not without effort preserved his uppermost member from the seductions of the nymph gravitation who was on the lookout for his whole length shortly ha ha he shouted about a minute after mrs berry had spoken and almost abandoned himself to the nymph on the spot mrs berrys words had just reached his wits why do you laugh young man she inquired familiar and motherly on account of his condition ripton laughed louder and caught his chest on the edge of the table and his nose on a chicken thats goo he said recovering and rocking under mrs berrys eyes no friend i did not say no friend she remarked i said no one meanin i know not where for to send it to riptons response to this was you put a griffin on that cake wheatsheaves each side his crest mrs berry said sweetly oldest baronetcy n england waved ripton yes mrs berry encouraged him on you think hes richards were oblige be very close and shes the most lovelyif i hear man say thing gainst her you neednt for to cry over her young man said mrs berry i wanted for to drink their right healths by their right names and then go about my days work and i do hope you wont keep me ripton stood bolt upright at her words you do he said and filling a bumper he with cheerfully vinous articulation and glibness of tongue proposed the health of richard and lucy feverel of raynham abbey and that mankind should not require an expeditious example of the way to accept the inspiring toast he drained his bumper at a gulp it finished him the farthing rushlight of his reason leapt and expired he tumbled to the sofa and there stretched some minutes subsequent to riptons signalization of his devotion to the bridal pair mrs berrys maid entered the room to say that a gentleman was inquiring below after the young gentleman who had departed and found her mistress with a tottering wineglass in her hand exhibiting every symptom of unconsoled hysterics her mouth gaped as if the fell creditor had her by the swallow she ejaculated with horrible exultation that she had been and done it as her disastrous aspect seemed to testify and her evident but inexplicable access of misery induced the sympathetic maid to tender those caressing words that were all mrs berry wanted to go off into the selfcaressing fit without delay and she had already given the preluding demoniac ironic outburst when the maid called heaven to witness that the gentleman would hear her upon which mrs berry violently controlled her bosom and ordered that he should be shown upstairs instantly to see her the wretch she was she repeated the injunction the maid did as she was told and mrs berry wishing first to see herself as she was mutely accosted the lookingglass and tried to look a very little better she dropped a shawl on ripton and was settled smoothing her agitation when her visitor was announced the gentleman was adrian harley an interview with tom bakewell had put him on the track and now a momentary survey of the table and its white vestured cake made him whistle mrs berry plaintively begged him to do her the favour to be seated a fine morning maam said adrian it have been mrs berry answered glancing over her shoulder at the window and gulping as if to get her heart down from her mouth a very fine spring pursued adrian calmly anatomizing her countenance mrs berry smothered an adjective to weather on a deep sigh her wretchedness was palpable in proportion to it adrian waned cheerful and brisk he divined enough of the business to see that there was some strange intelligence to be fished out of the culprit who sat compressing hysterics before him and as he was never more in his element than when he had a sinner and a repentant prostrate abject sinner in hand his affable countenance might well deceive poor berry i presume these are mr thompsons lodgings he remarked with a look at the table mrs berrys head and the whites of her eyes informed him that they were not mr thompsons lodgings no said adrian and threw a carelessly inquisitive eye about him mr feverel is out i suppose a convulsive start at the name and two corroborating hands dropped on her knees formed mrs berrys reply mr feverels man continued adrian told me i should be certain to find him here i thought he would be with his friend mr thompson im too late i perceive their entertainment is over i fancy you have been having a party of them here maama bachelors breakfast in the presence of that cake this observation seemed to mask an irony so shrewd that mrs berry could barely contain herself she felt she must speak making her face as deplorably propitiating as she could she began sir may i beg for to know your name mr harley accorded her request groaning in the clutch of a pitiless truth she continued and you are mr harley that wasoh and youve come for mr mr richard feverel was the gentleman mr harley had come for oh and its no mistake and hes of raynham abbey mrs berry inquired adrian very much amused assured her that he was born and bred there his fathers sir austin wailed the blacksatin bunch from behind her handkerchief adrian verified richards descent oh then what have i been and done she cried and stared blankly at her visitor i been and married my baby i been and married the bread out of my own mouth o mr harley mr harley i knew you when you was a boy that big and wore jackets and all of you and its my softness thats my ruin for i never can resist a mans asking look at that cake mr harley adrian followed her directions quite coolly weddingcake maam he said bridecake it is mr harley did you make it yourself maam the quiet ease of the question overwhelmed mrs berry and upset that train of symbolic representations by which she was seeking to make him guess the catastrophe and spare her the furnace of confession i did not make it myself mr harley she replied its a bought cake and im a lost woman little i dreamed when i had him in my arms a baby that i should some day be marrying him out of my own house i little dreamed that oh why did he come to me dont you remember his old nurse when he was a baby in arms that went away so sudden and no fault of hers mr harley the very mornin after the night you got into mr bensons cellar and got so tipsy on his madearyi remember it as clear as yesterdayand mr benson was that angry he threatened to use the whip to you and i helped put you to bed im that very woman adrian smiled placidly at these reminiscences of his guileless youthful life well maam well he said he would bring her to the furnace wont you see it all kind sir mrs berry appealed to him in pathetic dumb show doubtless by this time adrian did see it all and was mentally cursing at folly and reckoning the immediate consequences but he looked uninstructed his peculiar dimplesmile was undisturbed his comfortable fullbodied posture was the same well maam he spurred her on mrs berry burst forth it were done this mornin mr harley in the church at halfpast eleven of the clock or twenty to by licence adrian was now obliged to comprehend a case of matrimony oh he said like one who is as hard as facts and as little to be moved somebody was married this morning was it mr thompson or mr feverel mrs berry shuffled up to ripton and removed the shawl from him saying do he look like a new married bridegroom mr harley adrian inspected the oblivious ripton with philosophic gravity this young gentleman was at church this morning he asked oh quite reasonable and proper then mrs berry begged him to understand of course maam adrian lifted and let fall the stupid inanimate limbs of the gone wretch puckering his mouth queerly you were all reasonable and proper maam the principal male performer then is my cousin mr feverel he was married by you this morning by licence at your parish church and came here and ate a hearty breakfast and left intoxicated mrs berry flew out he never drink a drop sir a more moderate young gentleman you never see oh dont ye think that now mr harley he was as upright and master of his mind as you be ay the wise youth nodded thanks to her for the comparison i mean the other form of intoxication mrs berry sighed she could say nothing on that score adrian desired her to sit down and compose herself and tell him circumstantially what had been done she obeyed in utter perplexity at his perfectly composed demeanour mrs berry as her recital declared was no other than that identical woman who once in old days had dared to behold the baronet behind his mask and had ever since lived in exile from the raynham world on a little pension regularly paid to her as an indemnity she was that woman and the thought of it made her almost accuse providence for the betraying excess of softness it had endowed her with how was she to recognize her baby grown a man he came in a feigned name not a word of the family was mentioned he came like an ordinary mortal though she felt something more than ordinary to himshe knew she did he came bringing a beautiful young lady and on what grounds could she turn her back on them why seeing that all was chaste and legal why should she interfere to make them unhappyso few the chances of happiness in this world mrs berry related the seizure of her ring one wrench said the sobbing culprit one and my ring was off she had no suspicions and the task of writing her name in the vestry book had been too enacting for a thought upon the other signatures i daresay you were exceedingly sorry for what you had done said adrian indeed sir moaned berry i were and am and would do your best to rectify the mischiefeh maam indeed and indeed sir i would she protested solemnly as of course you shouldknowing the family where may these lunatics have gone to spend the moon mrs berry swimmingly replied to the islei dont quite know sir she snapped the indication short and jumped out of the pit she had fallen into repentant as she might be those dears should not be pursued and cruelly balked of their young bliss tomorrow if you please mr harley not today a pleasant spot adrian observed smiling at his easy prey by a measurement of dates he discovered that the bridegroom had brought his bride to the house on the day he had quitted raynham and this was enough to satisfy adrians mind that there had been concoction and chicanery chance probably had brought him to the old woman chance certainly had not brought him to the young one very well maam he said in answer to her petitions for his favourable offices with sir austin in behalf of her little pension and the bridal pair i will tell him you were only a blind agent in the affair being naturally soft and that you trust he will bless the consummation he will be in town tomorrow morning but one of you two must see him tonight an emetic kindly administered will set our friend here on his legs a bath and a clean shirt and he might go i dont see why your name should appear at all brush him up and send him to bellingham by the seven oclock train he will find his way to raynham he knows the neighbourhood best in the dark let him go and state the case remember one of you must go with this fair prospect of leaving a choice of a perdition between the couple of unfortunates for them to fight and lose all their virtues over adrian said good morning mrs berry touchingly arrested him you wont refuse a piece of his cake mr harley oh dear no maam adrian turned to the cake with alacrity i shall claim a very large piece richard has a great many friends who will rejoice to eat his weddingcake cut me a fair quarter mrs berry put it in paper if you please i shall be delighted to carry it to them and apportion it equitably according to their several degrees of relationship mrs berry cut the cake somehow as she sliced through it the sweetness and hapless innocence of the bride was presented to her and she launched into eulogies of lucy and clearly showed how little she regretted her conduct she vowed that they seemed made for each other that both were beautiful both had spirit both were innocent and to part them or make them unhappy would be mrs berry wrought herself to cry aloud oh such a pity adrian listened to it as the expression of a matteroffact opinion he took the huge quarter of cake nodded multitudinous promises and left mrs berry to bless his good heart so dies the system was adrians comment in the street and now let prophets roar he dies respectably in a marriagebed which is more than i should have foretold of the monster meantime he gave the cake a dramatic tap ill go sow nightmares chapter xxxii adrian really bore the news he had heard with creditable disinterestedness and admirable repression of anything beneath the dignity of a philosopher when one has attained that felicitous point of wisdom from which one sees all mankind to be fools the diminutive objects may make what new moves they please one does not marvel at them their sedateness is as comical as their frolic and their frenzies more comical still on this intellectual eminence the wise youth had built his castle and he had lived in it from an early period astonishment never shook the foundations nor did envy of greater heights tempt him to relinquish the security of his stronghold for he saw none jugglers he saw running up ladders that overtopped him and airballoons scaling the empyrean but the former came precipitately down again and the latter were at the mercy of the winds while he remained tranquil on his solid unambitious ground fitting his morality to the laws his conscience to his morality his comfort to his conscience not that voluntarily he cut himself off from his fellows on the contrary his sole amusement was their society alone he was rather dull as a man who beholds but one thing must naturally be study of the animated varieties of that one thing excited him sufficiently to think life a pleasant play and the faculties he had forfeited to hold his elevated position he could serenely enjoy by contemplation of them in others thuswonder at master richards madness though he himself did not experience it he was eager to mark the effect on his beloved relatives as he carried along his vindictive hunch of cake he shaped out their different attitudes of amaze bewilderment horror passing by some personal chagrin in the prospect for his patron had projected a journey commencing with paris culminating on the alps and lapsing in rome a delightful journey to show richard the highways of history and tear him from the risk of further ignoble fascinations that his spirit might be altogether bathed in freshness and revived this had been planned during richards absence to surprise him now the dream of travel was to adrian what the love of woman is to the race of young men it supplanted that foolishness it was his romance as we say that buoyant anticipation on which in youth we ride the airs and which as we wax older and too heavy for our atmosphere hardens to the hobby which if an obstinate animal is a safer horse and conducts man at a slower pace to the sexton adrian had never travelled he was aware that his romance was earthly and had discomforts only to be evaded by the one potent talisman possessed by his patron his alp would hardly be grand to him without an obsequious landlord in the foreground he must recline on mammons imperial cushions in order to moralize becomingly on the ancient world the search for pleasure at the expense of discomfort as frantic lovers woo their mistresses to partake the shelter of a but and batten on a crust adrian deemed the bitterness of beggarliness let his sweet mistress be given him in the pomp and splendour due to his superior emotions or not at all consequently the wise youth had long nursed an ineffectual passion and it argued a great nature in him that at the moment when his wishes were to be crowned he should look with such slight touches of spleen at the gorgeous composite fabric of parisian cookery and roman antiquities crumbling into unsubstantial mockery assuredly very few even of the philosophers would have turned away uncomplainingly to meaner delights the moment after hippias received the first portion of the cake he was sitting by the window in his hotel reading he had fought down his breakfast with more than usual success and was looking forward to his dinner at the foreys with less than usual timidity ah glad youve come adrian he said and expanded his chest i was afraid i should have to ride down this is kind of you well walk down together through the park its absolutely dangerous to walk alone in these streets my opinion is that orangepeel lasts all through the year now and will till legislation puts a stop to it i give you my word i slipped on a piece of orangepeel yesterday afternoon in piccadilly and i thought i was down i saved myself by a miracle you have an appetite i hope asked adrian i think i shall get one after a bit of a walk chirped hippias yes i think i feel hungry now charmed to hear it said adrian and began unpinning his parcel on his knees how should you define folly he checked the process to inquire hm hippias meditated he prided himself on being oracular when such questions were addressed to him i think i should define it to be a slide very good definition in other words a piece of orangepeel once on it your life and limbs are in danger and you are saved by a miracle you must present that to the pilgrim and the monument of folly what would that be hippias meditated anew all the human race on one anothers shoulders he chuckled at the sweeping sourness of the instance very good adrian applauded or in default of that some symbol of the thing say such as this of which i have here brought you a chip adrian displayed the quarter of the cake this is the monument made portableeh cake cried hippias retreating to his chair to dramatize his intense disgust youre right of them that eat it if iif i dont mistake he peered at it the noxious composition bedizened in that way is what they call weddingcake its arrant poison who is it you want to kill what are you carrying such stuff about for adrian rang the bell for a knife to present you with your due and proper portion you will have friends and relatives and cant be saved from them not even by miracle it is a habit which exhibits perhaps the unconscious inherent cynicism of the human mind for people who consider that they have reached the acme of mundane felicity to distribute this token of esteem to their friends with the object probably he took the knife from a waiter and went to the table to slice the cake of enabling those friends these edifices require very delicate incisioneach particular currant and subtle condiment hangs to its neighboura weddingcake is evidently the most highly civilized of cakes and partakes of the evils as well as the advantages of civilizationi was saying they send us these lovetokens no doubt we shall have to weigh out the crumbs if each is to have his fair share that we may the better estimate their state of bliss by passing some hours in purgatory this as far as i can apportion it without weights and scales is your share my uncle he pushed the corner of the table bearing the cake towards hippias get away hippias vehemently motioned and started from his chair ill have none of it i tell you its death its fifty times worse than that beastly compound christmas pudding what fool has been doing this then who dares send me cake me its an insult you are not compelled to eat any before dinner said adrian pointing the corner of the table after him but your share you must take and appear to consume one who has done so much to bring about the marriage cannot in conscience refuse his allotment of the fruits maidens i hear first cook it under their pillows and extract nuptial dreams therefromsaid to be of a lighter class taken that way its a capital cake and upon my honour you have helped to make ityou have indeed so here it is the table again went at hippias he ran nimbly round it and flung himself on a sofa exhausted crying there my appetites gone for today then shall i tell richard that you wont touch a morsel of his cake said adrian leaning on his two hands over the table and looking at his uncle richard yes your nephew my cousin richard your companion since youve been in town hes married you know married this morning at kensington parish church by licence at halfpast eleven of the clock or twenty to married and gone to spend his honeymoon in the isle of wight a very delectable place for a months residence i have to announce to you that thanks to your assistance the experiment is launched sir richard married there was something to think and to say in objection to it but the wits of poor hippias were softened by the shock his hand travelled halfway to his forehead spread out to smooth the surface of that seat of reason and then fell surely you knew all about it you were so anxious to have him in town under your charge married hippias jumped uphe had it why hes under age hes an infant so he is but the infant is not the less married fib like a man and pay your feewhat does it matter any one who is breeched can obtain a licence in our noble country and the interests of morality demand that it should not be difficult is it truecan you persuade anybody that you have known nothing about it ha infamous joke i wish sir you would play your pranks on somebody else said hippias sternly as he sank back on the sofa youve done me up for the day i can assure you adrian sat down to instil belief by gentle degrees and put an artistic finish to the work he had the gratification of passing his uncle through varied contortions and at last hippias perspired in conviction and exclaimed this accounts for his conduct to me that boy must have a cunning nothing short of infernal i feeli feel it just here he drew a hand along his midriff im not equal to this world of fools he added faintly and shut his eyes no i cant dine eat hano go without me shortly after hippias went to bed saying to himself as he undressed see what comes of our fine schemes poor austin and as the pillow swelled over his ears im not sure that a days fast wont do me good the dyspepsy had bought his philosophy at a heavy price he had a right to use it adrian resumed the procession of the cake he sighted his melancholy uncle algernon hunting an appetite in the row and looking as if the hope ahead of him were also onelegged the captain did not pass with out querying the ungainly parcel i hope i carry it ostentatiously enough said adrian enclosed is wherewithal to quiet the alarm of the land now may the maids and wives of merry england sleep secure i had half a mind to fix it on a pole and engage a band to parade it this is our dear richards weddingcake married at halfpast eleven this morning by licence at the kensington parish church his own ring being lost he employed the ring of his beautiful brides lachrymose landlady she standing adjacent by the altar his farewell to you as a bachelor and hers as a maid you can claim on the spot if you think proper and digest according to your powers algernon let off steam in a whistle thompson the solicitors daughter he said i met them the other day somewhere about here he introduced me to her a pretty little baggage no adrian set him right tis a miss desborough a roman catholic dairymaid reminds one of pastoral england in the time of the plantagenets hes quite equal to introducing her as thompsons daughter and himself as beelzebubs son however the wild animal is in hymens chains and the cake is cut will you have your morsel oh by all meansnot now algernon had an unwonted air of reflection father know it not yet he will tonight by nine oclock then i must see him by seven dont say you met me he nodded and pricked his horse wants money said adrian putting the combustible he carried once more in motion the women were the crowning joy of his contemplative mind he had reserved them for his final discharge dear demonstrative creatures dyspepsia would not weaken their poignant outcries or selfinterest check their fainting fits on the generic woman one could calculate well might the pilgrims scrip say of her that she is always at natures breast not intending it as a compliment each woman is eve throughout the ages whereas the pilgrim would have us believe that the adam in men has become warier if not wiser and weak as he is has learnt a lesson from time probably the pilgrims meaning may be taken to be that man grows and woman does not at any rate adrian hoped for such natural choruses as you hear in the nursery when a bauble is lost he was awake to mrs dorias maternal predestinations and guessed that clare stood ready with the best form of filial obedience they were only a poor couple to gratify his mephistophelian humour to be sure but mrs doria was equal to twenty and they would proclaim the diverse ways with which maidenhood and womanhood took disappointment while the surrounding forey girls and other females of the family assembly were expected to develop the finer shades and tapering edges of an agitation to which no woman could be cold all went well he managed cleverly to leave the cake unchallenged in a conspicuous part of the drawingroom and stepped gaily down to dinner much of the conversation adverted to richard mrs doria asked him if he had seen the youth or heard of him seen him no heard of him yes said adrian i have heard of him i heard that he was sublimely happy and had eaten such a breakfast that dinner was impossible claret and cold chicken cake and cake at breakfast they all interjected that seems to be his fancy just now what an extraordinary taste you know he is educated on a system one fast young male forey allied the system and the cake in a miserable pun adrian a hater of puns looked at him and held the table silent as if he were going to speak but he said nothing and the young gentleman vanished from the conversation in a blush extinguished by his own spark mrs doria peevishly exclaimed oh fishcake i suppose i wish he understood a little better the obligations of relationship whether he understands them i cant say observed adrian but i assure you he is very energetic in extending them the wise youth talked innuendoes whenever he had an opportunity that his dear relative might be rendered sufficiently inflammable by and by at the aspect of the cake but he was not thought more than commonly mysterious and deep was his appointment at the house of those grandison people mrs doria asked with a hostile upperlip adrian warmed the blindfolded parties by replying do they keep a beadle at the door mrs dorias animosity to mrs grandison made her treat this as a piece of satirical ingenuousness i daresay they do she said and a curate on hand oh i should think a dozen old mr forey advised his punning grandson clarence to give that house a wide berth where he might be disposed of and dishedup at a moments notice and the scent ran off at a jest the foreys gave good dinners and with the old gentleman the excellent old fashion remained in permanence of trooping off the ladies as soon as they had taken their sustenance and just exchanged a smile with the flowers and the dessert when they rose to fade with a beautiful accord and the gallant males breathed under easier waistcoats and settled to the business of the table sure that an hour for unbosoming and imbibing was their own adrian took a chair by brandon forey a barrister of standing i want to ask you he said whether an infant in law can legally bind himself if hes old enough to affix his signature to an instrument i suppose he can yawned brandon is he responsible for his acts ive no doubt we could hang him then what he could do for himself you could do for him not quite so much pretty near for instance he can marry thats not a criminal case you know and the marriage is valid you can dispute it yes and the greeks and the trojans can fight it holds then both water and fire the patriarch of the table sang out to adrian that he stopped the vigorous circulation of the claret dear me sir said adrian i beg pardon the circumstances must excuse me the fact is my cousin richard got married to a dairymaid this morning and i wanted to know whether it held in law it was amusing to watch the manly coolness with which the announcement was taken nothing was heard more energetic than deuce he has and a dairymaid i thought it better to let the ladies dine in peace adrian continued i wanted to be able to console my aunt well butwell but the old gentleman much the most excited puffed eh brandon hes a boy this young ass do you mean to tell me a boy can go and marry when he pleases and any troll he pleases and the marriage is good if i thought that id turn every woman off my premises i would from the housekeeper to the scullerymaid id have no woman near him tilltill till the young greenhorn was grey sir suggested brandon till he knew what women are made of sir the old gentleman finished his sentence vehemently what dye think will feverel say to it mr adrian he has been trying the very system you have proposed sirone that does not reckon on the powerful action of curiosity on the juvenile intelligence im afraid its the very worst way of solving the problem of course it is said clarence none but a fool at your age adrian relieved his embarrassment it is natural my dear clarence that you should consider the idea of an isolated or imprisoned manhood something monstrous and we do not expect you to see what amount of wisdom it contains you follow one extreme and we the other i dont say that a middle course exists the history of mankind shows our painful efforts to find one but they have invariably resolved themselves into asceticism or laxity acting and reacting the moral question is if a naughty little man by reason of his naughtiness releases himself from foolishness does a foolish little man by reason of his foolishness save himself from naughtiness a discussion peculiar to men of the world succeeded the laugh at mr clarence then coffee was handed round and the footman informed adrian in a low voice that mrs doria forey particularly wished to speak with him adrian preferred not to go in alone very well he said and sipped his coffee they talked on sounding the depths of law in brandon forey and receiving nought but hollow echoes from that profound cavity he would not affirm that the marriage was invalid he would not affirm that it could not be annulled he thought not still he thought it would be worth trying a consummated and a nonconsummated union were two different things dear me said adrian does the law recognize that why thats almost human another message was brought to adrian that mrs doria forey very particularly wished to speak with him what can be the matter he exclaimed pleased to have his faith in woman strengthened the cake had exploded no doubt so it proved when the gentlemen joined the fair society all the younger ladies stood about the table whereon the cake stood displayed gaps being left for those sitting to feast their vision and intrude the comments and speculations continually arising from fresh shocks of wonder at the unaccountable apparition entering with the halfguilty air of men who know they have come from a grosser atmosphere the gallant males also ranged themselves round the common object of curiosity here adrian mrs doria cried where is adrian pray come here tell me where did this cake come from whose is it what does it do here you know all about it for you brought it clare saw you bring it into the room what does it mean i insist upon a direct answer now do not make me impatient adrian certainly mrs doria was equal to twenty by her concentrated rapidity and volcanic complexion it was evident that suspicion had kindled i was really bound to bring it adrian protested answer me the wise youth bowed categorically this cake came from the house of a person a female of the name of berry it belongs to you partly partly to me partly to clare and to the rest of our family on the principle of equal division for which purpose it is present yes speak it means my dear aunt what that kind of cake usually does mean this then is the breakfast and the ring adrian where is richard mrs doria still clung to unbelief in the monstrous horror but when adrian told her that richard had left town her struggling hope sank the wretched boy has ruined himself she said and sat down trembling oh that system the delicate vituperations gentle ladies use instead of oaths mrs doria showered on that system she hesitated not to say that her brother had got what he deserved opinionated morbid weak justice had overtaken him now he would see but at what a price at what a sacrifice mrs doria commanded adrian to confirm her fears sadly the wise youth recapitulated berrys words he was married this morning at halfpast eleven of the clock or twenty to twelve by licence at the kensington parish church then that was his appointment mrs doria murmured that was the cake for breakfast breathed a second of her sex and it was his ring exclaimed a third the men were silent and made long faces clare stood cold and sedate she and her mother avoided each others eyes is it that abominable country person adrian the happy damsel is i regret to say the papist dairymaid said adrian in sorrowful but deliberate accents then arose a feminine hum in the midst of which mrs doria cried brandon she was a woman of energy her thoughts resolved to action spontaneously brandon she drew the barrister a little aside can they not be followed and separated i want your advice cannot we separate them a boy it is really shameful if he should be allowed to fall into the toils of a designing creature to ruin himself irrevocably can we not brandon the worthy barrister felt inclined to laugh but he answered her entreaties from what i hear of the young groom i should imagine the office perilous im speaking of law brandon can we not obtain an order from one of your courts to pursue them and separate them instantly this evening yes brandon was sorry to say she decidedly could not you might call on one of your judges brandon brandon assured her that the judges were a hardworked race and to a man slept heavily after dinner will you do so tomorrow the first thing in the morning will you promise me to do so brandonor a magistrate a magistrate would send a policeman after them my dear brandon i begi beg you to assist us in this dreadful extremity it will be the death of my poor brother i believe he would forgive anything but this you have no idea what his notions are of blood brandon tipped adrian a significant nod to step in and aid what is it aunt asked the wise youth you want them followed and torn asunder by wild policemen tomorrow brandon queerly interposed wont that bejust too late adrian suggested mrs doria sighed out her last spark of hope you see said adrian yes yes mrs doria did not require any of his elucidations pray be quiet adrian and let me speak brandon it cannot be its quite impossible can you stand there and tell me that boy is legally married i never will believe it the law cannot be so shamefully bad as to permit a boya mere childto do such absurd things grandpapa she beckoned to the old gentleman grandpapa pray do make brandon speak these lawyers never will he might stop it if he would if i were a man do you think i would stand here well my dear the old gentleman toddled to compose her im quite of your opinion i believe he knows no more than you or i my belief is they none of them know anything till they join issue and go into court i want to see a few female lawyers to encourage the bankrupt perruquier sir said adrian they would have to keep a large supply of wigs on hand and you can jest adrian his aunt reproached him but i will not be beaten i knowi am firmly convinced that no law would ever allow a boy to disgrace his family and ruin himself like that and nothing shall persuade me that it is so now tell me brandon and pray do speak in answer to my questions and please to forget you are dealing with a woman can my nephew be rescued from the consequences of his folly is what he has done legitimate is he bound for life by what he has done while a boy wella brandon breathed through his teeth ahm the matters so very delicate you see helen youre to forget that adrian remarked ahm well pursued brandon perhaps if you could arrest and divide them before nightfall and make affidavit of certain facts yes the eager woman hastened his lagging mouth wellhm ain that casea or if a lunatic you could prove him to have been of unsound mind oh theres no doubt of his madness on my mind brandon yes well in that case or if of different religious persuasions she is a catholic mrs doria joyfully interjected yes well in that caseobjections might be taken to the form of the marriage might be proved fictitious or if hes under say eighteen years he cant be much more cried mrs doria i think she appeared to reflect and then faltered imploringly to adrian what is richards age the kind wise youth could not find it in his heart to strike away the phantom straw she caught at oh about that i should fancy he muttered and found it necessary at the same time to duck and turn his head for concealment mrs doria surpassed his expectations yes i well then brandon was resuming with a shrug which was meant to say he still pledged himself to nothing when clares voice was heard from out the buzzing circle of her cousins richard is nineteen years and six months old today mama nonsense child he is mama clares voice was very steadfast nonsense i tell you how can you know richard is one year and nine months older than me mama mrs doria fought the fact by years and finally by months clare was too strong for her singular child she mentally apostrophized the girl who scornfully rejected straws while drowning but theres the religion still she comforted herself and sat down to cogitate the men smiled and looked vacuous music was proposed there are times when soft music hath not charms when it is put to as base uses as imperial caesars dust and is taken to fill horrid pauses angelica forey thumped the piano and sang im a laughing gitana haha haha matilda forey and her cousin mary branksburne wedded their voices and songfully incited all young people to haste to the bower that love has built and defy the wise ones of the world but the wise ones of the world were in a majority there and very few places of assembly will be found where they are not so the glowing appeal of the british balladmonger passed into the bosom of the emptiness he addressed clare was asked to entertain the company the singular child calmly marched to the instrument and turned over the appropriate illustrations to the balladmongers repertory clare sang a little irish air her duty done she marched from the piano mothers are rarely deceived by their daughters in these matters but clare deceived her mother and mrs doria only persisted in feeling an agony of pity for her child that she might the more warrantably pity herselfa not uncommon form of the emotion for there is no juggler like that heart the balladmonger puts into our mouths so boldly remember that she saw years of selfdenial years of a ripening scheme rendered fruitless in a minute and by the system which had almost reduced her to the condition of constitutional hypocrite she had enough of bitterness to brood over and some excuse for selfpity still even when she was cooler mrs dorias energetic nature prevented her from giving up straws were straws and the frailer they were the harder she clutched them she rose from her chair and left the room calling to adrian to follow her adrian she said turning upon him in the passage you mentioned a house where this horrible cakewhere he was this morning i desire you to take me to that woman immediately the wise youth had not bargained for personal servitude he had hoped he should be in time for the last act of the opera that night after enjoying the comedy of real life my dear aunthe was beginning to insinuate order a cab to be sent for and get your hat said mrs doria there was nothing for it but to obey he stamped his assent to the pilgrims dictum that women are practical creatures and now reflected on his own account that relationship to a young fool may be a vexation and a nuisance however mrs doria compensated him what mrs doria intended to do the practical creature did not plainly know but her energy positively demanded to be used in some way or other and her instinct directed her to the offender on whom she could use it in wrath she wanted somebody to be angry with somebody to abuse she dared not abuse her brother to his face him she would have to console adrian was a fellowhypocrite to the system and would she was aware bring her into painfully delicate albeit highly philosophic ground by a discussion of the case so she drove to bessy berry simply to inquire whither her nephew had flown when a soft woman and that soft woman a sinner is matched with a woman of energy she does not show much fight and she meets no mercy bessy berrys creditor came to her in female form that night she then beheld it in all its terrors hitherto it had appeared to her as a male a disembodied spirit of her imagination possessing male attributes and the peculiar male characteristic of being moved and ultimately silenced by tears as female her creditor was terrible indeed still had it not been a late hour bessy berry would have died rather than speak openly that her babes had sped to make their nest in the isle of wight they had a long start they were out of the reach of pursuers they were safe and she told what she had to tell she told more than was wise of her to tell she made mention of her early service in the family and of her little pension alas her little pension her creditor had come expecting no paymentcome as creditors are wont in such moods just to take it out of herto employ the familiar term at once mrs doria pounced upon the pension that of course you know is at an end she said in the calmest manner and berry did not plead for the little bit of bread to her she only asked a little consideration for her feelings true admirers of women had better stand aside from the scene undoubtedly it was very sad for adrian to be compelled to witness it mrs doria was not generous the pilgrim may be wrong about the sex not growing but its fashion of conducting warfare we must allow to be barbarous and according to what is deemed the pristine or wild cat method ruin nothing short of it accompanied poor berry to her bed that night and her character bled till morning on her pillow the scene over adrian reconducted mrs doria to her home mice had been at the cake during her absence apparently the ladies and gentlemen present put it on the greedy mice who were accused of having gorged and gone to bed im sure theyre quite welcome said mrs doria its a farce this marriage and adrian has quite come to my way of thinking i would not touch an atom of it why they were married in a married womans ring can that be legal as you call it oh im convinced dont tell me austin will be in town tomorrow and if he is true to his principles he will instantly adopt measures to rescue his son from infamy i want no legal advice i go upon common sense common decency this marriage is false mrs dorias fine scheme had become so much a part of her life that she could not give it up she took clare to her bed and caressed and wept over her as she would not have done had she known the singular child saying poor richard my dear poor boy we must save him clare we must save him of the two the mother showed the greater want of iron on this occasion clare lay in her arms rigid and emotionless with one of her hands tightlocked all she said was i knew it in the morning mama she slept clasping richards nuptial ring by this time all specially concerned in the system knew it the honeymoon was shoring placidly above them is not happiness like another circulating medium when we have a very great deal of it some poor hearts are aching for what is taken away from them when we have gone out and seized it on the highways certain inscrutable laws are sure to be at work to bring us to the criminal bar sooner or later who knows the honeymoon that did not steal somebodys sweetness richard turpin went forth singing money or life to the world richard feverel has done the same substituting happiness for money frequently synonyms the coin he wanted he would have and was just as much a highway robber as his fellow dick so that those who have failed to recognize him as a hero before may now regard him in that light meanwhile the world he has squeezed looks exceedingly patient and beautiful his coin chinks delicious music to him nature and the order of things on earth have no warmer admirer than a jolly brigand or a young man made happy by the jews chapter xxxiii and now the author of the system was on trial under the eyes of the lady who loved him what so kind as they yet are they very rigorous those soft watchful womans eyes if you are below the measure they have made of you you will feel it in the fulness of time she cannot but show you that she took you for a giant and has had to come down a bit you feel yourself strangely diminishing in those sweet mirrors till at last they drop on you complacently level but oh beware vain man of ever waxing enamoured of that wonderful elongation of a male creature you saw reflected in her adoring upcast orbs beware of assisting to delude her a woman who is not quite a fool will forgive your being but a man if you are surely that she will haply learn to acknowledge that no mortal tailor could have fitted that figure she made of you respectably and that practically though she sighs to think it her ideal of you was on the pattern of an overgrown charityboy in the regulation jacket and breech for this she first scorns the narrow capacities of the tailor and then smiles at herself but shouldst thou when the hour says plainly be thyself and the woman is willing to take thee as thou art shouldst thou still aspire to be that thing of shanks and wrests wilt thou not seem contemptible as well as ridiculous and when the fall comes will it not be flat on thy face instead of to the common height of men you may fall miles below her measure of you and be safe nothing is damaged save an overgrown charityboy but if you fall below the common height of men you must make up your mind to see her rustle her gown spy at the lookingglass and transfer her allegiance the moral of which is that if we pretend to be what we are not woman for whose amusement the farce is performed will find us out and punish us for it and it is usually the end of a sentimental dalliance had sir austin given vent to the pain and wrath it was natural he should feel he might have gone to unphilosophic excesses and however much he lowered his reputation as a sage lady blandish would have excused him she would not have loved him less for seeing him closer but the poor gentleman tasked his soul and stretched his muscles to act up to her conception of him he a man of science in life who was bound to be surprised by nothing in nature it was not for him to do more than lift his eyebrows and draw in his lips at the news delivered by ripton thompson that ill bird at raynham all he said after ripton had handed the letters and carried his penitential headache to bed was you see emmeline it is useless to base any system on a human being a very philosophical remark for one who has been busily at work building for nearly twenty years too philosophical to seem genuine it revealed where the blow struck sharpest richard was no longer the richard of his creationhis pride and his joybut simply a human being with the rest the bright star had sunk among the mass and yet what had the young man done and in what had the system failed the lady could not but ask herself this while she condoled with the offended father my friend she said tenderly taking his hand before she retired i know how deeply you must be grieved i know what your disappointment must be i do not beg of you to forgive him now you cannot doubt his love for this young person and according to his light has he not behaved honourably and as you would have wished rather than bring her to shame you will think of that it has been an accidenta misfortunea terrible misfortune the god of this world is in the machinenot out of it sir austin interrupted her and pressed her hand to get the goodnight over at any other time her mind would have been arrested to admire the phrase now it seemed perverse vain false and she was tempted to turn the meaning that was in it against himself much as she pitied him you know emmeline he added i believe very little in the fortune or misfortune to which men attribute their successes and reverses they are useful impersonations to novelists but my opinion is sufficiently high of flesh and blood to believe that we make our own history without intervention accidentsterrible misfortuneswhat are theygood night goodnight she said looking sad and troubled when i said misfortune i meant of course that he is to blame butshall i leave you his letter to me i think i have enough to meditate upon he replied coldly bowing god bless you she whispered andmay i say it do not shut your heart he assured her that he hoped not to do so and the moment she was gone he set about shutting it as tight as he could if instead of saying base no system on a human being he had said never experimentalize with one he would have been nearer the truth of his own case he had experimented on humanity in the person of the son he loved as his life and at once when the experiment appeared to have failed all humanitys failings fell on the shoulders of his son richards parting laugh in the trainit was explicable now it sounded in his ears like the mockery of this base nature of ours at every endeavour to exalt and chasten it the young man had plotted this from step to step sir austin traced the plot the curious mask he had worn since his illness the selection of his incapable uncle hippias for a companion in preference to adrian it was an evident wellperfected plot that hideous laugh would not be silenced base like the rest treacherous a creature of passions using his abilities solely to gratify themnever surely had humanity such chances as in him a manichaean tendency from which the sententious eulogist of nature had been struggling for years and which was partly at the bottom of the system now began to cloud and usurp dominion of his mind as he sat alone in the forlorn deadhush of his library he saw the devil how are we to know when we are at the head and fountain of the fates of them we love there by the springs of richards future his father sat and the devil said to him only be quiet do nothing resolutely do nothing your object now is to keep a brave face to the world so that all may know you superior to this human nature that has deceived you for it is the shameless deception not the marriage that has wounded you ay answered the baronet the shameless deception not the marriage wicked and ruinous as it must be a destroyer of my tenderest hopes my dearest schemes not the marriagethe shameless deception and he crumpled up his sons letter to him and tossed it into the fire how are we to distinguish the dark chief of the manichaeans when he talks our own thoughts to us further he whispered and your systemif you would be brave to the world have courage to cast the dream of it out of you relinquish an impossible project see it as it isdead too good for men ay muttered the baronet all who would save them perish on the cross and so he sat nursing the devil by and by he took his lamp and put on the old cloak and cap and went to gaze at ripton that exhausted debauchee and youth without a destiny slept a dead sleep a handkerchief was bound about his forehead and his helpless sunken chin and snoring nose projected up the pillow made him look absurdly piteous the baronet remembered how often he had compared his boy with this one his own bright boy and where was the difference between them mere outward gilding said his familiar yes he responded i daresay this one never positively plotted to deceive his father he followed his appetites unchecked and is internally the sounder of the two ripton with his sunken chin and snoring nose under the light of the lamp stood for human nature honest however abject miss random i fear very much is a necessary establishment whispered the monitor does the evil in us demand its natural food or it corrupts the whole ejaculated sir austin and is no angel of avail till that is drawn off and is that our conflictto see whether we can escape the contagion of its embrace and come uncorrupted out of that the world is wise in its way said the voice though it look on itself through port wine he suggested remembering his lawyer thompson wise in not seeking to be too wise said the voice and getting intoxicated on its drug of comfort human nature is weak and miss random is an establishment and wild oats an institution it always has been so and always will be so i fear in spite of your very noble efforts and leadswhither and endswhere richards laugh taken up by horrid reverberations as it were through the lengths of the lower halls replied this colloquy of two voices in a brain was concluded by sir austin asking again if there were no actual difference between the flower of his hopes and yonder drunken weed and receiving for answer that there was a decided dissimilarity in the smell of the couple becoming cognizant of which he retreated sir austin did not battle with the tempter he took him into his bosom at once as if he had been ripe for him and received his suggestions and bowed to his dictates because he suffered and decreed that he would suffer silently and be the only sufferer it seemed to him that he was greatminded in his calamity he had stood against the world the world had beaten him what then he must shut his heart and mask his face that was all to be far in advance of the mass is as fruitless to mankind he reflected as straggling in the rear for how do we know that they move behind us at all or move in our track what we win for them is lost and where we are overthrown we lie it was thus that a fine mind and a fine heart at the bounds of a nature not great chose to colour his retrogression and countenance his shortcoming and it was thus that he set about ruining the work he had done he might well say as he once did that there are hours when the clearest soul becomes a cunning fox for a grief that was private and peculiar he unhesitatingly cast the blame upon humanity just as he had accused it in the period of what he termed his own ordeal how had he borne that by masking his face and he prepared the ordeal for his son by doing the same this was by no means his idea of a mans duty in tribulation about which he could be strenuously eloquent but it was his instinct so to act and in times of trial great natures alone are not at the mercy of their instincts moreover it would cost him pain to mask his face pain worse than that he endured when there still remained an object for him to open his heart to in proportion and he always reposed upon the spartan comfort of bearing pain and being passive do nothing said the devil he nursed which meant in his case take me into you and dont cast me out excellent and sane is the outburst of wrath to men when it stops short of slaughter for who that locks it up to eat in solitary can say that it is consumed sir austin had as weak a digestion for wrath as poor hippias for a green duckling instead of eating it it ate him the wild beast in him was not the less deadly because it did not roar and the devil in him not the less active because he resolved to do nothing he sat at the springs of richards future in the forlorn deadhush of his library there hearing the cinders click in the extinguished fire and that humming stillness in which one may fancy one hears the midnight fates busily stirring their embryos the lamp glowed mildly on the bust of chatham toward morning a gentle knock fell at his door lady blandish glided in with hasty step she came straight to him and took both his hands my friend she said speaking tearfully and trembling i feared i should find you here i could not sleep how is it with you well emmeline well he replied torturing his brows to fix the mask he wished it had been adrian who had come to him he had an extraordinary longing for adrians society he knew that the wise youth would divine how to treat him and he mentally confessed to just enough weakness to demand a certain kind of management besides adrian he had not a doubt would accept him entirely as he seemed and not pester him in any way by trying to unlock his heart whereas a woman he feared would be waxing too womanly and swelling from tears and supplications to a scene of all things abhorred by him the most so he rapped the floor with his foot and gave the lady no very welcome face when he said it was well with him she sat down by his side still holding one hand firmly and softly detaining the other oh my friend may i believe you may i speak to you she leaned close to him you know my heart i have no better ambition than to be your friend surely i divide your grief and may i not claim your confidence who has wept more over your great and dreadful sorrows i would not have come to you but i do believe that sorrow shared relieves the burden and it is now that you may feel a womans aid and something of what a woman could be to you be assured he gravely said i thank you emmeline for your intentions no no not for my intentions and do not thank me think of himthink of your dear boy our richard as we have called himoh do not think it a foolish superstition of mine but i have had a thought this night that has kept me in torment till i rose to speak to you tell me first you have forgiven him a father bears no malice to his son emmeline your heart has forgiven him my heart has taken what he gave and quite forgiven him you will hear no complaints of mine the lady paused despondingly and looked at him in a wistful manner saying with a sigh yes i know how noble you are and different from others he drew one of his hands from her relaxed hold you ought to be in bed emmeline i cannot sleep go and talk to me another time no it must be now you have helped me when i struggled to rise into a clearer world and i think humble as i am i can help you now i have had a thought this night that if you do not pray for him and bless himit will end miserably my friend have you done so he was stung and offended and could hardly help showing it in spite of his mask have you done so austin this is assuredly a new way of committing fathers to the follies of their sons emmeline no not that but will you pray for your boy and bless him before the day comes he restrained himself to pronounce his words calmlyand i must do this or it will end in misery how else can it end can i save him from the seed he has sown consider emmeline what you say he has repeated his cousins sin you see the end of that oh so different this young person is not is not of the class poor austin wentworth allied himself to indeed it is different and hebe just and admit his nobleness i fancied you did this young person has great beauty she has the elements of good breeding sheindeed i think had she been in another position you would not have looked upon her unfavourably she may be too good for my son the baronet spoke with sublime bitterness no woman is too good for richard and you know it pass her yes i will speak only of him he met her by a fatal accident we thought his love dead and so did he till he saw her again he met her he thought we were plotting against him he thought he should lose her for ever and is the madness of an hour he did this my emmeline pleads bravely for clandestine matches ah do not trifle my friend say would you have had him act as young men in his position generally do to young women beneath them sir austin did not like the question it probed him very severely you mean he said that fathers must fold their arms and either submit to infamous marriages or have these creatures ruined i do not mean that exclaimed the lady striving for what she did mean and how to express it i mean that he loved her is it not a madness at his age but what i chiefly mean issave him from the consequences no you shall not withdraw your hand think of his pride his sensitiveness his great wild naturewild when he is set wrong think how intense it is set upon love think my friend do not forget his love for you sir austin smiled an admirable smile of pity that i should save him or any one from consequences is asking more than the order of things will allow to you emmeline and is not in the disposition of this world i cannot consequences are the natural offspring of acts my child you are talking sentiment which is the distraction of our modern age in everythinga phantasmal vapour distorting the image of the life we live you ask me to give him a golden age in spite of himself all that could be done by keeping him in the paths of virtue and truth i did he is become a man and as a man he must reap his own sowing the baffled lady sighed he sat so rigid he spoke so securely as if wisdom were to him more than the love of his son and yet he did love his son feeling sure that he loved his son while he spoke so loftily she reverenced him still baffled as she was and sensible that she had been quibbled with all i ask of you is to open your heart to him she said he kept silent call him a manhe is and must ever be the child of your education my friend you would console me emmeline with the prospect that if he ruins himself he spares the world of young women yes that is something closely she scanned the mask it was impenetrable he could meet her eyes and respond to the pressure of her hand and smile and not show what he felt nor did he deem it hypocritical to seek to maintain his elevation in her soft soul by simulating supreme philosophy over offended love nor did he know that he had an angel with him then a blind angel and a weak one but one who struck upon his chance am i pardoned for coming to you she said after a pause surely i can read my emmelines intentions he gently replied very poor ones i feel my weakness i cannot utter half i have been thinking oh if i could you speak very well emmeline at least i am pardoned surely so and before i leave you dear friend shall i be forgivenmay i beg itwill you bless him he was again silent pray for him austin pray for him ere the night is over as she spoke she slid down to his feet and pressed his hand to her bosom the baronet was startled in very dread of the soft fit that wooed him he pushed back his chair and rose and went to the window its day already he said with assumed vivacity throwing open the shutters and displaying the young light on the lawn lady blandish dried her tears as she knelt and then joined him and glanced up silently at richards moon standing in wane toward the west she hoped it was because of her having been premature in pleading so earnestly that she had failed to move him and she accused herself more than the baronet but in acting as she had done she had treated him as no common man and she was compelled to perceive that his heart was at present hardly superior to the hearts of ordinary men however composed his face might be and apparently serene his wisdom from that moment she grew critical of him and began to study her idola process dangerous to idols he now that she seemed to have relinquished the painful subject drew to her and as one who wished to smooth a foregone roughness murmured gods rarest blessing is after all a good woman my emmeline bears her sleepless night well she does not shame the day he gazed down on her with a fondling tenderness i could bear many many she replied meeting his eyes and you would see me look better and better ifif only but she had no encouragement to end the sentence perhaps he wanted some mute form of consolation perhaps the handsome placid features of the darkeyed dame touched him at any rate their platonism was advanced by his putting an arm about her she felt the arm and talked of the morning thus proximate they by and by both heard something very like a groan behind them and looking round beheld the saurian eye lady blandish smiled but the baronets discomposure was not to be concealed by a strange fatality every stage of their innocent loves was certain to have a human beholder oh im sure i beg pardon benson mumbled arresting his head in a melancholy pendulosity he was ordered out of the room and i think i shall follow him and try to get forty winks said lady blandish they parted with a quiet squeeze of hands the baronet then called in benson get me my breakfast as soon as you can he said regardless of the aspect of injured conscience benson sombrely presented to him i am going to town early and benson he added you will also go to town this afternoon or tomorrow if it suits you and take your book with you to mr thompson you will not return here a provision will be made for you you can go the heavy butler essayed to speak but the tremendous blow and the baronets gesture choked him at the door he made another effort which shook the rolls of his loose skin pitiably an impatient signal sent him out dumband raynham was quit of the one believer in the great shaddock dogma etext editors bookmarks although it blew hard when caesar crossed the rubicon as when nations are secretly preparing for war the world is wise in its way the danger of a little knowledge of things is disputable wise in not seeking to be too wise yet though angels smile
