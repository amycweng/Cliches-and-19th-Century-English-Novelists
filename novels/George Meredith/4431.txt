xxviii tom cogglesbys proposition xxix prelude to an engagement xxx the battle of the bulldogs part i xxxi the battle of the bulldogs part ii chapter xxvi mrs mel makes a bed for herself and family the last person thought of by her children at this period was mrs mel nor had she been thinking much of them till a letter from mr goren arrived one day which caused her to pass them seriously in review always an early bird and with maxims of her own on the subject of rising and getting the worm she was standing in a small perch in the corner of the shop dictating accounts to mrs fiske who was copying hurriedly that she might earn sweet intervals for gossip when dandy limped up and delivered the letter mrs fiske worked hard while her aunt was occupied in reading it for a great deal of fresh talk follows the advent of the post and may be reckoned on without looking up however she could tell presently that the letter had been read through such being the case and no conversation coming of it her curiosity was violent her aunts face too was an index of something extraordinary that inflexible woman instead of alluding to the letter in any way folded it up and renewed her dictation it became a contest between them which should show her human nature first mrs mel had to repress what she knew mrs fiske to control the passion for intelligence the close neighbourhood of one anxious to receive and one capable of giving waxed too much for both i think anne you are stupid this morning said mrs mel well i am aunt said mrs fiske pretending not to see which was the first to unbend i dont know what it is the figures seem all dazzled like i shall really be glad when evan comes to take his proper place ah went mrs mel and mrs fiske heard her muttering then she cried out are harriet and caroline as great liars as louisa mrs fiske grimaced that would be difficult would it not aunt and i have been telling everybody that my son is in town learning his business when hes idling at a country house and trying to play his father over again upon my word what with liars and fools if you go to sleep a minute you have a months work on your back what is it aunt mrs fiske feebly inquired a gentleman i suppose he wouldnt take an order if it was offered upon my word when tailors think of winning heiresses its time we went back to adam and eve do you mean evan aunt interposed mrs fiske who probably did not see the turns in her aunts mind thereread for yourself said mrs mel and left her with the letter mrs fiske read that mr goren had been astonished at evans non appearance and at his total silence which he did not consider altogether gentlemanly behaviour and certainly not such as his father would have practised mr goren regretted his absence the more as he would have found him useful in a remarkable invention he was about to patent being a peculiar red cross upon shirtsa fortune to the patentee but as mr goren had no natural heirs of his body he did not care for that what affected him painfully was the news of evans doings at a noble house beckley court to wit where according to the report of a rich young gentleman friend mr raikes for whose custom mr goren was bound to thank evan the youth who should have been learning the science of tailoring had actually passed himself off as a lord or the son of one or something of the kind and had got engaged to a wealthy heiress and would no doubt marry her if not found out where the chances of detection were so numerous mr goren saw much to condemn in the idea of such a marriage but like father like son said mr goren he thanked the lord that an honest tradesman was not looked down upon in this country and in fact gave mrs mel a few quiet digs to waken her remorse in having missed the man that he was when mrs fiske met her aunt again she returned her the letter and simply remarked louisa mrs mel nodded she understood the implication the general who had schemed so successfully to gain evan time at beckley court in his own despite and against a hundred obstructions had now another enemy in the field and one who if she could not undo her work could punish her by the afternoon coach mrs mel accompanied by dandy her squire was journeying to fallow field bent upon things the faithful squire was kept by her side rather as a security for others than for his particular services dandys arms were crossed and his countenance was gloomy he had been promised a holiday that afternoon to give his mistress sally kilnes cook an airing and dandy knew in his soul that sally when she once made up her mind to an excursion would go and would not go alone and that her very force of will endangered her constancy he had begged humbly to be allowed to stay but mrs mel could not trust him she ought to have told him so perhaps explanations were not approved of by this wellintended despot and however beneficial her resolves might turn out for all parties it was natural that in the interim the children of her rule should revolt and dandy picturing his sally flaunting on the arm of some accursed low marine haply kicked against mrs mels sovereignty though all that he did was to shoot out his fist from time to time and grunt through his set teeth iron to express the character of her awful rule mrs mel alighted at the dolphin the landlady of which was a mrs hawkshaw a rival of mrs sockley of the green dragon she was welcomed by mrs hawkshaw with considerable respect the great mel had sometimes slept at the dolphin ah that black she sighed indicating mrs mels dress and the story it told i cant give you his room my dear mrs harrington wishing i could im sorry to say its occupied for all i ought to be glad i dare say for hes an old gentleman who does you a good turn if you study him but there id rather have had poor dear mr harrington in my best bed than old or youngprinces or nobodies i wouldhe was that grand and pleasant mrs mel had her tea in mrs hawkshaws parlour and was entertained about her husband up to the hour of supper when a short step and a querulous voice were heard in the passage and an old gentleman appeared before them whos to carry up my trunk maam no man here mrs hawkshaw bustled out and tried to lay her hand on a man failing to find the growth spontaneous she returned and begged the old gentleman to wait a few moments and the trunk would be sent up parcel o women was his reply regularly bedevilled gets worse and worse i ll carry it up myself with a wheezy effort he persuaded the trunk to stand on one end and then looked at it the exertion made him hot which may account for the rage he burst into when mrs hawkshaw began flutteringly to apologize youre sure maam surewhat are you sure of ill tell you what i am sure ofeh this keeping clear of mens a damned pretence you dont impose upon me dont believe in your pothouse nunneriesnot a bit just like you when you are virtuous its deuced inconvenient let one of the maids try no dont believe in em having thus relieved his spleen the old gentleman addressed himself to further efforts and waxed hotter he managed to tilt the trunk over and thus gained a length and by this method of progression arrived at the foot of the stairs where he halted and wiped his face blowing lustily mrs mel had been watching him with calm scorn all the while she saw him attempt most ridiculously to impel the trunk upwards by a similar process and thought it time to interfere dont you see you must either take it on your shoulders or have a help the old gentleman sprang up from his peculiarly tight posture to blaze round at her he had the words wellpeppered on his mouth but somehow he stopped and was subsequently content to growl where s the help in a parcel of petticoats mrs mel did not consider it necessary to give him an answer she went up two or three steps and took hold of one handle of the trunk saying there i think it can be managed this way and she pointed for him to seize the other end with his hand he was now in that unpleasant state of prickly heat when testy old gentlemen could commit slaughter with ecstasy had it been the maid holding a candle who had dared to advise he would have overturned her undoubtedly and established a fresh instance of the impertinence the uselessness and weakness of women mrs mel topped him by half a head and in addition stood three steps above him towering like a giantess the extreme gravity of her large face dispersed all idea of an assault the old gentleman showed signs of being horribly injured nevertheless he put his hand to the trunk it was lifted and the procession ascended the stairs in silence the landlady waited for mrs mel to return and then said really mrs harrington you are clever that lifting that trunks as good as a lock and bolt on him youve as good as made him a dolphin him that was one o the oldest green dragons in fallifield my thanks to you most sincere mrs mel sent out to hear where dandy had got to after which she said who is the man i told you mrs harringtonthe oldest green dragon his name you mean do you know if i was to breathe it out i believe hed jump out of the window he d be off that you might swear to oh such a whimsical not illmeaningquite the contrary study his whims and youll never want theres mrs sockleyshe s took ill he wont go therethat s how ive caught him my dearbut he pays her medicine and she looks to him the same he hate a sick house but he pity a sick woman now if i can only please him i can always look on him as half a dolphin to say the least and perhaps tomorrow ill tell you who he is and what but not tonight for theres his supper to get over and that they say can be as bad as the busting of one of his own vats awful what does he eat said mrs mel a pair o chops that seem simple now dont it and yet they chops make my heart go pittypat the commonest things are the worst done said mrs mel it aint that but they must be done his particular way do you see mrs harrington laid close on the fire he say so as to keep in the juice but he ups and bounces in a minute at a speck o black so one thing or the other there you are no blacks no juices i say toast the chops said mrs mel the landlady of the dolphin accepted this new idea with much enlightenment but ruefully declared that she was afraid to go against his precise instructions mrs mel then folded her hands and sat in quiet reserve she was one of those numerous women who always know themselves to be right she was also one of those very few whom providence favours by confounding dissentients she was positive the chops would be illcooked but what could she do she was not in command here so she waited serenely for the certain disasters to enthrone her not that the matter of the chops occupied her mind particularly nor could she dream that the pair in question were destined to form a part of her history and divert the channel of her fortunes her thoughts were about her own immediate work and when the landlady rushed in with the chops under a cover and said look at em dear mrs harrington she had forgotten that she was again to be proved right by the turn of events oh the chops she responded send them while they are hot send em why you dont think id have risked their cooling i have sent em and what do he do but send em travelling back and here they be and what objections his is i might study till i was blind and i shouldnt see em no i suppose not said mrs mel he wont eat em wont eat anything but his bedroom candle immediately and whether his sheets are aired and mary says he sniffed at the chops and that gal really did expect he d fling them at her i told you what he was oh dear the bell was heard ringing in the midst of the landladys lamentations go to him yourself said mrs mel no christian man should go to sleep without his supper ah but he aint a common christian returned mrs hawkshaw the old gentleman was in a hurry to know when his bedroom candle was coming up or whether they intended to give him one at all that night if not let them say so as he liked plainspeaking the moment mrs hawkshaw touched upon the chops he stopped her mouth go about your business maam you cant cook em i never expected you could i was a fool to try you it requires at least ten years instruction before a man can get a woman to cook his chop as he likes it but what was your complaint sir said mrs hawkshaw imploringly thats right and he rubbed his hands and brightened his eyes savagely thats the way opportunity for gossip things well done down it goes you know that you cant have a word over iteh things done fit to toss on a dungheap aha then theres a cackle my belief is you do it on purpose cant be such rank idiots you do it on purpose all done for gossip oh sir no the landlady half curtsied oh maam yes the old gentleman bobbed his head no indeed sir the landlady shook hers damn it maam i swear you do symptoms of wrath here accompanied the declaration and with a sigh and a very bitter feeling mrs hawkshaw allowed him to have the last word apparently thiswhich i must beg to call the ladys morselcomforted his irascible system somewhat for he remained in a state of composure eight minutes by the clock and mark how little things hang together another word from the landlady precipitating a retort from him and a gesture or muttering from her and from him a snapping outburst and from her a sign that she held out still in fact had she chosen to battle for that last word as in other cases she might have done then would he have exploded gone to bed in the dark and insisted upon sleeping the consequence of which would have been to change this history now while mrs hawkshaw was upstairs mrs mel called the servant who took her to the kitchen where she saw a prime loin of mutton off which she cut two chops with a cunning hand and these she toasted at a gradual distance putting a plate beneath them and a tin behind and hanging the chops so that they would turn without having to be pierced the bell rang twice before she could say the chops were ready the first time the maid had to tell the old gentleman she was taking up his water her next excuse was that she had dropped her candle the chops readywho was to take them really mrs harrington you are so clever you ought if i might be so bold as say so you ought to end it yourself said the landlady i cant ask him to eat them he was all but on the busting point when i left him and that there candle did for him quite said mary the maid im afraid its chops cooked for nothing added the landlady mrs mel saw them endangered the maid held back the landlady feared we can but try she said oh i wish mum youd face him stead o me said mary i do dread that old bears den here i will go said mrs mel has he got his ale better draw it fresh if he drinks any and upstairs she marched the landlady remaining below to listen for the commencement of the disturbance an utterance of something certainly followed mrs mels entrance into the old bears den then silence then what might have been question and answer thenwas mrs mel assaulted and which was knocked down it really was a chair being moved to the table the door opened yes maam do what you like the landlady heard mrs mel descended saying send him up some fresh ale and you have made him sit down obedient to those chops cried the landlady well might poor dear mr harringtonpleasant man as he was say as he used to say theres lovely women in the world mrs hawkshaw hed say and theres duchesses hed say and theres they that can sing and can dance and some he says that can cook but hed look sly as hed stoop his head and shake it roll em into one he says and not any of your grand ladies can match my wife at home and indeed mrs harrington he told me he thought so many a time in the great company he frequented perfect peace reigning above mrs hawkshaw and mrs mel sat down to supper below and mrs hawkshaw talked much of the great one gone his relict did not care to converse about the dead save in their practical aspect as ghosts but she listened and that passed the time byandby the old gentleman rang and sent a civil message to know if the landlady had ships rum in the house dear heres another trouble cried the poor woman nonone say yes said mrs mel and called dandy and charged him to run down the street to the square and ask for the house of mr coxwell the maltster and beg of him in her name a bottle of his ships rum and dont you tumble down and break the bottle dandy accidents with spiritbottles are not excused dandy went on the errand after an energetic grunt in due time he returned with the bottle whole and sound and mr coxwells compliments mrs mel examined the cork to see that no process of suction had been attempted and then said carry it up to him dandy let him see theres a man in the house besides himself why my dear the landlady turned to her it seems natural to you to be mistress where you go i dont at all mind for aint it my profit but you do take us off our legs then the landlady warmed by gratitude told her that the old gentleman was the great london brewer who brewed there with his brother and brewed for himself five miles out of fallow field half of which and a good part of the neighbourhood he owned and his name was mr tom cogglesby oh said mrs mel and his brother is mr andrew that s it said the landlady and because he took it into his head to go and to choose for himself and be married no getting his brother mr tom to speak to him why not indeed if theres to be no marrying the sooner we lay down and give up the better i think but that s his way he do hate us women mrs harrington i have heard he was crossed some say it was the lady of beckley court who was a beauty when he was only a poor cobblers son mrs mel breathed nothing of her relationship to mr tom but continued from time to time to express solicitude about dandy they heard the door open and old tom laughing in a capital good temper and then dandy came down evidently full of ships rum hes pumped me said dandy nodding heavily at his mistress mrs mel took him up to his bedroom and locked the door on her way back she passed old toms chamber and his chuckles were audible to her they finished the rum said mrs hawkshaw i shall rate him for that tomorrow said mrs mel giving that poor beast liquor rate mr tom oh mrs harrington why hell snap your head off for a word mrs mel replied that her head would require a great deal of snapping to come off during this conversation they had both heard a singular intermittent noise above mrs hawkshaw was the first to ask what can it be more trouble with him hes in his bedroom now mad with drink like dandy perhaps said mrs mel hark cried the landlady oh it seemed that old tom was bouncing about in an extraordinary manner now came a pause as if he had sworn to take his rest now the room shook and the windows rattled one d think really his bed was a fryingpan and him a live fish in it said the landlady ohthere again my goodness have he got a flea the thought was alarming mrs mel joined in or a dont dont my dear she was cut short oh one o them little things d be ruin to me to think o that hark at him it must be and whats to do i ve sent the maids to bed we havent a man if i was to go and knock at his door and ask better try and get him to be quiet somehow ah i dare say i shall make him fire out fifty times worse mrs hawkshaw stipulated that mrs mel should stand by her and the two women went upstairs and stood at old toms door there they could hear him fuming and muttering imprecations and anon there was an interval of silence and then the room was shaken and the cursings recommenced it must be a fight he s having with a flea said the landlady oh pray heaven it is a flea for a flea my deargentlemen may bring that theirselves but a b thats a stationary and born of a bed dont you hear the other thing d give him a minutes rest but a fleas hophopoff and on and he sound like an old gentleman worried by a flea what are you doing mrs mel had knocked at the door the landlady waited breathlessly for the result it appeared to have quieted old tom whats the matter said mrs mel severely the landlady implored her to speak him fair and reflect on the desperate things he might attempt whats the matter can anything be done for you mr tom cogglesbys reply comprised an insinuation so infamous regarding women when they have a solitary man in their power that it cannot be placed on record is anything the matter with your bed anything yes anything is the matter maam hope twenty live geese inside its enougheh bed do you call it its the rack its damnation bed ha after delivering this he was heard stamping up and down the room my very best bed whispered the landlady would it please you sir to changei can give you another im not a man of experiments maamspecially in strange houses so very very sorry what the deuce old tom came close to the door you whimpering you put a man in a beast of a bedyou drive him half madand then begin to blubber go away i am so sorry sir if you dont go away maam i shall think your intentions are improper oh my goodness cried poor mrs hawkshaw what can one do with him mrs mel put mrs hawkshaw behind her are you dressed she called out in this way mrs mel tackled old tom he was told that should he consent to cover himself decently she would come into his room and make his bed comfortable and in a voice that dispersed armies of innuendoes she bade him take his choice either to rest quiet or do her bidding had old tom found his master at last and in one of the hated sex breathlessly mrs hawkshaw waited his answer and she was an astonished woman when it came very well maam wait a couple of minutes do as you like on their admission to the interior of the chamber old tom was exhibited in his daily garb sufficiently subdued to be civil and explain the cause of his discomfort lumps in his bed he was bruised by them he supposed he couldnt ask women to judge for themselvestheyd be shriekingbut he could assure them he was blue all down his back mrs mel and mrs hawkshaw turned the bed about and punched it and rolled it ha went old tom whats the good of that thats just how i found it moment i got into bed geese began to put up their backs mrs mel seldom indulged in a joke and then only when it had a proverbial cast on the present occasion the truth struck her forcibly and she said one fool makes many and so no doubt does one goose accompanied by a smile the words would have seemed impudent but spoken as a plain fact and with a grave face it set old tom blinking like a small boy ten minutes after the whip now she pursued speaking to him as to an old child look here this is how you manage knead down in the middle of the bed then jump into the hollow lie there and you neednt wake till morning old tom came to the side of the bed he had prepared himself for a wretched night an uproar and eternal complaints against the house its inhabitants and its foundations but a woman stood there who as much as told him that digging his fist into the flock and jumping into the hole into that hole under his eyeswas all that was wanted that he had been making a noise for nothing and because he had not the wit to hit on a simple contrivance then too his jest about the geesethis woman had put a stop to that he inspected the hollow cynically a man might instruct him on a point or two old tom was not going to admit that a woman could oh very well thank you maam thats your idea ill try it good night good night returned mrs mel dont forget to jump into the middle head foremost maam as you weigh said mrs mel and old tom trumped his lips silenced if not beaten beaten one might almost say for nothing more was heard of him that night he presented himself to mrs mel after breakfast next morning slept well maam oh then you did as i directed you said mrs mel those chops too very good i got through em eating like scratching only wants a beginning said mrs mel ha youve got your word then as well as everybody else wheres your dandy this morning maam locked up you ought to be ashamed to give that poor beast liquor he wont get fresh air today ha may i ask you where youre going today maam i am going to beckley so am i maam what d ye say if we join company care for insinuations i want a conveyance of some sort returned mrs mel object to a donkey maam not if hes strong and will go good said old tom and while he spoke a donkeycart stopped in front of the dolphin and a welldressed man touched his hat get out of that damned bad habit will you growled old tom what do you mean by wearing out the brim o your hat in that way help this woman in mrs mel helped herself to a part of the seat we are too much for the donkey she said ha thats right what i have maam is good i cant pretend to horses but my donkeys the best are you going to cry about him no when hes tired i shall either walk or harness you said mrs mel this was spoken halfway down the high street of fallow field old tom looked full in her face and bawled out deuce take it are you a woman i have borne three girls and one boy said mrs mel what sort of a husband he is dead ha thats an opening but taint an answer im off to beckley on a marriage business i m the son of a cobbler so i go in a donkeycart no damned pretences for me im going to marry off a young tailor to a gal hes been playing the lord to if she cares for him shell take him if not theyre all the luckier both of em whats the tailors name said mrs mel you are a woman returned old tom now come maam dont you feel ashamed of being in a donkeycart i m ashamed of men sometimes said mrs mel never of animals shamed o me perhaps i dont know you ha well im a man with no pretences do you like em how have you brought up your three girls and one boy no pretenceseh mrs mel did not answer and old tom jogged the reins and chuckled and asked his donkey if he wanted to be a racer should you take me for a gentleman maam i dare say you are sir at heart not from your manner of speech i mean appearances maam i judge by the disposition you do maam then deuce take it if you are a woman you re old tom had no time to conclude a great noise of wheels and a horn blown caused them both to turn their heads and they beheld a curricle descending upon them vehemently and a fashionably attired young gentleman straining with all his might at the reins the next instant they were rolling on the bank about twenty yards ahead the curricle was halted and turned about to see the extent of the mischief done pardon a thousand times my worthy couple cried the sonorous mr raikes what we have seen we swear not to divulge franco and fred your pledge we swear exclaimed this couple but suddenly the cheeks of mr john raikes flushed he alighted from the box and rushing up to old tom was shouting my bene do you want my toe on your plate old tom stopped him with the mysterious words completely changed the aspect of mr john raikes he bowed obsequiously and made his friend franco step down and assist in the task of reestablishing the donkey who fortunately had received no damage chapter xxvii exhibits roses generalship evans performance on the second fiddle and the wretchedness of the countess we left rose and evan on their way to lady jocelyn at the librarydoor rose turned to him and with her chin archly lifted sideways said i know what you feel you feel foolish now the sense of honour and of the necessity of acting the part it imposes on him may be very strong in a young man but certainly as a rule the sense of ridicule is more poignant and evan was suffering horrid pangs we none of us like to play second fiddle to play second fiddle to a young woman is an abomination to us all but to have to perform upon that instrument to the darling of our heartswould we not rather die nay almost rather end the duet precipitately and with violence evan when he passed drummond into the house and quietly returned his gaze endured the first shock of this strange feeling there could be no doubt that he was playing second fiddle to rose and what was he about to do oh horror to stand like a criminal and say or worse have said for him things to tip the ears with fire to tell the young ladys mother that he had won her daughters love and meant what did he mean he knew not alas he was second fiddle he could only mean what she meant evan loved rose deeply and completely but noble manhood was strong in him you may sneer at us if you please ladies we have been educated in a theory that when you lead off with the bow the order of nature is reversed and it is no wonder therefore that having stript us of one attribute our fine feathers moult and the majestic cocklike march which distinguishes us degenerates you unsex us if i may dare to say so ceasing to be men what are we if we are to please you rightly always allow us to play first poor evan did feel foolish whether rose saw it in his walk or had a loving feminine intuition of it and was aware of the golden rule i have just laid down we need not inquire she hit the fact and he could only stammer and bid her open the door no she said after a slight hesitation it will be better that i should speak to mama alone i see walk out on the lawn dear and wait for me and if you meet drummond dont be angry with him drummond is very fond of me and of course i shall teach him to be fond of you he only thinks what is not true because he does not know you i do thoroughly and there you see i give you my hand evan drew the dear hand humbly to his lips rose then nodded meaningly and let her eyes dwell on him and went in to her mother to open the battle could it be that a flame had sprung up in those grey eyes latterly once they were like morning before sunrise how soft and warm and tenderly transparent they could now be assuredly she loved him and he beloved by the noblest girl ever fashioned why should he hang his head and shrink at the thought of human faces like a wretch doomed to the pillory he visioned her last glance and lightning emotions of pride and happiness flashed through his veins the generous brave heart yes with her hand in his he could stand at baymeet any fate evan accepted rose because he believed in her love and judged it by the strength of his own her sacrifice of her position he accepted because in his soul he knew he should have done no less he mounted to the level of her nobleness and losing nothing of the beauty of what she did it was not so strange to him still there was the baleful reflection that he was second fiddle to his beloved no harmony came of it in his mind how could he take an initiative he walked forth on the lawn where a group had gathered under the shade of a maple consisting of drummond forth mrs evremonde mrs shorne mr george uplift seymour jocelyn and ferdinand laxley a little apart juliana bonner was walking with miss carrington juliana when she saw him left her companion and passing him swiftly said follow me presently into the conservatory evan strolled near the group and bowed to mrs shorne whom he had not seen that morning the ladys acknowledgement of his salute was constrained and but a shade on the side of recognition they were silent till he was out of earshot he noticed that his second approach produced the same effect in the conservatory juliana was awaiting him it is not to give you roses i called you here mr harrington she said not if i beg one he responded ah but you do not want them from it depends on the person pluck this said evan pointing to a white rose she put her fingers to the stem what folly she cried and turned from it are you afraid that i shall compromise you asked evan you care for me too little for that my dear miss bonner how long did you know rose before you called her by her christian name evan really could not remember and was beginning to wonder what he had been called there for the little lady had feverish eyes and fingers and seemed to be burning to speak but afraid i thought you had gone she dropped her voice without wishing me goodbye i certainly should not do that miss bonner formal she exclaimed half to herself miss bonner thanks you do you think i wish you to stay no friend of yours would wish it you do not know the selfishnessbrutalof these people of birth as they call it i have met with nothing but kindness here said evan then go while you can feel that she answered for it cannot last another hour here is the rose she broke it from the stem and handed it to him you may wear that and they are not so likely to call you an adventurer and names of that sort i am hardly considered a lady by them an adventurer the full meaning of the phrase struck evans senses when he was alone miss bonner knew something of his condition evidently perhaps it was generally known and perhaps it was thought that he had come to win rose for his worldly advantage the idea was overwhelmingly new to him up started selflove in arms he would renounce her it is no insignificant contest when love has to crush selflove utterly at moments it can be done love has divine moments there are times also when love draws part of his being from selflove and can find no support without it but how could he renounce her when she came forth to himsmiling speaking freshly and lightly and with the colour on her cheeks which showed that she had done her part how could he retract a step i have told mama evan thats over she heard it first from me and she dear evan if you are going to be sensitive ill run away you that fear no danger and are the bravest man i ever knew i think you are really trembling she will speak to papa and thenand then i suppose they will both ask you whether you intend to give me up or no im afraid youll do the former your motherlady jocelyn listened to you rose you told her all every bit and what does she think of me thinks you very handsome and astonishing and me very idiotic and natural and that there is a great deal of bother in the world and that my noble relatives will lay the blame of it on her no dear not all that but she talked very sensibly to me and kindly you know she is called a philosopher nobody knows how deephearted she is though my mother is true as steel i cant separate the kindness from the sense or i would tell you all she said when i say kindness i dont mean any oh my child and tears and kisses and maundering you know you mustnt mind her thinking me a little fool you want to know what she thinks of you she said nothing to hurt you evan and we have gained ground so far and now well go and face our enemies uncle mel expects to hear about your appointment in a day or two and oh rose evan burst out what is it why must i owe everything to you why dear why because if you do its very much better than your owing it to anybody else proud again not proud only second fiddle you know dear evan when two people love there is no such thing as owing between them rose i have been thinking it is not too late i love you god knows i did in portugal i do nowmore and more but oh my bright angel he ended the sentence in his breast well butwhat evan sounded down the meaning of his but stripped of the usual heroics it was what will be thought of me not a small matter to any of us he caught a distant glimpse of the little bit of bare selfishness and shrank from it too late cried rose the battle has commenced now and mr harrington i will lean on your arm and be led to my dear friends yonder do they think that i am going to put on a mask to please them not for anybody what they are to know they may as well know at once she looked in evans face do you hesitate he felt the contrast between his own and hers between the niggard spirit of the beggarly receiver and the high bloom of the exalted giver nevertheless he loved her too well not to share much of her nature and wedding it suddenly he said rose tell me now if you were to see the place where i was born could you love me still yes evan if you were to hear me spoken of with contempt who dares cried rose never to me contempt of what i spring from rose names used names are used tushnames said rose reddening how cowardly that is have you finished oh faint heart i suppose im not a fair lady or you wouldnt have won me now come remember evan i conceal nothing and if anything makes you wretched here do think how i love you in his own firm belief he had said everything to arrest her in her course and been silenced by transcendent logic she thought the same rose made up to the conclave under the maple the voices hushed as they approached capital weather said rose does harry come back from london tomorrowdoes anybody know not aware laxley was heard to reply i want to speak a word to you rose said mrs shorne with the greatest pleasure my dear aunt and rose walked after her my dear rose mrs shorne commenced your conduct requires that i should really talk to you most seriously you are probably not aware of what you are doing nobody likes ease and natural familiarity more than i do i am persuaded it is nothing but your innocence you are young to the worlds ways and perhaps a little too headstrong and vain conceited and wilful added rose if you like the words better but i must sayi do not wish to trouble your fatheryou know he cannot bear worrybut i must say that if you do not listen to me he must be spoken to why not mama i should naturally select my brother first no doubt you understand me any distant allusion to mr harrington pertness will not avail you rose so you want me to do secretly what i am doing openly you must and shall remember you are a jocelyn rose only half my dear aunt and by birth a lady rose and i ought to look under my eyes and blush and shrink whenever i come near a gentleman aunt ah my dear no doubt you will do what is most telling since you have spoken of this mr harrington i must inform you that i have it on certain authority from two or three sources that he is the son of a small shopkeeper at lymport mrs shorne watched the effect she had produced indeed aunt cried rose and do you know this to be true so when you talk of gentlemen rose please be careful whom you include i mustnt include poor mr harrington then my grandpapa bonner is out of the list and such numbers of good worthy men mrs shorne understood the hit at the defunct manufacturer she said you must most distinctly give me your promise while this young adventurer remains herei think it will not be longnot to be compromising yourself further as you now do orindeed i musti shall let your parents perceive that such conduct is ruin to a young girl in your position and certainly you will be sent to elburne house for the winter rose lifted her hands crying ye godsas harry says but im very much obliged to you my dear aunt concerning mr harrington wonderfully obliged son of a small is it a tttailor aunt it isi have heard and that is much worse cloth is viler than cotton and dont they call these creatures snsnips some word of that sort it makes little difference what they are called well aunt i sincerely thank you as this subject seems to interest you go and see mama now she can tell you a great deal more and if you want her authority come back to me rose then left her aunt in a state of extreme indignation it was a clever move to send mrs shorne to lady jocelyn they were antagonistic and rational as lady jocelyn was and with her passions under control she was unlikely to side with mrs shorne now rose had fought against herself and had as she thought conquered in portugal evans half insinuations had given her small suspicions which the scene on board the jocasta had half confirmed and since she came to communicate with her own mind she bore the attack of all that rose against him bit by bit she had not been too blind to see the unpleasantness of the fresh facts revealed to her they did not change her on the contrary drew her to him fasterand she thought she had completely conquered whatever could rise against him but when juliana bonner told her that day that evan was not only the son of the thing but the thing himself and that his name could be seen any day in lymport and that he had come from the shop to beckley poor rosey had a sick feeling that almost sank her for a moment she looked back wildly to the doors of retreat her eyes had to feed on evan she had to taste some of the luxury of love before she could gain composure and then her arrogance towards those she called her enemies did not quite return in that letter you told me allallall evan yes allreligiously oh why did i miss it would it give you pleasure she feared to speak being tender as a mother to his sensitiveness the expressive action of her eyebrows sufficed she could not bear concealment or doubt or a shadow of dishonesty and he gaining force of soul to join with hers took her hands and related the contents of the letter fully she was pale when he had finished it was some time before she was able to get free from the trammels of prejudice but when she did she did without reserve saying evan there is no man who would have done so much these little exaltations and generosities bind lovers tightly he accepted the credit she gave him and at that we need not wonder it helped him further to accept herself otherwise could he his name known to be on a shopfronthave aspired to her still but as an unexampled man princely in soul as he felt why he might kneel to rose jocelyn so they listened to one another and blinded the world by putting bandages on their eyes after the fashion of little boys and girls meantime the fair being who had brought these two from the ends of the social scale into this happy tangle the beneficent countess was wretched when you are in the enemys country you are dependent on the activity and zeal of your spies and scouts and the best of thesepolly wheedle to withad proved defective recalcitrant even and because a letter had been lost in her room as the countess exclaimed to herself though polly gave her no reasons the countess had therefore to rely chiefly upon personal observation upon her intuitions upon her sensations in the proximity of the people to whom she was opposed and from these she gathered that she was to use the word which seemed fitting to her betrayed still to be sweet still to smile and to amusestill to give her zealous attention to the business of the diplomatists election still to go through her churchservices devoutly required heroism she was equal to it for she had remarkable courage but it was hard to feel no longer at one with providence had not providence suggested sir abraham to her killed him off at the right moment in aid of her and now providence had turned and the assistance she had formerly received from that power and given thanks for so profusely was the cause of her terror it was absolutely as if she had been borrowing from a jew and were called upon to pay fiftyfold interest evan she writes in a gasp to harriet we must pack up and depart abandon everything he has disgraced us all and ruined himself impossible that we can stay for the picnic we are known dear think of my position one day in this house particulars when i embrace you i dare not trust a letter here if evan had confided in me he is impenetrable he will be low all his life and i refuse any more to sully myself in attempting to lift him for silvas sake i must positively break the connection heaven knows what i have done for this boy and will support me in the feeling that i have done enough my conscience at least is safe like many illustrious generals the countess had for the hour lost heart we find her however the next day writing oh harriet what trials for sisterly affection can i possibly weather the gale as the old l sailors used to say it is dreadful i fear i am by duty bound to stop on little bonner thinks evan quite a dukes son has been speaking to her grandmama and today this morning the venerable old lady quite as much as gave me to understand that an union between our brother and her sons child would sweetly gratify her and help her to go to her rest in peace can i chase that spark of comfort from one so truly pious dearest juliana i have anticipated evans feeling for her and so she thinks his conduct cold indeed i told her point blank he loved her that you know is different from saying dying of love which would have been an untruth but evan of course no getting him should juliana ever reproach me i can assure the child that any man is in love with any womanwhich is really the case it is you dear humdrum what the dictionary calls nascent i never liked the word but it stands for a fact the countess here exhibits the weakness of a selfeducated intelligence she does not comprehend the joys of scholarship in her employment of latinisms it will be pardoned to her by those who perceive the profound piece of feminine discernment which precedes it i do think i shall now have courage to stay out the picnic she continues i really do not think all is known very little can be known or i am sure i could not feel as i do it would burn me up george up does not dare and his most beautiful ladylove had far better not mr forth may repent his whispers but oh what evan may do rose is almost detestable manners my dear totally deficient an ally has just come evans good fortune is most miraculous his low friend turns out to be a young fortunatus very original sparkling and in my hands to be made much of i do think he willfor he is most zealoushe will counteract that hateful mr forth who may soon have work enough mr raikes evans friend met a mad captain in fallow field dear mr raikes is ready to say anything not from love of falsehood but because he is ready to think it he has confessed to me that evan told him louisa de saldar has changed his opinion and much impressed this eccentric young gentleman do you know any young girl who wants a fortune and would be grateful dearest i have decided on the picnic let your conscience be clear and providence cannot be against you so i feel mr parsley spoke very beautifully to that purpose last sunday in the morning service a little too much through his nose perhaps but the poor young mans nose is a great organ and we will not cast it in his teeth more than nature has done i said so to my diplomatist who was amused if you are sparklingly vulgar with the english you are aristocratic oh what principle we women require in the thorny walk of life i can show you a letter when we meet that will astonish humdrum not so diplomatic as the writer thought mrs melville sweet woman must continue to practise civility for a woman who is a wife my dear in verity she lives in a glass house and let her fling no stones let him who is without sin how beautiful that christian sentiment i hope i shall be pardoned but it always seems to me that what we have to endure is infinitely worse than any other suffering for you find no comfort for the children of ts in scripture nor any defence of their dreadful position robbers thieves magdalens but no the unfortunate offspring of that class are not even mentioned at least in my most diligent perusal of the scriptures i never lighted upon any remote allusion and we know the jews did wear clothing outcasts verily and evan could go and write but i have no patience with him he is the blind tool of his mother and anybodys puppet the letter concludes with horrid emphasis the madre in beckley has sent for evan from a low publichouse i have intercepted the messenger evan closeted with sir franks andrews horrible old brother with lady jocelyn the whole house from garret to kitchen full of whispers a prayer to providence closes the communication chapter xxviii tom coggleseys proposition the appearance of a curricle and a donkeycart within the gates of beckley court produced a sensation among the men of the lower halls and a couple of them rushed out with the left calf considerably in advance to defend the house from violation toward the curricle they directed what should have been a bow but was a nod their joint attention was then given to the donkeycart in which old tom cogglesby sat alone bunchy in figure bunched in face his shrewd grey eyes twinkling under the bush of his eyebrows oy siryou my man exclaimed the tallest of the pair resolutely this wont do dont you know driving this sort of conveyance slap along the gravel ere up to the pillars s unparliamentary cant be allowed now right about this address accompanied by a commanding elevation of the dexter hand seemed to excite mr raikes far more than old tom he alighted from his perch in haste and was running up to the stalwart figure crying fellow when as you tell a dog to lie down old tom called out be quiet sir and raikes halted with prompt military obedience the sight of the curricle acting satellite to the donkeycart staggered the two footmen are you lords sang out old tom a burst of laughter from the friends of mr raikes in the curricle helped to make the powdered gentlemen aware of a sarcasm and one with no little dignity replied that they were not lords oh then come and hold my donkey great irresolution was displayed at the injunction but having consulted the face of mr raikes one fellow evidently half overcome by what was put upon him with the steps of adam into exile descended to the gravel and laid his hand on the donkeys head hold hard cried old tom whisper in his ear hell know your language may i have the felicity of assisting you to terra firma interposed mr raikes with the bow of deferential familiarity done that once too often returned old tom jumping out there whats the fee theres a crown for you that aint afraid of a live donkey and there s a sixpenny bit for you that areto keep up your courage and when hes dead you shall have his skinto shave by excellent shouted raikes thomas he addressed a footman hand in my card mr john feversham raikes and tell my lady tom cogglesbys come added the owner of that name we will follow tom cogglesby as he chooses to be called lady jocelyn rose on his entering the library and walking up to him encountered him with a kindly full face so i see you at last tom she said without releasing his hand and old tom mounted patches of red in his wrinkled cheeks and blinked and betrayed a singular antiquated bashfulness which ended after a mumble of yes there he was and he hoped her ladyship was well by his seeking refuge in a chair where he sat hard and fixed his attention on the leg of a table well tom do you find much change in me she was woman enough to continue he was obliged to look up cant say i do my lady dont you see the grey hairs tom better than a wig rejoined he was it true that her ladyship had behaved rather ill to old tom in her youth excellent women have been naughty girls and young beauties will have their train it is also very possible that old tom had presumed upon trifles and found it difficult to forgive her his own folly preferable to a wig well i would rather see you with your natural thatch youre bent too you look as if you had kept away from beckley a little too long told you my lady i should come when your daughter was marriageable oho thats it i thought it was the election election be hembeg pardon my lady swear tom if it relieves you i think it bad to check an oath or a sneeze i m come to see you on business my lady or i shouldnt have troubled you malice you ll see i dont bear any my lady ah if you had only sworn roundly twentyfive years ago what a much younger man you would have been and a brave capital old friend whom i should not have missed all that time come cried old tom varying his eyes rapidly between her ladyships face and the floor you acknowledge i had reason to mais cela va sans dire cobblers sons aint scholars my lady and are not all in the habit of throwing their fathers in our teeth i hope old tom wriggled in his chair well my lady im not going to make a fool of myself at my time o life neednt be alarmed now youve got the bellrope handy and a husband on the premises lady jocelyn smiled stood up and went to him i like an honest fist she said taking his we re not going to be doubtful friends and we wont snap and snarl thats for people whore independent of wigs tom i find for my part that a little grey on the top of any head cools the temper amazingly i used to be rather hot once you could be peppery my lady now im cool tom and so must you be or if you fight it must be in my cause as you did when you thrashed that saucy young carter do you remember if youll sit ye down my lady ill just tell you what im come for said old tom who plainly showed that he did remember and was alarmingly softened by her ladyships retention of the incident lady jocelyn returned to her place youve got a marriageable daughter my lady i suppose we may call her so said lady jocelyn with a composed glance at the ceiling gaged to be married to any young chap you must put the question to her tom ha i dont want to see her at this lady jocelyn looked slightly relieved old tom continued happen to have got a little moneynot so much as many a lords got i dare say such as tis there tis young fellow i know wants a wife and he shall have best part of it will that suit ye my lady lady jocelyn folded her hands certainly ive no objection what it has to do with me i cant perceive ahem went old tom it wont hurt your daughter to be married now will it oh my daughter is the destined bride of your young fellow said lady jocelyn is that how its to be sheold tom cleared his throat she wont marry a lord my lady but shehemif she dont mind thatll have a deuced sight more hard cash than many lords son d give her and a young fellow for a husband sound in wind and limb good bone and muscle speaks grammar and two or three languages and stop cried lady jocelyn i hope this is not a prize young man if he belongs at his age to the unco quid i refuse to take him for a son inlaw and i think rose will too old tom burst out vehemently hes a damned good young fellow though he isnt a lord well said lady jocelyn i ve no doubt youre in earnest tom it s curious for this morning rose has come to me and given me the first chapter of a botheration which she declares is to end in the common rash experiment what is your young fellows name who is he what is he wont take my guarantee my lady roseif she marriesmust have a name you know old tom hit his knee then theres a pill for ye to swallow for he aint the son of a lord thats swallowed tom what is he hes the son of a tradesman then my lady and old tom watched her to note the effect he had produced more s the pity was all she remarked and he ll have his thousand a year to start with and hes a tailor my lady her ladyship opened her eyes harringtons his name my lady dont know whether you ever heard of it lady jocelyn flung herself back in her chair the queerest thing i ever met said she thousand a year to start with old tom went on and if she marries i mean if he marries her ill settle a thousand per ann on the first babyboy or gal hum is this gross collusion mr tom lady jocelyn inquired what does that mean have you spoken of this before to any one i havent my lady decided on it this morning hem you got a son too hes fond of a young gal or he ought to be ill settle him when ive settled the daughter harry is strongly attached to a dozen i believe said his mother well tom well think of it i may as well tell you rose has just been here to inform me that this mr harrington has turned her head and that she has given her troth and all that sort of thing i believe such was not to be laid to my charge in my day you were open enough my lady said old tom shes fond of the young fellow shell have a pill to swallow poor young woman old tom visibly chuckled lady jocelyn had a momentary temptation to lead him out but she did not like the subject well enough to play with it apparently rose has swallowed it she said goose shears cabbage and all muttered old tom got a stomach she knows hes a tailor then the young fellow told her he hasnt been playing the lord to her as far as hes concerned i think he has been tolerably honest tom for a man and a lover and told her he was born and bound a tailor rose certainly heard it from him slapping his knee old tom cried bravo for though one part of his nature was disappointed and the best part of his plot disarranged he liked evans proceeding and felt warm at what seemed to him roses scorn of rank she must be a good gal my lady she couldnt have got it from t other side got it from you not that you no said lady jocelyn apprehending him im afraid i have no republican virtues i m afraid i should have rejected the pill dont be angry with me for old tom looked sour again i like birth and position and worldly advantages and notwithstanding roses pledge of the instrument she calls her heart and in spite of your offer i shall i tell you honestly counsel her to have nothing to do with anything less than lords old tom struck in very well are you going to lock her up my lady no nor shall i whip her with rods leave her free to her choice she will have my advice that i shall give her and i shall take care that before she makes a step she shall know exactly what it leads to her father of course will exercise his judgement lady jocelyn said this to uphold the honour of sir franks knowing at the same time perfectly well that he would be wheedled by rose i confess i like this mr harrington but its a great misfortune for him to have had a notorious father a tailor should certainly avoid fame and this young man will have to carry his father on his back he ll never throw the great mel off tom cogglesby listened and was really astonished at her ladyships calm reception of his proposal shameful of him shameful he muttered perversely for it would have made him desolate to have had to change his opinion of her ladyship after cherishing it and consoling himself with it fiveandtwenty years fearing the approach of softness he prepared to take his leave nowyour servant my lady i stick to my word mind and if your people here are willing ii ve got a candidate up for fallfield ill knock him down and you shall sneak in your tory servant my lady old tom rose to go lady jocelyn took his hand cordially though she could not help smiling at the humility of the cobblers son in his manner of speaking of the tory candidate wont you stop with us a few days i d rather not i thank ye wont you see rose i wont not till shes married well tom were friends now not aware ive ever done you any harm my lady look me in the face the trial was hard for him though she had been fiveandtwenty years a wife she was still very handsome but he was not going to be melted and when the perverse old fellow obeyed her it was with an aspect of resolute disgust that would have made any other woman indignant lady jocelyn laughed why tom your brother andrews here and makes himself comfortable with us we rode by brooks farm the other day do you remember coppings pondhow we dragged it that night what days we had old tom tugged once or twice at his imprisoned fist while these youthful frolics of his too stupid self and the wild and beautiful miss bonner were being recalled i remember he said savagely and reaching the door hurled out and i remember the bulldogs too servant my lady with which he effected a retreat to avoid a ringing laugh he heard in his ears lady jocelyn had not laughed she had done no more than look and smile kindly on the old boy it was at the bulldogs a fall of water on the borders of the park that tom cogglesby then a hearty young man had been guilty of his folly had mistaken her frank friendliness for a return of his passion and his stubborn vanity still attributed her rejection of his suit to the fact of his descent from a cobbler or as he put it to her infernal worship of rank poor old tom said her ladyship when alone he s rough at the rind but sound at the core she had no idea of the long revenge old tom cherished and had just shaped into a plot to be equal with her for the bulldogs chapter xxix prelude to an engagement money was a strong point with the elburne brood the jocelyns very properly respected blood but being as harry their youngest representative termed them poor as rats they were justified in considering it a marketable stuff and when they married they married for money the hon miss jocelyn had espoused a manufacturer who failed in his contract and deserved his death the diplomatist melville had not stepped aside from the family traditions in his alliance with miss black the daughter of a bold bankrupt educated in affluence and if he touched nothing but l and some very pretty ringlets that was not his fault sir franks too mixed his pure stream with gold as yet however the gold had done little more than shine on him and belonging to expectancy it might be thought unsubstantial beckley court was in the hands of mrs bonner who with the highest sense of duty toward her only living child was the last to appreciate lady jocelyns entire absence of demonstrative affection and severely reprobated her daughters philosophic handling of certain serious subjects sir franks no doubt came better off than the others her ladyship brought him twenty thousand pounds and harry had ten in the past tense and rose ten in the future but living as he had done a score of years anticipating the demise of an incurable invalid he though an excellent husband and father could scarcely be taught to imagine that the jocelyn object of his bargain was attained he had the semblance of wealth without the personal glow which absolute possession brings it was his habit to call himself a poor man and it was his dream that rose should marry a rich one harry was hopeless he had been his grandmothers pet up to the years of adolescence he was getting too old for any prospect of a military career he had no turn for diplomacy no taste for any of the walks open to blood and birth and was in headlong disgrace with the fountain of goodness at beckley court where he was still kept in the tacit understanding that should juliana inherit the place he must be at hand to marry her instantly after the fashion of the jocelyns they were an injured family for what they gave was good and the commercial world had not behaved honourably to them now ferdinand laxley was just the match for rose born to a title and fine estate he was evidently fond of her and there had been a gentle hope in the bosom of sir franks that the family fatality would cease and that rose would marry both money and blood from this happy delusion poor sir franks was awakened to hear that his daughter had plighted herself to the son of a tradesman that as the climax to their evil fate she who had some blood and some money of her ownthe only jocelyn who had ever united the twowas desirous of wasting herself on one who had neither the idea was so utterly opposed to the principles sir franks had been trained in that his intellect could not grasp it he listened to his sister mrs shorne he listened to his wife he agreed with all they said though what they said was widely diverse he consented to see and speak to evan and he did so and was much the most distressed for sir franks liked many things in life and hated one thing alonewhich was bother a smooth world was his delight rose knew this and her instruction to evan was you cannot give me upyou will go but you cannot give me up while i am faithful to you tell him that she knew that to impress this fact at once on the mind of sir franks would be a great gain for in his detestation of bother he would soon grow reconciled to things monstrous and hearing the same on both sides the matter would assume an inevitable shape to him mr second fiddle had no difficulty in declaring the eternity of his sentiments but he toned them with a despair rose did not contemplate and added also his readiness to repair in any way possible the evil done he spoke of his birth and position sir franks with a gentlemanly delicacy natural to all lovers of a smooth world begged him to see the main and the insurmountable objection birth was to be desired of course and position and so forth but without money how can two young people marry evans heart melted at this generous way of putting it he said he saw it he had no hope he would go and be forgotten and begged that for any annoyance his visit might have caused sir franks and lady jocelyn they would pardon him sir franks shook him by the hand and the interview ended in a dialogue on the condition of the knees of black lymport and on horseflesh in portugal and spain following evan rose went to her father and gave him a good hours excitement after which the worthy gentleman hurried for consolation to lady jocelyn whom he found reading a book of french memoirs in her usual attitude with her feet stretched out and her head thrown back as in a distant survey of the lively people screening her from a troubled world her ladyship read him a piquant story and sir franks capped it with another from memory whereupon her ladyship held him wrong in one turn of the story and sir franks rose to get the volume to verify and while he was turning over the leaves lady jocelyn told him incidentally of old tom cogglesbys visit and proposal sir franks found the passage and that her ladyship was right which it did not move her countenance to hear ah said he finding it no use to pretend there was no bother in the world heres a pretty pickle rose says she will have that fellow hum replied her ladyship and if she keeps her mind a couple of years it will be a wonder very bad for her this sort of thingtalked about muttered sir franks ferdinand was just the man well yes i suppose its her mistake to think brains an absolute requisite said lady jocelyn opening her book again and scanning down a column sir franks being imitative adopted a similar refuge and the talk between them was varied by quotations and choice bits from the authors they had recourse to both leaned back in their chairs and spoke with their eyes on their books julias going to write to her mother said he very filial and proper said she therell be a horrible hubbub you know emily most probably i shall get the blame cela se concoit young harrington goes the day after tomorrow thought it better not to pack him off in a hurry and just before the picnic no certainly i suppose it would look odd how are we to get rid of the countess eh this bautru is amusing franks but hes nothing to vandy homme incomparable on the whole i find menage rather dull the countess what an accomplished liar that woman is she seems to have stepped out of tallemants gallery concerning the countess i suppose you had better apply to melville where the deuce did this young harrington get his breeding from he comes of a notable sire yes but theres no sign of the snob in him and i exonerate him from the charge of adventuring after rose george uplift tells mei had him in just nowthat the mother is a woman of mark and strong principle she has probably corrected the too luxuriant nature of mel in her offspring that is to say in this one pour les autres je ne dis pas well the young man will go and if rose chooses to become a monument of constancy we can do nothing i shall give my advice but as she has not deceived me and she is a reasonable being i shant interfere putting the case at the worst they will not want money i have no doubt tom cogglesby means what he says and will do it so there we will leave the matter till we hear from elburne house sir franks groaned at the thought how much does he offer to settle on them he asked a thousand a year on the marriage and the same amount to the first child i daresay the end would be that they would get all sir franks nodded and remained with one eyebrow pitiably elevated above the level of the other anything but a tailor he exclaimed presently half to himself there is a prejudice against that craft her ladyship acquiesced berangerlet me seeyour favourite frenchman franks wasnt it his fatherno his grandfather mon pauvre et humble grandpyre i think was a tailor hum the degrees of the thing i confess dont affect me one trade i imagine to be no worse than another ferdinands allowance is about a thousand said sir franks meditatively and wont be a farthing more till he comes to the title added her ladyship well resumed sir franks its a horrible bother his wife philosophically agreed with him and the subject was dropped lady jocelyn felt with her husband more than she chose to let him know and sir franks could have burst into anathemas against fate and circumstances more than his love of a smooth world permitted he however was subdued by her calmness and she with ten times the weight of brain was manoeuvred by the wonderful dash of general rose jocelyn for her ladyship thinking i shall get the blame of all this rather sided insensibly with the offenders against those who condemned them jointly and seeing that rose had been scrupulously honest and straightforward in a very delicate matter this lady was so constituted that she could not but applaud her daughter in her heart a worldly woman would have acted if she had not thought differently but her ladyship was not a worldly woman evans bearing and character had during his residence at beckley court become so thoroughly accepted as those of a gentleman and one of their own rank that after an allusion to the origin of his breeding not a word more was said by either of them on that topic besides rose had dignified him by her decided conduct by the time poor sir franks had read himself into tranquillity mrs shorne who knew him well and was determined that he should not enter upon his usual negociations with an unpleasantness that is to say to forget it joined them in the library bringing with her sir john loring and hamilton jocelyn her first measure was to compel sir franks to put down his book lady jocelyn subsequently had to do the same well what have you done franks said mrs shorne done answered the poor gentleman what is there to be done ive spoken to young harrington spoken to him he deserves horsewhipping have you not told him to quit the house instantly lady jocelyn came to her husbands aid it wouldnt do i think to kick him out in the first place he hasnt deserved it not deserved it emilythe commonest low vile adventuring tradesman in the second place pursued her ladyship its not adviseable to do anything that will make rose enter into the young womans sublimities it s better not to let a lunatic see that you think him stark mad and the same holds with young women afflicted with the lovemania the sound of sense even if they cant understand it flatters them so as to keep them within bounds otherwise you drive them into excesses best avoided really emily said mrs shorne you speak almost one would say as an advocate of such unions you must know perfectly well that i entirely condemn them replied her ladyship who had once and once only delivered her opinion of the nuptials of mr and mrs shorne in selfdefence and to show the total difference between the cases mrs shorne interjected an utterly penniless young adventurer oh no theres money remarked sir franks money is there quoth hamilton respectfully and theres wit added sir john if he has half his sisters talent astonishing woman hamilton chimed in adding with a shrug but egad well we dont want him to resemble his sister said lady jocelyn i acknowledge shes amusing amusing emily mrs shorne never encountered her sisterinlaws calmness without indignation i could not rest in the house with such a person knowing her what she is a vile adventuress as i firmly believe what does she do all day with your mother depend upon it you will repent her visit in more ways than one a prophecy asked lady jocelyn smiling on the grounds of common sense on the grounds of propriety and consideration of what was due to themselves all agreed to condemn the notion of rose casting herself away on evan lady jocelyn agreed with mrs shorne sir franks with his brother and sir john but as to what they were to do they were divided lady jocelyn said she should not prevent rose from writing to evan if she had the wish to do so folly must come out said her ladyship its a combustible material i wont have her health injured she shall go into the world more she will be presented at court and if its necessary to give her a dose or two to counteract her vanity i dont object this will wear off or si cest veritablement une grande passion eh bien we must take what providence sends us and which we might have prevented if we had condescended to listen to the plainest worldly wisdom added mrs shorne yes said lady jocelyn equably you know you and i julia argue from two distinct points girls may be shut up as you propose i dont think nature intended to have them the obverse of men i m sure their mothers never designed that they should run away with footmen riding masters chance curates as they occasionally do and wouldnt if they had points of comparison my opinion is that prospero was just saved by the prince of naples being wrecked on his island from a shocking mis alliance between his daughter and the son of sycorax i see it clearly poetry conceals the extreme probability but from what i know of my sex i should have no hesitation in turning prophet also as to that what could mrs shorne do with a mother who talked in this manner mrs melville when she arrived to take part in the conference which gradually swelled to a family one was equally unable to make lady jocelyn perceive that her plan of bringing up rose was in the present result of it other than unlucky now the two generalsrose jocelyn and the countess de saldar had brought matters to this pass and from the two tactical extremes the former by openness and dash the latter by subtlety and her own interpretations of the means extended to her by providence i will not be so bold as to state which of the two i think right good and evil work together in this world if the countess had not woven the tangle and gained evan time rose would never have seen his bloodnever have had her spirit hurried out of all shows and forms and habits of thought up to the gates of existence as it were where she took him simply as god created him and her and clave to him again had rose been secret when this turn in her nature came she would have forfeited the strange power she received from it and which endowed her with decision to say what was in her heart and stamp it lastingly there the two generals were quite antagonistic but no two in perfect ignorance of one anothers proceedings ever worked so harmoniously toward the main result the countess was the skilful engineer rose the general of cavalry and it did really seem that with tom cogglesby and his thousands in reserve the victory was about to be gained the male jocelyns an easy race decided that if the worst came to the worst and rose proved a wonder there was money which was something but social prejudice was about to claim its champion hitherto there had been no general on the opposite side love aided by the countess had engaged an inert mass the champion was discovered in the person of the provincial don juan mr harry jocelyn harry had gone on a mysterious business of his own to london he returned with a green box under his arm which five minutes after his arrival was entrusted to conning in company with a genial present for herself of a kind not perhaps so fit for exhibition at least they both thought so for it was given in the shades harry then went to pay his respects to his mother who received him with her customary ironical tolerance his father to whom he was an incarnation of bother likewise nodded to him and gave him a finger duty done harry looked round him for pleasure and observed nothing but glum faces even the face of john raikes was heavy he had been hovering about the duke and miss current for an hour hoping the countess would come and give him a promised introduction the countess stirred not from above and jack drifted from group to group on the lawn and grew conscious that wherever he went he brought silence with him his isolation made him humble and when harry shook his hand and said he remembered fallow field and the fun there mr raikes thanked him harry made his way to join his friend ferdinand and furnished him with the latest london news not likely to appear in the papers laxley was distant and unamused from the fact too that harry was known to be the countesss slave his presence produced the same effect in the different circles about the grounds as did that of john raikes harry began to yawn and wish very ardently for his sweet lady she however had too fine an instinct to descend an hour before dinner juliana sent him a message that she desired to see him jove i hope that girls not going to be blowing hot again sighed the conqueror he had nothing to fear from juliana the moment they were alone she asked him have you heard of it harry shook his head and shrugged they havent told you rose has engaged herself to mr harrington a tradesman a tailor pooh have you got hold of that story said harry but im sorry for old ferdy he was fond of rosey heres another bother you dont believe me harry harry was mentally debating whether in this new posture of affairs his friend ferdinand would press his claim for certain moneys lent oh i believe you he said harrington has the knack with you women why you made eyes at him it was a tossup between you and rosey once juliana let this accusation pass he is a tradesman he has a shop in lymport i tell you harry and his name on it and he came here on purpose to catch rose and now he has caught her he tells her and his mother is now at one of the village inns waiting to see him go to mr george uplift he knows the family yes the countess has turned your head of course but she has schemed and schemed and told such storiesgod forgive her the girl had to veil her eyes in a spasm of angry weeping oh come juley murmured her killing cousin harry boasted an extraordinary weakness at the sight of feminine tears i say juley you know if you begin crying im done for and it isnt fair he dropped his arm on her waist to console her and generously declared to her that he always had been very fond of her these scenes were not foreign to the youth her fits of crying from which she would burst in a frenzy of contempt at him had made harry say stronger things and the assurances of profound affection uttered in a most languid voice will sting the hearts of women harry still went on with his declarations heating them rapidly so as to bring on himself the usual outburst and check she was longer in coming to it this time and he had a horrid fear that instead of dismissing him fiercely and so annulling his words the strange little person was going to be soft and hold him to them there were her tears however which she could not stop well then juley look i do upon my honour yesthere dont cry any morei do love you harry held his breath in awful suspense juliana quietly disengaged her waist and looking at him said poor harry you need not lie any more to please me such was harrys astonishment that he exclaimed it isnt a lie i say i do love you and for an instant he thought and hoped that he did love her well then harry i dont love you said juliana which revealed to our friend that he had been mistaken in his own emotions nevertheless his vanity was hurt when he saw she was sincere and he listened to her a moody being this may account for his excessive wrath at evan harrington after juliana had given him proofs of the truth of what she said but the countess was harringtons sister the image of the countess swam before him was it possible harry went about asking everybody he met the initiated were discreet those who had the whispers were open a bare truth is not so convincing as one that discretion confirms harry found the detestable news perfectly true stop it by all means if you can said his father yes try a fall with rose said his mother and i must sit down to dinner today with a confounded fellow the son of a tailor whos had the impudence to make love to my sister cried harry im determined to kick him out of the househalf to what is the modification of your determination due lady jocelyn inquired probably suspecting the sweet and gracious person who divided harrys mind her ladyship treated her children as she did mankind generally from her intellectual eminence harry was compelled to fly from her cruel shafts he found comfort with his aunt shorne and she as much as told harry that he was the head of the house and must take up the matter summarily it was expected of him now was the time for him to show his manhood harry could think of but one way to do that yes and if i doall up with the old lady he said and had to explain that his grandmama bonner would never leave a penny to a fellow who had fought a duel a duel said mrs shorne no there are other ways insist upon his renouncing her and rosetreat her with a high hand as becomes you your mother is incorrigible and as for your father one knows him of old this devolves upon you our family honour is in your hands harry considering harrys reputation the family honour must have got low harry of course was not disposed to think so he discovered a great deal of unused pride within him for which he had hitherto not found an agreeable vent he vowed to his aunt that he would not suffer the disgrace and while still that blandishing olivehued visage swam before his eyes he pledged his word to mrs shorne that he would come to an understanding with harrington that night quietly said she no scandal pray oh never mind how i do it returned harry manfully how am i to do it then he added suddenly remembering his debt to evan mrs shorne instructed him how to do it quietly and without fear of scandal the miserable champion replied that it was very well for her to tell him to say this and that butand she thought him demented he must previous to addressing harrington in those terms have money money echoed the lady money yes money he iterated doggedly and she learnt that he had borrowed a sum of harrington and the amount of the sum it was a disastrous plight for mrs shorne was penniless she cited ferdinand laxley as a likely lender oh im deep with him already said harry in apparent dejection how dreadful are these everlasting borrowings of yours exclaimed his aunt unaware of a trifling incongruity in her sentiments you must speak to him withoutpay him byandby we must scrape the money together i will write to your grandfather yes speak to him how can i when i owe him i cant tell a fellow hes a blackguard when i owe him and i cant speak any other way i aint a diplomatist dashed if i know what to do juliana murmured his aunt cant ask her you know mrs shorne combated the one prominent reason for the objection but there were two harry believed that he had exhausted julianas treasury reproaching him further for his wastefulness mrs shorne promised him the money should be got by hook or by crook next day and you will speak to this mr harrington tonight harry no allusion to the loan till you return it appeal to his sense of honour the dinnerbell assembled the inmates of the house evan was not among them he had gone as the countess said aloud on a diplomatic mission to fallow field with andrew cogglesby the truth being that he had finally taken andrew into his confidence concerning the letter the annuity and the bond upon which occasion andrew had burst into a laugh and said he could lay his hand on the writer of the letter trust old tom for plots van hell blow you up in a twinkling the cunning old dog he pretends to be hardhe s as soft as i am if it wasnt for his crotchets well hand him back the cash and thats ended andeh what a dear girl she is not that im astonished my harry might have married a lordsit at top of any table in the land and youre as good as any man thats my opinion but i say shes a wonderful girl to see it chattering thus andrew drove with the dear boy into fallow field evan was still in his dream to him the generous love and valiant openness of rose though they were matched in his own bosom seemed scarcely human almost as noble to him were the gentlemanly plainspeaking of sir franks and lady jocelyns kind commonsense but the more he esteemed them the more unbounded and miraculous appeared the prospect of his calling their daughter by the sacred name and kneeling with her at their feet did the dear heavens have that in store for him the horizon edges were dimly lighted harry looked about under his eyelids for evan trying at the same time to compose himself for the martyrdom he had to endure in sitting at table with the presumptuous fellow the countess signalled him to come within the presence as he was crossing the room rose entered and moved to meet him with ah harry back again glad to see you harry gave her a blunt nod to which she was inattentive what whispered the countess after he pressed the tips of her fingers have you brought back the grocer now this was hard to stand harry could forgive her her birth and pass it utterly by if she chose to fall in love with him but to hear the grocer mentioned when he knew of the tailor was a little too much and what harry felt his ingenuous countenance was accustomed to exhibit the countess saw it she turned her head from him to the diplomatist and he had to remain like a sentinel at her feet he did not want to be thanked for the green box still he thought she might have favoured him with one of her muchembracing smiles in the evening after wine when he was warm and had almost forgotten the insult to his family and himself the countess snubbed him it was unwise on her part but she had the ghastly thought that facts were oozing out and were already half known she was therefore sensitive tenfold to appearances savage if one failed to keep up her lie to her and was guilty of a shadow of difference of behaviour the picnic over our general would evacuate beckley court and shake the dust off her shoes and leave the harvest of what she had sown to providence till then respect and the honours of war so the countess snubbed him and he being full of wine fell into the hands of juliana who had witnessed the little scene she has made a fool of others as well as of you said juliana how has she he inquired never mind do you want to make her humble and crouch to you i want to see harrington said harry he will not return tonight from fallow field he has gone there to get mr andrew cogglesbys brother to do something for him you wont have such another chance of humbling them bothboth i told you his mother is at an inn here the countess has sent mr harrington to fallow field to be out of the way and she has told her mother all sorts of falsehoods how do you know all that quoth harry by jove juley talk about plotters no keeping anything from you ever never mind the mother is here she must be a vulgar woman oh if you could manage harry to get this woman to comeyou could do it so easily while they are at the pienic tomorrow it would have the best effect on rose she would then understand and the countess i could send the old woman a message cried harry rushing into the scheme inspired by julianas fiery eyes send her a sort of message to say where we all were let her know that her son is here in some way juley resumed and egad what an explosion pursued harry but suppose no one shall know if you leave it to meif you do just as i tell you harry you wont be treated as you were this evening after that if you bring down her pride and harry i hear you want moneyi can give you some youre a perfect trump juley exclaimed her enthusiastic cousin but no i cant take it i must kiss you though he put a kiss upon her cheek once his kisses had left a red waxen stamp she was callous to these compliments now will you do what i advise you tomorrow she asked after a slight hesitation during which the olivehued visage flitted faintly in the distances of his brain harry said it ll do rose good and make harrington cut yes i declare i will then they parted juliana went to her bedroom and flung herself upon the bed hysterically as the tears came thick and fast she jumped up to lock the door for this outrageous habit of crying had made her contemptible in the eyes of lady jocelyn and an object of pity to rose some excellent and noble natures cannot tolerate disease and are mystified by its ebullitions it was very sad to see the slight thin frame grasped by those wan hands to contain the violence of the frenzy that possessed her the pale hapless face rigid above the torment in her bosom she had prayed to be loved like other girls and her readiness to give her heart in return had made her a byword in the house she went to the window and leaned out on the casement looking towards fallowfield over the downs weeping bitterly with a hard shut mouth one brilliant star hung above the ridge and danced on her tears will he forgive me she murmured oh my god i wish we were dead together her weeping ceased and she closed the window and undressed as far away from the mirror as she could get but its force was too much for her and drew her to it some undefined hope had sprung in her suddenly with nervous slow steps she approached the glass and first brushing back the masses of black hair from her brow looked as for some new revelation long and anxiously she perused her features the wide bony forehead the eyes deepset and rounded with the scarlet of recent tears the thin nosesharp as the dead the weak irritable mouth and sunken cheeks she gazed like a spirit disconnected from what she saw presently a sort of forlorn negative was indicated by the motion of her head i can pardon him she said and sighed how could he love such a face chapter xxx the battle of the bulldogs part i at the southwestern extremity of the park with a view extending over wide meadows and troubled mill waters yellow barnroofs and weathergray old farmwalls two grassy mounds threw their slopes to the margin of the stream here the bulldogs held revel the hollow between the slopes was crowned by a bending birch which rose threestemmed from the root and hung a noiseless green shower over the basin of green it shadowed beneath it the interminable growl sounded pleasantly softly shot the sparkle of the twisting water and you might dream things halffulfilled knots of fern were about but the tops of the mounds were firm grass evidently well rolled and with an eye to airy feet olympus one eminence was called parnassus the other olympus a little overlooked parnassus but parnassus was broader and altogether better adapted for the games of the muses round the edges of both there was a welltrimmed bush of laurel obscuring only the feet of the dancers from the observing gods for on olympus the elders reclined great efforts had occasionally been made to dispossess and unseat them and their security depended mainly on a hump in the middle of the mound which defied the dance watteaulike groups were already couched in the shade there were ladies of all sorts townbred and countrybred farmers daughters and daughters of peers for this picnic as lady jocelyn disgusting the countess would call it was in reality a fete champetre given annually to which the fair offspring of the superior tenants were invited the brothers and fathers coming to fetch them in the evening it struck the eye of the countess de saldar that olympus would be a fitting throne for her and a point whence her shafts might fly without fear of a return like another illustrious general at salamanca she directed a detachment to take possession of the height courtly sir john loring ran up at once and gave the diplomatist an opportunity to thank her flatteringly for gaining them two minutes to themselves sir john waved his handkerchief in triumph welcoming them under an awning where carpets and cushions were spread and whence the countess could eye the field she was dressed ravishingly slightly in a foreign style the bodice being peaked at the waist as was then the portuguese persuasion the neck too was deliciously veiled with fine laceand thoroughly veiled for it was a feature the countess did not care to expose to the vulgar daylight off her gentle shoulders as it were some fringe of cloud blown by the breeze this sweet lady opened her bosom to curled a lovely black lace scarf not carolines if she laughed the tinge of mourning lent her laughter new charms if she sighed the exuberant array of her apparel bade the spectator be of good cheer was she witty men surrendered reason and adored her only when she entered the majestic mood and assumed the languors of greatness and recited musky anecdotes of her intimacy with it only then did mankind as represented at beckley court open an internal eye and reflect that it was wonderful in a tailors daughter and she felt that mankind did so reflect her instincts did not deceive her she knew not how much was known in the depths of her heart she kept low the fear that possibly all might be known and succeeding in this she said to herself that probably nothing was known after all george uplift miss carrington and rose were the three she abhorred partly to be out of their way and to be out of the way of chance shots for she had heard names of people coming that reminded her of dubbinss where in past days there had been on one awful occasion a terrific discovery made the countess selected olympus for her station it was her last day and she determined to be happy doubtless she was making a retreat but have not illustrious generals snatched victory from their pursuers fair then sweet and full of grace the countess moved as the restless shifting of colours to her motions was the constant interchange of her semisorrowful manner and ready archness sir john almost capered to please her and the diplomatist in talking to her forgot his diplomacy and the craft of his tongue it was the last day also of caroline and the duke the countess clung to caroline and the duke more than to evan and rose she could see the first couple walking under an avenue of limes and near them that young man or monkey raikes as if in ambush twice they passed him and twice he doffed his hat and did homage a most singular creature exclaimed the countess it is my constant marvel where my brother discovered such a curiosity do notice him that man raikes said the diplomatist do you know he is our rival harry wanted an excuse for another bottle last night and proposed the member for fallowfield up got this mr raikes and returned thanks yes the countess negligently interjected in a way she had caught from lady jocelyn cogglesbys nominee apparently i know it all said the countess we need have no apprehension he is docile my brotherinlaws brother you see is most eccentric we can manage him best through this mr raikes for a personal application would be ruin he quite detests our family and indeed all the aristocracy melvilles mouth pursed and he looked very grave sir john remarked he seems like a monkey just turned into a man and doubtful about the tail added the countess the image was tolerably correct but other causes were at the bottom of the air worn by john raikes the countess had obtained an invitation for him with instructions that he should come early and he had followed them so implicitly that the curricle was flinging dust on the hedges between fallow field and beckley but an hour or two after the chariot of apollo had mounted the heavens and mr raikes presented himself at the breakfast table fortunately for him the countess was there after the repast she introduced him to the duke and he bowed to the duke and the duke bowed to him and now to instance the peculiar justness in the mind of mr raikes he though he worshipped a coronet and would gladly have recalled the feudal times to a corrupt land could not help thinking that his bow had beaten the dukes and was better he would rather not have thought so for it upset his preconceptions and threatened a revolution in his ideas for this reason he followed the duke and tried if possible to correct or at least chasten the impressions he had of possessing a glaring advantage over the nobleman the dukes second notice of him was hardly a nod well mr raikes reflected if this is your duke why egad for figure and style my friend harrington beats him hollow and raikes thought he knew who could conduct a conversation with superior dignity and neatness the torchlight of a delusion was extinguished in him but he did not wander long in that gloomy cavernous darkness of the disenchanted as many of us do and as evan had done when after a week at beckley court he began to examine of what stuff his brilliant father the great mel was composed on the contrary as the light of the duke dwindled raikes gained in lustre in fact he said theres nothing but the title wanting he was by this time on a level with the duke in his elastic mind olympus had been held in possession by the countess about half an hour when lady jocelyn mounted it quite unconscious that she was scaling a fortified point the countess herself fired off the first gun at her it has been so extremely delightful up alone here lady jocelyn to look at everybody below i hope many will not intrude on us none but the dowagers who have breath to get up replied her ladyship panting by the way countess you hardly belong to us yet you dance indeed i do not oh then you are in your right place a dowager is a woman who doesnt dance and her male attendant iswhat is he we will call him a fogy lady jocelyn directed a smile at melville and sir john who both protested that it was an honour to be the countesss fogy rose now joined them with laxley morally dragged in her wake another dowager and fogy cried the countess musically do you not dance my child not till the music strikes up rejoined rose i suppose we shall have to eat first that is the hamlet of the picnic play i believe said her mother of course you dance dont you countess rose inquired for the sake of amiable conversation the countesss head signified oh no quite out of the question she held up a little bit of her mournful draperies adding besides you dear child know your company and can select i do not and cannot do so i understand we have a most varied assembly rose shut her eyes and then looked at her mother lady jocelyns face was undisturbed but while her eyes were still upon the countess she drew her head gently back imperceptibly if anything she was admiring the lady but rose could be no placid philosophic spectator of what was to her a horrible assumption and hypocrisy for the sake of him she loved she had swallowed a nauseous cup bravely the countess was too much for her she felt sick to think of being allied to this person she had a shuddering desire to run into the ranks of the world and hide her head from multitudinous hootings with a pang of envy she saw her friend jenny walking by the side of william harvey happy untried unoffending full of hope and without any bitter draughts to swallow aunt bel now came tripping up gaily take the alternative douairiere or demoiselle cried lady jocelyn we must have a sharp distinction or olympus will be mobbed entre les deux sil vous plait responded aunt bel rose hurry down and leaven the mass i see ten girls in a bunch its shocking ferdinand pray disperse yourself why is it emily that we are always in excess at picnics is man dying out from what i can see remarked lady jocelyn harry will be lost to his species unless some one quickly relieves him hes already half eaten up by the conley girls countess isnt it your duty to rescue him the countess bowed and murmured to sir john a dismissal i fear my fascinations lady jocelyn may not compete with those fresh young persons ha ha fresh young persons laughed sir john for the ladies in question were romping boisterously with mr harry the countess inquired for the names and condition of the ladies and was told that they sprang from farmer conley a welltodo son of the soil who farmed about a couple of thousand acres between fallow field and beckley and bore a good reputation at the county bank but i do think observed the countess it must indeed be pernicious for any youth to associate with that class of woman a deterioration of manners rose looked at her mother again she thought those girls would scorn to marry a tradesmans son the feeling grew in rose that the countess lowered and degraded her her mothers calm contemplation of the lady was more distressing than if she had expressed the contempt rose was certain according to her young ideas lady jocelyn must hold now the countess had been considering that she would like to have a word or two with mr harry and kissing her fingers to the occupants of olympus and fixing her fancy on the diverse thoughts of the ladies and gentlemen deduced from a rapturous or critical contemplation of her figure from behind she descended the slope was it going to be a happy day the wellimagined opinions of the gentleman on her attire and style made her lean to the affirmative but roses demure behaviour and somethingsomething would come across her hopes she had as she now said to herself stopped for the picnic mainly to give caroline a last opportunity of binding the duke to visit the cogglesby saloons in london let caroline cleverly contrive this as she might without any compromise and the stay at beckley court would be a great gain yes caroline was still with the duke they were talking earnestly the countess breathed a short appeal to providence that caroline might not prove a fool overnight she had said to caroline do not be so english can one not enjoy friendship with a nobleman without wounding ones conscience or breaking with the world my dear the duke visiting you you cow that infamous strike of yours he will be utterly obsequious i am not telling you to pass the line the contrary but we continentals have our grievous reputation because we dare to meet as intellectual beings and defy the imputation that ladies and gentlemen are no better than animals it sounded very lofty to caroline who accepting its sincerity replied i cannot do things by halves i cannot live a life of deceit a life of miserynot deceit whereupon pitying her poor english nature the countess gave her advice and this advice she now implored her familiars to instruct or compel caroline to follow the countesss garment was plucked at she beheld little dorothy loring glancing up at her with the roguish timidity of her years may i come with you asked the little maid and went off into a prattle i spent that five shillingsi bought a shillings worth of sweet stuff and nine pennorth of twine and a shilling for small wax candles to light in my room when im going to bed because i like plenty of light by the lookingglass always and they do make the room so hot my jane declared she almost fainted but i burnt them out then i only had very little left for a horse to mount my doll on and i wasnt going to get a screw so i went to papa and he gave me five shillings and oh do you know rose cant bear me to be with you jealousy i suppose for youre very agreeable and do you know your mama is coming today ive got a papa and no mama and youve got a mama and no papa isnt it funny but i dont think so much of it as you re grown up oh im quite sure she is coming because i heard harry telling juley she was and juley said it would be so gratifying to you a bribe and a message relieved the countess of dorothys attendance on her what did this mean were people so base as to be guilty of hideous plots in this house her mother coming the countesss blood turned deadly chill had it been her father she would not have feared but her mother was so vilely plain of speech she never opened her mouth save to deliver facts which was to the countess the sign of atrocious vulgarity but her mother had written to say she would wait for evan in fallow field the countess grasped at straws did dorothy hear that and if harry and juliana spoke of her mother what did that mean that she was hunted and must stand at bay oh papa papa why did you marry a dawley she exclaimed plunging to what was in her idea the root of the evil she had no time for outcries and lamentations it dawned on her that this was to be a day of battle where was harry still in the midst of the conley throng apparently poohpoohing something to judge by the twist of his mouth the countess delicately signed for him to approach her the extreme delicacy of the signal was at least an excuse for harry to perceive nothing it was renewed and harry burst into a fit of laughter at some fun of one of the conley girls the countess passed on and met juliana pacing by herself near the lower gates of the park she wished only to see how juliana behaved the girl looked perfectly trustful as much so as when the countess was pouring in her ears the tales of evans growing but bashful affection for her he will soon be here whispered the countess has he told you he will come by this entrance no replied juliana you do not look well sweet child i was thinking that you did not countess oh indeed yes with reason alas all our visitors have by this time arrived i presume they come all day the countess hastened away from one who when roused could be almost as clever as herself and again stood in meditation near the joyful harry this time she did not signal so discreetly harry could not but see it and the conley girls accused him of cruelty to the beautiful dame which novel idea stung harry with delight and he held out to indulge in it a little longer his back was half turned and as he talked noisily he could not observe the serene and resolute march of the countess toward him the youth gaped when he found his arm taken prisoner by the insertion of a small deliciouslygloved and perfumed hand through it i must claim you for a few moments said the countess and took the startled conley girls one and all in her beautiful smile of excuse why do you compromise me thus sir these astounding words were spoken out of the hearing of the conley girls compromise you muttered harry masterly was the skill with which the countess contrived to speak angrily and as an injured woman while she wore an indifferent social countenance i repeat compromise me no mr harry jocelyn you are not the jackanapes you try to make people think you you understand me the countess might accuse him but harry never had the ambition to make people think him that his natural tendency was the reverse and he objected to the application of the word jackanapes to himself and was ready to contest the fact of people having that opinion at all however all he did was to repeat compromise is not open unkindness to me compromising me how asked harry would you dare to do it to a strange lady would you have the impudence to attempt it with any woman here but me no i am innocent it is my consolation i have resisted you but you by this cowardly behaviour place meand my reputation which is moreat your mercy noble behaviour mr harry jocelyn i shall remember my young english gentleman the view was totally new to harry i really had no idea of compromising you he said upon my honour i cant see how i did it now oblige me by walking less in the neighbourhood of those fatfaced glaring farmgirls the countess spoke under her breath and dont look as if you were being whipped the art of it is evidentyou are but carrying on the gamelisten if you permit yourself to exhibit an unkindness to me you show to any man who is a judge and to every woman that there has been something between us you know my innocenceyes but you must punish me for having resisted you thus long harry swore he never had such an idea and was much too much of a man and a gentleman to behave in that wayand yet it seemed wonderfully clever and here was the countess saying take your reward mr harry jocelyn you have succeeded i am your humble slave i come to you and sue for peace to save my reputation i endanger myself this is generous of you am i such a clever fellow thought the young gentleman deuced lucky with women he knew that still a fellow must be wonderfully miraculously clever to be able to twist and spin about such a woman as this in that way he did not object to conceive that he was the fellow to do it besides here was the countess de saldarworth five hundred of the conley girlsalmost at his feet mollified he said now didnt you begin it evasion was the answer it would be such pleasure to you so see a proud woman weep and if yesterday persecuted as i am with dreadful falsehoods abroad respecting me and mine if yesterday i did seem cold to your great merits is it generous of you to take this revenge harry began to scent the double meaning in her words she gave him no time to grow cool over it she leaned half abandoned on his arm arts feminine and irresistible encompassed him it was a fatal mistake of julianas to enlist harry jocelyn against the countess de saldar he engaged still without any direct allusion to the real business to move heaven and earth to undo all that he had done and the countess implied an engagement to dowhat more than she intended to fulfil ten minutes later she was alone with caroline tie yourself to the duke at the dinner she said in the forcible phrase she could use when necessary dont let them scheme to separate you never mind looksdo it caroline however had her reasons for desiring to maintain appearances the countess dashed at her hesitation there is a plot to humiliate us in the most abominable way the whole family have sworn to make us blush publicly publicly blush they have written to mama to come and speak out now will you attend to me caroline you do not credit such atrocity i know it to be true i never can believe that rose would do such a thing said caroline we can hardly have to endure more than has befallen us already her speech was pensive as of one who had matter of her own to ponder over a swift illumination burst in the countesss mind no have you dear darling carry not that i intend that you should but today the duke would be such ineffable support to us may i deem you have not been too cruel today you dear silly english creature duck i used to call you when i was your little louy all is not yet lost but i will save you from the ignominy if i can i will caroline denied nothingconfirmed nothing just as the countess had stated nothing yet they understood one another perfectly women have a subtler language than ours the veil pertains to them morally as bodily and they see clearer through it the countess had no time to lose wrath was in her heart she did not lend all her thoughts to selfdefence without phrasing a word or absolutely shaping a thought in her head she slanted across the sun to mr raikes who had taken refreshment and in obedience to his instinct notwithstanding his enormous pretensions had commenced a few preliminary antics dear mr raikes she said drawing him aside not before dinner i really cant contain the exuberant flow returned that gentleman my animal spirits always get the better of me he added confidentially suppose you devote your animal spirits to my service for half an hour yours countess from the os frontis to the chine was the exuberant rejoinder the countess made a wry mouth your curricle is in beckley behold said jack two juveniles not half so blest as i do from the seat regard the festive scene oer yon park palings they are there even franko and fred i m afraid i promised to get them in at a later period of the day which sadly sore my conscience doth disturb but what is to be done about the curricle my countess mr raikes said the countess smiling on him fixedly you are amusing but in addressing me you must be precise and above all things accurate i am not your countess he bowed profoundly oh that i might say my queen the countess replied a conviction of your lunacy would prevent my taking offence though i might wish you enclosed and guarded without any further exclamations raikes acknowledged a superior and now attend to me said the countess listen you go yourself or send your friends instantly to fallow field bring with you that girl and her child stop there is such a person tell her she is to be spoken to about the prospects of the poor infant i leave that to your inventive genius evan wishes her here bring her and should you see the mad captain who behaves so oddly favour him with a ride he says he dreams his wife is here and he will not reveal his name suppose it should be my own beloved husband i am quite anxious the countess saw him go up to the palings and hold a communication with his friends franko and fred one took the whip and after mutual flourishes drove away now mused the countess if captain evremonde should come it would break up the picnic alas the countess had surrendered her humble hopes of a days pleasure but if her mother came as well what a diversion that would be if her mother came before the captain his arrival would cover the retreat if the captain preceded her she would not be noticed suppose her mother refrained from coming in that case it was a pity but the jocelyns had brought it on themselves this mapping out of consequences followed the countesss deeds and did not inspire them her passions sharpened her instincts which produced her actions the reflections ensued as in nature the consequences were all seen subsequently observe the difference between your male and female generals on reflection too the countess praised herself for having done all that could be done she might have written to her mother but her absence would have been remarked her messenger might have been overhauled and lastly mrs melgorgon of a mother the countess cried out for mrs mel was like a fate to her she could remember only two occasions in her whole life when she had been able to manage her mother and then by lying in such a way as to distress her conscience severely if mama has conceived this idea of coming nothing will impede her my prayers will infuriate her said the countess and she was sure that she had acted both rightly and with wisdom she put on her armour of smiles she plunged into the thick of the enemy since they would not allow her to taste human happinessshe had asked but for the picnic a small truce since they denied her that rather than let them triumph by seeing her wretched she took into her bosom the joy of demons she lured mr george uplift away from miss carrington and spoke to him strange hints of matrimonial disappointments looking from time to time at that apprehensive lady doating on her terrors and mr george seconded her by his clouded face for he was ashamed not to show that he did not know louisa harrington in the countess de saldar and had not the courage to declare that he did the countess spoke familiarly but without any hint of an ancient acquaintance between them what a post her husbands got thought mr george not envying the count he was wrong she was an admirable ally all over the field the countess went watching for her mother praying that if she did come providence might prevent her from coming while they were at dinner how clearly mrs shorne and mrs melville saw her vulgarity now by the new light of knowledge how certain they were that they had seen her ungentle training in a dozen little instances she is not wellbred cela se voit said lady jocelyn bred its the stage how could such a person be bred said mrs shorne accept in the countess the heroine who is combating classprejudices and surely she is preeminently noteworthy true she fights only for her family and is virtually the champion of the opposing institution misplaced that does not matter the fates may have done it purposely by conquering she establishes a principle a duke adores her sister the daughter of the house her brother and for herself she has many protestations in honour of her charms nor are they empty ones she can confound mrs melville if she pleases to by exposing an adorer to lose a friend issuing out of tailordom she a countess has done all this and it were enough to make her glow did not little evils and angers and spites and alarms so frightfully beset her the sun of the picnic system is dinner hence philosophers may deduce that the picnic is a british invention there is no doubt that we do not shine at the picnic until we reflect the face of dinner to this then all who were not lovers began seriously to look forward and the advance of an excellent county band specially hired to play during the entertainment gave many of the guests quite a new taste for sweet music and indeed we all enjoy a thing infinitely more when we see its meaning about this time evan entered the lower parkgates with andrew the first object he encountered was john raikes in a state of great depression he explained his case just look at my frill now upon my honour you know im good tempered i pass their bucolic habits but this is beyond bearing i was near the palings there and a fellow calls out hi will you help the lady over holloa thinks i an adventure however i advised him to take her round to the gates the beast burst out laughing now then says he and i heard a scrambling at the pales and up came the head of a dog oh the dog first says i catch by the ears says he i did so pull says he gad pull indeed the beast gave a spring and came slap on my chest with his dirty wet muzzle on my neck i felt instantly it was the death of my frill but gallant as you know me i still asked for the lady if you will please or an it meet your favour to extend your hand to me i confess i did think it rather odd the idea of a lady coming in that way over the palings but my curst love of adventure always blinds me it always misleads my better sense harrington well instead of a lady i see a fellowhe may have been a lineal descendant of cedric the saxon wheres the lady says i lady says he and stares and then laughs lady why he jumps over and points at his beast of a dog dont you know a bitch when you see one i was in the most ferocious rage if he hadnt been a big burly bully down hed have gone why didnt you say what it was i roared why says he the word isnt considered polite i gave him a cut there i said i rejoice to be positively assured that you uphold the laws and forms of civilization sir my belief is he didnt feel it the thrust sinned in its shrewdness remarked evan ending a laugh hem went mr raikes more contentedly after all what are appearances to the man of wit and intellect dress and women will approve you but i assure you they much prefer the man of wit in his slouched hat and stockings down i was introduced to the duke this morning it is a curious thing that the seduction of a duchess has always been one of my dreams at this andrew cogglesby fell into a fit of laughter your servant said mr raikes turning to him and then he muttered extraordinary likeness good heavens powers from a state of depression mr raikeschanged into one of bewilderment evan paid no attention to him and answered none of his hasty undertoned questions just then as they were on the skirts of the company the band struck up a lively tune and quite unconsciously the legs of raikes affected it may be by supernatural reminiscences loosely hornpiped it was but a moment he remembered himself the next but in that fatal moment eyes were on him he never recovered his dignity in beckley court he was fatally mercurial what is the joke against this poor fellow asked evan of andrew never mind van youll roar old tom again we ll see byandby after the champagne hethis young raikesha habut i cant tell you and andrew went away to drummond to whom he was more communicative then he went to melville and one or two others and the eyes of many became concentrated on raikes and it was observed as a singular sign that he was constantly facing about and flushing the fiercest red once he made an effort to get hold of evans arm and drag him away as one who had an urgent confession to be delivered of but evan was talking to lady jocelyn and other ladies and quietly disengaged his arm without even turning to notice the face of his friend then the dinner was announced and men saw the dinner the countess went to shake her brothers hand and with a very gratulatory visage said through her halfshut teeth if mama appears rise up and go away with her before she has time to speak a word an instant after evan found himself seated between mrs evremonde and one of the conley girls the dinner had commenced the first half of the battle of the bulldogs was as peaceful as any ordinary picnic and promised to the general company as calm a conclusion chapter xxxi the battle of the bulldogs part ii if it be a distinct point of wisdom to hug the hour that is then does dinner amount to a highly intellectual invitation to man for it furnishes the occasion and britons are the wisest of their race for more than all others they take advantage of it in this nature is undoubtedly our guide seeing that he who while feasting his body allows to his soul a thought for the morrow is in his digestion curst and becomes a house of evil humours now though the epicure may complain of the cold meats a dazzling table a buzzing company blue sky and a band of music are incentives to the forgetfulness of troubles past and imminent and produce a concentration of the faculties they may not exactly prove that peace is established between yourself and those who object to your carving of the world but they testify to an armistice aided by these observations you will understand how it was that the countess de saldar afflicted and menaced was inspired on taking her seat to give so graceful and stately a sweep to her dress that she was enabled to conceive woman and man alike to be secretly overcome by it you will not refuse to credit the fact that mr raikes threw care to the dogs heavy as was that mysterious lump suddenly precipitated on his bosom and you will think it not impossible that even the springers of the mine about to explode should lose their subterranean countenances a generous abandonment to one idea prevailed as for evan the first glass of champagne rushed into reckless nuptials with the music in his head bringing rose warm almost as life on his heart sublime are the visions of lovers he knew he must leave her on the morrow he feared he might never behold her again and yet he tasted bliss for it seemed within the contemplation of the gods that he should dance with his darling before darkhaply waltz with her oh heaven he shuts his eyes blinded the band wheels off meltingly in a tune all cadences and twirls and risings and sinkings and passionate outbursts trippingly consoled ah how sweet to waltz through life with the right partner and what a singular thing it is to look back on the day when we thought something like it never mind there may be spheres where it is so manageddoubtless the planets have their hanwell and bedlam i confess that the hand here writing is not insensible to the effects of that first glass of champagne the poetry of our countesss achievements waxes rich in manifold colours i see her by the light of her own pleas to providence i doubt almost if the hand be mine which dared to make a hero play second fiddle and to his beloved i have placed a bushel over his light certainly poor boy it was enough that he should have tailordom on his shoulders i ought to have allowed him to conquer nature and so come out of his eclipse this shall be said of him that he can play second fiddle without looking foolish which for my part i call a greater triumph than if he were performing the heroics we are more accustomed to he has steady eyes can gaze at the right level into the eyes of others and commands a tongue which is neither struck dumb nor set in a flutter by any startling question the best instances to be given that he does not lack merit are that the jocelyns whom he has offended by his birth cannot change their treatment of him and that the hostile women whatever they may say do not think rose utterly insane at any rate rose is satisfied and her selflove makes her a keen critic the moment evan appeared the sickness produced in her by the countess passed and she was ready to brave her situation with no mock humility she permitted mrs shorne to place her in a seat where glances could not be interchanged she was quite composed calmly prepared for conversation with any one indeed her behaviour since the hour of general explanation had been so perfectly wellcontained that mrs melville said to lady jocelyn i am only thinking of the damage to her it will pass overthis fancy you can see she is not serious it is mere spirit of opposition she eats and drinks just like other girls you can see that the fancy has not taken such very strong hold of her i cant agree with you replied her ladyship i would rather have her sit and sigh by the hour and loathe roast beef that would look nearer a cure she has the notions of a silly country girl said mrs shorne exactly lady jocelyn replied a season in london will give her balance so the guests were tolerably happy or at least with scarce an exception open to the influences of champagne and music perhaps juliana was the wretchedest creature present she was about to smite on both cheeks him she loved as well as the woman she despised and had been foiled by still she had the consolation that rose seeing the vulgar mother might turn from evan a poor distant hope meagre and shapeless like herself her most anxious thoughts concerned the means of getting money to lockup harrys tongue she could bear to meet the countesss wrath but not evans offended look hark to that countess why do you denominate this a picnic lady jocelyn it is in verity a fete i suppose we ought to lie down a la grecque to come within the term was the reply on the whole i prefer plain english for such matters but this is assuredly too sumptuous for a picnic lady jocelyn from what i can remember picnic implies contribution from all the guests it is true i left england a child mr george uplift could not withhold a sharp grimace the countess had throttled the inward monitor that tells us when we are lying so grievously had she practised the habit in the service of her family yes said mrs melville i have heard of that fashion and very stupid it is extremely vulgar murmured miss carrington possibly lady jocelyn observed but good fun i have been to pic nics in my day i invariably took cold pie and claret i clashed with halfadozen but all the harm we did was to upset the dictum that there can be too much of a good thing i know for certain that the bottles were left empty and this woman thought the countess this woman with a soul so essentially vulgar claims rank above me the reflection generated contempt of english society in the first place and then a passionate desire for selfassertion she was startled by a direct attack which aroused her momentarily lulled energies a lady quite a stranger a dry simpering lady caught the countesss benevolent passing gaze and leaning forward said i hope her ladyship bears her affliction as well as can be expected in military parlance the countess was taken in flank another would have askedwhat ladyship to whom do you allude may i beg to inquire the countess knew better rapid as light it shot through her that the relict of sir abraham was meant and this she divined because she was aware that devilish malignity was watching to trip her a little conversation happening to buzz at the instant the countess merely turned her chin to an angle agitated her brows very gently and crowned the performance with a mournful smile all that a woman must feel at the demise of so precious a thing as a husband was therein eloquently expressed and at the same time if explanations ensued there were numerous ladyships in the world whom the countess did not mind afflicting should she be hard pressed i knew him so well resumed the horrid woman addressing anybody it was so sad so unexpected but he was so subject to affection of the throat and i was so sorry i could not get down to him in time i had not seen him since his marriage when i was a girland to meet one of his childrenbut my dear in quinsey i have heard that there is nothing on earth like a good hearty laugh mr raikes hearing this sucked down the flavour of a glass of champagne and with a look of fierce jollity interposed as if specially charged by providence to make plain to the persecuted countess his mission and business there then our vocation is at last revealed to us quinsey doctor i remember when a boy wandering over the paternal mansion and envying the life of a tinker which my mother did not think a good omen in me but the traps of a quinseydoctor are even lighter say twenty good jokes and two or three of a practical kind a man most enviable it appears he remarked aloud to one of the conley girls that quinsey is needed before a joke is properly appreciated i like fun said she but had not apparently discovered it what did that odious woman mean by perpetually talking about sir abraham the countess intercepted a glance between her and the hated juliana she felt it was a malignant conspiracy still the vacuous vulgar air of the woman told her that most probably she was but an instrument not a confederate and was only trying to push herself into acquaintance with the great a proceeding scorned and abominated by the countess who longed to punish her for her insolent presumption the bitterness of her situation stung her tenfold when she considered that she dared not meantime the champagne became as regular in its flow as the bulldogs and the monotonous bass of these latter sounded through the music like life behind the murmur of pleasure if you will the countess had a not unfeminine weakness for champagne and old mr bonners cellar was well and choicely stocked but was this enjoyment to the countessthis dreary station in the background may i emerge she as much as implored providence the petition was infinitely tender she thought she might or it may be that nature was strong and she could not restrain herself taking wine with sir john she said this bowing do you know how amusing it is deemed by us portuguese why not embrace as the dear queen used to say to me i am decidedly of her majestys opinion observed sir john with emphasis and the countess drew back into a mingled laugh and blush her fiendish persecutor gave two or three nods and you know the queen she said she had to repeat the remark whereupon the countess murmured intimately ah we have lost a staunch old tory in sir abraham said the lady performing lamentation what did it mean could design lodge in that emptylooking head with its crisp curls button nose and diminishing simper was this picnic to be made as terrible to the countess by her putative father as the dinner had been by the great mel the deep hard level look of juliana met the countesss smile from time to time and like flimsy light horse before a solid array of infantry the countess fell back only to be worried afresh by her perfectly unwitting tormentor his last dayswithout pain oh i hope so came after a lapse of general talk arent we getting a little funereal mrs perkins lady jocelyn asked and then rallied her neighbours miss carrington looked at her vexedly for the fiendish perkins was checked and the countess in alarm about to commit herself was a pleasant sight to miss carrington the worst of these indiscriminate meetings is that there is no conversation whispered the countess thanking providence for the relief just then she saw juliana bend her brows at another person this was george uplift who shook his head and indicated a shrewdeyed thin middleaged man of a lawyerlike cast and then juliana nodded and george uplift touched his arm and glanced hurriedly behind for champagne the countesss eyes dwelt on the timid young squire most affectionately you never saw a fortress more unprepared for dread assault hem was heard terrific but the proper pause had evidently not yet come and now to prevent it the countess strained her energies and tasked her genius intensely have you an idea of the difficulty of keeping up the ball among a host of illassorted stupid country people who have no open topics and can talk of nothing continuously but scandal of their neighbours and who moreover feel they are not up to the people they are mixing with darting upon seymour jocelyn the countess asked touchingly for news of the partridges it was like the unlocking of a machine seymour was not blythe in his reply but he was loud and forcible and when he came to the statisticsoh then you would have admired the countessfor comparisons ensued braces were enumerated numbers given were contested and the shooting of this one jeered at and anothers sure mark respectfully admitted and how lay the coveys and what about the damage done by last winters floods and was there good hope of the pheasants outside this latter the countess hovered twice the awful hem was heard she fought on she kept them at it if it flagged she wished to know this or that and finally thought that really she should like herself to try one shot the women had previously been left behind this brought in the women lady jocelyn proposed a female expedition for the morrow i believe i used to be something of a shot formerly she said you peppered old tom once my lady remarked andrew and her ladyship laughed and that foolish andrew told the story and the countess to revive her subject had to say may i be enrolled to shoot though she detested and shrank from firearms here are two said the hearty presiding dame ladies apply immediately to have your names put down the possibility of an expedition of ladies now struck seymour vividly and said he i ll be secretary and began applying to the ladies for permission to put down their names many declined with brevity muttering either aloud or to themselves unwomanly varied by unladylike some confessed cowardice some a horror of the noise close to their ears and there was the plea of nerves but the names of half adozen ladies were collected and then followed much laughter and musical hubbub and delicate banter so the ladies and gentlemen fell one and all into the partridge pit dug for them by the countess and that horrible hem equal in force and terror to the roar of artillery preceding the charge of ten thousand dragoons was silencedthe pit appeared impassable did the countess crow over her advantage mark her the ladys face is entirely given up to partridges english sports are so much envied abroad she says but what she dreads is a reflection for that leads off from the point a portion of her mind she keeps to combat them in lady jocelyn and others who have the tendency the rest she divides between internalprayers for succour and casting about for another popular subject to follow partridges now mere talent as critics say when they are lighting candles round a genius mere talent would have hit upon pheasants as the natural sequitur and then diverged to sportsa great theme for it ensures a chorus of sneers at foreigners and so on probably to a discussion of birds and beasts best adapted to enrapture the palate of man stories may succeed but they are doubtful and not to be trusted coming after cookery after an exciting subject which has made the general tongue to wag and just enough heated the brain to cause it to cry out for spiced foodthen start your story taking care that it be mild for one too marvellous stops the tide the sense of climax being strongly implanted in all bosoms so the countess told an anecdoteone of mels mr george uplift was quite familiar with it and knew of one passage that would have abashed him to relate before ladies the sylphlike ease with which the countess floated over this foul abysm was miraculous mr george screwed his eyelids queerly and closed his jaws with a report completely beaten the anecdote was of the character of an apologue and pertained to game this was as it happened a misfortune for mr raikes had felt himself left behind by the subject and the stuff that was in this young man being naturally ebullient he lay by to trip it and take a lead his remarks brought on him a shrewd cut from the countess which made matters worse for a pun may also breed puns as doth an anecdote the countesss stroke was so neat and perfect that it was something for the gentlemen to think over and to punish her for giving way to her cleverness and to petty vexation hem sounded once more and then may i ask you if the present baronet is in england now lady jocelyn perceived that some attack was directed against her guest she allowed the countess to answer the eldest was drowned in the lisbon waters and then said but who is it that persists in serving up the funeral baked meats to us mrs shorne spoke for her neighbour mr farnleys cousin was the steward of sir abraham harringtons estates the countess held up her head boldly there is a courageous exaltation of the nerves known to heroes and great generals in action when they feel sure that resources within themselves will spring up to the emergency and that over simple mortals success is positive i had a great respect for sir abraham mr farnley explained very great i heard that this lady bowing to the countess was his daughter lady jocelyns face wore an angry look and mrs shorne gave her the shade of a shrug and an expression implying i didnt evan was talking to miss jenny graine at the moment rather earnestly with a rapid glance at him to see that his ears were closed the countess breathed not the elder branchcadet the sort of noisy silence produced by halfadozen people respirating deeply and moving in their seats was heard the countess watched mr farnleys mystified look and whispered to sir john estce quil comprenne le francais lui it was the final featherlike touch to her triumph she saw safety and a clear escape and much joyful gain and the pleasure of relating her sufferings in days to come this vista was before her when harsh as an execution bell telling her that she had vanquished man but that providence opposed her mrs melchisedec harrington was announced to lady jocelyn perfect stillness reigned immediately as if the picnic had heard its doom oh i will go to her said her ladyship whose first thought was to spare the family andrew come and give me your arm but when she rose mrs mel was no more than the length of an arm from her elbow in the midst of the horrible anguish she was enduring the countess could not help criticizing her mothers curtsey to lady jocelyn fine but a shade too humble still it was fine all might not yet be lost mama she softly exclaimed and thanked heaven that she had not denied her parent mrs mel did not notice her or any of her children there was in her bosom a terrible determination to cast a devil out of the one she best loved for this purpose heedless of all pain to be given or of impropriety she had come to speak publicly and disgrace and humiliate that she might save him from the devils that had ruined his father my lady said the terrible woman thanking her in reply to an invitation that she should be seated i have come for my son i hear he has been playing the lord in your house my lady i humbly thank your ladyship for your kindness to him but he is nothing more than a tailors son and is bound a tailor himself that his father may be called an honest man i am come to take him away mrs mel seemed to speak without much effort though the pale flush of her cheeks showed that she felt what she was doing juliana was pale as death watching rose intensely bright with the gemlike light of her gallant spirit roses eyes fixed on evan he met them the words of ruth passed through his heart but the countess who had given rose to evan and the duke to caroline where was her supporter the duke was entertaining caroline with no less dexterity and roses eyes said to evan feel no shame that i do not feel but the countess stood alone it is ever thus with genius to quote the numerous illustrious authors who have written of it what mattered it now that in the dead hush lady jocelyn should assure her mother that she had been misinformed and that mrs mel was presently quieted and made to sit with others before the fruits and wines all eyes were hatefulthe very thought of providence confused her brain almost reduced to imbecility the countess imagined as a reality that sir abraham had borne with her till her public announcement of relationship and that then the outraged ghost would no longer be restrained and had struck this blow the crushed picnic tried to get a little air and made attempts at conversation mrs mel sat upon the company with the weight of all tailordom and now a messenger came for harry everybody was so zealously employed in the struggle to appear comfortable under mrs mel that his departure was hardly observed the general feeling for evan and his sisters by their superiors in rank was one of kindly pity laxley however did not behave well he put up his glass and scrutinized mrs mel and then examined evan and rose thought that in his interchange of glances with any one there was a lurking revival of the scene gone by she signalled with her eyebrows for drummond to correct him but drummond had another occupation andrew made the diversion he whispered to his neighbour and the whisper went round and the laugh and mr raikes grew extremely uneasy in his seat and betrayed an extraordinary alarm but he also was soon relieved a messenger had come from harry to mrs evremonde bearing a slip of paper this the lady glanced at and handed it to drummond a straggling pencil had traced these words just running by sw gatessaw the captain coming incouldnt stop to stop himtremendous hurryimportant harry j drummond sent the paper to lady jocelyn after her perusal of it a scout was despatched to the summit of olympus and his report proclaimed the advance in the direction of the bulldogs of a smart little figure of a man in white hat and white trousers who kept flicking his legs with a cane mrs evremonde rose and conferred with her ladyship an instant and then drummond took her arm quietly and passed round olympus to the east and lady jocelyn broke up the sitting juliana saw rose go up to evan and make him introduce her to his mother she turned lividly white and went to a corner of the park by herself and cried bitterly lady jocelyn sir franks and sir john remained by the tables but before the guests were out of earshot the individual signalled from olympus presented himself there are times when one cant see what else to do but to lie said her ladyship to sir franks and when we do lie the only way is to lie intrepidly turning from her perplexed husband she exclaimed ah lawson captain evremonde lifted his hat declining an intimacy where is my wife madam have you just come from the arctic regions i have come for my wife madam his unsettled grey eyes wandered restlessly on lady jocelyns face the countess standing near the duke felt some pity for the wife of that croppedheaded tightskinned lunatic at large but deeper was the countesss pity for lady jocelyn in thinking of the account she would have to render on the day of judgement when she heard her ladyship reply evelyn is not here captain evremonde bowed profoundly trailing his broad white hat along the sward do me the favour to read this madam he said and handed a letter to her lady jocelyn raised her brows as she gathered the contents of the letter ferdinands handwriting she exclaimed i accuse no one madami make no accusation i have every respect for you madamyou have my esteem i am sorry to intrude madam an intrusion is regretted my wife runs away from her bed madam and i have the law madam the law is with the husband no force he lashed his cane sharply against his white legs the law madam no brute force his cane made a furious whirl cracking again on his legs as he reiterated the law does the law advise you to strike at a tangent all over the country in search for her inquired lady jocelyn captain evremonde became ten times more voluble and excited mrs mel was heard by the countess to say her ladyship does not know how to treat madmen nor did sir franks and sir john they began expostulating with him a madman gets madder when you talk reason to him said mrs mel and now the countess stepped forward to lady jocelyn and hoped she would not be thought impertinent in offering her opinion as to how this frantic person should be treated the case indeed looked urgent many gentlemen considered themselves bound to approach and be ready in case of need presently the countess passed between sir franks and sir john and with her hand put up as if she feared the furious cane said you will not strike me strike a lady madam the cane and hat were simultaneously lowered lady jocelyn permits me to fetch for you a gentleman of the law or will you accompany me to him in a moment captain evremondes manners were subdued and civilized and in perfectly sane speech he thanked the countess and offered her his arm the countess smilingly waved back sir john who motioned to attend on her and away she went with the captain with all the glow of a woman who feels that she is heaping coals of fire on the heads of her enemies was she not admired now upon my honour said lady jocelyn they are a remarkable family meaning the harringtons what farther she thought she did not say but she was a woman who looked to natural gifts more than the gifts of accidents and evans chance stood high with her then so the battle of the bulldogs was fought and cruelly as the countess had been assailed and wounded she gained a victory yea though demogorgon aided by the vindictive ghost of sir abraham took tangible shape in the ranks opposed to her true lady jocelyn forgetting her own recent intrepidity condemned her as a liar but the fruits of the countesss victory were plentiful drummond forth fearful perhaps of exciting unjust suspicions in the mind of captain evremonde disappeared altogether harry was in a mess which threw him almost upon evans mercy as will be related and lastly ferdinand laxley that insufferable young aristocrat was thus spoken to by lady jocelyn this letter addressed to lawson telling him that his wife is here is in your handwriting ferdinand i dont say you wrote iti dont think you could have written it but to tell you the truth i have an unpleasant impression about it and i think we had better shake hands and not see each other for some time laxley after one denial of his guilt disdained to repeat it he met her ladyships hand haughtily and bowing to sir franks turned on his heel so then in glorious complete victory the battle of the bulldogs ended of the close of the picnic more remains to be told for the present i pause in observance of those rules which demand that after an exhibition of consummate deeds time be given to the spectator to digest what has passed before him etext editors bookmarks a madman gets madder when you talk reason to him ah how sweet to waltz through life with the right partner and not any of your grand ladies can match my wife at home any man is in love with any woman believed in her love and judged it by the strength of his own eating like scratching only wants a beginning feel no shame that i do not feel feel they are not up to the people they are mixing with found it difficult to forgive her his own folly good and evil work together in this world hated one thing alonewhich was bother he has been tolerably honest tom for a man and a lover i cannot live a life of deceit a life of miserynot deceit if we are to please you rightly always allow us to play first it is no insignificant contest when love has to crush selflove listened to one another and blinded the world maxims of her own on the subject of rising and getting the worm my belief is you do it on purpose cant be such rank idiots no conversation coming of it her curiosity was violent one fool makes many and so no doubt does one goose play second fiddle without looking foolish second fiddle he could only mean what she meant sense even if they cant understand it flatters them so the commonest things are the worst done the thrust sinned in its shrewdness those numerous women who always know themselves to be right two people love there is no such thing as owing between them waited serenely for the certain disasters to enthrone her what will be thought of me not a small matter to any of us when testy old gentlemen could commit slaughter with ecstasy why hell snap your head off for a word
