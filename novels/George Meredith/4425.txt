xliii rhoda pledges her hand xliv the enemy appears xlv the farmer is awakened xlvi when the night is darkest xlvii dawn is near xlviii conclusion chapter xxxix late into the afternoon farmer fleming was occupying a chair in roberts lodgings where he had sat since the hour of twelve without a movement of his limbs or of his mind and alone he showed no sign that he expected the approach of any one as mute and unremonstrant as a fallen tree nearly as insensible his eyes half closed and his hands lying open the great figure of the old man kept this attitude as of stiff decay through long sunny hours and the noise of the london suburb although the wedding people were strangely late it was unnoticed by him when the door opened and rhoda stepped into the room he was unaware that he had been waiting and only knew that the hours had somehow accumulated to a heavy burden upon him she is coming father robert is bringing her up rhoda said let her come he answered roberts hold was tight under dahlias arm as they passed the doorway and then the farmer stood robert closed the door for some few painful moments the farmer could not speak and his hand was raised rejectingly the return of human animation to his heart made him look more sternly than he felt but he had to rid himself of one terrible question before he satisfied his gradual desire to take his daughter to his breast it came at last like a short roll of drums the words were heard is she an honest woman she is said rhoda the farmer was looking on robert robert said it likewise in a murmur but with steadfast look bending his eyes now upon dahlia a mist of affection grew in them he threw up his head and with a choking infantine cry uttered come robert placed her against her fathers bosom he moved to the window beside rhoda and whispered and she answered and they knew not what they said the joint moans of father and daughter the unutterable communion of such a meetingfilled their ears grief held aloof as much as joy neither joy nor grief were in those two hearts of parent and child but the senseless contentment of hard of infinite hard human craving the old man released her and rhoda undid her hands from him and led the pale sacrifice to another room wheres mr fleming asked robert understood him her husband will not come it was interpreted by the farmer as her husbands pride or may be the man who was her husband now had righted her at last and then flung her off in spite for what he had been made to do im not being deceived robert no sir upon my soul ive got that here the farmer struck his ribs rhoda came back sister is tired she said dahlia is going down home with you fori hope for a long stay all the better while home weve got we maynt lose time my girl gammons on s way to the station now hell wait hell wait till midnight you may always reckon on a slow man like gammon for waitin robert comes too father we have business to do robert gives me his rooms here for a little time his landlady is a kind woman and will take care of me you will trust me to robert ill bring rhoda down on monday evening robert said to the farmer you may trust me mr fleming that i know that im sure of thats a certainty said the farmer id do it for good if for good was in the girls heart robert there seems he hesitated eh robert there seems a something upon us all theres a something to be done is there but if ive got my flesh and blood and none can spit on her why should i be asking whats and whys i bow my head and god forgive me if ever i complained and you will bring rhoda to us on monday yes and try and help to make the farm look up again if gammonll do the ordering about poor old mas gammon hes a rare old man is he changed by adversity robert though hes awful secret that old man do you consider a bit gammons faithfulness robert ay hes above most men in that robert agreed on with dahlias bonnetsharp the farmer gave command he felt now that he was growing accustomed to the common observation of things that the faces and voices around him were different from such as the day brings in its usual course were all as slow as mas gammon i reckon father said rhoda she is weak she has been very unwell do not trouble her with any questions do not let any questions be asked of her at hone any talking fatigues it may be dangerous to her the farmer stared ay and about her hairim beginning to remember she wears a cap and her hairs cut off like an oakumpickers thats more gossip for neighbours mad people will they listen to truth rhoda flamed out in her dark fashion we speak truth nothing but truth she has had a brain fever that makes her very weak and every one must be silent at home father stop the sale of the farm for robert will work it into order he has promised to be our friend and dahlia will get her health there and be near mothers grave the farmer replied as from a far thought theres money in my pocket to take down two he continued but theres not money there to feed our family a week on i leave it to the lord i sow i dig and i sow and when bread fails to us the land must go and let it go and no crying about it im astonishing easy at heart though if i must sell and do sell i shant help thinking of my father and his father and the father before him mayhap and in most likelihood artfuller men n mefor what they was born to they made to flourish theyll cry in their graves a mans heart sticks to land robert that youll find some day i thought i cared none but about land till that poor weak white thing put her arms on my neck rhoda had slipped away from them again the farmer stooped to roberts ear had a bit of a disagreement with her husband is it robert cleared his throat ay thats it he said serious at all one cant tell you know and not her faultnot my girls fault robert no i can swear to that shes come to the right home then shell be near her mother and me let her pray at night and shell know shes always near her blessed mother perhaps the women ll want to take refreshment if we may so far make free with your hospitality but it must be quick robertor will they they cant eat and i cant eat soon afterward mr fleming took his daughter dahlia from the house and out of london the deeplyafflicted creature was as the doctors had said of her too strong for the ordinary modes of killing she could walk and still support herself though the ordeal she had gone through this day was such as few women could have traversed the terror to follow the deed she had done was yet unseen by her and for the hour she tasted if not peace the pause to suffering which is given by an act accomplished robert and rhoda sat in different rooms till it was dusk when she appeared before him in the half light the ravage of a past storm was visible on her face she sat down to make tea and talked with singular self command mr fleming mentioned the gossips down at wrexby said robert are they very bad down there not worse than in other villages said rhoda they have not been unkind they have spoken about us but not unkindlyi mean not spitefully and you forgive them i do they cannot hurt us now robert was but striving to master some comprehension of her character what are we to resolve rhoda i must get the money promised to this man when he has flung off his wife at the church door he married my sister for the money he said it oh he said it he shall not say that we have deceived him i told him he should have it he married her for money you should not have told him so rhoda i did and i will not let my word be broken pardon me if i ask you where you will get the money its a large sum i will get it rhoda said firmly by the sale of the farm no not to hurt father but this mans a scoundrel i know him ive known him for years my fear is that he will be coming to claim his wife how was it i never insisted on seeing the man before i did think of asking but fancied a lot of things that you didnt wish it and he was shy ah lord what miseries happen from our not looking straight at facts we cant deny shes his wife now not if we give him the money rhoda spoke of the money as if she had taken heated metal into her mouth all the more likely said robert let him rest had you your eyes on him when he saw me in the vestry for years that man has considered me his deadly enemy because i punished him once what a scene id have given a limb id have given my life to have saved you from that scene rhoda she replied if my sister could have been spared i ought to know what wickedness there is in the world its ignorance that leads to the unhappiness of girls do you know that im a drunkard no he called me something like it and he said something like the truth theres the sting set me adrift and i drink hard he spoke a fact and i couldnt answer him yes its the truth that gives such pain said rhoda shivering how can girls know what men are i could not guess that you had any fault this man was so respectful he sat modestly in the room when i saw him last nightlast night was it i thought he has been brought up with sisters and a mother and he has been kind to my dearand all we thought love for her wasshameful shameful she pressed her eyelids continuing he shall have the moneyhe shall have it we will not be in debt to such a man he has saved my sister from one as badwho offered it to be rid of her oh menyou heard thatand now pretends to love her i think i dream how could she ever have looked happily on that hateful face he would be thought handsome said robert marvelling how it was that rhoda could have looked on sedgett for an instant without reading his villanous nature i dont wish you to regret anything you have done or you may do rhoda but this is what made me cry out when i looked on that man and knew it was he who had come to be dahlias husband hell be torture to her the mans temper his habitsbut you may well say you are ignorant of us men keep so what i do with all my soul entreat of you isto get a hidingplace for your sister never let him take her off theres such a thing as hell upon earth if she goes away with him shell know it his black temper wont last he will come for her and claim her he shall have money rhoda said no more on a sidetable in the room stood a remarkable pile under cover of a shawl robert lifted the shawl and beheld the wooden boxes one upon the other containing master gammons and mrs sumfits rival savings which they had presented to dahlia in the belief that her husband was under a cloud of monetary misfortune that had kept her proud heart from her old friends the farmer had brought the boxes and left them there forgetting them i fancy said robert we might open these it may be a little help said rhoda a very little robert thought but to relieve the oppression of the subject they had been discussing he forthwith set about procuring tools with which he split first the box which proved to be mrs sumfits for it contained amid six gold sovereigns and much silver and pence a slip of paper whereon was inscribed in a handwriting identified by rhoda as peculiar to the loving woman and sweetest love to her ever dear altogether the sum amounted to nine pounds three shillings and a farthing now for master gammonhes heavy said robert and he made the savings of that unpretentious veteran bare master gammon had likewise written his word it was discovered on the blank space of a bit of newspaper and looked much as if a fat lobworm had plunged himself into a bowl of ink and in his literary delirium had twisted uneasily to the verge of the paper with difficulty they deciphered complemens robert sang bravo gammon and counted the hoard all was in copper coinage lycurgan and severe and reached the sum of one pound seventeen shillings there were a number of farthings of queen annes reign and robert supposed them to be of value so that as yet we cant say whos the winner he observed rhoda was in tears be kind to him please when you see him she whispered the smaller gift had touched her heart more tenderly kind to the old man robert laughed gently and tied the two hoards in separate papers which he stowed into one box and fixed under string this amount put all in one doesnt go far rhoda no said she i hope we may not need it she broke out dear good humble friends the poor are gods own people christ has said so this is good this is blessed money rhodas cheeks flushed to their orangerounded swarthy red and her dark eyes had the fervour of an exalted earnestness they are my friends for ever they save me from impiety they help me as if god had answered my prayer poor pennies and the old man not knowing where his days may end he gives allhe must have true faith in providence may it come back to him multiplied a thousand fold while i have strength to work the bread i earn shall be shared with him old man old man i love youhow i love you you drag me out of deep ditches oh good and dear old man if god takes me first may i have some power to intercede for you if you have ever sinned everybody in the world is not wicked there are some who go the ways directed by the bible i owe you more than i can ever pay she sobbed but told robert it was not for sorrow he longing to catch her in his arms and punctilious not to overstep the duties of his post of guardian could merely sit by listening and reflecting on her as a strange biblical girl with hebrew hardness of resolution and hebrew exaltation of soul beautiful too as the dark women of the east he admitted to himself that he never could have taken it on his conscience to subdue a human creatures struggling will as rhoda had not hesitated to do with dahlia and to command her actions and accept all imminent responsibilities not quailing with any outcry or abandonment of strength when the shock of that revelation in the vestry came violently on her rhoda seeing there that it was a brute and not a man into whose hand she had perilously forced her sisters stood steadying her nerves to act promptly with advantage less like a woman robert thought than a creature born for battle and she appeared to be still undaunted full of her scheme and could cry without fear of floods something of the chivalrous restraint he put upon the motions of his heart sprang from the shadowy awe which overhung that impressible organ this feeling likewise led him to place a blind reliance on her sagacity and sense of what was just and what should be performed you promised this money to him he said half thinking it incredible on monday said rhoda you must get a promise from him in return she answered why when he could break it the instant he cared to and a promise would tempt him to it he does not love her no he does not love her said robert meditating whether he could possibly convey an idea of the character of men to her innocent mind he flung her off thank heaven for it i should have been punished too muchtoo much he has saved her from the perils of temptation he shall be paid for it to see her taken away by such a man ah she shuddered as at sight of a hideous pit but robert said i know him rhoda that was his temper itll last just fourandtwenty hours and then we shall need all our strength and cunning my dear it would be the death of dahlia youve seen the man as he is take it for a warning she belongs to him thats the law human and divine not when he has flung her off robert rhoda cried piteously let us take advantage of that he did fling her off spat at us all and showed the blackest hellish plot i ever in my life heard of hes not the worst sinner scoundrel as he is poor girl poor soul a hard lot for women in this world rhoda i suppose i may breakfast with you in the morning i hear major warings knock below i want a man to talk to do come robert rhoda said and gave him her hand he strove to comprehend why it was that her hand was merely a hand and no more to him just then squeezed the cold fingers and left her chapter xi so long as we do not know that we are performing any remarkable feat we may walk upon the narrowest of planks between precipices with perfect security but when we suffer our minds to eye the chasm underneath we begin to be in danger and we are in very great fear of losing our equal balance the moment we admit the insidious reflection that other men placed as we are would probably topple headlong over anthony hackbut of boynes bank had been giving himself up latterly to this fatal comparison the hour when gold was entrusted to his charge found him feverish and irritable he asked himself whether he was a mere machine to transfer money from spot to spot and he spurned at the pittance bestowed upon honesty in this life where could boynes bank discover again such an honest man as he and because he was honest he was poor the consideration that we alone are capable of doing the unparalleled thing may sometimes inspire us with fortitude but this will depend largely upon the antecedent moral trials of a man it is a temptation when we look on what we accomplish at all in that light the temptation being inbred is commonly a proof of internal corruption if i take a step suppose now to the right or to the left anthony had got into the habit of saying while he made his course and after he had deposited his charge he would wipe his moist forehead in a state of wretched exultation over his renowned trustworthiness he had done the thing for years and what did the people in the streets know about him formerly he had used to regard the people in the streets and their opinions with a voluptuous contempt but he was no longer wrapped in sweet calculations of his savings and his chances and his connection with a mighty bank the virtue had gone out of him yet he had not the slightest appetite for other mens money no hunger nor any definite notion of enjoyment to be derived from money not his own imagination misled the old man there have been spotless reputations gained in the service of virtue before now and chaste and beautiful persons have walked the narrow plank envied and admired and they have ultimately tottered and all but fallen or they have quite fallen from no worse an incitement than curiosity cold curiosity as the directors of our human constitution tell us is in the colder condition of our blood a betraying vice leading to sin at a period when the fruits of sin afford the smallest satisfaction it is in fact our last probation and one of our latest delusions if that is passed successfully we may really be pronounced as of some worth anthony wished to give a light indulgence to his curiosity say by running away and over london bridge on one side and back on the other hugging the money for two weeks he thought of this absurd performance as a comical and agreeable diversion how would he feel when going in the direction of the surrey hills and how when returning and when there was a prospect of the bank where the money was to be paid in being shut supposing that he was a minute behind his time would the bankdoors remain open in expectation of him and if the money was not paid in what would be thought what would be thought at boynes if the next day he was late in making his appearance holloa hackbut hows thisim a bit late sir morninglate you were late yesterday evening werent youwhy sir the way the clerks at that bank of mortimer and pennycuicks rush away from business and close the doors after em as if their day began at four pm and business was botheration its a disgrace to the city o london and i beg pardon for being late but never sleeping a wink all night for fear about this money i am late this morning i humbly confess when i got to the bank the doors were shut our clocks correct that i know my belief sir is the clerks at mortimer and pennycuicks put on the timeoh we must have this inquired into anthony dramatized the farcical scene which he imagined between himself and mr sequin the head clerk at boynes with immense relish and terminated it by establishing his reputation for honesty higher than ever at the bank after which violent exercise of his fancy the old man sank into a dulness during several days the farmer slept at his lodgings for one night and talked of money and of selling his farm and half hinted that it would be a brotherly proceeding on anthonys part to buy it and hold it so as to keep it in the family the farmers deep belief in the existence of his hoards always did anthony peculiar mischief anthony grew conscious of a giddiness and all the next day he was scarcely fit for his work but the day following that he was calm and attentive two bags of gold were placed in his hands and he walked with caution down the steps of the bank turned the corner and went straight on to the west never once hesitating or casting a thought behind upon mortimer and pennycuicks he had not in truth one that was loose to be cast all his thoughts were boiling in his head obfuscating him with a prodigious steam through which he beheld the city surging and the streets curving like lines in water and the people mixing and passing into and out of one another in an astonishing mannerno face distinguishable the whole thick multitude appearing to be stirred like glue in a gallipot the only distinct thought which he had sprang from a fear that the dishonest ruffians would try to steal his gold and he hugged it and groaned to see that villany was abroad marvellous too that the clocks on the churches all the way along the westward thoroughfare stuck at the hour when banks are closed to business it was some time or a pretence at some time before the minutehands surmounted that difficulty having done so they rushed ahead to the ensuing hour with the mad precipitation of pantomimic machinery the sight of them presently standing on the hour like a sentinel presenting arms was startlinglaughable anthony could not have flipped with his fingers fifty times in the interval he was sure of it or not much more he said so the city was shut to him behind iron bars up in the west there is not so much to be dreaded from the rapacity of men you do not hear of such alarming burglaries there every day every hand is not at anothers throat there or in anothers pocket at least not until after nightfall and when the dark should come on anthony had determined to make for his own quarter with all speed darkness is horrible in foreign places but foreign places are not so accusing to you by daylight the park was vastly pleasant to the old man ah he sniffed country air and betook himself to a seat extraordinary he thought what little people they look on their horses and in their carriages thats the aristocracy is it the aristocracy appeared oddly diminutive to him he sneered at the aristocracy but beholding a policeman became stolid of aspect the policeman was a connecting link with his city life the true lord of his fearful soul though the moneybags were under his arm beneath his buttoned coat it required a deep pause before he understood what he had done and then the park began to dance and curve like the streets and there was a singular curtseying between the heavens and the earth he had to hold his moneybags tight to keep them from plunging into monstrous gulfs i dont remember that ive taken a drink of any sort he said since i and the old farmer took our turn down in the docks hows this he seemed to rock he was near upon indulging in a fit of terror but the impolicy of it withheld him from any demonstration save an involuntary spasmodic ague when this had passed his eyesight and sensations grew clearer and he sat in a mental doze looking at things with quiet animal observation his recollection of the state after a lapse of minutes was pleasurable the necessity for motion however set him on his feet and off he went still westward out of the park and into streets he trotted at a good pace suddenly came a call of his name in his ear and he threw up one arm in selfdefence uncle anthony dont you know me eh i do to be sure i do he answered peering dimly upon rhoda im always meeting one of you ive been down in the city trying to find you all day uncle i meet youi might have missed it is direction from heaven for i prayed anthony muttered im out for a holiday thisrhoda pointed to a houseis where i am lodging oh said anthony and hows your family rhoda perceived that he was rather distraught after great persuasion she got him to go upstairs with her only for two seconds he stipulated i cant sit you will have a cup of tea with me uncle no i dont think im equal to tea not with rhoda its a name in scripture said anthony and he drew nearer to her youre comfortable and dark here my dear how did you come here whats happened you wont surprise me im only stopping for a day or two in london uncle ah a wicked place that it is no wickeder than other places ill be bound well i must be trotting i cant sit i tell you youre as dark here as a gaol let me ring for candles uncle no im going she tried to touch him to draw him to a chair the agile old man bounded away from her and she had to pacify him submissively before he would consent to be seated the teaservice was brought and rhoda made tea and filled a cup for him anthony began to enjoy the repose of the room but it made the moneybags alien to him and serpents in his bosom frettingon his chair he cried well well whats to talk about we cant drink tea and not talk rhoda deliberated and then said uncle i think you have always loved me it seemed to him a merit that he should have loved her he caught at the idea so i have rhoda my dear i have i do you do love me dear uncle now i come to think of it rhodamy dody i dont think ever ive loved anybody else never loved eer a young woman in my life as a young man tell me uncle are you not very rich no i aint not very not at all you must not tell untruths uncle i dont said anthony only too doggedly to instil conviction i have always felt uncle that you love money too much what is the value of money except to give comfort and help you to be a blessing to others in their trouble does not god lend it you for that purpose it is most true and if you make a store of it it will only be unhappiness to yourself uncle you love me i am in great trouble for money anthony made a long arm over the projection of his coat and clasped it securely sullenly refusing to answer dear uncle hear me out i come to you because i know you are rich i was on my way to your lodgings when we met we were thrown together you have more money than you know what to do with i am a beggar to you for money i have never asked before i never shall ask again now i pray for your help my life and the life dearer to me than any other depend on you will you help me uncle anthony yes no anthony shouted yes yes yes if i can no if i cant and cant it is so its no rhodas bosom sank but only as a wave in the sealike energy of her spirit uncle you must anthony was restrained from jumping up and running away forthwith by the peace which was in the room and the dread of being solitary after he had tasted of companionship you have money uncle you are rich you must help me dont you ever think what it is to be an old man and no one to love you and be grateful to you why do you cross your arms so close anthony denied that he crossed his arms closely rhoda pointed to his arms in evidence and he snarled out there now cause im supposed to have saved a trifle i aint to sit as i like its downright too bad its shocking but seeing that he did not uncross his arms and remained bunched up defiantly rhoda silently observed him she felt that money was in the room dont let it be a curse to you she said and her voice was hoarse with agitation what anthony asked whats a curse that did she know had she guessed her finger was laid in a line at the bags had she smelt the gold it will be a curse to you uncle death is coming whats money then uncle uncross your arms you are afraid you dare not you carry it about you have no confidence anywhere it eats your heart look at me i have nothing to conceal can you imitate me and throw your hands out so why uncle will you let me be ashamed of you you have the money there you cannot deny it me crying to you for help what have we talked togetherthat we would sit in a country house and i was to look to the flowerbeds and always have dishes of green peas for youplenty in june and you were to let the village boys know what a tongue you have if they made a clatter of their sticks along the gardenrails and you were to drink your tea looking on a green and the sunset uncle poor old good old soul you mean kindly you must be kind a day will make it too late you have the money there you get older and older every minute with trying to refuse me you know that i can make you happy i have the power and i have the will help me i say in my great trouble that money is a burden you are forced to carry it about for fear you look guilty as you go running in the streets because you fear everybody do good with it let it be money with a blessing on it it will save us from horrid misery from death from torture and death think uncle look uncle you with the moneyme wanting it i pray to heaven and i meet you and you have it will you say that you refuse to give it when i seewhen i show you you are led to meet me and help me openput down that arm against this storm of mingled supplication and shadowy menace anthony held out with all outward firmness until when bidding him to put down his arm she touched the arm commandingly and it fell paralyzed rhodas eyes were not beautiful as they fixed on the object of her quest in this they were of the character of her mission she was dealing with an evil thing and had chosen to act according to her light and by the counsel of her combative and forceful temper at each step new difficulties had to be encountered by fresh contrivances and money now money alone had become the specific for present use there was a limitation of her spiritual vision to aught save to money and the money being bared to her eyes a frightful gleam of eagerness shot from them her hands met anthonys in a common grasp of the moneybags its not mine anthony cried in desperation whose money is it said rhoda and caught up her hands as from fire my lord anthony moaned if you dont speak like a court o justice hear yourself is the money yours uncle itis and isnt hung in the balance it is not rhoda dressed the question for him in the terror of contemptuous horror it is iof course it is how could it help being mine my money yes what sort o things that to askwhether what ive gots mine or yours or somebody elses ha and you say you are not rich uncle a charming congratulatory smile was addressed to him and a shake of the head of tender reproach irresistible to his vanity rich with a lot o calls on me everybody wantin to borrowim rich and now you coming to me you women cant bring a guess to bear upon the right nature o money uncle you will decide to help me i know she said it with a staggering assurance of manner how do you know cried anthony why do you carry so much money about with you in bags uncle hear it my dear he simulated misers joy aint that music talk of operas hear that dont it talk dont it chink dont it sing he groaned oh lord and fell back this transition from a state of intensest rapture to the depths of pain alarmed her nothing its nothing anthony anticipated her inquiries they bags is so heavy then why do you carry them about perhaps its heart disease said anthony and grinned for he knew the soundness of his health you are very pale uncle eh you dont say that you are awfully white dear uncle ill look in the glass said anthony no i wont he sank back in his chair rhoda were all sinners aint we allevery man and woman of us and baby too thats a comfort yes it is a comfort its a tremendous comfortshuts mouths i know what youre going to saysome bigger sinners than others if theyre sorry for it though what then they can repent cant they they must undo any harm they may have done sinners are not to repent only in words uncle ive been feeling lately he murmured rhoda expected a misers confession ive been feeling the last two or three days he resumed what uncle sort of taste of a tremendous nice lemon in my mouth my dear and liked it till all of a sudden i swallowed it wholesuch a gulp i felt it just now im all right no uncle said rhoda you are not all right this money makes you miserable it does i can see that it does now put those bags in my hands for a minute try it will do you good attend to me it will or let me have them they are poison to you you dont want them i dont cried anthony upon my soul i dont i dont want em id giveit is true my dear i dont want em theyre poison theyre poison to you said rhoda theyre health theyre life to me i said my uncle anthony will help me he is noti know his hearthe is not a miser are you a miser uncle her hand was on one of his bags it was strenuously withheld but while she continued speaking reiterating the word miser the hold relaxed she caught the heavy bag away startled by its weight he perceived the effect produced on her and cried aha and ive been carrying two of emtwo rhoda panted in her excitement now give it up said he she returned it he got it against his breast joylessly and then bade her to try the weight of the two she did try them and anthony doated on the wonder of her face uncle see what riches do you fear everybodyyou think there is no secure placeyou have more do you carry about all your money no he chuckled at her astonishment iveyes ive got more of my own her widened eyes intoxicated him more ive saved ive put by say im an old sinner whatd th old farmer say now do you love your uncle tony old ant they call me down at the bank he was on the point of uttering but the vision of the bank lay terrific in his recollection and summoned at last would not be wiped away the unbearable picture swam blinking through accumulating clouds remote and minute as the chief scene of our infancy but commanding him with the present touch of a mighty arm thrown out im honest he cried i always have been honest im known to be honest i want no mans money ive got money of my own i hate sin i hate sinners im an honest man ask them down atrhoda my dear i say dont you hear me rhoda you think ive a turn for misering its a beastly mistake poor savings and such a trouble to keep honest when youre poor and ive done it for years spite o temptation t d send lots o men to the hulks safe into my hand safe out o my hands slip once and there aint mercy in men and you say i had a whirl of my head and went round and didnt know where i was for a minute and forgot the place id to go to and come away to think in a quiet part he stopped abruptly in his ravings you give me the money rhoda she handed him the moneybags he seized them and dashed them to the ground with the force of madness kneeling he drew out his penknife and slit the sides of the bags and held them aloft and let the gold pour out in torrents insufferable to the sight and uttering laughter that clamoured fierily in her ears for long minutes afterwards the old man brandished the empty bags and sprang out of the room she sat dismayed in the centre of a heap of gold chapter xli on the monday evening master gammon was at the station with the cart robert and rhoda were a train later but the old man seemed to be unaware of any delay and mildly staring received their apologies and nodded they asked him more than once whether all was well at the farm to which he replied that all was quite well and that he was never otherwise about halfanhour after on the road a gradual dumb chuckle overcame his lower features he flicked the horse dubitatively and turned his head first to robert next to rhoda and then he chuckled aloud the last o they melns rotted yestday afternoon did they said robert youll have to get fresh seed thats all master gammon merely showed his spirit to be negative youve been playing the fool with the sheep robert accused him it hit the old man in a very tender part i play the fool wi neer a sheep alive mr robert animals likes their customed food and dont like no other i never changes my food nord eer a sheep nord a cow nord a bullock if animals was masters id as lief give a sheep beer as offer him freehandedof my own will thats to saya meln they rots robert smiled though he was angry the delicious unvexed countrytalk soothed rhoda and she looked fondly on the old man believing that he could not talk on in his sedate way if all were not well at home the hills of the beaconridge beyond her home and the line of stunted firs which she had named the old bent beggarmen were visible in the twilight her eyes flew thoughtfully far over them with the feeling that they had long known what would come to her and to those dear to her and the intense hope that they knew no more inasmuch as they bounded her sight if the sheep thrive she ventured to remark so that the comforting old themes might be kept up thats the particular if said robert signifying something that had to be leaped over master gammon performed the feat with agility sheep never was heartier he pronounced emphatically lots of applications for melonseed gammon to this the veterans tardy answer was more fools n one about i reckon and robert allowed him the victory implied by silence and theres no news in wrexby none at all said rhoda a direct question inevitably plunged master gammon so deep amid the soundings of his reflectiveness that it was the surest way of precluding a response from him but on this occasion his honest deliberation bore fruit squire blancove hes dead the name caused rhoda to shudder found dead in s bed satday morning master gammon added and warmed upon the subject went on hes that stiff folks say that stiff he is hell have to get into a rounded coffin hes just like half a hoop he was all of a heap like had a fight with s bolster and got th wust of it but be t the seizure or be t gout in s belly hes gone clean dead and he wunt buy th farm nether shutters is all shut up at the hall hell go burying about wednesday men that drinks dont keep rhoda struck at her brain to think in what way this death could work and show like a punishment of the heavens upon that one wrongdoer but it was not manifest as a flame of wrath and she laid herself open to the peace of the fields and the hedgeways stepping by the farmhouse came in sight and friendly old adam and eve turning from the moon she heard the sound of water every sign of peace was around the farm the cows had been milked long since the geese were quiet there was nothing but the white board above the gardengate to speak of the history lying in her heart they found the farmer sitting alone shading his forehead rhoda kissed his cheeks and whispered for tidings of dahlia go up to her the farmer said rhoda grew very chill she went upstairs with apprehensive feet and recognizing mrs sumfit outside the door of dahlias room embraced her and heard her say that dahlia had turned the key and had been crying from mornings to nights it cant last mrs sumfit sobbed lonesome hysterics theys death to come shes falling into the trance ill go for the sight o me shocks her rhoda knocked waited patiently till her persistent repetition of her name gained her admission she beheld her sister indeed but not the broken dahlia from whom she had parted dahlia was hard to her caress and crying has he come stood at bay whiteeyed and looking like a thing strung with wires no dearest he will not trouble you have no fear are you full of deceit said dahlia stamping her foot i hope not my sister dahlia let fall a long quivering breath she went to her bed upon which her mothers bible was lying and taking it in her two hands held it under rhodas lips swear upon that what am i to swear to dearest swear that he is not in the house he is not my own sister believe me it is no deceit he is not he will not trouble you see i kiss the book and swear to you my beloved i speak truth come to me dear rhoda put her arms up entreatingly but dahlia stepped back you are not deceitful you are not cold you are not inhuman inhuman you are not you are not oh my god look at her the toneless voice was as bitter for rhoda to hear as the accusations she replied with a poor smile i am only not deceitful come and see you will not be disturbed what am i tied to dahlia struggled feebly as against a weight of chains oh what am i tied to its on me tight like teeth i cant escape i cant breathe for it i was like a stone when he asked me marry himloved me some one preachedmy duty i am lost i am lost why you girlwhywhat did you do why did you take my hand when i was asleep and hurry me so fast what have i done to you why did you push me alongi couldnt see where i heard the church babble for youinhuman inhuman what have i done to you what have you to do with punishing sin its not sin let me be sinful then i am i am sinful hear me i love him i love my lover and she screamed out he loves me rhoda now thought her mad she looked once at the rigid figure of her transformed sister and sitting down covered her eyes and wept to dahlia the tears were at first an acrid joy but being weak she fell to the bed and leaned against it forgetting her frenzy for a time you deceived me she murmured and again you deceived me rhoda did not answer in trying to understand why her sister should imagine it she began to know that she had in truth deceived dahlia the temptation to drive a frail human creature to do the thing which was right had led her to speak falsely for a good purpose was it not righteously executed away from the tragic figure in the room she might have thought so but the horror in the eyes and voice of this awakened sacrifice struck away the support of theoretic justification great pity for the poor enmeshed life helpless there and in a womans worst perillooking either to madness or to death for an escapedrowned her reason in a heavy cloud of tears long on toward the stroke of the hour dahlia heard her weep and she murmured on you deceived me but it was no more to reproach rather it was an exculpation of her reproaches you did deceive me rhoda rhoda half lifted her head the slight tone of a change to tenderness swelled the gulfs of pity and she wept aloud dahlia untwisted her feet and staggered up to her fell upon her shoulder and called her my lovegood sister for a great mute space they clung together their lips met and they kissed convulsively but when dahlia had close view of rhodas face she drew back saying in an underbreath dont cry i see my misery when you cry rhoda promised that she would check her tears and they sat quietly side by side hand in hand mrs sumfit outside had to be dismissed twice with her fresh brews of supplicating tea and toast and the cakes which when eaten warm with good country butter and a sprinkle of salt reanimate as she did her utmost to assure the sisters through the closed door humanitys distressed spirit at times their hands interchanged a fervent pressure their eyes were drawn to an equal gaze in the middle of the night dahlia said i found a letter from edward when i came here writtenoh base man that he is rhoda could not control the impulse to cry it out written before said dahlia divining her at once i read it did not cry i have no tears will you see it it is very shortenough it said enough and written before she crumpled her fingers in rhodas rhoda to please her saying yes she went to the pillow of the bed and drew the letter from underneath i know every word she said i should die if i repeated it my wife before heaven it begins so i was his wife i must have broken his heartbroken my husbands dahlia cast a fearful eye about her her eyelids fluttered as from a savage sudden blow hardening her mouth to utter defiant spite my lovers she cried he is if he loves me and i love him he is my lover my lover my lover nothing shall stop me from saying itlover and there is none to claim me but he oh loathsome what a serpent it is ive got round me and you tell me god put it do you answer that for i want to know and i dont know where i am i am lost i am lost i want to get to my lover tell me rhoda you would curse me if i did and listen to me let him open his arms to me i go i follow him as far as my feet will bear me i would go if it lightened from heaven if i saw up there the warning you shall not i would go but look on me she smote contempt upon her bosom he would not call to such a thing as me me now my skin is like a toads to him ive become like something in the dust i could hiss like adders i am quite impenitent i pray by my bedside my head on my bible but i only say yes yes thats done thats deserved if theres no mercy oh if there is no mercy thats deserved i say so now but this is what i say rhoda i see nothing but blackness when i pray and i say permit no worse i say permit no worse or take the consequences he calls me his wife i am his wife and if dahlia fell to speechless panting her mouth was open she made motion with her hands horror as of a blasphemy struggling to her lips kept her dumb but the prompting passion was indomitable read it said her struggling voice and rhoda bent over the letter reading and losing thought of each sentence as it passed to dahlia the vital words were visible like evanescent blue gravelights she saw them rolling through her sisters mind and just upon the conclusion she gave out as in a chaunt and i who have sinned against my innocent darling will ask her to pray with me that our future may be one so that may make good to her what she has suffered and to the god whom we worship the offence i have committed rhoda looked up at the pale penetrating eyes read have you read to the last said dahlia speak it let me hear you he writes it yes you will not husband he says and then she took up the sentences of the letter backwards to the beginning pausing upon each one with a short moan and smiting her bosom i found it here rhoda i found his letter here when i came i came a dead thing and it made me spring up alive oh what bliss to be dead ive felt nothingnothing for months she flung herself on the bed thrusting her handkerchief to her mouth to deaden the outcry im punished im punished because i did not trust to my darling no not for one year is it that since we parted i am an impatient creature and he does not reproach me i tormented my own my love my dear and he thought ii was tired of our life together no he does not accuse me dahlia replied to her sisters unspoken feeling with the shrewd divination which is passions breathing space he accuses himself he says itutters itspeaks it i sold my beloved there is no guile in him oh be just to us rhoda dearest she came to rhodas side you did deceive me did you not you are a deceiver my love rhoda trembled and raising her eyelids answered yes you saw him in the street that morning dahlia smiled a glittering tenderness too evidently deceitful in part but quite subduing you saw him my rhoda and he said he was true to me and sorrowful and you told him dear one that i had no heart for him and wished to go to helldid you not gbod rhoda forgive me i mean good my true good rhoda yes you hate sin it is dreadful but you should never speak falsely to sinners for that does not teach them to repent mind you never lie again look at me i am chained and i have no repentance in me see me i am nearer itthe othersin i mean if that man comeswill he nono rhoda cried if that man comes he will not come he cast me off at the church door and said he had been cheated money oh edward dahlia drooped her head he will keep away you are safe said rhoda because if no help comes i am losti am lost for ever but help will come i mean peace will come we will read we will work in the garden you have lifted poor father up my dear ah that old man dahlia sighed he is our father yes poor old man and dahlia whispered i have no pity for him if i am dragged away im afraid i shall curse him he seems a stony old man i dont understand fathers he would make me go away he talks the scriptures when he is excited im afraid he would shut my bible for me those old men know nothing of the hearts of women now darling go to your room rhoda begged earnestly for permission to stay with her but dahlia said my nights are fevers i cant have arms about me they shook hands when they separated not kissing chapter xlii three days passed quietly at the farm and each morning dahlia came down to breakfast and sat with the family at their meals pale with the mournful rim about her eyelids but a patient figure no questions were asked the house was guarded from visitors and on the surface the home was peaceful on the wednesday squire blancove was buried when master gammon who seldom claimed a holiday or specified an enjoyment of which he would desire to partake asked leave to be spared for a couple of hours that he might attend the ceremonious interment of one to whom a sort of vagrant human sentiment of clanship had made him look up as to the chief gentleman of the district and therefore one having claims on his respect a burial had great interest for the old man ill be home for dinner itll gie me an appetite master gammon said solemnly and he marched away in his serious sunday hat and careful coat blither than usual after his departure mrs sumfit sat and discoursed on deaths and burials the certain end of all at least she corrected herself the deaths were the burials were not so certain consequently we might take the burials as they were a favour to be a blessing except in the event of persons being buried alive she tried to make her hearers understand that the idea of this calamity had always seemed intolerable to her and told of numerous cases which the coffin having been opened showed by the convulsed aspect of the corpse or by spots of blood upon the shroud that the poor creature had wakened up forlorn and not a kick allowed to him my dears it happens to women too does it not mother said dahlia theyre most subject to trances my sweet from always imitatin they imitates their deaths at last and oh mrs sumfit was taken with nervous chokings of alarm at the thought aloneall dark and hard wood upon your chest your elbows your nose your toes and you under heaps o gravel not a breath for you though you snap and catch for oneworse than a fish on land its over very soon mother said dahlia the coldness of you young women yes but its the timeyou feeling trying for air its the horrid oh dear me you set your mind on it i do said dahlia you see coffinnails instead of stars youd give the world to turn upon one side you cant think you can only hate those who put you there you see them taking tea saying prayers sleeping in bed putting on bonnets walking to church kneading dough eatingall at once like the firing of a gun theyre in one world youre in another why my goodness oned say shed gone through it herself ejaculated mrs sumfit terrified dahlia sent her eyes at rhoda i must go and see that poor man covered mrs sumfit succumbed to a fit of resolution much under the pretence that it had long been forming well and mother said dahlia checking her promise me put a feather on my mouth put a glass to my face before you let them carry me out will you rhoda promises i have asked her oh the ideas of this girl mrs sumfit burst out and looking so as she says it my love you didnt mean to die dahlia soothed her and sent her off i am buried alive she said i feel it allthe stifling the hopeless cramp let us go and garden rhoda have you got laudanum in the house rhoda shook her head too sick at heart to speak they went into the garden which was dahlias healthfullest place it seemed to her that her dead mother talked to her there that was not a figure of speech when she said she felt buried alive she was in the state of sensational delusion there were times when she watched her own power of motion curiously curiously stretched out her hands and touched things and moved them the sight was convincing but the shudder came again in a frame less robust the brain would have given way it was the very soundness of the brain which when her blood was a simple tide of life in her veins and no vital force had condemned her to see the wisdom and the righteousness of the act of sacrifice committed by her and had urged her even up to the altar then the sudden throwing off of the mask by that man to whom she had bound herself and the reading of edwards letter of penitence and love thwarted reason but without blinding or unsettling it passion grew dominant yet against such deadly matters on all sides had passion to strive that under a darkened sky visibly chained bound down and hopeless she felt betweenwhiles veritably that she was a living body buried her senses had become semilunatic she talked reasonably and rhoda hearing her question and answer at mealtimes like a sane woman was in doubt whether her sister wilfully simulated a partial insanity when they were alone together now in the garden dahlia said all those flowers my dear have roots in mother and me she cant feel them for her souls in heaven but mine is down there the pain is the trying to get your soul loose its the edge of a knife that wont cut through do you know that rhoda said as acquiescingly as she could yes do you dahlia whispered its what they call the agony only to go through it in the dark when you are all alone boarded round you will never know that and theres an angel brings me one of mothers roses and i smell it i see fields of snow and its warm there and no labour for breath i see great beds of flowers i pass them like a breeze im shot and knock on the ground and they bury me for dead again indeed dearest its true she meant true as regarded her sensations rhoda could barely give a smile for response and dahlias intelligence being supernaturally active she read her sisters doubt and cried out then let me talk of him it was the fiery sequence to her foregone speech signifying that if her passion had liberty to express itself she could clear understandings but even a moments free wing to passion renewed the blinding terror within her rhoda steadied her along the walks praying for the time to come when her friends the rector and his wife might help in the task of comforting this poor sister detestation of the idea of love made her sympathy almost deficient and when there was no active work to do in aid she was nearly valueless knowing that she also stood guilty of a wrong the day was very soft and still the flowers gave light for light they heard through the noise of the millwater the funeral bell sound it sank in rhoda like the preaching of an end that was promise of a beginning and girdled a distancing land of trouble the breeze that blew seemed mercy to live here in forgetfulness with dahlia was the limit of her desires perhaps if robert worked among them she would gratefully give him her hand that is if he said not a word of love master gammon and mrs sumfit were punctual in their return near the dinnerhour and the business of releasing the dumplings and potatoes and spreading out the cold meat and lettuces restrained for some period the narrative of proceedings at the funeral chief among the incidents was that mrs sumfit had really seen and only wanted by corroboration of master gammon to be sure she had positively seen anthony hackbut on the skirts of the funeral procession master gammon however was no supporter of conjecture what he had thought he had thought but that was neither here nor there he would swear to nothing that he had not touchedeyes deceivedhe was never a guesser he left mrs sumfit to pledge herself in perturbation of spirit to an oath that her eyes had seen anthony hackbut and more which was that after the close of the funeral service the young squire had caught sight of anthony crouching in a corner of the churchyard and had sent a man to him and they had disappeared together mrs sumfit was heartily laughed at and rallied both by robert and the farmer tony at a funeral and train expenses the farmer interjected dye think mother tonyd come to wrexby churchyard fore he come queen annes farm and wheres he now mayhap mrs sumfit appealed in despair to master gammon with entreaties and a ready dumpling there mas gammon and why you shd play at do believe and at dont believe after that awesome scene the solemest of lifes when you did declare to me sayin it was a stride for boots out o london this morning your words mas gammon and bootsits true if by that alone for boots i says to myselfhe thinks by boots there being a corder in his family on the mothers side which you yourself told to me as you did mas gammon and now holds back you did like a bad horse hey does gammon jib said the farmer with the ghost of old laughter twinkling in his eyes he told me this tale mrs sumfit continued daring her irresponsive enemy to contradict her with a threatening gaze he told me this tale he did and my beliefs his game s he gets me into a cornerthere to be laughed at mas gammon if youre not a sly old man you said you did he was drownded your mothers brothers wifes brother and he had a brother and what he was to youthat brother mrs sumfit smote her handsoh my goodness my poor head but you shant slip away mas gammon no try you ever so much drownded he was and eight days in the sea which you told me over a warm mug of ale by the fire years back and i do believe them dumplings makes ye obstinate for worse you get and that fond of em i shll soon not have enough in our biggest pot yes you said he was eight days in the sea and as for face you said poor thing he was like a rag of towel dipped in starch was your own words and all his likeness wiped out and joe the other brother a corderbootmaker you call emlooked down him as he was stretched out on the shore of the sea all along and didnt know him till he come to the boots and he says its abner for there was his boots to know him by now will you deny mas gammon you said mr hackbuts boots and a long stride it was for em from london and i wont be laughed at through arts of any sly old man the circumstantial charge made no impression on master gammon who was heard to mumble as from the inmost recesses of tightpacked dumpling but he left the vindication of his case to the farmers laughter the mention of her uncle had started a growing agitation in rhoda to whom the indication of his eccentric behaviour was a stronger confirmation of his visit to the neighbourhood and wherefore had he journeyed down had he come to haunt her on account of the money he had poured into her lap rhoda knew in a moment that she was near a great trial of her strength and truth she had more than once i cannot tell you how distantly conceived that the money had been money upon which the mildest word for stolen should be put to express the feeling she had got about it after she had parted with the bulk of it to the man sedgett not stolen not appropriated but money that had perhaps been entrusted and of which anthony had forgotten the rightful ownership this idea of hers had burned with no intolerable fire but under a weight of all discountenancing appearances feeble though it was it had distressed her the dealing with money and the necessity for it had given rhoda a better comprehension of its nature and value she had taught herself to think that her suspicion sprang from her uncles wild demeanour and the scene of the gold pieces scattered on the floor as if a heart had burst at her feet no sooner did she hear that anthony had been by supposition seen than the little light of secret dread flamed a panic through her veins she left the table before master gammon had finished and went out of the house to look about for her uncle he was nowhere in the fields nor in the graveyard she walked over the neighbourhood desolately until her quickened apprehension was extinguished and she returned home relieved thinking it folly to have imagined her uncle was other than a man of hoarded wealth and that he was here but in the interval she had experienced emotions which warned her of a struggle to come who would be friendly to her and an arm of might the thought of the storm she had sown upon all sides made her tremble foolishly when she placed her hand in roberts she gave his fingers a confiding pressure and all but dropped her head upon his bosom so sick she was with weakness it would have been a deceit toward him and that restrained her perhaps yet more she was restrained by the gloomy prospect of having to reply to any words of love without an idea of what to say and with a loathing of caresses she saw herself condemned to stand alone and at a season when she was not strengthened by pure selfsupport rhoda had not surrendered the stern belief that she had done well by forcing dahlias hand to the marriage though it had resulted evilly in reflecting on it she had still a feeling of the harsh joy peculiar to those who have exercised command with a conscious righteousness upon wilful sinful and erring spirits and have thwarted the wrongdoer she could only admit that there was sadness in the issue hitherto at least nothing worse than sad disappointment the man who was her sisters husband could no longer complain that he had been the victim of an imposition she had bought his promise that he would leave the country and she had rescued the honour of the family by paying him at what cost she asked herself that now and then her selfsupport became uneven could her uncle have parted with the great sumhave shed it upon her merely beneficently and because he loved her was it possible that he had the habit of carrying his own riches through the streets of london she had to silence all questions imperiously recalling exactly her ideas of him and the value of money in the moment when money was an object of hungerwhen she had seized it like a wolf and its value was quite unknown unguessed at rhoda threw up her window before she slept that she might breathe the cool night air and as she leaned out she heard steps moving away and knew them to be roberts in whom that pressure of her hand had cruelly resuscitated his longing for her she drew back wondering at the idleness of menslaves while they want a womans love savages when they have won it she tried to pity him but she had not an emotion to spare save perhaps one of dull exultation that she alone of women was free from that wretched mess called love and upon it she slept it was between the breakfast and dinner hours at the farm next day when the young squire accompanied by anthony hackbut met farmer fleming in the lane bordering one of the outermost fields of wheat anthony gave little more than a blunt nod to his relative and slouched on leaving the farmer in amazement while the young squire stopped him to speak with him anthony made his way on to the house shortly after he was seen passing through the gates of the garden accompanied by rhoda at the dinnerhour robert was taken aside by the farmer neither rhoda nor anthony presented themselves they did not appear till nightfall when anthony came into the room he took no greetings and gave none he sat down on the first chair by the door shaking his head with vacant eyes rhoda took off her bonnet and sat as strangely silent in vain mrs sumfit asked her shall it be tea dear and a little cold meat the two dumb figures were separately interrogated but they had no answer come brother tony the farmer tried to rally him dahlia was knitting some article of feminine gear robert stood by the muskpots at the window looking at rhoda fixedly of this gaze she became conscious and glanced from him to the clock its late she said rising but youre empty my dear and to think o going to bed without a dinner or your tea and no supper youll never say prayers if you do said mrs sumfit the remark engendered a notion in the farmers head that anthony promised to be particularly prayerless youve been and spent a night at the young squires i hear brother tony all right and well no complaints on my part i do assure ye if youre mixed up with that family i wont bring it in youre anyways mixed up with this family not so as to clash do you see only man now you are here a wordd be civil if you dont want a doctor i was right murmured mrs sumfit at the funeral he was and lord be thanked i thought my eyes was failin mas gammon youd ha lost no character by sidin wi me heres dahlia too said the farmer brother tony dont you see her shes beginning to be recognizable if her haird grow a bit faster sheswell there she is a quavering tiny voice that came from anthony said how d ye dohow d ye do sounding like the first effort of a fife but anthony did not cast eye on dahlia will you eat manwill you smoke a pipewont you talk a wordwill you go to bed these several questions coming between pauses elicited nothing from the staring oldman is there a matter wrong at the bank the farmer called out and anthony jumped in a heap eh persisted the farmer rhoda interposed uncle is tired he is unwell tomorrow he will talk to you no but is there anything wrong up there though the farmer asked with eager curiosity and a fresh smile at the thought that those banks and city folk were mortal and could upset notwithstanding their crashing wheels brother tony you speak out has anybody been and broke never mind a blow so long o course as they havent swallowed your money how is it why i never saw such a sight as you you come down from london you play hide and seek about your relations house and here when you do condescend to step ineh how is it you aint i hope ruined tony are ye rhoda stood over her uncle to conceal him he shall not speak till he has had some rest and yes mother he shall have some warm tea upstairs in bed boil some water now uncle come with me anybody broke anthony rolled the words over as rhoda raised his arm im asked such a lot my dear i aint equal to it you said here d be a quiet place i dont know about money try my pockets yes mum if you was forty policemen im empty youd find it and no objection to nod to prayers but never was taught one of my own where am i going my dear upstairs with me uncle rhoda had succeeded in getting him on his feet the farmer tapped at his forehead as a signification to the others that anthony had gone wrong in the head which reminded him that he had prophesied as much he stiffened out his legs and gave a manful spring crying hulloa brother tony why man eh look here what goin to bed what you tony i sayi saydear me and during these exclamations intricate visions of tripping by means of gold wires danced before him rhoda hurried anthony out after the door had shut the farmer said that comes of it sooner or later there it is you give your heart to moneyyou insure in a ship and as much as say heres a ship and blow and lighten i defy you whereas we daybyday people if it do blow and if it do lighten and the waves are avilanches weve nothing to lose poor old tonya smash to a certainty theres been a smash and hes gone under the harrow any o you here might ha heard me say things cant last for ever hant you now the persons present meekly acquiesced in his prophetic spirit to this extent mrs sumfit dolorously said often william dear and accepted the incontestable truth in deep humiliation of mind save the farmer continued save and store only dont put your heart in the box its true william mrs sumfit acted clerk to the sermon dahlia took her softly by the neck and kissed her is it love for the old woman mrs sumfit murmured fondly and dahlia kissed her again the farmer had by this time rounded to the thought of how he personally might be affected by anthonys illluck supposing perchance that anthony was suffering from something more than a sentimental attachment to the bank of his predilection and such a reflection instantly diverted his tendency to moralize we shall hear tomorrow he observed in conclusion which as it caused a desire for the morrow to spring within his bosom sent his eyes at master gammon who was half an hour behind his time for bed and had dropped asleep in his chair this unusual display of public somnolence on master gammons part together with the veterans reputation for slowness made the farmer fret at him as being in some way an obstruction to the lively progress of the hours hoy gammon he sang out awakeningly to ordinary ears but master gammon was not one who took the ordinary plunge into the gulf of sleep and it was required to shake him and to bellow at himto administer at once earthquake and thunderbefore his lizard eyelids would lift over the great oldworld eyes upon which like a clayey monster refusing to be informed with heavenly fire he rolled to the right of his chair and to the left and pitched forward and insisted upon being inanimate brought at last to a condition of stale consciousness he looked at his master long and uttered surprisingly farmer theres queer things going on in this house and then relapsed to a combat with mrs sumfit regarding the candle she saying that it was not to be entrusted to him and he sullenly contending that it was here well all go to bed said the farmer what with one person queer and another person queer i shall be in for a headache if i take to thinking gammons a man sees in s sleep what he misses awake did you ever know he addressed anybody such a thing as tony hackbut coming into a relations house and sitting there and not a word for any of us its i call it dumbfoundering and thats me why didnt i go up and shake his hand you ask well why not if he dont know hes welcome without ceremony hes no good why ive got matters t occupy my mind too havent i every man has and some moren others let alone crosses theres something wrong with my brotherinlaw tony thats settled odd that we country people who bide and take the lords gifts the farmer did not follow out this reflection but raising his arms shepherdwise he puffed as if blowing the two women before him to their beds and then gave a shy look at robert and nodded goodnight to him robert nodded in reply he knew the cause of the farmers uncommon blitheness algernon blancove the young squire had proposed for rhodas hand chapter xliii anthony had robbed the bank the young squire was aware of the fact and had offered to interpose for him and to make good the money to the bank upon one condition so much rhoda had gathered from her uncles babbling interjections throughout the day the farmer knew only of the young squires proposal which had been made direct to him and he had left it to robert to state the case to rhoda and plead for himself she believed fully when she came downstairs into the room where robert was awaiting her that she had but to speak and a mine would be sprung and shrinking from it hoping for it she entered and tried to fasten her eyes upon robert distinctly telling him the tale robert listened with a calculating seriousness of manner that quieted her physical dread of his passion she finished and he said it will perhaps save your uncle im sure it will please your father she sat down feeling that a warmth had gone and that she was very bare must i consent then if you can i suppose both being spirits formed for action a perplexity found them weak as babes he moreover was stung to see her debating at all upon such a question and he was in despair before complicated events which gave nothing for his hands and heart to do stiff endurance seemed to him to be his lesson and he made a show of having learnt it were you going out robert i usually make the rounds of the house to be sure alls safe his walking about the garden at night was not then for the purpose of looking at her window rhoda coloured in all her dark crimson with shame for thinking that it had been so i must decide tomorrow morning they say the pillows the best counsellor a reply that presumed she would sleep appeared to her as bitterly unfriendly did father wish it not by what he spoke you suppose he does wish it wheres the father who wouldnt of course he wishes it hes kind enough but you may be certain he wishes it oh dahlia dahlia rhoda moaned under a rush of new sensations unfilial akin to those which her sister had distressed her by speaking shamelessly out ah poor soul added robert my darling must be brave she must have great courage dahlia cannot be a coward i begin to see rhoda threw up her face and sat awhile as one who was reading old matters by a fresh light i cant think she said with a start have i been dreadfully cruel was i unsisterly i have such a horror of some thingsdisgrace and men are so hard on women and fatheri felt for him and i hated that base man its his cousin and his name i could almost fancy this trial is brought round to me for punishment an ironic devil prompted robert to say you cant let harm come to your uncle the thing implied was the farthest in his idea of any womans possible duty are you of that opinion rhoda questioned with her eyes but uttered nothing now he had spoken almost in the ironical tone she should have noted that and how could a truehearted girl suppose him capable of giving such counsel to her whom he loved it smote him with horror and anger but he was much too manly to betray these actual sentiments and continued to dissemble you see he had not forgiven her for her indifference to him you are no longer your own mistress he said meaning exactly the reverse thisthat she was bound in generosity to sacrifice herselfwas what rhoda feared there was no forceful passion in her bosom to burst through the crowd of weak reasonings and vanities to bid her be a woman not a puppet and the passion in him for which she craved that she might be taken up by it and whirled into forgetfulness with a seal of betrothal upon her lips was absent so that she thought herself loved no more by robert she was weary of thinking and acting on her own responsibility and would gladly have abandoned her will yet her judgement if she was still to exercise it told her that the step she was bidden to take was one the direct consequence and the fruit of her other resolute steps pride whispered you could compel your sister to do that which she abhorred and pity pleaded for her poor old uncle anthony she looked back in imagination at that scene with him in london amazed at her frenzy of power and again from that contemplation amazed at her present nervelessness i am not fit to be my own mistress she said then the sooner you decide the better observed robert and the room became hot and narrow to him very little time is given me she murmured the sound was like a whimper exasperating to one who had witnessed her remorseless energy i dare say you wont find the hardship so great said he because she looked up quickly i went out one day to meet him do you mean that robert i went to hear news of my sister i had received no letters from her and he wrote to say that he could tell me about her my uncle took me once to the bank i saw him there first he spoke of wrexby and of my sister it is pleasant to inexperienced girls to hear themselves praised since the day when you told me to turn back i have always respected you her eyelids lowered softly could she have humbled herself more but she had at the same time touched his old wound and his rival then was the wooer now rich and a gentleman and this room robert thought as he looked about it was the room in which she had refused him when he first asked her to be his i think he said ive never begged your pardon for the last occasion of our being alone here together ive had my arm round you dont be frightened thats my marriage and there was my wife and theres an end of my likings and my misconduct forgive me for calling it to mind no no robert rhoda lifted her hands and startled by the impulse dropped them saying what forgiveness was i ever angry with you a look of tenderness accompanied the words and grew into a dusky crimson rose under his eyes when you went into the wood i saw you going i knew it was for some good object he said and flushed equally but by the recurrence to that scene he had checked her sensitive developing emotion she hung a moment in languor and that oriental warmth of colour ebbed away from her cheeks you are very kind said she then he perceived in dimmest fashion that possibly a chance had come to ripeness withered and fallen within the late scoffing seconds of time enraged at his blindness and careful lest he had wrongly guessed not to expose his regret the man was a lover he remarked both truthfully and hypocritically ive always thought you were born to be a lady you had that ambition young madam she answered thats what i dont understand your saying it o my friend you will soon take to your new duties you have small objection to them even now yes or my life wont be worth much know that you are driving me to it and i wish you happiness rhoda you are madly imperilling the prospect thereof to each of them the second meaning stood shadowy behind the utterances and further thank you robert i shall have to thank you for the issue now its time to part do you not see that theres a danger for me in remaining good night behold i am submissive good night rhoda you were the first to give the signal of parting good night i am simply submissive why not my name are you hurt with me rhoda choked the indirectness of speech had been a shelter to her permitting her to hint at more than she dared clothe in words again the delicious dusky rose glowed beneath his eyes but he had put his hand out to her and she had not taken it what have i done to offend you i really dont know rhoda nothing the flower had closed he determined to believe that she was gladdened at heart by the prospect of a fine marriage and now began to discourse of anthonys delinquency saying it was not money taken for moneys sake any one can see that it was half clear to me when you told me about it that the money was not his to give but ive got the habit of trusting you to be always correct and i never am said rhoda vexed at him and at herself women cant judge so well about money matters has your uncle no account of his own at the bank he was thought to be a bit of a miser what he is or what he was i cant guess he has not been near the bank since that day nor to his home he has wandered down on his way here sleeping in cottages his heart seems broken i have still a great deal of the money i kept it thinking it might be a protection for dahlia oh my thoughts and what i have done of course i imagined him to be rich a thousand pounds seemed a great deal to me and very little for one who was rich if i had reflected at all i must have seen that uncle anthony would never have carried so much through the streets i was like a fiend for money i must have been acting wrongly such a craving as that is a sign of evil what evil there is youre going to mend rhoda i sell myself then hardly so bad as that the money will come from you instead of from your uncle rhoda bent forward in her chair with her elbows on her knees like a man brooding perhaps it was right that the money should come from her and how could she have hoped to get the money by any other means here at least was a positive escape from perplexity it came at the right moment was it a help divine what cowardice had been prompting her to evade it after all could it be a dreadful step that she was required to take her eyes met roberts and he said startlingly just like a woman why but she had caught the significance and blushed with spite he was the first to praise you you are brutal to me robert my name at last you accused me of that sort of thing before in this room rhoda stood up i will wish you good night and now you take my hand good night they uttered simultaneously but robert did not give up the hand he had got in his own his eyes grew sharp and he squeezed the fingers im bound she cried once robert drew her nearer to him let me go once he reiterated rhoda as ive never kissed youonce no dont anger me no one has ever kissed you never then i his force was compelling the straightened figure had he said be mine she might have softened to his embrace but there was no fire of divining love in her bosom to perceive her lovers meaning she read all his words as a placard on a board and revolted from the outrage of submitting her lips to one who was not to be her husband his jealousy demanded that gratification foremost the be mine was ready enough to follow let me go robert she was released the cause for it was the opening of the door anthony stood there a more astounding resemblance to the phantasm of a dream was never presented he was clad in a manner to show forth the condition of his wits in partial night and day attire one of the farmers nightcaps was on his head surmounted by his hat a confused recollection of the necessity for trousers had made him draw on those garments sufficiently to permit of the movement of his short legs at which point their subserviency to the uses ended wrinkled with incongruous clothing from head to foot and dazed by the light he peered on them like a mouse magnified and petrified dearest uncle rhoda went to him anthony nodded pointing to the door leading out of the house i just want to go offgo off never you mind me im only going off you must go to your bed uncle oh lord no im going off my dear ive had sleep enough for forty i he turned his mouth to rhodas ear i dont want t see th old farmer and as if he had given a conclusive reason for his departure he bored towards the door repeating it and bawling additionally in the morning you have seen him uncle you have seen him its over said rhoda anthony whispered i dont want t see th old farmer but you have seen him uncle in the morning my dear not in the morning hell be looking and asking where away brother tony wheres your bankers book brother tony hows moneymarket brother tony i cant see th old farmer it was impossible to avoid smiling his imitation of the farmers country style was exact she took his hands and used every persuasion she could think of to induce him to return to his bed nor was he insensible to argument or superior to explanation th old farmer thinks ive got millions my dear you cant satisfy him he i dont want t see him in the morning he thinks ive got millions his mouthll go down i dont want you dont want him to look and i cant count now i cant count a bit and every post i see s a policeman i aint hiding let em take the old man and he was a faithful servant till one day he got up on a regular whirlygo round and ever sincesuch a little boy im frightened o you rhoda i will do everything for you said rhoda crying wretchedly because the young squire says anthony made his voice mysterious yes yes rhoda stopped him and i consent she gave a hurried halfglance behind her come uncle oh pity dont let me think your reasons gone i can get you the money but if you go foolish i cannot help you her energy had returned to her with the sense of sacrifice anthony eyed her tears weve sat on a bank and cried together havent we he said and counted ants we have shall we sit in the sun together tomorrow say we shall shall we a good long day in the sun and nobody looking at me s my pleasure rhoda gave him the assurance and he turned and went upstairs with her docile at the prospect of hours to be passed in the sunlight yet when morning came he had disappeared robert also was absent from the breakfasttable the farmer made no remarks save that he reckoned master gammon was rightin allusion to the veterans somnolent observation overnight and strange things were acted before his eyes there came by the morning delivery of letters one addressed to miss fleming he beheld his daughters rise put their hands out and claim it in a breath and they gazed upon one another like the two women demanding the babe from the justice of the wise king the letter was placed in rhodas hand dahlia laid hers on it their mouths were shut any one not looking at them would have been unaware that a supreme conflict was going on in the room it was a strenuous wrestle of their eyeballs like the give way of athletes pausing but the delirious beat down the constitutional strength a hard bright smile ridged the hollow of dahlias cheeks rhodas dark eyes shut she let go her hold and dahlia thrust the letter in against her bosom snatched it out again and dipped her face to roses in a jug and kissing mrs sumfit ran from the room for a single minute after which she came back smiling with gravely joyful eyes and showing a sedate readiness to eat and conclude the morning meal what did this mean the farmer could have made allowance for rhodas behaving so seeing that she notoriously possessed intellect and he had the habit of charging all freaks and vagaries of manner upon intellect but dahlia was a soft creature without this apology for extravagance and what right had she to letters addressed to miss fleming the farmer prepared to ask a question and was further instigated to it by seeing mrs sumfits eyes roll sympathetic under a burden of overpowering curiosity and bewilderment on the point of speaking he remembered that he had pledged his word to ask no questions he feared tothat was the secret he had put his trust in rhodas assurance and shrank from a spoken suspicion so checking himself he broke out upon mrs sumfit now then mother which caused her to fluster guiltily she having likewise given her oath to be totally unquestioning even as was master gammon whom she watched with a deep envy mrs sumfit excused the anxious expression of her face by saying that she was thinking of her dairy whither followed by the veteran she retired rhoda stood eyeing dahlia nerved to battle against the contents of that letter though in the first conflict she had been beaten oh this curse of love she thought in her heart and as dahlia left the room flushed stupefied and conscienceless rhoda the more readily told her father the determination which was the result of her interview with robert no sooner had she done so than a strange fluttering desire to look on robert awoke within her bosom she left the house believing that she went abroad to seek her uncle and walked up a small grassknoll a little beyond the farmyard from which she could see green corntracts and the pastures by the river the river flowing oily under summer light and the slowfooted cows with their heads bent to the herbage faraway sheep and white hawthorn bushes and deep hedgeways bursting out of the trimness of the earlier season and a nightingale sang among the hazels near by this scene of unthrobbing peacefulness was beheld by rhoda with her first conscious delight in it she gazed round on the farm under a quick new impulse of affection for her old home and whose hand was it that could alone sustain the working of the farm and had done so without reward her eyes travelled up to wrexby hall perfectly barren of any feeling that she was to enter the place aware only that it was full of pain for her she accused herself but could not accept the charge of her having ever hoped for transforming events that should twist and throw the dear old farmlife long back into the fields of memory nor could she understand the reason of her continued coolness to robert enough of accurate reflection was given her to perceive that discontent with her station was the original cause of her discontent now what she had sown she was reapingand wretchedly colourless are these harvests of our dream the sun has not shone on them they may have a tragic bloodhue as with dahlias but they will never have any warm and fresh and nourishing sweetnessthe juice which is in a single blade of grass a longing came upon rhoda to go and handle butter she wished to smell it as mrs sumfit drubbed and patted and flattened and rounded it in the dairy and she ran down the slope meeting her father at the gate he was dressed in his brushed suit going she knew whither and when he asked if she had seen her uncle she gave for answer a plain negative and longed more keenly to be at work with her hands and to smell the homely creamy air under the dairyshed chapter xliv she watched her father as he went across the field and into the lane her breathing was suppressed till he appeared in view at different points more and more distant and then she sighed heavily stopped her breathing and hoped her unshaped hope again the last time he was in sight she found herself calling to him with a voice like that of a burdened sleeper her thought being how can you act so cruelly to robert he passed up wrexby heath and over the black burnt patch where the fire had caught the furzes on a dry maynight and sank on the side of the hall when we have looked upon a picture of still green life with a troubled soul and the blow falls on us we accuse nature of our own treachery to her rhoda hurried from the dairydoor to shut herself up in her room and darken the light surrounding her she had turned the lock and was about systematically to pull down the blind when the marvel of beholding dahlia stepping out of the garden made her for a moment less the creature of her sickened senses dahlia was dressed for a walk and she went very fast the same paralysis of motion afflicted rhoda as when she was gazing after her father but her hand stretched out instinctively for her bonnet when dahlia had crossed the green and the millbridge and was no more visible rhoda drew her bonnet on and caught her black silk mantle in her hand and without strength to throw it across her shoulders dropped before her bed and uttered a strange prayer let her die rather than go back to disgrace my god my god she tried to rise and failed in the effort and superstitiously renewed her prayer send death to her ratherand rhodas vision under her shut eyes conjured up clouds and lightnings and spheres in conflagration there is nothing so indicative of fevered or of bad blood as the tendency to counsel the almighty how he shall deal with his creatures the strain of a long uncertainty and the late feverish weeks had distempered the fine blood of the girl and her acts and words were becoming remoter exponents of her character she bent her head in a blind doze that gave her strength to rise as swiftly as she could she went in the track of her sister that morning robert had likewise received a letter it was from major waring and contained a banknote and a summons to london as also an enclosure from mrs boulby of warbeach the nature of which was an advertisement cut out of the county paper notifying to one robert eccles that his aunt anne had died and that there was a legacy for him to be paid over upon application robert crossed the fields laughing madly at the ironical fate which favoured him a little and a little and never enough save just to keep him swimming the letter from major waring said i must see you immediately be quick and come i begin to be of your opinionthere are some things which we must take into our own hands and deal summarily with ayay robert gave tongue in the clear morning air scenting excitement and eager for it as a hound more was written which he read subsequently i wrong percys letter continued the best of women she was driven to my door there is it seems some hope that dahlia will find herself free at any rate keep guard over her and dont leave her mrs lovell has herself been moving to make discoveries down at warbeach mr blancove has nearly quitted this sphere she nursed himi was jealousthe words out truth courage and suffering touch margarets heart yours percy jumping over a bank robert came upon anthony who was unsteadily gazing at a donkey that cropped the grass by a gate here you are said robert and took his arm anthony struggled though he knew the grasp was friendly but he was led along nor did robert stop until they reached greatham five miles beyond wrexby where he entered the principal inn and called for wine you want spirit you want life said robert anthony knew that he wanted no wine whatever his needs might be yet the tender ecstacy of being paid for was irresistible and he drank saying just one glass then robert pledged him they were in a private room of which having ordered up three bottles of sherry robert locked the door the devil was in him he compelled anthony to drink an equal portion with himself alternately frightening and cajoling the old man drink i tell you youve robbed me and you shall drink i havent i havent anthony whined drink and be silent youve robbed me and you shall drink and by heaven if you resist ill hand you over to bluer imps than youve ever dreamed of old gentleman youve robbed me mr hackbut drink i tell you anthony wept into his glass thats a trick i could never do said robert eyeing the drip of the trembling old tear pitilessly your health mr hackbut youve robbed me of my sweetheart never mind lifes but the pop of a gun some of us flash in the pan and theyre the only ones that do no mischief youre not one of them sir so you must drink and let me see you cheerful by degrees the wine stirred anthonys blood and he chirped feebly as one who half remembered that he ought to be miserable robert listened to his maundering account of his adventure with the bank money sternly replenishing his glass his attention was taken by the sight of dahlia stepping forth from a chemists shop in the street nearly opposite to the inn this is my medicine said robert and yours too he addressed anthony the sun had passed its meridian when they went into the streets again roberts head was high as a cocks and anthony leaned on his arm performing short halfcircles headlong to the front until the mighty arm checked and uplifted him they were soon in the fields leading to wrexby robert saw two female figures far ahead a man was hastening to join them the women started and turned suddenly one threw up her hands and darkened her face it was in the pathway of a broad meadow deep with grass wherein the red sorrel topped the yellow buttercup like rust upon the seasons gold robert hastened on he scarce at the moment knew the man whose shoulder he seized but he had recognised dahlia and rhoda and he found himself face to face with sedgett its you perhaps youll keep your hands off before you make sure another time robert said i really beg your pardon step aside with me not while ive a haporth o brains in my noddle replied sedgett drawling an imitation of his enemys courteous tone ive come for my wife im just down by train and a bit out of my way i reckon im come and im in a hurry she shall get home and have on her things boxes packed and we go robert waved dahlia and rhoda to speed homeward anthony had fallen against the roots of a banking elm and surveyed the scene with philosophic abstractedness rhoda moved taking dahlias hand stop cried sedgett do you people here think me a fool eccles you know me better n that that young womans my wife ive come for her i tell ye youve no claim on her rhoda burst forth weakly and quivered and turned her eyes supplicatingly on robert dahlia was a statue of icy fright youve thrown her off man and sold what rights you had said robert spying for the point of his person where he might grasp the wretch and keep him off that dont hold in law sedgett nodded a man may get in a passion when he finds hes been cheated maynt he i have your word of honour said rhoda muttering oh devil come to wrong us then you shouldnt ha run ferreting down in my part o the country you or ecclesi dont care who tisyouve been at my servants to get at my secrets some of you have youve declared war youve been trying to undermine me thats a breach i call it anyhow ive come for my wife ill have her none of us none of us no one has been to your house said rhoda vehemently you live in hampshire sir i think i dont know any more i dont know where i have not asked my sister oh spare us and go no one has been down into your part of the country said robert with perfect mildness to which sedgett answered bluffly there ye lie bob eccles and he was immediately felled by a tremendous blow robert strode over him and taking dahlia by the elbow walked three paces on as to set her in motion off he cried to rhoda whose eyelids cowered under the blaze of his face it was best that her sister should be away and she turned and walked swiftly hurrying dahlia and touching her oh dont touch my arm dahlia said quailing in the fall of her breath they footed together speechless taking the womans quickest gliding step at the last stile of the fields rhoda saw that they were not followed she stopped panting her heart and eyes were so full of that flaming creature who was her lover dahlia took from her bosom the letter she had won in the morning and held it open in both hands to read it the pause was short dahlia struck the letter into her bosom again and her starved features had some of the bloom of life she kept her right hand in her pocket and rhoda presently asked what have you there you are my enemy dear in some things dahlia replied a muscular shiver passing over her i think said rhoda i could get a little money to send you away will you go i am full of grief for what i have done god forgive me pray dont speak so dont let us talk said dahlia scorched as she felt both in soul and body a touch or a word was a wound to her yet she was the first to resume i think i shall be saved i cant quite feel i am lost i have not been so wicked as that rhoda gave a loving answer and again dahlia shrank from the miserable comfort of words as they came upon the green fronting the iron gateway rhoda perceived that the board proclaiming the sale of queen annes farm had been removed and now she understood her fathers readiness to go up to wrexby hall he would sell me to save the farm she reproached herself for the thought but she could not be just she had the image of her father plodding relentlessly over the burnt heath to the hall as conceived by her agonized sensations in the morning too vividly to be just though still she knew that her own indecision was to blame master gammon met them in the garden pointing aloft over the gateway thats down he remarked and the three green front teeth of his quiet grin were stamped on the impressionable vision of the girls in such a way that they looked at one another with a bare bitter smile once it would have been mirth tell father dahlia said when they were at the back doorway and her eyes sparkled piteously and she bit on her underlip rhoda tried to detain her but dahlia repeated tell father and in strength and in will had become more than a match for her sister chapter xlv rhoda spoke to her father from the doorway with her hand upon the lock of the door at first he paid little attention to her and when he did so began by saying that he hoped she knew that she was bound to have the young squire and did not intend to be prankish and wilful because the young squire was eager to settle affairs that he might be settled himself i dont deny its honour to us and its a comfort said the farmer this is the first morning ive thought easily in my chair for years im sorry about robert whos a twice unlucky un but you aimed at something higher i suppose rhoda was prompted to say a word in selfdefence but refrained and again she told dahlias story wondering that her father showed no excitement of any kind on the contrary there was the dimple of one of his voiceless chuckles moving about the hollow of one cheek indicating some slow contemplative action that was not unpleasant within he said ah well its very sadthat is if tis so and no more for a time she discovered that he was referring to her uncle anthony concerning whose fortunate position in the world he was beginning to entertain some doubts or else said the farmer with a tap on his forehead hes going here it d be odd after all if commercially as he d call it his despised brotherinlawand i say it in all kindnessshould turn out worth not exactly millions but worth a trifle the farmer nodded with an air of deprecating satisfaction rhoda did not gain his ear until as by an instinct she perceived what interest the story of her uncle and the moneybags would have for him she related it and he was roused then for the third time she told him of dahlia rhoda saw her fathers chest grow large while his eyes quickened with light he looked on her with quite a strange face wrath and a revived apprehension and a fixed will were expressed in it and as he catechized her for each particular of the truth which had been concealed from him she felt a respectfulness that was new in her personal sensations toward her father but it was at the expense of her love when he had heard and comprehended all he said send the girl down to me but rhoda pleaded she is too worn she is tottering she cannot endure a word on this not even of kindness and help then you said the farmer you tell her shes got a dutys her first duty now obedience to her husband do you hear then let her hear it obedience to her husband and welcomes the man when he calls on me hes welcome my doors are open to him i thank him i honour him i bless his name its to him i oweyou go up to her and say her father owes it to the young man whos married her that he can lift up his head go aloft ay for years ive been suspecting something of this i tell ye girl i dont understand about church doors and castin of her offhes come for her hasnt he then he shall have her i tell ye i dont understand about money hes married her well then shes his wife and how can he bargain not to see her the base wretch cried rhoda hasnt he married her the farmer retorted hasnt he given the poor creature a name im not for abusing her but him i do thank and i say when he calls heres my hand for him here its out and waiting for him father if you let me see it rhoda checked the intemperate outburst father this is a bada bad man he is a very wicked man we were all deceived by him robert knows him he has known him for years and knows that he is very wicked this man married our dahlia to get rhoda gasped and could not speak it he flung her off with horrible words at the church door after this how can he claim her i paid him all he had to expect with uncles money for his promise by his sacred oath never never to disturb or come near my sister after that he cant cant claim her if he does hes her husband interrupted the farmer when he comes here hes welcome i say hes welcome my hands out to himif its alone that hes saved the name of fleming from disgrace i thank him and my daughter belongs to him where is he now you talk of a scuffle with robert i do hope robert will not forget his proper behaviour go you up to your sister and say from mealls forgotten and forgiven say its all underfoot but she must learn to be a good girl from this day and if shes at the gate to welcome her husband so much the better ll her father be pleasedsay that i want to see the man itll gratify me to feel her husbands flesh and blood his being out of sight so longs been a sore at my heart and when i see him ill welcome him and so must all in my house this was how william fleming received the confession of his daughters unhappy plight rhoda might have pleaded dahlias case better but that she was too shocked and outraged by the selfishness she saw in her father and the partial desire to scourge which she was too intuitively keen at the moment not to perceive in the paternal forgiveness and in the stipulation of the forgiveness she went upstairs to dahlia simply stating that their father was aware of all the circumstances dahlia looked at her but dared ask nothing so the day passed neither robert nor anthony appeared the night came all doors were locked the sisters that night slept together feeling the very pulses of the hours yet neither of them absolutely hopelessly although in a great anguish rhoda was dressed by daylight the old familiar country about the house lay still as if it knew no expectation she observed master gammon tramping forth afield and presently heard her fathers voice below all the machinery of the daily life got into motion but it was evident that robert and anthony continued to be absent a thought struck her that robert had killed the man it came with a flash of joy that was speedily terror and she fell to praying vehemently and vaguely dahlia lay exhausted on the bed but nigh the hour when letters were delivered she sat up saying there is one for me get it there was in truth a letter for her below and it was in her fathers hand and open come out said the farmer as rhoda entered to him when they were in the garden he commanded her to read and tell him the meaning of it the letter was addressed to dahlia fleming its for my sister rhoda murmured in anger but more in fear she was sternly bidden to read and she read dahliathere is mercy for us you are not lost to me edward after this was appended in a feminine hand there is really hope a few hours will tell us but keep firm if he comes near you keep from him you are not his run hide go anywhere if you have reason to think he is near i dare not write what it is we expect yesterday i told you to hope today i can say believe that you will be saved you are not lost everything depends on your firmness margaret l rhoda lifted up her eyes the farmer seized the letter and laid his finger on the first signature is that the christian name of my girls seducer he did not wait for an answer but turned and went into the breakfasttable when he ordered a tray with breakfast for dahlia to betaken up to her bedroom and that done he himself turned the key of the door and secured her mute woe was on mrs sumfits face at all these strange doings but none heeded her and she smothered her lamentations the farmer spoke nothing either of robert or of anthony he sat in his chair till the dinner hour without book or pipe without occupation for eyes or hands silent but acute in his hearing the afternoon brought relief to rhodas apprehensions a messenger ran up to the farm bearing a pencilled note to her from robert which said that he in company with her uncle was holding sedgett at a distance by force of arm and that there was no fear rhoda kissed the words hurrying away to the fields for a few minutes to thank and bless and dream of him who had said that there was no fear she knew that dahlia was unconscious of her imprisonment and had less compunction in counting the minutes of her absence the sun spread in yellow and fell in red before she thought of returning so sweet it had become to her to let her mind dwell with robert and she was half a stranger to the mournfulness of the house when she set her steps homeward but when she lifted the latch of the gate a sensation prompted by some unwitting selfaccusal struck her with alarm she passed into the room and beheld her father and mrs sumfit who was sitting rolling with her apron over her head the man sedgett was between them chapter xlvi no sooner had rhoda appeared than her father held up the key of dahlias bedroom and said unlock your sister and fetch her down to her husband mechanically rhoda took the key and leave our door open he added she went up to dahlia sick with a sudden fright lest evil had come to robert seeing that his enemy was here but that was swept from her by dahlias aspect he is in the house dahlia said and asked was there no letterno letter none this morning rhoda clasped her in her arms seeking to check the convulsions of her trembling no letter no letter none not any oh no letter for me the strange varying tones of musical interjection and interrogation were pitiful to hear did you look for a letter said rhoda despising herself for so speaking he is in the house where is my letter what was it you hoped what was it you expected darling dahlia moaned i dont know im blind i was told to hope yesterday i had my letter and it told me to hope he is in the house oh my dear my love cried rhoda come down a minute see him it is fathers wish come only for a minute come to gain time if there is hope but there was no letter for me this morning rhoda i cant hope i am lost he is in the house dearest there was a letter said rhoda doubting that she did well in revealing it dahlia put out her hands dumb for the letter father opened it and read it and keeps it said rhoda clinging tight to the stricken form then he is against me oh my letter dahlia wrung her hands while they were speaking their fathers voice was heard below calling for dahlia to descend he came thrice to the foot of the stairs and shouted for her the third time he uttered a threat that sprang an answer from her bosom in shrieks rhoda went out on the landing and said softly come up to her father after a little hesitation he ascended the stairs why girl i only ask you to come down and see your husband he remarked with an attempt at kindliness of tone whats the harm then come and see him thats all come and see him dahlia was shrinking out of her fathers sight as he stood in the doorway say she communicated to rhoda say i want my letter come william fleming grew impatient let her have her letter father said rhoda you have no right to withhold it that letter my girl he touched rhodas shoulder as to satisfy her that he was not angry that letters where it ought to be ive puzzled out the meaning of it that letters in her husbands possession dahlia with her ears stretching for all that might be uttered heard this passing round the door she fronted her father my letter gone to him she cried shameful old man can you look on me father could you give it im a dead woman she smote her bosom stumbling backward upon rhodas arm you have been a wicked girl the ordinarily unmoved old man retorted your husband has come for you and you go with him know that and let me hear no threats hes a modestminded quiet young man and a farmer like myself and neednt be better than he is come you down to him at once ill tell you he comes to take you away and his carts at the gate to the gate you go with him when next i see youyou visiting me or i visiting youi shall see a respected creature and not what you have been and want to be you have racked the household with fear and shame for years now come and carry out what youve begun in the contrary direction youve got my word o command dead woman or live woman rhoda take one elbow of your sister your aunts coming up to pack her box i say im determined and no one stops me when i say that come out dahlia and let our parting be like between parent and child heres the dark falling and your husbands anxious to be away he has business and ll hardly get you to the station for the last train to town hark at him below hes naturally astonished he is and youre trying his temper as youd try any mans he wants to be off come and when next we meet i shall see you a happy wife he might as well have spoken to a corpse speak to her still father said rhoda as she drew a chair upon which she leaned her sisters body and ran down full of the power of hate and loathing to confront sedgett but great as was that power within her it was overmatched by his brutal resolution to take his wife away no argument no irony no appeals can long withstand the iteration of a dogged phrase ive come for my wife sedgett said to all her instances his voice was waxing loud and insolent and as it sounded mrs sumfit moaned and flapped her apron then how could you have married him they heard the farmers roar of this unanswerable thing aloft yeshow how cried rhoda below utterly forgetting the part she had played in the marriage its too late to hate a man when youve married him my girl sedgett went out to the foot of the stairs mr flemingshes my wife ill teach her about hating and loving ill behave well to her i swear im in the midst of enemies but i say i do love my wife and ive come for her and have her i will now in two minutes time mr fleming my carts at the gate and ive got business and shes my wife the farmer called for mrs sumfit to come up and pack dahlias box and the forlorn woman made her way to the bedroom all the house was silent rhoda closed her sight and she thought does god totally abandon us she let her father hear father you know that you are killing your child i hear ye my lass said he she will die father i hear ye i hear ye she will die father he stamped furiously exclaiming whos got the law of her better and above a husband hear reason and come and help and fetch down your sister she goes father rhoda cried looking at her open hands as if she marvelled to see them helpless there was for a time that silence which reigns in a sickchamber when the man of medicine takes the patients wrist and in the silence came a blessed soundthe lifting of a latch rhoda saw roberts face so said robert as she neared him you neednt tell me whats happened heres the man i see he dodged me cleverly the hound wants practice the fox is born with his cunning few words were required to make him understand the position of things in the house rhoda spoke out all without hesitation in sedgetts hearing but the farmer respected robert enough to come down to him and explain his views of his duty and his daughters duty by the kitchen firelight he and robert and sedgett read one anothers countenances he has a proper claim to take his wife robert said the farmer hes righted her before the world and i thank him and if he asks for her of me he must have her and he shall all right sir replied robert and i say too shall when im stiff as logwood oh robert robert rhoda cried in great joy do you mean that you step twixt me and my own said mr

dodged me cleverly that you did id like to know how it was done i see youve got a cart outside and a boy at the horses head the horse steps well does he im about three hours behind him i reckonnot too late though he let fall a great breath of weariness rhoda went to the cupboard and drew forth a rarely touched bottle of spirits with which she filled a small glass and handing the glass to him said drink he smiled kindly and drank it off the mans in your house mr fleming he said and hes my guest and my daughters husband remember that said the farmer and mean to wait not half a minute longer till ive taken her offmark that sedgett struck in now mr fleming you see you keep good your word to me ill do no less said the farmer he went into the passage shouting for mrs sumfit to bring down the box she begs mrs sumfit answered to himshe begs william ony a short five minutes to pray by herself which you will grant unto her dear you will lord whats come upon us quick and down with the box then mother he rejoined the box was dragged out and dahlias door was shut that she might have her last minutes alone rhoda kissed her sister before leaving her alone and so cold were dahlias lips so tight the clutch of her hands that she said dearest think of god and dahlia replied i do he will not forsake you rhoda said dahlia nodded with shut eyes and rhoda went forth and now robert you and ill see whos master on these premises said the farmer hear all im bounders under a sacred obligation to the husband of my child and the lords wrath on him who interferes and lifts his hand against me when i perform my sacred duty as a father place there im going to open the door rhoda see to your sisters bonnet and things robert stand out of my way theres no refreshment of any sort youll accept of before starting mr sedgett none at all thats no fault of my hospitality stand out of my way robert he was obeyed robert looked at rhoda but had no reply for her gaze of despair the farmer threw the door wide open there were people in the gardenstrangers his name was inquired for out of the dusk then whisperings were heard passing among the illdiscerned forms and the farmer went out to them robert listened keenly but the touch of rhodas hand upon his own distracted his hearing yet it must be he said why does she come here both he and rhoda followed the farmers steps drawn forth by the evercredulous eagerness which arises from an interruption to excited wretchedness near and nearer to the group they heard a quaint old woman exclaim come here to you for a wife when he has one of his own at home a poor thing he shipped off to america thinking himself more cunning than devils or angels and she got put out at a port owing to stress of weather to defeat the mans wickedness cant i prove it to you sir hes a married man which none of us in our village knew till the poor tricked thing crawled back penniless to find himand there she is now with such a story of his cunning to tell to anybody as will listen and why he kept it secret to get her pension paid him still on its all such a tale for you to hear byandby robert burst into a glorious laugh why mother mrs boulby havent you got a word for me my blessedest robert the good woman cried as she rushed up to kiss him though it wasnt to see you i came exactly she whispered the major and the good gentlemantheyre behind i travelled down with them dearyoud like to knowmrs lovell sent her little cunning groom down to warbeach just two weeks back to make inquiries about that villain and the groom left me her address in case my dear when the poor creaturehis true wifecrawled home and we knew of her at three tree farm and knew her story i wrote word at once i did to mrs lovell and the sweet good lady sent down her groom to fetch me to you to make things clear here you shall understand them soon its providence at work i do believe that now theres a chance o punishing the wicked ones the figure of rhoda with two lights in her hand was seen in the porch and by the shadowy rays she beheld old anthony leaning against the house and major waring with a gentleman beside him close upon the gate at the same time a sound of wheels was heard robert rushed back into the great parlourkitchen and finding it empty stamped with vexation his prey had escaped but there was no relapse to give spare thoughts to that pollution of the house it had passed major waring was talking earnestly to mr fleming who held his head low stupefied and aware only of the fact that it was a gentleman imparting to him strange matters by degrees all were beneath the farmers roofall save one who stood with bowed head by the threshold there is a sort of hero and a sort of villain to this story they are but instruments hero and villain are combined in the person of edward who was now here to abase himself before the old man and the family he had injured and to kneel penitently at the feet of the woman who had just reason to spurn him he had sold her as a slave is sold he had seen her plunged into the blackest pit yet was she miraculously kept pure for him and if she could give him her pardon might still be his the grief for which he could ask no compassion had at least purified him to meet her embrace the great agony he had passed through of late had killed his meaner pride he stood there ready to come forward and ask forgiveness from unfriendly faces and beg that he might be in dahlias eyes oncethat he might see her once he had grown to love her with the fullest force of a selfish though not a common nature or rather he had always loved her and much of the selfishness had fallen away from his love it was not the highest form of love but the love was his highest development he had heard that dahlia lost to him was free something like the mortal yearning to look upon the dead risen to life made it impossible for him to remain absent and in doubt he was ready to submit to every humiliation that he might see the rescued features he was willing to pay all his penalties believing too that he was forgiven he knew that dahlias heart would throb for him to be near her and he had come the miraculous agencies which had brought him and major waring and mrs boulby to the farm that exalted woman was relating to mrs sumfit in another part of the house the farmer and percy and robert were in the family sittingroom when after an interval william fleming said aloud come in sir and edward stepped in among them rhoda was above seeking admittance to her sisters door and she heard her father utter that welcome it froze her limbs for still she hated the evildoer her hatred of him was a passion she crouched over the stairs listening to a low and longtoned voice monotonously telling what seemed to be one sole thing over and over without variation in the room where the men were words were indistinguishable thrice after calling to dahlia and getting no response she listened again and awe took her soul at last for abhorred as he was by her his power was felt she comprehended something of that earnestness which made the offender speak of his wrongful deeds and his shame and his remorse before his fellowmen straight out and calmly like one who has been plunged up to the middle in the fires of the abyss and is thereafter insensible to meaner pains the voice ended she was then aware that it had put a charm upon her ears the other voices following it sounded dull has hecan he have confessed in words all his wicked baseness she thought and in her soul the magnitude of his crime threw a gleam of splendour on his courage even at the bare thought that he might have done this feeling that dahlia was saved and thenceforth at liberty to despise him and torture him rhoda the more readily acknowledged that it might be a true love for her sister animating him from the height of a possible vengeance it was perceptible she turned to her sisters door and knocked at it calling to her safe safe but there came no answer and she was half glad for she had a fear that in the quick revulsion of her sisters feelings mere earthly love would act like heavenly charity and edward would find himself forgiven only too instantly and heartily in the small muskscented guests parlour mrs boulby was giving mrs sumfit and poor old sleepy anthony the account of the miraculous discovery of sedgetts wickedness which had vindicated all one hoped for from above as also the narration of the stabbing of her boy and the heroism and greatheartedness of robert rhoda listened to her for a space and went to her sisters door again but when she stood outside the kitchen she found all voices silent within it was in truth not only very difficult for william fleming to change his view of the complexion of circumstances as rapidly as circumstances themselves changed but it was very bitter for him to look upon edward and to see him in the place of sedgett he had been struck dumb by the sudden revolution of affairs in his house and he had been deferentially convinced by major warings tone that he ought rightly to give his hearing to an unknown young gentleman against whom anger was due he had listened to edward without one particle of comprehension except of the fact that his behaviour was extraordinary he understood that every admission made by edward with such grave and strange directness would justly have condemned him to punishment which the culprits odd and upright and eventoned selfdenunciation rendered it impossible to think of inflicting he knew likewise that a whole history was being narrated to him and that although the other two listeners manifestly did not approve it they expected him to show some tolerance to the speaker he said once robert do me the favour to look about outside for t other robert answered him that the man was far away by this time the farmer suggested that he might be waiting to say his word presently dont you know youve been dealing with a villain sir cried robert throw ever so little light upon one of that breed and they skulk in a hurry mr fleming for the sake of your honour dont mention him again what youre asked to do now is to bury the thoughts of him he righted my daughter when there was shame on her the farmer replied that was the idea printed simply on his understanding for edward to hear it was worse than a scourging with rods he bore it telling the last vitality of his pride to sleep and comforting himself with the drowsy sensuous expectation that he was soon to press the hand of his lost one his beloved who was in the house breathing the same air with him was perhaps in the room above perhaps sitting impatiently with clasped fingers waiting for the signal to unlock them and fling them open he could imagine the damp touch of very expectant fingers the dying look of lifedrinking eyes and oh the helplessness of her limbs as she sat buoying a heart drowned in bliss it was unknown to him that the peril of her uttermost misery had been so imminent and the picture conjured of her in his mind was that of a gentle but troubled facea soul afflicted yet hoping because it had been told to hope and half conscious that a rescue almost divine in its suddenness and unexpectedness and its perfect clearing away of all shadows approached manifestly by the pallid cast of his visage he had tasted shrewd and wasting grief of late roberts heart melted as he beheld the change in edward i believe mr blancove im a little to blame he said perhaps when i behaved so badly down at fairly you may have thought she sent me and it set your heart against her for a time i can just understand how it might edward thought for a moment and conscientiously accepted the suggestion for standing under that roof with her whom he loved near him it was absolutely out of his power for him to comprehend that his wish to break from dahlia and the measures he had taken or consented to had sprung from his own unassisted temporary baseness then robert spoke to the farmer rhoda could hear roberts words her fear was that dahlia might hear them too his pleading for edward was so hearty yet why should i always think differently from robert she asked herself and with that excuse for changeing partially thawed she was very anxious for her fathers reply and it was late in coming she felt that he was unconvinced but suddenly the door opened and the farmer called into the darkness dahlia down here previously emotionless an emotion was started in rhodas bosom by the command and it was gladness she ran up and knocked and found herself crying out he is hereedward but there came no answer edward is here come come and see him still not one faint reply dahlia dahlia the call of dahlias name seemed to travel endlessly on rhoda knelt and putting her mouth to the door said my darling i know you will reply to me i know you do not doubt me now listen you are to come down to happiness the silence grew heavier and now a doubt came shrieking through her soul father rang her outcry the father came and then the lover came and neither to father nor to lover was there any word from dahlias voice she was found by the side of the bed inanimate and pale as a sister of death but you who may have cared for her through her many tribulations have no fear for this gentle heart it was near the worst yet not the worst chapter xlvii up to the black gates but not beyond them the dawn following such a night will seem more like a daughter of the night than promise of day it is day that follows notwithstanding the sad fair girl survived and her flickering life was the sole light of the household at times burying its members in dusk to shine on them again more like a prolonged farewell than a gladsome restoration she was saved by what we call chance for it had not been in her design to save herself the hand was firm to help her to the deadly draught as far as could be conjectured she had drunk it between hurried readings from her mothers bible the one true companion to which she had often clung always halfavailingly the bible was found by her side as if it had fallen from the chair before which she knelt to read her last quickening verses and had fallen with her one arm was about it one grasped the broken phial with its hideous label it was uncomplainingly registered among the few facts very distinctly legible in master gammons memory that for three entire weeks he had no dumplings for dinner at the farm and although upon a computation articles of that description amounting probably to sixtythree if there is any need for our being precise were due to him and would necessarily be for evermore due to him seeing that it is beyond all human and even spiritual agency to make good unto man the dinner he has lost master gammon uttered no word to show that he was sensible of a slight which was the only indication given by him of his knowledge of a calamity having changed the order of things at the farm on the day when dumplings reappeared he remarked with a glance at the ceiling goin on bettereh marm oh mas gammon mrs sumfit burst out if i was only certain you said your prayers faithful every night the observation was apparently taken by master gammon to express one of the mere emotions within her bosom for he did not reply to it she watched him feeding in his steady way with the patient bent back and slowly chopping old grey jaws and struck by a pathos in the sight exclaimed weve all been searched so mas gammon i feel i know everything thats in me id say i couldnt ha given you dumplins and tears but think of our wickedness when i confess to you i did feel spiteful at you to think that you were wiltin to eat the dumplins while all of us mourned and rocked as in a quake expecting the worst to befall and that made me refuse them to you it was cruel of me and well may you shake your head if i was only sure you said your prayers the meaning in her aroused heart was that if she could be sure master gammon said his prayers so as to be searched all through by them as she was herself and to feel thereby as she did that he knew everything that was within him she would then in admiration of his profound equanimity acknowledge him to be a superior christian naturally enough master gammon allowed the interjection to pass regarding it as simply a vagrant action of the engine of speech while mrs sumfit with an interjectors consciousness of prodigious things implied which were not in any degree comprehended left his presence in kindness and with a shade less of the sense that he was a superior christian nevertheless the sight of master gammon was like a comforting medicine to all who were in the house he was mrs sumfits clock he was balm and blessedness in rhodas eyes anthony was jealous of him the farmer held to him as to a stake in the ground even robert who rallied and tormented and was vexed by him admitted that he stood some way between an example and a warning and was a study the grand primaeval quality of unchangeableness as exhibited by this old man affected them singularly in their recovery from the storm and the wreck of the hours gone by so much so that they could not divest themselves of the idea that it was a manifestation of power in master gammon to show forth undisturbed while they were feeling their life shaken in them to the depths i have never had the opportunity of examining the idolworshipping mind of a savage but it seems possible that the immutability of aspect of his little wooden god may sometimes touch him with a similar astounded aweeven when and indeed especially after he has thrashed it had the old man betrayed his mortality in a sign of curiosity to know why the hubbub of trouble had arisen and who was to blame and what was the story the effect on them would have been diminished he really seemed granite among the turbulent waves give me gammons life was farmer flemings prayerful interjection seeing him come and go sit at his meals and sleep and wake in season all through those tragic hours of suspense without a question to anybody once or twice when his eye fell upon the doctor master gammon appeared to meditate he observed that the doctor had never been called in to one of his family and it was evident that he did not understand the complication of things which rendered the doctors visit necessary youll never live so long as that old man the farmer said to robert no but when he goes all of hims gone robert answered but gammons got the wisdom to keep himself safe robert theres no one to blame for his wrinkles gammons a sheepskin old time writes his nothings on said robert hes safesafe enough an old hulk doesnt very easily manage to founder in the mud and gammons been lying on the mud all his life let that be how t will returned the farmer ive had days o mortal envy of that old man well its whether you prefer being the fiddle or the fiddlecase quoth robert of anthony the farmer no longer had any envy in him though he was as passive as master gammon the farmer beheld merely a stupefied old man and not a steady machine he knew that some queer misfortune had befallen anthony hell find im brotherly said mr fleming but anthony had darkened his golden horizon for him and was no longer an attractive object to his vision upon an autumn afternoon dahlia looking like a pale spring flower came down among them she told her sister that it was her wish to see edward rhoda had lost all power of will even if she had desired to keep them asunder she mentioned dahlias wish to her father who at once went for his hat and said dress yourself neat my lass she knew what was meant by that remark messages daily had been coming down from the hall but the rule of a discerning lady was then established there and rhoda had been spared a visit from either edward or algernon though she knew them to be at hand during dahlias convalescence the farmer had not spoken to rhoda of her engagement to the young squire the great misery intervening seemed in her mind to have cancelled all earthly engagements and when he said that she must use care in her attire he suddenly revived a dread within her bosom as if he had plucked her to the verge of a chasm but mrs lovells delicacy was still manifest edward came alone and he and dahlia were left apart there was no need to ask for pardon from those gentle eyes they joined hands she was wasted and very weak but she did not tremble passion was extinguished he refrained from speaking of their union feeling sure that they were united it required that he should see her to know fully the sinner he had been wasted though she was he was ready to make her his own if only for the sake of making amends to this dear fair soul whose picture of saint was impressed on him first as a response to the world wondering at his sacrifice of himself and next by degrees as an absolute visible fleshly fact she had come out of her martyrdom stamped with the heavenly signmark those are the old trees i used to speak of she said pointing to the two pines in the millers grounds they always look like adam and eve turning away they do not make you unhappy to see them dahlia i hope to see them till i am gone edward pressed her fingers he thought that warmer hopes would soon flow into her the neighbours are kind he asked very kind they inquire after me daily his cheeks reddened he had spoken at random and he wondered that dahlia should feel it pleasurable to be inquired after she who was so sensitive the clergyman sits with me every day and knows my heart she added the clergyman is a comfort to women said edward dahlia looked at him gently the round of her thin eyelids dwelt on him she wished she dared not speak her wish to one whose remembered mastery in words forbade her poor speechlessness but god would hear her prayers for him edward begged that he might come to her often and she said come he misinterpreted the readiness of the invitation when he had left her he reflected on the absence of all endearing epithets in her speech and missed them having himself suffered he required them for what had she wrestled so sharply with death if not to fall upon his bosom and be his in a great outpouring of gladness in fact he craved the immediate reward for his public acknowledgement of his misdeeds he walked in this neighbourhood known by what he had done and his desire was to take his wife away never more to be seen there following so deep a darkness he wanted at least a cheerful dawn not one of a penitential greynot a hooded dawn as if the paths of life were to be under cloistral arches and he wanted a rose of womanhood in his hand like that he had parted with and to recover which he had endured every earthly mortification even to absolute abasement the frail bent lily seemed a stranger to him can a man go farther than his nature never when he takes passion on board by other means his nature may be enlarged and nerved but passion will find his weakness and while urging him on will constantly betray him at that point edward had three interviews with dahlia he wrote to her as many times there was but one answer for him and when he ceased to charge her with unforgivingness he came to the strange conclusion that beyond our calling of a woman a saint for rhetorical purposes and esteeming her as one for pictorial it is indeed possible as he had slightly discerned in this womans presence both to think her saintly and to have the sentiments inspired by the overearthly in her person her voice her simple words of writing her gentle resolve all issuing of a capacity to suffer evil and pardon it conveyed that character to a mind not soft for receiving such impressions chapter xlviii major waring came to wrexby hall at the close of the october month he came to plead his own cause with mrs lovell but she stopped him by telling him that his friend robert was in some danger of losing his love she is a woman percy i anticipate your observation but more than that she believes she is obliged to give her hand to my cousin the squire its an intricate story relating to money she does not care for algy a bit which is not a matter that greatly influences him he has served her in some mysterious way by relieving an old uncle of hers algy has got him the office of village postman for this district i believe if its that but i think it should be more to justify her at all events she seems to consider that her hand is pledged you know the kind of girl your friend fancies besides her father insists she is to marry the squire which is certainly the most natural thing of all so dont you think dear percy you had better take your friend on the continent for some weeks i never i confess exactly understood the intimacy existing between you but it must be sincere are you said percy yes perfectly but always in a roundabout way why do you ask me in this instance because you could stop this silly business in a day i know i could then why do you not because of a wish to be sincere percy i have been that throughout if you could read me i tried to deliver my cousin edward from what i thought was a wretched entanglement his selfish falseness offended me and i let him know that i despised him when i found that he was a man who had courage and some heart he gained my friendship once more and i served him as far as i couldhappily as it chanced i tell you all this because i dont care to forfeit your esteem and heaven knows i may want it in the days to come i believe i am the best friend in the worldand bad anything else no one perfectly pleases me not even you you are too studious of character and like myself exacting of perfection in one or two points but now hear what i have done and approve it if you think fit i have flirtedabominable wordi am compelled to use the language of the missesyes i have flirted with my cousin algy i do it too well i knowby nature and i hate it he has this morning sent a letter down to the farm saying that as he believes he has failed in securing rhodas affections he renounces all pretensions etc subject to her wishes etc the courting i imagine can scarcely have been pleasant to him my delightful manner with him during the last fortnight has been infinitely pleasanter so your friend robert may be made happy byandby that is to say if his rhoda is not too like her sex youre an enchantress exclaimed percy stop said she and drifted into seriousness before you praise me you must know more percy that duel in india he put out his hand to her yes i forgive she resumed you were cruel then remember that and try to be just now the poor boy would go to his doom i could have arrested it i partly caused it i thought the honour of the army at stake i was to blame on that day and i am to blame again but i feel that i am almost excuseable if you are not too harsh a judge no i am not i am execrable but forgive me percys face lighted up in horrified amazement as margaret lovell unfastened the brooch at her neck and took out the dullred handkerchief it was the bond between us she pursued that i was to return this to you when i no longer remained my own mistress count me a miserably heartless woman i do my best you brought this handkerchief to me dipped in the blood of the poor boy who was slain i have worn it it was a safeguard did you mean it to serve as such oh percy i felt continually that blood was on my bosom i felt it fighting with me it has saved me from much and now i return it to you he could barely articulate why dear friend by the reading of the bond you should know i asked you when i was leaving india how long i was to keep it by me you said till you marry do not be vehement percy this is a thing that could not have been averted is it possible percy cried that you carried the play out so far as to promise him to marry him your forehead is thunder percy i know that look margaret i think i could bear to see our army suffer another defeat rather than you should be contemptible your chastisement is not given in half measures percy speak on said he there is more to come you are engaged to marry him i engaged that i would take the name of blancove if he would cease to persecute rhoda fleming the stipulation was exactly in those words you mean to carry it out to be sincere i do percy you mean to marry algernon blancove i should be contemptible indeed if i did percy you do not i do not and you are sincere by all the powers of earth and heaven theres no madness like dealing with an animated enigma what is it you do mean as i saidto be sincere but i was also bound to be of service to your friend it is easy to be sincere and passive percy struck his brows can you mean that edward blancove is the man oh no edward will never marry any one i do him the justice to say that his vice is not that of unfaithfulness he had but one love and her heart is quite dead there is no marriage for himshe refuses you may not understand the why of that but women will she would marry him if she could bring herself to itthe truth is he killed her pride her taste for life has gone she is bent on her sisters marrying your friend she has no other thought of marriage and never will have i know the state it is not much unlike mine waring fixed her eyes there is a man yes she answered bluntly it is somebody then whose bankers account is i hope satisfactory yes percy she looked eagerly forward as thanking him for releasing her from a difficulty you still can use the whip but i do not feel the sting i marry a bankers account do you bear in mind the day i sent after you in the park i had just heard that i was ruined you know my mania for betting i heard it and knew when i let my heart warm to you that i could never marry you that is one reason perhaps why i have been an enigma i am sincere in telling algy i shall take the name of blancove i marry the banker now take this old gift of yours percy grasped the handkerchief and quitted her presence forthwith feeling that he had swallowed a dose of the sex to serve him for a lifetime yet he lived to reflect on her having decided practically perhaps wisely for all parties her debts expunged she became an old gentlemans demure young wife a sweet hostess and as ever a true friend something of a miracle to one who had inclined to make a heroine of her while imagining himself to accurately estimate her deficiencies honourably by this marriage the lady paid for such wild oats as she had sown in youth there were joybells for robert and rhoda but none for dahlia and edward dahlia lived seven years her sisters housemate nurse of the growing swarm she had gone through fire as few women have done in like manner to leave their hearts among the ashes but with that human heart she left regrets behind her the soul of this young creature filled its place it shone in her eyes and in her work a lamp to her little neighbourhood and not less a lamp of cheerful beams for one day being as another to her in truth she sat above the clouds when she died she relinquished nothing others knew the loss between her and robert there was deeper community on one subject than she let rhoda share almost her last words to him spoken calmly but with the quaver of breath resembling sobs were help poor girls etext editors bookmarks you who may have cared for her through her many tribulations have no fear can a man go farther than his nature cold curiosity found by the side of the bed inanimate and pale as a sister of death sinners are not to repent only in words so long as we do not know that we are performing any remarkable feat there were joybells for robert and rhoda but none for dahlia
