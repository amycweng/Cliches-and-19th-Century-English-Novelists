great halldoors squire beltham was master there the other members of the household were his daughter dorothy beltham a married daughter mrs richmond benjamin sewis an old halfcaste butler various domestic servants and a little boy christened harry lepel richmond the squires grandson riversley grange lay in a rich watered hollow of the hampshire heathcountry a lonely circle of enclosed brook and pasture within view of some of its dependent farms but out of hail of them or any dwelling except the stables and the headgardeners cottage traditions of audacious highwaymen together with the gloomy surrounding firscenery kept it alive to fears of solitude and the night and there was that in the determined violence of the knocks and repeated bellpeals which assured all those who had ever listened in the servants hall to prognostications of a possible night attack that the robbers had come at last most awfully a crowd of maids gathered along the upper corridor of the main body of the building two or three footmen hung lower down bold in attitude suddenly the noise ended and soon after the voice of old sewis commanded them to scatter away to their beds whereupon the footmen took agile leaps to the post of danger while the women in whose bosoms intense curiosity now supplanted terror proceeded to a vacant room overlooking the front entrance and spied from the window meanwhile sewis stood by his masters bedside the squire was a hunter of the old sort a hard rider deep drinker and heavy slumberer before venturing to shake his arm sewis struck a light and flashed it over the squires eyelids to make the task of rousing him easier at the first touch the squire sprang up swearing by his lord harry he had just dreamed of fire and muttering of buckets sewis youre the man are you where has it broken out no sir no fire said sewis you be cool sir cool sir confound it sewis havent i heard a whole town of steeples at work i dont sleep so thick but i can hear you dog fellow comes here gives me a start tells me to be cool what the deuce nobody hurt then all right the squire had fallen back on his pillow and was relapsing to sleep sewis spoke impressively theres a gentleman downstairs a gentleman downstairs sir he has come rather late gentleman downstairs come rather late the squire recapitulated the intelligence to possess it thoroughly rather late eh oh shove him into a bed and give him hot brandy and water and be hanged to him sewis had the office of tempering a severely distasteful announcement to the squire he resumed the gentleman doesnt talk of staying that is not his business its rather late for him to arrive rather late roared the squire why whats it oclock reaching a hand to the watch over his head he caught sight of the unearthly hour a quarter to two gentleman downstairs cant be that infernal apothecary who broke s engagement to dine with me last night by george if it is ill souse him ill drench him from head to heel as though the rascal d been drawn through the duckpond two oclock in the morning why the mans drunk tell him im a magistrate and ill commit him deuce take him give him fourteen days for a sot another fourteen for impudence ive given a month fore now comes to me a justice of the peacemans mad tell him hes in peril of a lunatic asylum and doesnt talk of staying lift him out o the house on the top o your boot sewis and say its mine youve my leave sewis withdrew a step from the bedside at a safe distance he fronted his master steadily almost admonishingly its mr richmond sir he said mr the squire checked his breath that was a name never uttered at the grange the scoundrel he inquired harshly half in a tone of one assuring himself and his rigid dropped jaw shut the fact had to be denied or affirmed instantly and sewis was silent grasping his bedclothes in a lump the squire cried downstairs downstairs sewis youve admitted him into my house no sir you have he is not in the house sir you have how did you speak to him then out of my window sir what place here is the scoundrel soiling now he is on the doorstep outside the house outside is he and the doors locked yes sir let him rot there by this time the midnight visitors patience had become exhausted a renewal of his clamour for immediate attention fell on the squires ear amazing him to stupefaction at such challengeing insolence hand me my breeches he called to sewis i cant think brisk out of my breeches sewis held the garment ready the squire jumped from the bed fuming speechlessly chafing at gaiters and braces cravat and coat and allowed his buttons to be fitted neatly on his calves the hammering at the halldoor and plucking at the bell going on without intermission he wore the aspect of one who assumes a forced composure under the infliction of outrages on his character in a court of law where he must of necessity listen and lock his boiling replies within his indignant bosom now sewis now my horsewhip he remarked as if it had been a simple adjunct of his equipment your hat sir my horsewhip i said your hat is in the hall sewis observed gravely i asked you for my horsewhip that is not to be found anywhere said sewis the squire was diverted from his objurgations against this piece of servitorial defiance by his daughter dorothys timid appeal for permission to come in sewis left the room presently the squire descended fully clad and breathing sharply from his nostrils servants were warned off out of hearing none but sewis stood by the squire himself unbolted the door and threw it open to the limit of the chain whos there he demanded a response followed promptly from outside i take you to be mr harry lepel beltham correct me if i err accept my apologies for disturbing you at a late hour of the night i pray your name is plain augustus fitzgeorge roy richmond at this moment mr beltham you will recognize me better by opening your door entirely voices are deceptive you were born a gentleman mr beltham and will not reduce me to request you to behave like one i am now in the position as it were of addressing a badger in his den it is on both sides unsatisfactory it reflects egregious discredit upon you the householder the squire hastily bade sewis see that the passages to the sleeping apartments were barred and flung the great chain loose he was acting under strong control of his temper it was a quiet grey night and as the doors flew open a largelybuilt man dressed in a highcollared greatcoat and fashionable hat of the time stood clearly defined to view he carried a light cane with the point of the silver handle against his under lip there was nothing formidable in his appearance and his manner was affectedly affable he lifted his hat as soon as he found himself face to face with the squire disclosing a partially bald head though his whiskering was luxuriant and a robust condition of manhood was indicated by his erect attitude and the immense swell of his furred greatcoat at the chest his features were exceedingly frank and cheerful from his superior height he was enabled to look down quite royally on the man whose repose he had disturbed the following conversation passed between them you now behold who it is mr beltham that acknowledges to the misfortune of arousing you at an unseemly hourunbetimes as our gossips in mother saxon might sayand with profound regret sir though my habit is to take it lightly have you any accomplices lurking about here i am alone whats your business i have no business you have no business to be here no i ask you whats the object of your visit permit me first to speak of the cause of my protracted arrival sir the ridicule of casting it on the postboys will strike you mr beltham as it does me nevertheless i must do it i have no resource owing to a rascal of the genus incontinent in liquor i have this night walked seven miles from ewling my complaint against him is not on my own account what brought you here at all can you ask me i ask you what brought you to my house at all true i might have slept at ewling why didnt you for the reason mr beltham which brought me here originally i could not waitnot a single minute so far advanced to the neighbourhood i would not be retarded and i came on i crave your excuses for the hour of my arrival the grounds for my coming at all you will very well understand and you will applaud me when i declare to you that i come to her penitent to exculpate myself certainly but despising selfjustification i love my wife mr beltham yes hear me out sir i can point to my unhappy star and say blame that more than me that star of my birth and most disastrous fortunes should plead on my behalf to you to my wife at least it will youve come to see my daughter marian have you my wife sir you dont cross my threshold while i live you compel her to come out to me she stays where she is poor wretch till the grave takes her youve done your worst be off mr beltham i am not to be restrained from the sight of my wife scamp by no scurrilous epithets from a man i am bound to respect will i be deterred or exasperated damned scamp i say the squire having exploded his wrath gave it free way ive stopped my tongue all this while before a scoundrel d corkscrew the bestbottled temper right or left go where you will one end o the world to the other by god and heres a scoundrel stinks of villany and ive proclaimed him ware my gates as a common trespasser and deserves hanging if ever rook did nailed hard and fast to my barn doors comes here for my daughter when he got her by stealing her scenting his carcase and talking bout his birth singing what not sort o foreign mewin stuff and she found him out a liar and a beast by god and she turned home my doors are open to my flesh and blood and here she halts i say gainst the law if the laws against me shes crazed youve made her mad she knows none of us not even her boy be off youve done your worst the lights gone clean out in her and hear me you richmond or roy or whatever you call yourself i tell you i thank the lord she has lost her senses see her or not youve no hold on her and see her you shant while i go by the name of a man mr richmond succeeded in preserving an air of serious deliberation under the torrent of this tremendous outburst which was marked by scarce a pause in the delivery he said my wife deranged i might presume it too truly an inherited disease do you trifle with me sir her reason unseated and can you pretend to the right of dividing us if this be as you sayoh ten thousand times the stronger my claim my absolute claim to cherish her make way for me mr beltham i solicit humbly the holiest privilege sorrow can crave of humanity my wife my wife make way for me sir his figure was bent to advance the squire shouted an order to sewis to run round to the stables and slip the dogs loose is it your final decision mr richmond asked damn your fine words yes it is i keep my flock clear of a foul sheep mr beltham i implore you be merciful i submit to any conditions only let me see her i will walk the park till morning but say that an interview shall be granted in the morning frankly sir it is not my intention to employ force i throw myself utterly on your mercy i love the woman i have much to repent of i see her and i go but once i must see her so far i also speak positively speak as positively as you like said the squire by the laws of nature and the laws of man marian richmond is mine to support and comfort and none can hinder me mr beltham none if i resolve to take her to myself cant they said the squire a curse be on him heavens lightnings descend on him who keeps husband from wife in calamity the squire whistled for his dogs as if wounded to the quick by this coldblooded action mr richmond stood to his fullest height nor sir on my application during tomorrows daylight shall i see her nor sir on your applicationthe squire drawled in uncontrollable mimicking contempt of the others florid forms of speech ending in his own styleno you wont you claim a paternal right to refuse me my wife is your child good i wish to see my son on that point the squire was equally decided you cant hes asleep i insist nonsense i tell you hes abed and asleep i repeat i insist when the boys fast asleep man the boy is my flesh and blood you have spoken for your daughteri speak for my son i will see him though i have to batter at your doors till sunrise some minutes later the boy was taken out of his bed by his aunt dorothy who dressed him by the dark windowlight crying bitterly while she said hush hush and fastened on his small garments between tender huggings of his body and kissings of his cheeks he was told that he had nothing to be afraid of a gentleman wanted to see him nothing more whether the gentleman was a good gentleman and not a robber he could not learn but his aunt dorothy having wrapped him warm in shawl and comforter and tremblingly tied his hatstrings under his chin assured him with convulsive caresses that it would soon be over and he would soon be lying again snug and happy in his dear little bed she handed him to sewis on the stairs keeping his fingers for an instant to kiss them after which old sewis the lord of the pantry where all sweet things were stored deposited him on the floor of the hall and he found himself facing the man of the night it appeared to him that the stranger was of enormous size like the giants of fairy books for as he stood a little out of the doorway there was a peep of night sky and trees behind him and the trees looked very much smaller and hardly any sky was to be seen except over his shoulders the squire seized one of the boys hands to present him and retain him at the same time but the stranger plucked him from his grandfathers hold and swinging him high exclaimed here he is this is harry richmond he has grown a grenadier kiss the little chap and back to bed with him growled the squire the boy was heartily kissed and asked if he had forgotten his papa he replied that he had no papa he had a mama and a grandpapa the stranger gave a deep groan you see what you have done you have cut me off from my own he said terribly to the squire but tried immediately to soothe the urchin with nursery talk and the pats on the shoulder which encourage a little boy to grow fast and tall four years of separation he resumed and my son taught to think that he has no father by heavens it is infamous it is a curst piece of inhumanity mr beltham if i do not see my wife i carry off my son you may ask till youre hoarse you shall never see her in this house while i am here to command said the squire very well then harry richmond changes homes i take him the affair is concluded you take him from his mother the squire sang out you swear to me she has lost her wits she cannot suffer i can i shall not expect from you mr beltham the minutest particle of comprehension of a fathers feelings you are earthy you are an animal the squire saw that he was about to lift the boy and said stop never mind that stop look at the case you can call again tomorrow and you can see me and talk it over shall i see my wife no you shant you remain faithful to your word sir do you i do then i do similarly what stop not to take a child like that out of a comfortable house at night in winter man oh the night is temperate and warm he shall not remain in a house where his father is dishonoured stop not a bit of it cried the squire no one speaks of you i give you my word youre never mentioned by man woman or child in the house silence concerning a father insinuates dishonour mr beltham damn your fine speeches and keep your blackguardly hands off that boy the squire thundered mind if you take him he goes for good he doesnt get a penny from me if you have the bringing of him up youve done for him if you decide that way he may stand here a beggar in a stolen coat like you and i wont own him here harry come to me come to your grandad mr richmond caught the boy just when he was turning to run that gentleman he said pointing to the squire is your grandpapa i am your papa you must learn at any cost to know and love your papa if i call for you tomorrow or next day they will have played tricks with harry richmond and hid him mr beltham i request you for the final time to accord me your promise observe i accept your promisethat i shall at my demand tomorrow or the next day obtain an interview with my wife the squire coughed out an emphatic never and fortified it with an oath as he repeated it upon a fuller breath sir i will condescend to entreat you to grant this permission said mr richmond urgently no never i wont rejoined the squire red in the face from a fit of angry coughing i wont but stop put down that boy listen to me you richmond ill tell you what ill do illif you swear on a bible like a cadger before a bench of magistrates youll never show your face within a circuit o ten miles hereabouts and wont trouble the boy if you meet him or my daughter or me or any one of ushark ye ill do this let go the boy and ill give ye five hundredill give ye a cheque on my banker for a thousand pounds and hark me out you do this you swear as i said on the servants bible in the presence of my butler and me strike you dead as ananias and t other one if you

property if not every bit of it is it a bargain will you swear dont and the boys a beggar hes a stranger here as much as you take him and by the lord you ruin him there now never mind stay down with him hes got a cold already ought to be in his bed let the boy down you offer me money mr richmond answered that is one of the indignities belonging to a connection with a man like you you would have me sell my son to see my afflicted wife i would forfeit my hearts yearnings for my son your money sir i toss to the winds and i am under the necessity of informing you that i despise and loathe you i shrink from the thought of exposing my son to your besotted selfish example the boy is mine i have him and he shall traverse the wilderness with me by heaven his destiny is brilliant he shall be hailed for what he is the rightful claimant of a place among the proudest in the land and mark me mr beltham obstinate sensual old man that you are i take the boy and i consecrate my life to the duty of establishing him in his proper rank and station and there if you live and i live you shall behold him and bow your grovelling pigs head to the earth and bemoan the day by heaven when youa common country squire a man of no origin a creature with whose blood we have mixed oursand he is stoneblind to the honour conferred on himwhen you in your besotted stupidity threatened to disinherit harry richmond the door slammed violently on such further speech as he had in him to utter he seemed at first astonished but finding the terrified boy about to sob he drew a pretty box from one of his pockets and thrust a delicious sweetmeat between the whimpering lips then after some moments of irresolution during which he struck his chest soundingly and gazed down talked alternately to himself and the boy and cast his eyes along the windows of the house he at last dropped on one knee and swaddled the boy in the folds of the shawl raising him in a businesslike way he settled him on an arm and stepped briskly across gravelwalk and lawn like a horse to whose neck a smart touch of the whip has been applied the soft mild night had a moon behind it somewhere and here and there a lightblue space of sky showed small rayless stars the breeze smelt fresh of roots and heath it was more a maynight than one of february so strange an aspect had all these quiet hilllines and larch and firtree tops in the halfdark stillness that the boys terrors were overlaid and almost subdued by his wonderment he had never before been out in the night and he must have feared to cry in it for his sobs were not loud on a rise of the parkroad where a firplantation began he heard his name called faintly from the house by a womans voice that he knew to be his aunt dorothys it came after him only once harry richmond but he was soon out of hearing beyond the park among the hollows that run dipping for miles beside the great highroad toward london sometimes his father whistled to him or held him high and nodded a salutation to him as though they had just discovered one another and his perpetual accessibility to the influences of spicy sugarplums notwithstanding his grief caused his father to prognosticate hopefully of his future wisdom so when obedient to command he had given his father a kiss the boy fell asleep on his shoulder ceasing to know that he was a wandering infant and if i remember rightly he dreamed he was in a ship of cinnamonwood upon a sea that rolled mighty but smooth immense broad waves and tore thing from thing without a sound or a hurt chapter ii an adventure on my own account that night stands up without any clear traces about it or near it like the brazen castle of romance round which the seatide flows my father must have borne me miles along the road he must have procured food for me i have an idea of feeling a damp forehead and drinking new milk and byandby hearing a roar of voices or vehicles and seeing a dog that went alone through crowded streets without a master doing as he pleased and stopping every other dog he met he took his turning and my father and i took ours we were in a house that to my senses had the smell of dark corners in a street where all the housedoors were painted black and shut with a bang italian organmen and milkmen paraded the street regularly and made it sound hollow to their music milk and no cows anywhere numbers of people and no acquaintances among them my thoughts were occupied by the singularity of such things my father could soon make me forget that i was transplanted he could act dog tame rabbit fox pony and a whole nursery collection alive but he was sometimes absent for days and i was not of a temper to be on friendly terms with those who were unable to captivate my imagination as he had done when he was at home i rode him all round the room and upstairs to bed i lashed him with a whip till he frightened me so real was his barking if i said menagerie he became a caravan of wild beasts i undid a button of his waistcoat and it was a lion that made a spring roaring at me i pulled his coattails and off i went tugging at an old bear that swung a hind leg as he turned in the queerest way and then sat up and beating his breast sent out a mewmoan our room was richer to me than all the grange while these performances were going forward his monkey was almost as wonderful as his bear only he was too big for it and was obliged to aim at reality in his representation of this animal by means of a number of breakages a defect that brought our landlady on the scene the enchantment of my fathers companionship caused me to suffer proportionately in his absence during that period of solitude my nursemaid had to order me to play and i would stumble about and squat in the middle of the floor struck suddenly by the marvel of the difference between my present and my other home my father entered into arrangements with a punch and judy man for him to pay me regular morning visits opposite our window yet here again his genius defeated his kind intentions for happening once to stand by my side during the progress of the show he made it so vivid to me by what he said and did that i saw no fun in it without him i used to dread the heralding crow of punch if he was away and cared no longer for wooden heads being knocked ever so hard on sundays we walked to the cathedral and this was a day with a delight of its own for me he was never away on the sunday both of us attired in our best we walked along the streets hand in hand my father led me before the cathedral monuments talking in a low tone of british victories and commending the heroes to my undivided attention i understood very early that it was my duty to imitate them while we remained in the cathedral he talked of glory and old england and dropped his voice in the middle of a murmured chant to introduce nelsons name or some other great mans and this recurred regularly what are we for now he would ask me as we left our house i had to decide whether we took a hero or an author which i soon learnt to do with capricious resolution we were one sunday for shakespeare another for nelson or pitt nelson papa was my most frequent rejoinder and he never dissented but turned his steps toward nelsons cathedral dome and uncovered his head there and said nelson then today and we went straight to his monument to perform the act of homage i chose nelson in preference to the others because near bedtime in the evening my father told me stories of our hero of the day and neither pitt nor shakespeare lost an eye or an arm or fought with a huge white bear on the ice to make himself interesting i named them occasionally out of compassion and to please my father who said that they ought to have a turn they were he told me in the habit of paying him a visit whenever i had particularly neglected them to learn the grounds for my disregard of their claims and they urged him to intercede with me and imparted many of their unpublished adventures so that i should be tempted to give them a chance on the following sunday great will my father called shakespeare and slender billy pitt the scene where great will killed the deer dragging falstaff all over the park after it by the light of bardolphs nose upon which they put an extinguisher if they heard any of the keepers and so left everybody groping about and catching the wrong person was the most wonderful mixture of fun and tears great will was extremely youthful but everybody in the park called him father william and when he wanted to know which way the deer had gone king lear or else my memory deceives me punned and lady macbeth waved a handkerchief for it to be steeped in the blood of the deer shylock ordered one pound of the carcase hamlet the fact was impressed on me offered him a threelegged stool and a number of kings and knights and ladies lit their torches from bardolph and away they flew distracting the keepers and leaving will and his troop to the deer that poor thing died from a different weapon at each recital though always with a flow of blood and a successful dash of his antlers into falstaff and to hear falstaff bellow but it was mournful to hear how sorry great will was over the animal he had slain he spoke like music i found it pathetic in spite of my knowing that the whole scene was lighted up by bardolphs nose when i was just bursting out cryingfor the deers tongue was lolling out and quick pantings were at his side he had little ones at homegreat will remembered his engagement to sell shylock a pound of the carcase determined that no jew should eat of it he bethought him that falstaff could well spare a pound and he said the jew would not see the difference falstaff only got off by hard running and roaring out that he knew his unclean life would make him taste like pork and thus let the jew into the trick my father related all this with such a veritable matteroffact air and such livelinesshe sounded the chase and its cries and showed king lear tottering and hamlet standing dark and the vast substance of falstaffthat i followed the incidents excitedly and really saw them which was better than understanding them i required some help from him to see that hamlets offer of a threelegged stool at a feverish moment of the chase was laughable he taught me what to think of it by pitching great wills voice high and hamlets very low by degrees i got some unconscious knowledge of the characters of shakespeare there never was so fascinating a father as mine for a boy anything under eight or ten years old he could guess on saturday whether i should name william pitt on the sunday for on those occasions slender billy as i hope i am not irreverent in calling him made up for the dulness of his high career with a raspberryjam tart for which my father told me solemnly the illustrious minister had in his day a passion if i named him my father would say w p otherwise s b was born in the year soandso now and he went to the cupboard in the name of politics take this and meditate upon him the shops being all shut on sunday he certainly bought it anticipating me unerringly on the saturday and as soon as the tart appeared we both shouted i fancy i remember his repeating a couplet billy pitt took a cake and a raspberry jam when he heard they had taken seringapatam at any rate the rumour of his having done so at periods of strong excitement led to the inexplicable display of foresight on my fathers part my meditations upon pitt were under this influence favourable to the post of a prime minister but it was merely appetite that induced me to choose him i never could imagine a grandeur in his office notwithstanding my fathers eloquent talk of ruling a realm shepherding a people hurling british thunderbolts the days discipline was that its selected hero should reign the undisputed monarch of it so when i was for pitt i had my tart as he used to have it and no story for he had none and i think my idea of the ruler of a realm presented him to me as a sort of shadow about a pastrycooks shop but i surprised people by speaking of him i made remarks to our landlady which caused her to throw up her hands and exclaim that i was astonishing she would always add a mysterious word or two in the hearing of my nursemaid or any friend of hers who looked into my room to see me after my father had got me forward with instructions on the piano and exercises in early english history and the book of the peerage i became the wonder of the house i was put up on a stool to play in my cottage near a wood or cherry ripe and then to show the range of my accomplishments i was asked and who married the dowager duchess of dewlap and i answered john gregg wetherall esquire and disgraced the family then they asked me how i accounted for her behaviour it was because the duke married a dairymaid i replied always tossing up my chin at that my father had concocted the questions and prepared me for the responses but the effect was striking both upon his visitors and the landladys gradually my ear grew accustomed to her invariable whisper on these occasions blood rile she said and her friends all said no like the run of a finger down a fiddlestring a gentleman of his acquaintance called on him one evening to take him out for a walk my father happened to be playing with me when this gentleman entered our room and he jumped up from his hands and knees and abused him for intruding on his privacy but afterwards he introduced him to me as shylocks greatgreatgreatgrandson and said that shylock was satisfied with a pound and his descendant wanted two hundred pounds or else all his body and this he said came of the emigration of the family from venice to england my father only seemed angry for he went off with shylocks very great grandson arminarm exclaiming to the rialto when i told mrs waddy about the visitor she said oh dear oh dear then im afraid your sweet papa wont return very soon my pretty pet we waited a number of days until mrs waddy received a letter from him she came fulldressed into my room requesting me to give her twenty kisses for papa and i looked on while she arranged her blue bonnet at the glass the bonnet would not fix in its place at last she sank down crying in a chair and was all brown silk and said that how to appear before a parcel of dreadful men and perhaps a live duke into the bargain was more than she knew and more than could be expected of a lone widow woman not for worlds she answered my petition to accompany her she would not she said have me go to my papa there for anything on earth my papa would perish at the sight of me i was not even to wish to go and then she exclaimed oh the blessed childs poor papa and that people were cruel to him and would never take into account his lovely temper and that everybody was his enemy when he ought to be sitting with the highest in the land i had realized the extremity of my forlorn state on a sunday that passed empty of my father which felt like his having gone for ever my nursemaid came in to assist in settling mrs waddys bonnet above the six crisp curls and while they were about it i sat quiet plucking now and then at the brown silk partly to beg to go with it partly in jealousy and love at the thought of its seeing him from whom i was so awfully separated mrs waddy took fresh kisses off my lips assuring me that my father would have them in twenty minutes and i was to sit and count the time my nursemaid let her out i pretended to be absorbed in counting till i saw mrs waddy pass by the window my heart gave a leap of pain i found the streetdoor open and no one in the passage and i ran out thinking that mrs waddy would be obliged to take me if she discovered me by her side in the street i was by no means disconcerted at not seeing her immediately running on from one street to another i took the turnings with unhesitating boldness as if i had a destination in view i must have been out near an hour before i understood that mrs waddy had eluded me so i resolved to enjoy the shopwindows with the luxurious freedom of one whose speculations on those glorious things all up for show are no longer distracted by the run of time and a nursemaid little more than a glance was enough now that i knew i could stay as long as i liked if i stopped at all it was rather to exhibit the bravado of liberty than to distinguish any particular shop with my preference all were equally beautiful so were the carriages so were the people ladies frequently turned to look at me perhaps because i had no covering on my head but they did not interest me in the least i should have been willing to ask them or any one where the peerage lived only my mind was quite full and i did not care i felt sure that a great deal of walking would ultimately bring me to st pauls or westminster abbey to anything else i was indifferent toward sunset my frame was struck as with an arrow by the sensations of hunger on passing a cooksshop i faltered along hoping to reach a second one without knowing why i had dragged my limbs from the first there was a boy in ragged breeches no taller than myself standing tiptoe by the window of a very large and brilliant pastrycooks he persuaded me to go into the shop and ask for a cake i thought it perfectly natural to do so being hungry but when i reached the counter and felt the size of the shop i was abashed and had to repeat the nature of my petition twice to the young woman presiding there give you a cake little boy she said we dont give cakes we sell them because i am hungry said i pursuing my request another young woman came laughing and shaking lots of ringlets dont you see hes not a common boy he doesnt whine she remarked and handed me a stale bun saying here master charles and you neednt say thank you my name is harry richmond and i thank you very much i replied i heard her say as i went out you can see hes a gentlemans son the ragged boy was awaiting me eagerly gemini youre a lucky one he cried here come along curlypoll i believe that i meant to share the bun with him but of course he could not be aware of my beneficent intentions so he treated me as he thought i was for treating him and making one snatch at the bun ran off cramming it into his mouth i stood looking at any hand i learnt in that instant what thieving was and begging and hunger for i would have perished rather than have asked for another cake and as i yearned for it in absolute want of food the boys ungenerous treatment of me came down in a cloud on my reason i found myself being led through the crush of people by an old gentleman to whom i must have related an extraordinary rigmarole he shook his head saying that i was unintelligible but the questions he put to me why had i no hat on in the open streetwhere did my mother livewhat was i doing out alone in london were so many incitements to autobiographical composition to an infant mind and i tumbled out my history afresh each time that he spoke he led me into a square stooping his head to listen all the while but when i perceived that we had quitted the region of shops i made myself quite intelligible by stopping short and crying i am so hungry he nodded and said its no use crossexamining an empty stomach youll do me the favour to dine with me my little man well talk over your affairs byandby my alarm at having left the savoury street of shops was not soothed until i found myself sitting at table with him and a nice young lady and an old one who wore a cap and made loud remarks on my garments and everything i did i was introduced to them as the little boy dropped from the sky the old gentleman would not allow me to be questioned before i had eaten it was a memorable feast i had soup fish meat and pastry and for the first time in my life a glass of wine how they laughed to see me blink and cough after i had swallowed half the glass like water at once my tongue was unloosed i seemed to rise right above the roofs of london beneath which i had been but a wandering atom a few minutes ago i talked of my wonderful father and great will and pitt and the peerage i amazed them with my knowledge when i finished a long recital of great wills chase of the deer by saying that i did not care about politics i meant in my own mind that pitt was dull in comparison they laughed enormously as if i had fired them off do you know what you are sir said the old gentleman he had frowning eyebrows and a merry mouth youre a comical character i felt interested in him and asked him what he was he informed me that he was a lawyer and ready to be pantaloon to my clown if i would engage him are you in the peerage said i not yet he replied well then said i i know nothing about you the young lady screamed with laughter oh you funny little boy you killing little creature she said and coming round to me lifted me out of my chair and wanted to know if i knew how to kiss oh yes ive been taught that said i giving the salute without waiting for the invitation but i added i dont care about it much she was indignant and told me she was going to be offended so i let her understand that i liked being kissed and played with in the morning before i was up and if she would come to my house ever so early she would find me lying next the wall and ready for her and who lies outside she asked thats my papa i was beginning to say but broke the words with a sob for i seemed to be separated from him now by the sea itself they petted me tenderly my story was extracted by alternate leading questions from the old gentleman and timely caresses from the ladies i could tell them everything except the name of the street where i lived my midnight excursion from the house of my grandfather excited them chiefly also my having a mother alive who perpetually fanned her face and wore a balldress and a wreath things that i remembered of my mother the ladies observed that it was clear i was a romantic child i noticed that the old gentleman said humph very often and his eyebrows were like a rooks nest in a tree when i spoke of my father walking away with shylocks descendant and not since returning to me a big book was fetched out of his library in which he read my grandfathers name i heard him mention it aloud i had been placed on a stool beside a teatray near the fire and there i saw the old red house of riversley and my mother dressed in white and my aunt dorothy and they all complained that i had ceased to love them and must go to bed to which i had no objection somebody carried me up and undressed me and promised me a great game of kissing in the morning the next day in the strange house i heard that the old gentleman had sent one of his clerks down to my grandfather at riversley and communicated with the constables in london and byandby mrs waddy arrived having likewise visited those authorities one of whom supported her claims upon me but the old gentleman wished to keep me until his messenger returned from riversley he made all sorts of pretexts in the end he insisted on seeing my father and mrs waddy after much hesitation and even weeping furnished the address upon hearing which spoken aside to him he said i thought so mrs waddy entreated him to be respectful to my father who was she declared his superior and begging everybodys pardon present the superior of us all through no sin of his own that caused him to be so unfortunate and a real christian and pattern in spite of outsides though as true a gentleman as ever walked and by rights should be amongst the highest she repeated amongst the highest reprovingly with the ears of barley in her blue bonnet shaking and her hands clasped tight in her lap old mr bannerbridge that was the old gentlemans name came back very late from his visit to my father so late that he said it would be cruel to let me go out in the street after my bedtime mrs waddy consented to my remaining on the condition of my being surrendered to her at nine oclock and no later the following morning i was assured by mr bannerbridge that my fathers health and appetite were excellent he gave me a number of unsatisfying messages all the rest concerning his interview he whispered to his daughter and his sister miss bannerbridge who said they hoped they would have news from hampshire very early so that the poor child might be taken away by the friends of his infancy i could understand that my father was disapproved of by them and that i was a kind of shuttlecock flying between two battledores but why they pitied me i could not understand there was a great battle about me when mrs waddy appeared punctual to her appointed hour the victory was hers and i her prize passed a whole day in different conveyances the last of which landed us miles away from london at the gates of an old drooping mossed and streaked farmhouse that was like a wallflower in colour chapter iii dipwell farm in rain or in sunshine this old farmhouse had a constant resemblance to a wallflower and it had the same moist earthy smell except in the kitchen where john and martha thresher lived apart from their furniture all the fresh eggs and the butter stamped with three bees and the pots of honey the fowls and the hare lifted out of the hamper by his hind legs and the country loaves smelling heavenly which used to come to mrs waddys address in london and appear on my fathers table were products of dipwell farm and presents from her sister martha thresher on receiving this information i felt at home in a moment and asked right off how long am i to stay heream i going away tomorrowwhats going to be done with me the women found these questions of a youthful wanderer touching between kissings and promises of hens to feed and eggs that were to come of it i settled into contentment a strong impression was made on me by mrs waddys saying here master harry your own papa will come for you and you may be sure he will for i have his word he will and hes not one to break it unless his countrys against him and for his darling boy hed march against cannons so here youll sit and wait for him wont you i sat down immediately looking up mrs waddy and mrs thresher raised their hands i had given them some extraordinary proof of my love for my father the impression i received was that sitting was the thing to conjure him to me where his hearts not concerned mrs waddy remarked of me flatteringly hes shrewd as a little schoolmaster heve a birdsnesting eye said mrs thresher whose face i was studying john thresher wagered i would be a man before either of them reached that goal but whenever he spoke he suffered correction on account of his english more than his eating and his drinking that childs father worrits about his learning to speak the language of a british gentleman mrs waddy exclaimed before that child your hs must be like the panting of an engineto please his father hed stop me carrying the dinnertray on meatdish hot and im to repeat what i said to make sure the child havent heard anything ungrammatical the childs nursemaid hed lecture so the poor girl would come down to me ready to bend double like a bundle of nothing his observations so took the pride out of her thats because hes a father who knows his duty to the childchild says he man maam its just as you john when you sow your seed you think of your harvest so dont take it ill of me john i beg of you be careful of your english turn it over as youre about to speak change loads on the road you mean said john thresher na na hes come to settle nigh a weedy field if you like but his crop aint nigh reaping yet hark you mary waddy whore a widde whichs as much as say an unoccpied mind theres cockney and theres country and theres school mix the three strain and throw away the sediment now yons my view his wife and mrs waddy said reflectively in a breath true drink or no thats the trick o brewery he added they assented they began praising him too like meek creatures what john says is worth listening to mary you may be overcareful a stews a stew and not a boiling to shreds and you want a steady fire and not a furnace oh i quite agree with john martha we must take the good and the evil in a world like this then im no scholar and youre at ease said john mrs waddy put her mouth to his ear up went his eyebrows wrinkling arches over a petrified stare in some way she had regained her advantage art sure of it he inquired pray dont offend me by expressing a doubt of it she replied bowing john thresher poised me in the very centre of his gaze he declared he would never have guessed that and was reproved inasmuch as he might have guessed it he then said that i could not associate with any of the children thereabout and my dwelling in the kitchen was not to be thought of the idea of my dwelling in the kitchen seemed to be a serious consideration with mrs martha likewise i was led into the rooms of state the sight of them was enough i stamped my feet for the kitchen and rarely in my life have been happier than there dining and supping with john and martha and the farmlabourers expecting my father across the hills and yet satisfied with the sun to hope and not be impatient is really to believe and this was my feeling in my fathers absence i knew he would come without wishing to hurry him he had the world beyond the hills i this one where a slow full river flowed from the sounding mill under our garden wall through long meadows in winter the wild ducks made letters of the alphabet flying on the other side of the copses bounding our home there was a park containing trees old as the history of england john thresher said and the thought of their venerable age enclosed me comfortably he could not tell me whether he meant as old as the book of english history he fancied he did for the furrowtrack follows the plough close upon but no one exactly could swear when that the book was put together at my suggestion he fixed the trees to the date of the heptarchy a period of heavy ploughing thus begirt by saxon times i regarded riversley as a place of extreme baldness a greenland untrodden by my alfred and my harold these heroes lived in the circle of dipwell confidently awaiting the arrival of my father he sent me once a glorious letter mrs waddy took one of john threshers pigeons to london and in the evening we beheld the bird cut the sky like an arrow bringing round his neck a letter warm from him i loved planet communicating with planet would be not more wonderful to men than words of his to me travelling in such a manner i went to sleep and awoke imagining the bird bursting out of heaven meanwhile there was an attempt to set me moving again a strange young man was noticed in the neighbourhood of the farm and he accosted me at leckham fair i say dont we know one another how about your grandfather the squire and your aunt and mr bannerbridge ive got news for you not unwilling to hear him i took his hand leaving my companion the millers little girl mabel sweetwinter at a toystand while bob her brother and our guardian was shying sticks in a fine attitude yes and your father too said the young man come along and see him you can run i showed him how fast we were pursued by bob who fought for me and won me and my allegiance instantly returned to him he carried me almost the whole of the way back to dipwell women must feel for the lucky heroes who win them something of what i felt for mine i kissed his bloody face refusing to let him wipe it john thresher said to me at night ay now youve got a notion of boxing and will you believe it master harry theres people fools enough to want to tread that ther firstrate pastime under foot i speak truth and my word for t theyd better go in petticoats let clergymen preach as in duty bound you and ill uphold a manful sport we will and a cheer for bob he assured me and he had my entire faith that boxing was englands natural protection from the foe the comfort of having one like bob to defend our country from invasion struck me as inexpressible lighted by john threshers burning patriotism i entered the book of the history of england at about the pace of a carthorse with a huge waggon at my heels in the shape of john there was no moving on until he was filled his process of receiving historical knowledge was to fight over again the personages who did injury to our honour as a nation then shake hands and be proud of them for where we aint quite successful were cunning he said and we not being able to get rid of william the conqueror because hes got a will of his own and he wont budge why we takes and makes him one of ourselves and no disgrace in that i should hope he paid us a compliment dont you see master harry he wanted to be an englishman can you this says we sparrin up to him pretty middlin says he and does it well well then says we then youre one of us and well beat the world and did so john thresher had a laborious mind it cost him beads on his forehead to mount to these heights of meditation he told me once that he thought ones country was like ones wife you were born in the first and married to the second and had to learn all about them afterwards ay and make the best of them he recommended me to mix strain and throw away the sediment for that was the trick o brewery every puzzle that beset him in life resolved to this cheerful precept the value of which he said was shown by clear brown ale the drink of the land even as a child i felt that he was peculiarly an englishman tales of injustice done on the niger river would flush him in a heat of wrath till he cried out for fresh taxes to chastise the villains yet at the sight of the beggars at his gates he groaned at the taxes existing and enjoined me to have pity on the poor taxpayer when i lent a hand to patch the laws i promised him i would unreservedly with a laugh but with a sincere intention to legislate in a direct manner on his behalf he too though he laughed thanked me kindly i was clad in black for my distant mother mrs waddy brought down a young man from london to measure me so that my mourning attire might be in the perfect cut of fashion the childs papa would strip him if he saw him in a country tailors funeral suit she said and seemed to blow a wind of changes on me that made me sure my father had begun to stir up his part of the world he sent me a prayer in his own handwriting to say for my mother in heaven i saw it flying up between black edges whenever i shut my eyes martha thresher dosed me for liver mrs waddy found me pale by the fireside and prescribed iron both agreed upon highfeeding and the apothecary agreed with both in everything which reconciled them for both good women loved me so heartily they were near upon disputing over the medicines i was to consume under such affectionate treatment i betrayed the alarming symptom that my imagination was set more on my mother than on my father i could not help thinking that for any one to go to heaven was stranger than to drive to dipwell and i had this idea when my father was clasping me in his arms but he melted it like snow off the fields he came with postillions in advance of him wearing crape rosettes as did the horses we were in the cricketfield where dipwell was playing its first match of the season and a dipwell lad furious to see the elevens commit such a breach of the rules and decency as to troop away while the game was hot and surround my father flung the cricketball into the midst and hit two or three of the men hard my father had to shield him from the consequences he said he liked that boy and he pleaded for him so winningly and funnily that the man who was hurt most laughed loudest standing up in the carriage and holding me by the hand he addressed them by their names sweetwinter i thank you for your attention to my son and you thribble and you my man and you baker rippengale and you and you jupp as if he knew them personally it was true he nodded at random then he delivered a short speech and named himself a regular subscriber to their innocent pleasures he gave them money and scattered silver coin among the boys and girls and praised john thresher and martha his wife for their care of me and pointing to the chimneys of the farm said that the house there was holy to him from henceforth and he should visit it annually if possible but always in the month of may and in the shape of his subscription as certain as the cowslip the men after their fit of cheering appeared unwilling to recommence their play so he alighted and delivered the first ball and then walked away with my hand in his saying yes my son we will return to them tenfold what they have done for you the eleventh day of may shall be a day of pleasure for dipwell while i last and you will keep it in memory of me when i am gone and now to see the bed you have slept in martha thresher showed him the bed showed him flowers i had planted and a spanish chestnut tree just peeping ha said he beaming at every fresh sight of my doings madam i am your lifelong debtor and friend he kissed her on the cheek john thresher cried out why dame you trembles like a maid she spoke very faintly and was red in the face up to the time of our departure john stood like a soldier we drove away from a cheering crowd of cricketers and farmlabourers as if discharged from a great gun a royal salvo said my father and asked me earnestly whether i had forgotten to reward and take a particular farewell of any one of my friends i told him i had forgotten no one and thought it was true until on our way up the sandy lane which offered us a last close view of the old wallflower farm front i saw little mabel sweetwinter often my playfellow and bedfellow a curlyheaded girl who would have danced on sunday for a fairing and eaten gingerbread nuts during a ghoststory she was sitting by a furzebush in flower cherishing in her lap a lamb that had been worried she looked half up at me and kept looking so but would not nod then goodbye thought i and remembered her look when i had forgotten that of all the others chapter iv i have a taste of grandeur though i had not previously seen a postillion in my life i gazed on the pair bobbing regularly on their horses before me without a thought upon the marvel of their sudden apparition and connection with my fortunes i could not tire of hearing the pleasant music of the many feet at the trot and tried to explain to my father that the men going up and down made it like a piano that played of itself he laughed and kissed me he remembered having once shown me the inside of a piano when the keys were knocked my love for him as we drove into london had a recognized footing i perceived that he was my best friend and only true companion besides his being my hero the wicked men who had parted us were no longer able to do harm he said i forgot in my gladness at their defeat to ask what had become of shylocks descendant mrs waddy welcomed us when we alighted do not imagine that it was at the door of her old house it was in a wide street opening on a splendid square and pillars were before the houses and inside there was the enchantment of a little fountain playing thin as whipcord among ferns in a rockbasin under a window that glowed with kings of england copied from boys history books all the servants were drawn up in the hall to do homage to me they seemed less real and living than the wonder of the sweetsmelling chairs the birds and the elegant dogs richest of treats a monkey was introduced to me its your papas whim mrs waddy said resignedly he says he must have his jester indeed it is no joke to me yet she smiled happily though her voice was melancholy from her i now learnt that my name was richmond roy and not harry richmond i said very well for i was used to change everybody in the house wore a happy expression of countenance except the monkey who was too busy as we mounted the stairs i saw more kings of england painted on the backwindows mrs waddy said it is considered to give a monarchical effectshe coughed modestly after the long word and pursued as it should i insisted upon going to the top floor where i expected to find william the conqueror and found him but that strong connecting link between john thresher and me presented himself only to carry my recollections of the dipwell of yesterday as far back into the past as the old norman days and down go all the kings downstairs i said surveying them consecutively yes she replied in a tone that might lead one to think it their lamentable fate and did the people look at you as you drove along through the streets master richmond i said yes in turn and then we left off answering but questioned one another which is a quicker way of getting at facts i know it is with boys and women mrs waddy cared much less to hear of dipwell and its inhabitants than of the sensation created everywhere by our equipage i noticed that when her voice was not melancholy her face was she showed me a beautiful little pink bed having a crown over it in a room opening to my fathers twenty thousand magnificent dreams seemed to flash their golden doors when i knew that the bed was mine i thought it almost as nice as a place by my fathers side dont you like it mrs waddy i said she smiled and sighed like it oh yes my dear to be sure i do i only hope it wont vanish she simpered and looked sad i had too many distractions or i should have asked her whether my amazing and delightful new home had ever shown symptoms of vanishing it appeared to me judging from my experience that nothing moved violently except myself and my principal concern was lest any one should carry me away at a moments notice in the evening i was introduced to a company of gentlemen who were drinking wine after dinner with my father they clapped their hands and laughed immoderately on my telling them that i thought those kings of england who could not find room on the windows must have gone down to the cellars they are going my father said he drank off a glassful of wine and sighed prodigiously they are going gentlemen going there like good wine like old port which they tell us is going also favour me by drinking to the health of richmond roy the younger they drank to me heartily but my father had fallen mournful before i left the room ponyriding and lessons in boxing and wrestling and lessons in french from a french governess at whose appearance my father always seemed to be beginning to dance a minuet so exuberantly courteous was he and lessons in latin from a tutor whom my father invited to dinner once a fortnight but did not distinguish otherwise than occasionally to take down latin sentences in a notebook from his dictation occupied my mornings my father told the man who instructed me in the art of selfdefence that our family had always patronized his profession i wrestled ten minutes every day with this mans son and was regularly thrown on fine afternoons i was dressed in black velvet for a drive in the park where my father uncovered his head to numbers of people and was much looked at it is our duty my son never to forget names and persons i beg you to bear that in mind my dearest richie he said we used to go to his operabox and we visited the house of lords and the house of commons and my father though he complained of the decay of british eloquence and mourned for the days of chatham and william pitt our old friend of the cake and the raspberry jam and burke and sheridan encouraged the orators with approving murmurs my father no longer laid stress on my studies of the peerage now i have you in the very atmosphere that will come of itself he said i wished to know whether i was likely to be transported suddenly to some other place he assured me that nothing save a convulsion of the earth would do it which comforted me for i took the firmness of the earth in perfect trust we spoke of our old sunday walks to st pauls and westminster abbey as of a day that had its charm our pew among a fashionable congregation pleased him better the pewopener curtseyed to none as she did to him for my part i missed the monuments and the chants and something besides that had gonei knew not what at the first indication of gloom in me my father became alarmed and after making me stand with my tongue out before himself and mrs waddy like a dragon in a piece of tapestry would resume his old playfulness and try to be the same that he had been in mrs waddys lodgings then we read the arabian nights together or rather he read them to me often acting out the incidents as we rode or drove abroad an omission to perform a duty was the fatal forgetfulness to sprinkle pepper on the creamtarts if my father subjected me to an interrogation concerning my lessons he was the dread african magician to whom must be surrendered my acquisition of the ring and the musty old lamp we were quite in the habit of meeting fair persians he would frequently ejaculate that he resembled the three calendars in more respects than one to divert me during my recovery from measles he one day hired an actor in a theatre and put a cloth round his neck and seated him in a chair rubbed his chin with soap and played the part of the barber over him and i have never laughed so much in my life poor mrs waddy got her hands at her sides and kept on gasping oh sir oh while the barber hurried away from the halfshaved young man to consult his pretended astrolabe in the next room where we heard him shouting the suns altitude and consulting its willingness for the impatient young man to be further shaved and back he came seeming refreshed to have learnt the suns favourable opinion and gabbling at an immense rate full of barbers business the servants were allowed to be spectators but as soon as the young man was shaved my father dismissed them with the tone of a master no wonder they loved him mrs waddy asked who could help it i remember a pang i had when she spoke of his exposure to the risk of marrying again it added a curious romantic tenderness to my adoration of him and made me feel that he and i stood against the world to have his hand in mine was my delight then it was that i could think earnestly of prince ahmed and the kind and beautiful peribanou whom i would not have minded his marrying my favourite dream was to see him shooting an arrow in a match for a prize and losing the prize because of not finding his arrow and wondering where the arrow had flown to and wandering after it till he passed out of green fields to grassy rocks and to a stony desert where at last he found his arrow at an enormous distance from the shooting line and there was the desert all about him and the sweetest fairy ever imagined going to show herself to him in the ground under his feet in his absence i really hungered for him and was jealous during this arabian life we sat on a carpet that flew to the continent where i fell sick and was cured by smelling at an apple and my father directed our movements through the aid of a telescope which told us the titles of the hotels ready to receive us as for the cities and cathedrals the hot meadows under mountains the rivers and the castlesthey were little more to me than an animated book of geography opening and shutting at random and travelling from place to place must have seemed to me so much like the life i had led that i was generally as quick to cry as to laugh and was never at peace between any two emotions byandby i lay in a gondola with a young lady my father made friends fast on our travels her parents were among the number and she fell in love with me and enjoyed having the name of peribanou which i bestowed on her for her delicious talk of the blue and redstriped posts that would spout up fountains of pearls if they were plucked from their beds and the palaces that had flown out of the farthest corners of the world and the city that would some night or other vanish suddenly leaving bare searipple to say where where as they rolled over i would have seen her marry my father happily she was like rest and dreams to me soft sea and pearls we entered into an arrangement to correspond for life her name was clara goodwin she requested me to go always to the horse guards to discover in what part of the world colonel goodwin might be serving when i wanted to write to her i in return could give no permanent address so i related my history from the beginning to write to you would be the same as writing to a river she said and insisted that i should drop the odious name of roy when i grew a man my father quarrelled with colonel goodwin months after i felt as if i had only just been torn from clara but she stood in a mist irrecoverably distant i had no other friend twelve dozen of splendid burgundy were the fruit of our tour to be laid down at dipwell farm for my arrival at my majority when i should be a legal man embarked in my own ship as my father said i did not taste the wine porter for me that day please god cried mrs waddy who did my father eyed her with pity and ordered her to send the wine down to dipwell which was done he took me between his knees and said impressively now richie twelve dozen of the best that man can drink await you at the gates of manhood few fathers can say that to their sons my boy if we drink it together blessings on the day if im gone richie shut up in the long box his voice shook and he added gone to peribanou underneath you know remember that your dada saw that the wine was a good vintage and bought it and had it bottled in his own presence while you were asleep in the emperors room in the fine old burgundy city and swore that whatever came to them both his son should drink the wine of princes on the day of his majority here my fathers tone was highly exalted and he sat in a great flush i promised him i would bend my steps toward dipwell to be there on my twentyfirst birthday and he pledged himself to be there in spirit at least bodily if possible we sealed the subject with some tears he often talked of commissioning a poet to compose verses about that wonderful coming day at dipwell the thought of the day in store for us sent me strutting as though i had been in the presence of my drillmaster mrs waddy however grew extremely melancholy at the mention of it lord only knows where we shall all be by that time she sighed she is a dewy woman said my father disdainfully they appeared always to be at variance notwithstanding her absolute devotion to him my father threatened to have her married to somebody immediately if she afflicted him with what he called her waddyism she had got the habit of exclaiming at the end of her remarks no matter our clock strikes soon in a way that communicated to me an obscure idea of a door going to open unexpectedly in one of the walls and conduct us by subterranean passages into a new country my fathers method of rebuking her anxious nature was to summon his cook the funniest of frenchmen monsieur alphonse and issue orders for a succession of six dinnerparties and now maam you have occupation for your mind he would say to judge by the instantaneous composure of her whole appearance he did produce a temporary abatement of her malady the good soul bustled out of the room in attendance upon m alphonse and never complained while the dinners lasted but it was whispered that she had fits in the upper part of the house no sooner did my father hear the rumour than he accused her to her face of this enormity telling her that he was determined to effect a permanent cure even though she should drive him to unlimited expense we had a ball party and an aladdin supper and for a fortnight my father hired postillions we flashed through london my father backed a horse to run in the races on epsom downs named prince royal only for the reason that his name was prince royal and the horse won which was he said a proof to me that in our country it was common prudence to stick to royalty and he bade me note that if he went in a carriage and two he was comparatively unnoticed whereas when he was beheld in a carriage and four with postillions at a glance from him the country people tugged their forelocks and would like if he would let them to kiss his hand we will try the scarlet livery on one of our drives richie said he mrs waddy heard him it is unlawful sir she said for whom maam asked my father none but royal she was explaining but stopped for he showed her an awful frown and she cried so that my heart ached for her my father went out to order the livery on the spot he was very excited then it was that mrs waddy embracing me said my dear my own master richmond my little harry prepare your poor childs heart for evil days i construed her unintelligible speech as an attack upon my father and abused her violently while i was in this state of wrathful championship the halldoor was opened i ran out and caught sight of my aunt dorothy in company with old mr bannerbridge i was kissed and hugged for i know not how long until the smell of riversley took entire possession of me and my old home seemed nearer than the one i lived in but my aunt seeing tears on my cheeks asked me what was my cause of sorrow in a moment i poured out a flood of complaints against mrs waddy for vexing my father when she heard of the scarlet livery my aunt lifted her hands the man is near the end of his wits and his money together said mr bannerbridge and she said to me my darling harry will come back to his own nice little room and see his grandpapa soon wont you my pet all is ready for him there as it used to be except poor mama kiss my boy my harryharry richmond those were her last words on her deathbed before she went to god harry my own there is sampson the pony and harrys dog prince and his lamb daisy grown a sheep and the ploughboy dick with the big boots much more sweet talk of the same current that made my face cloudy and bright and filled me with desire for riversley to see my mothers grave and my friends aunt dorothy looked at me come now she said come with me harry her trembling seized on me like a fire i said yes though my heart sank as if i had lost my father with the word she caught me in her arms tight murmuring and dry our tears and make our house laugh oh since the night that harry went and i am now harrys mama he has me i looked on her forehead for the wreath of white flowers my mother used to wear and thought of my fathers letter with the prayer written on the blackbordered page i said i would go but my joy in going was gone we were stopped in the doorway by mrs waddy nothing would tempt her to surrender me mr bannerbridge tried reasoning with her and as he said put the case which seemed to have perched on his forefinger he talked of my prospects of my sole chance of being educated morally and virtuously as became the grandson of an english gentleman of a good old family and of my father having spent my mothers estate and of the danger of his doing so with mine and of religious duty and the awfulness of the position mrs waddy stood in he certainly subdued me to very silent breathing but did not affect me as my aunt dorothys picturing of riversley had done and when mrs waddy reduced to an apparent submissiveness addressed me piteously master richmond would you leave papa i cried out no no never leave my papa and twisted away from my aunts keeping my fathers arrival caused me to be withdrawn but i heard his offer of his hospitality and all that was his and subsequently there was loud talking on his part i was kissed by my aunt before she went she whispered come to us when you are free think of us when you pray she was full of tears mr bannerbridge patted my head the door closed on them and i thought it was a vision that had passed but now my father set my heart panting with questions as to the terrible possibility of us two ever being separated in some way he painted my grandfather so black that i declared earnestly i would rather die than go to riversley i would never utter the name of the place where there was evil speaking of the one i loved dearest do not my son he said solemnly or it parts us two i repeated after him i am a roy and not a beltham it was enough to hear that insult and shame had been cast on him at riversley for me to hate the name of the place we cried and then laughed together and i must have delivered myself with amazing eloquence for my father held me at arms length and said richie the notion of training you for a general commandership of the british army is a good one but if you have got the winning tongue the woolsack will do as well for a whisper in the ear of the throne that is our aim my son we sayyou will not acknowledge our birth you shall acknowledge our worth he complained bitterly of my aunt dorothy bringing a lawyer to our house the sins of mrs waddy were forgiven her owing to her noble resistance to the legal gentlemans seductive speech so i walked up and down stairs with the kings of england looking at me out of the coloured windows quietly for a week and then two ugly men entered the house causing me to suffer a fearful oppression though my father was exceedingly kind to them and had beds provided for them saying that they were very old retainers of his but the next day our scarlet livery appeared after exacting particular attention to his commands my father quitted mrs waddy and we mounted the carriage laughing at her deplorable eyes and prim lips which he imitated for my amusement a load is off my head he remarked he asked me if splendour did not fatigue me also i caught the answer from his face and replied that it did and that i should like to go right on to dipwell the burgundy sleeps safe there said my father and thought over it we had an extraordinary day people stood fast to gaze at us in the country some pulled off their hats and set up a cheer the landlords of the inns where we baited remained bareheaded until we started afresh and i according to my fathers example bowed and lifted my cap gravely to persons saluting us along the roads nor did i seek to know the reason for this excess of respectfulness i was beginning to take to it naturally at the end of a dusty highroad where it descends the hill into a town we drew up close by a high red wall behind which i heard boys shouting at play we went among them accompanied by their master my father tipped the head boy for the benefit of the school and following lunch with the master and his daughter to whom i gave a kiss at her request a halfholiday was granted to the boys in my name how they cheered the young lady saw my delight and held me at the window while my father talked with hers and for a long time after i beheld them in imagination talking that is to say my father issuing his instructions and mr rippenger receiving them like a pliant hodman for the result of it was that two days later without seeing my kings of england my home again or london i was julia rippengers intimate friend and the youngest pupil of the school my father told me subsequently that we slept at an hotel those two nights intervening memory transplants me from the coach and scarlet livery straight to my place of imprisonment chapter v i make a dear friend heriot was the name of the head boy of the school boddy was the name of one of the ushers they were both in love with julia rippenger it was my fortune to outrun them in her favour for a considerable period during which time though i had ceased to live in state and was wearing out my suits of velvet and had neither visit nor letter from my father i was in tolerable bliss julias kisses were showered on me for almost anything i said or did but her admiration of heroism and daring was so fervent that i was in no greater danger of becoming effeminate than achilles when he wore girls clothes she was seventeen an age bewitching for boys to look up to and men to look down on the puzzle of the school was how to account for her close relationship to old rippenger such an apple on such a crabtree seemed monstrous heriot said that he hoped boddy would marry old rippengers real daughter and said he thats birchtwigs i related his sparkling speech to julia who laughed accusing him however of impudence she let me see a portrait of her dead mother an irish lady raising dark eyelashes whom she resembled i talked of the portrait to heriot and as i had privileges accorded to none of the other boys and could go to her at any hour of the day after lessons he made me beg for him to have a sight of it she considered awhile but refused on hearing of the unkind refusal heriot stuck his hands into his pockets and gave up cricketing we saw him leaning against a wall in full view of her window while the boys crowded round him trying to get him to practise a schoolmatch of an important character coming off with a rival academy and it was only through fear of our school being beaten if she did not relent that julia handed me the portrait charging me solemnly to bring it back i promised of course heriot went into his favourite corner of the playground and there looked at it and kissed it and then buttoned his jacket over it tight growling when i asked him to return it julia grew frightened she sent me with numbers of petitions to him look here young un said heriot youre a good little fellow and i like you but just tell her i believe in nothing but handwriting and if she writes to me for it humbly and nicely she shall have it back say i only want to get a copy taken by a firstrate painter julia shed tears at his cruelty called him cruel wicked false to his word she wrote but the letter did not please him and his reply was scornful at prayers morning and evening it was pitiful to observe her glance of entreaty and her downfallen eyelashes i guessed that in heriots letters to her he wanted to make her confess something which she would not do now i write to him no more let him know it my darling she said and the consequence of heriots ungrateful obstinacy was that we all beheld her at the ceremony of the consecration of the new church place her hand on mr boddys arm and allow him to lead her about heriot kept his eyes on them his mouth was sharp and his arms stiff by his sides i was the bearer of a long letter to her that evening she tore it to pieces without reading it next day heriot walked slowly past mr boddy holding the portrait in his hands the usher called to him what have you there heriot my hero stared only a family portrait he answered thrusting it safe in his pocket and fixing his gaze on julias window permit me to look at it said mr boddy permit me to decline to let you said heriot look at me sir cried boddy i prefer to look elsewhere sir replied heriot and there was julia visible at her window i asked you sir civilly quoth boddy for permission to looki used the word intentionally i say i asked you for permission no you didnt heriot retorted quite cool inferentially you did but you did not use the word permission and you turned upon me impudently pursued boddy whose colour was thunder you quibbled sir you prevaricated you concealed what you were carrying am carrying heriot corrected his tense and mean to in spite of every boddy he murmured audibly like a rascal detected in an act of felony roared boddy you concealed it sir conceal it sir and i demand in obedience to my duty that you instantly exhibit it for my inspection now here at once no parleying unbutton or i call mr rippenger to compel you i was standing close by my brave heriot rather trembling studious of his manfulness though i was his left foot was firmly in advance as he said just in the manner to start an usher furious i concealed it i conceal it i was carrying it i carry it you demand that i exhibit for your inspection what i mean no boddy to see i have to assure you respectfully sir that family portraits are sacred things with the sons of gentlemen here richie off i found the portrait in my hand and heriot between me and the usher in the attitude of a fellow keeping another out of his home at prisonersbase he had spied mr rippengers head at the playground gate i had just time to see heriot and the usher in collision before i ran through the gate and into julias arms in her garden whither the dreadful prospect of an approaching catastrophe had attracted her heriot was merely reported guilty of insolence he took his five hundred lines of virgil with his usual sarcastic dignity all he said to mr rippenger was let it be about dido sir which set several of the boys upon didos history but heriot was condemned to the battles with turnus my share in this event secured heriots friendship to me without costing me the slightest inconvenience papa would never punish you julia said and i felt my rank nor was it wonderful i should when mr rippenger was constantly speaking of my fathers magnificence in my presence before company allowed to draw on him largely for pocketmoney i maintained my fathers princely reputation in the school at times especially when the holidays arrived and i was left alone with julia i had fits of mournfulness and almost thought the boys happier than i was going home began to seem an unattainable thing to me having a father too a regular father instead of a dazzling angel that appeared at intervals i considered a benefaction in its way some recompense to the boys for their not possessing one like mine my anxiety was relieved by my writing letters to my father addressed to the care of miss julia rippenger and posting them in her workbasket she favoured me with very funny replies signed your own everloving papa about his being engaged killing bengal tigers and capturing white elephants a noble occupation that gave me exciting and consolatory dreams of him we had at last a real letter of his dated from a foreign city but he mentioned nothing of coming to me i understood that mr rippenger was disappointed with it gradually a kind of cloud stole over me i no longer liked to ask for pocketmoney i was clad in a suit of plain cloth i was banished from the parlour and only on sunday was i permitted to go to julia i ceased to live in myself through the whole course of lessons at playtime in my bed and round to morning bell i was hunting my father in an unknown country generally with the sun setting before me i ran out of a wood almost into a brook to see it sink as if i had again lost sight of him and then a sense of darkness brought me back to my natural consciousness without afflicting me much but astonishing me why was i away from him i could repeat my lessons in the midst of these dreams quite fairly it was the awakening among the circle of the boys that made me falter during a recital and ask myself why i was there and he absent they had given over speculating on another holiday and treat from my father yet he had produced such an impression in the school that even when i had descended to the level of a total equality with them they continued to have some consideration for me i was able to talk of foreign cities and could tell stories and i was besides under the immediate protection of heriot but now the shadow of a great calamity fell on me for my dear heriot announced his intention of leaving the school next half i cant stand being prayed at morning and evening by a fellow who hasnt the pluck to strike me like a man he said mr rippenger had the habit of signalizing offenders in his public prayers as boys whose hearts he wished to be turned from callousness he perpetually suspected plots and to hear him allude to some deep longhatched school conspiracy while we knelt motionless on the forms and fetch a big breath to bring out may the heart of walter heriot be turned and he comprehend the multitudinous blessings etc was intensely distressing together with walter heriot andrew saddlebank our best bowler the drollest fellow in the world john salter and little gus temple were oftenest cited they declared that they invariably uttered amen as heriot did but we none of us heard this defiant murmur of assent from their lips heriot pronounced it clearly and cheerfully causing julias figure to shrink as she knelt with her face in the chair hard by her fathers deskpulpit i received the hearty congratulations of my comrades for singing out amen louder than heriot like a chorister though not in so prolonged a note on hearing to my stupefaction mr rippenger implore that the heart of him we know as richmond roy might be turned i did it spontaneously mr rippenger gazed at me in descending from his desk julia too looking grieved for my part i exulted in having done a thing that gave me a likeness to heriot little richmond youre a little hero he said caressing me i saw old rippenger whisper to that beast boddy never mind they wont hurt you as long as im here grow tough thats what youve got to do id like to see you horsed only to see whether youre game to take it without wincingif it didnt hurt you much little lad he hugged me up to him id take anything for you heriot said i all right he answered never meaning me to suffer on his account he had an inimitable manner of sweet speaking that endeared him to younger boys capable of appreciating it with the supernatural power of music it endeared him i suppose to young women also julia repeated his phrases as for instance silly boy silly boy spoken with a wave of his hand when a little fellow thanked him for a kindness she was angry at his approval of what she called my defiance of her father and insisted that i was the catspaw of one of heriots plots to vex him tell heriot you have my command to say you belong to me and must not be misled she said his answer was that he wanted it in writing she requested him to deliver up her previous letters thereupon he charged me with a lengthy epistle which plunged us into boiling water mr boddy sat in the schoolroom while heriots pen was at work on the wet sunday afternoon his keen little eyes were busy in his flat birds head all the time heriot continued writing he saw no more than that heriot gave me a book but as i was marching away to julia he called to know where i was going to miss rippenger i replied what have you there a book sir show me the book i stood fast its a book i have lent him sir said heriot rising i shall see if its a fit book for a young boy said boddy and before heriot could interpose he had knocked the book on the floor and out fell the letter both sprang down to seize it their heads encountered but heriot had the quicker hand he caught the letter and cried off to me as on another occasion this time however he was not between me and the usher i was seized by the collar and shaken roughly you will now understand that you are on a footing with the rest of the boys you roy said boddy little scoundrelly spoilt urchins upsetting the discipline of the school wont do here heriot here is your book i regret he added sneering that a leaf is torn i regret sir that the poor boy was so savagely handled said heriot he was warned to avoid insolence oh as much virgil as you like heriot retorted i know him by heart it was past the hour of my customary visit to julia and she came to discover the reason of my delay boddy stood up to explain heriot went forward saying i think im the one who ought to speak miss rippenger the fact is i hear from little roy that you are fond of tales of indian adventure and i gave him a book for you to read if you like it mr boddy objected and treated the youngster rather rigorously it must have been quite a misunderstanding on his part here is the book its extremely amusing julia blushed very red she accepted the book with a soft murmur and the sallow usher had not a word stay said heriot i took the liberty to write some notes my father is an indian officer you know and some of the terms in the book are difficult without notes richie hand that paper here they are miss rippenger if youll be so kind as to place them in the book i was hoping with all my might that she would not deny him she did and my heart sank oh i can read it without notes she said cheerfully after that i listened with indifference to her petition to boddy that i might be allowed to accompany her and was not at all chagrined by his refusal she laid down the book saying that i could bring it to her when i was out of disgrace in the evening we walked in the playground where heriot asked me to do a brave thing which he would never forget this was that i should take a sharp run right past boddy who was pacing up and down before the gate leading into julias garden and force her to receive the letter i went bounding like a ball the usher suspecting only that i hurried to speak to him let me see how indignant he was with my behaviour by striding all the faster as i drew near and so he passed the gate and i rushed in i had just time to say to julia hide it or im in such a scrape the next minute she was addressing my enemy surely you would not punish him because he loves me and he though he spoke of insubordination merited chastisement and other usher phrases seemed to melt and i had what i believe was a primary conception of the power of woman she led him to talk in the gentlest way possible of how the rain had refreshed her flowers and of this and that poor rose i could think of nothing but the darling letter which had flashed out of sight as a rabbit pops into burrows boddy departed with a rose ah richie she said i have to pay to have you with me now we walked to the summerhouse where she read heriots letter through but he is a boy how old is heriot he is not so old as i am these were her words and she read the letter anew and read it again after she had placed it in her bosom i meanwhile pouring out praises of heriot you speak of him as if you were in love with him richmond she said and i do love him i answered not with me she asked yes i do love you too if you will not make him angry but do you know what it is he wants of me i guessed yes he wants you to let him sit close to you for half an hour she said that he sat very near her in church ah said i but he mustnt interrupt the sermon she laughed and mouthed me over with laughing kisses theres very little he hasnt daring enough for we talked of his courage is he good as well said julia more to herself than to me but i sang out good oh so kind this appeared to convince her very generous to you and every one is he not she said and from that moment was all questions concerning his kind treatment of the boys and as to their looking up to him i quitted her taking her message to heriot you may tell himtell him that i cant write heriot frowned on hearing me repeat it humph he went and was bright in a twinkling that means shell come he smacked his hands together grew black and asked did she give that beast boddy a rose i had to confess she did and feeling a twinge of my treason to her felt hers to heriot humph he went she shall suffer for that all this was like music going on until the curtain should lift and reveal my father to me there was soon a secret to be read in heriots face for one who loved it as i did julias betrayed nothing i was not taken into their confidence and luckily not otherwise i fear i should have served them ill i was so poor a dissembler and was so hotly plied with interrogations by the suspicious usher i felt sure that heriot and julia met his eyes were on her all through prayertime and hers wandered over the boys heads till they rested on him when they gave a short flutter and dropped like a bird shot dead the boys must have had some knowledge that love was busy in their midst for they spoke of heriot and julia as a jolly couple and of boddy as one meaning to play the part of old nick the first opportunity she was kinder to them than ever it was not a new thing that she should send in cakes of her own making but it was extraordinary that we should get these thoughtful presents as often as once a fortnight and it became usual to hear a boy exclaim either among a knot of fellows or to himself by jingo she is a pretty girl on her passing out of the room and sometimes entirely of his own idea i am persuaded that if she had consented to marry boddy the boys would have been seriously disposed to conspire to jump up in the church and forbid the banns we should have preferred to hand her to the junior usher catman of whom the rumour ran in the school that he once drank a bottle of wine and was sick after it and he was therefore a weak creature to our minds the truth of the rumour being confirmed by his pale complexion that we would have handed our blooming princess to him was full proof of our abhorrence of boddy i might have thought with the other boys that she was growing prettier only i never could imagine her so delicious as when she smiled at my father the consequence of the enlistment of the whole school in heriots interests was that at cricketmatches picnics on the hills and boating on the canal mr boddy was begirt with spies and little temple reported to heriot a conversation that he lying hidden in tall grass had heard between boddy and julia boddy asked her to take private lessons in french from him heriot listened to the monstrous tale as he was on the point of entering julias boat where boddy sat beside her and heriot rowed strokeoar he dipped his blade and said loud enough to be heard by me in catmans boat do you think french useful in a military education sir and boddy said yes of course it is says heriot then i think i shall take lessons boddy told him he was taking lessons in the school oh says heriot i mean private lessons and here he repeated one of temples pieces of communication so much more can be imparted in a private lesson boddy sprang half up from his seat row sir and dont talk he growled sit sir and dont dance in the boat if you please or the lady will be overset said heriot julia requested to be allowed to land and walk home boddy caught the rudder lines and leapt on the bank to hand her out then all the boys in her boat and in catmans shouted miss julia dear miss julia dont leave us and we heard wheedling voices dont go off with him alone julia bade us behave well or she would not be able to come out with us at her entreaty boddy stepped back to his post and the two boats went forward like swans that have done ruffling their feathers the boys were exceedingly disappointed that no catastrophe followed the events of the day heriot they thought might have upset the boat saved julia and drowned boddy and given us a feast of pleasurable excitement instead of which boddy lived to harass us with his tyrannical impositions and spiteful slaps and it was to him not to our heriot that julia was most gracious some of us discussed her conduct shes a coquette said little temple i went off to the french dictionary is julia rippenger a coquette heriot i asked him keep girls out of your heads you little fellows said he dealing me a smart thump is a coquette a nasty girl i persisted no a nice one as it happens was his answer my only feeling was jealousy of the superior knowledge of the sex possessed by temple for i could not fathom the meaning of coquette but he had sisters temple and i walked the grounds together mutually declaring how much we would forfeit for heriots sake by this time my sunday visits to julia had been interdicted i was plunged as it were in the pit of the school and my dreams of my father were losing distinctness a series of boxes on the ears from boddy began to astound and transform me mr rippenger too threatened me with carvings though my offences were slight yes said temple and i in chorus but you darent strike heriot this was our consolation and the sentiment of the school fancy then our amazement to behold him laying the cane on heriots shoulders as fiercely as he could and boddy seconding him the scene was terrible we were all at our desks doing evening tasks for the morrow a great matchday at cricket boddy watching over us and bellowing silence at your work you lazy fellows if you want lessons to be finished at ten in the morning a noise came growing up to us from below up the stairs from the wetweather shed and heriot burst into the room old rippenger after him panting mr boddy you were right he cried i find him a prowler breaking all rules of discipline a perverted impudent rascal an example shall be set to my school sir we have been falling lax what i find the puppy in my garden whistlinghe confessesfor one of my servantshere mr boddy if you please my school shall see that none insult me with impunity he laid on heriot like a wind on a bulrush heriot bent his shoulders a trifle not his head hit away sir he said during the storm of blows and i through my tears imagined him or i do now a young eagle forced to bear the thunder but with his face to it then we saw boddy lay hands on him and in a twinkling down pitched the usher and the boys cheeredchirped i should say they exulted so and merely sang out like birds without any wilfulness of delight or defiance after the fall of boddy we had no sense of our hero suffering shame temple and i clutched fingers tight as long as the blows went on we hoped for boddy to make another attempt to touch heriot he held near the master looking ready to spring like a sallow panther we kept hoping he would in our horror of the murderous slashes of the cane and not a syllable did heriot utter temple and i started up unaware of what we were going to do or of anything until we had got a blow apiece and were in the thick of it and boddy had us both by the collars and was knocking our heads together as he dragged us back to our seats but the boys told us we stopped the execution mr rippenger addressed us before he left the schoolroom saddlebank salter and a good many others plugged their ears with their fists that night boddy and catman paced in the bedchambers to prevent plotting and conspiracy they said i longed to get my arms about heriot and thought of him and dreamed of blood and woke in the morning wondering what made me cry and my arms and back very stiff heriot was gay as ever but had fits of reserve the word passed round that we were not to talk of yesterday evening we feared he would refuse to play in the match why not said he staring at us angrily has saddlebank broken his arm and cant bowl no saddlebank was in excellent trim though shamefaced as was salter and most of the big boys were they begged heriot to let them shake his hand wait till we win our match said heriot julia did not appear at morning prayers ah said temple itd make her sick to hear old massacre praying it had nearly made him sick he added and i immediately felt that it had nearly made me sick we supposed we should not see julia at the match she came however and talked to everybody i could not contain myself i wanted so to tell her what had befallen heriot overnight while he was batting and the whole ground cheering his hits i on one side of her whispered i say julia my dear i say do you know and temple on the other miss julia i wish youd let me tell you we longed to arouse her pity for heriot at the moment she was admiring him but she checked us and as she was surrounded by ladies and gentlemen of the town and particular friends of hers we could not speak out heriot brought his bat to the booth for eightynine runs his sleeve happened to be unbuttoned and there on his arm was a mark of the cane look i said to julia but she looked at me richie are you ill she assured me i was very pale and i felt her trembling excessively and her parasol was covering us here roy temple we heard heriot call here come here and bowl to me i went and bowled till i thought my head was flying after the ball and getting knocks it swam and throbbed so horribly temple related that i fell and was carried all the way from the cricketfield home by heriot who would not give me up to the usher i was in julias charge three days every time i spoke of her father and heriot she cried oh hush and had tears on her eyelids when i was quite strong again i made her hear me out she held me and rocked over me like a green tree in the wind and rain was any name mentioned she asked with her mouth working and to my no said no she knew there was none and seemed to drink and choke and was one minute calm all but a trembling hanging underlip next smiling on me and next having her face carved in grimaces by the jerking little tugs of her mouth which i disliked to see for she would say nothing of what she thought of heriot and i thought to myself though i forbore to speak unkindly its no use your making yourself look ugly julia if she had talked of heriot i should have thought that crying persons kisses were agreeable on my return into the school i found it in a convulsion of excitement owing to heriots sending boddy a challenge to fight a duel with pistols mr rippenger preached a sermon to the boys concerning the unchristian spirit and hideous moral perversity of one who would even consent to fight a duel how much more reprehensible then was one that could bring himself to defy a fellowcreature to mortal combat we were not of his opinion and as these questions are carried by majorities we decided that boddy was a coward and approved the idea that heriot would have to shoot or scourge him when the holidays came mr rippenger concluded his observations by remarking that the sharpest punishment he could inflict upon heriot was to leave him to his own conscience which he did for three days and then asked him if he was in a fit state of mind to beg mr boddys pardon publicly im quite prepared to tell him what i think of him publicly sir said heriot a murmur of exultation passed through the school mr rippenger seized little temple and flogged him far from dreading the rod now that heriot and temple had tasted it i thought of punishment as a mad pleasure not a bit more awful than the burning furzebush plunged into by our fellows in a followmyleader scamper on the common so i caught temples hand as he went by me and said eagerly shall i sing out hurrah bother it was temples answer for he had taken a stinging dozen and had a tender skin mr rippenger called me up to him to inform me that whoever i was and whatever i was and i might be a little impostor foisted on his benevolence yet he would bring me to a knowledge of myself he gave me warning of it and if my father objected to his method my father must write word to that effect and attend punctually to business duties for surrey house was not an almshouse either for the sons of gentlemen of high connection or for the sons of vagabonds mr rippenger added a spurning shove on my shoulder to his recommendation to me to resume my seat i did not understand him at all i was in fact indebted to a boy named drew a known sneak for the explanation in itself difficult to comprehend it was that mr rippenger was losing patience because he had received no money on account of my boarding and schooling the intelligence filled my head like the buzz of a fly occupying my meditations without leading them anywhere i spoke on the subject to heriot oh the sordid old brute said he of mr rippenger how can he know the habits and feelings of gentlemen your fathers travelling and cant write of course my fathers in india and i get a letter from him about once a year we know one another and i know hes one of the best officers in the british army its just the way with schoolmasters and tradesmen they dont care whether a man is doing his duty to his country he must attend to them settle accounts with themhang them ill send you money dear little lad after ive left he dispersed my brooding fit i was sure my father was a fountain of gold and only happened to be travelling besides heriots love for julia whom none of us saw now was an incessant distraction she did not appear at prayers she sat up in the gallery at church hardly to be spied a letter that heriot flung over the gardenwall for her was returned to him open enclosed by post a letter for walter heriot exclaimed mr boddy lifting it high for heriot to walk and fetch it and his small eyes blinked when heriot said aloud on his way cheerfully a letter from the colonel in india boddy waited a minute and then said is your father in good health heriots face was scarlet at first he stuttered my fatheri hope so what have you in common with him sir you stated that the letter was from your father said boddy what if it is sir oh in that case nothing whatever to me they talked on and the youngest of us could perceive boddy was bursting with devilish glee heriot got a letter posted to julia it was laid on his desk with her name scratched completely out and his put in its place he grew pale and sad but did his work playing his games and only letting his friends speak to him of lessons and play his counsel to me was that in spite of everything i was always to stick to my tasks and my cricket his sadness he could not conceal he looked like an old lamp with a poor light in it not a boy in the school missed seeing how boddys flat head perpetually had a sideeye on him all this came to an end john salters father lived on the other side of the downs and invited three of us to spend a day at his house the selection included heriot saddlebank and me mr rippenger not liking to refuse mr salter consented to our going but pretended that i was too young salter said his mother and sisters very much wished to make my acquaintance we went in his fathers carriage a jolly wind blew clouds and dust and leaves i could have fancied i was going to my own father the sensation of freedom had a magical effect on me so that i was the wildest talker of them all even in the middle of the family i led the conversation and i did not leave salters house without receiving an assurance from his elder sisters that they were in love with me we drove homeback to prison we called itfull of good things talking of salters fathers cellar of wine and of my majority burgundy which i said believing it was true amounted to twelve hundred dozen and an appointment was made for us to meet at dipwell farm to assist in consuming it in my honour and my fathers that matter settled i felt myself rolling over and over at a great rate and clasping a juniper tree the horses had trenched from the chalk road on to the downs i had been shot out heriot and salter had jumped outheriot to look after me but saddlebank and the coachman were driving at a great rate over the dark slope salter felt some anxiety concerning his fathers horses so we left him to pursue them and walked on laughing heriot praising me for my pluck i say goodbye to you tonight richie said he were certain to meet again i shall go to a military school mind you enter a cavalry regiment when youre man enough look in the army list youll find me there my aunt shall make a journey and call on you while youre at rippengers so you shant be quite lonely to my grief i discovered that heriot had resolved he would not return to school youll get thrashed he said i cant help it i hope youve grown tough by this time i cant stay here i feel more like a dog than a man in that house now ill see you back safe no crying young cornet we had lost the sound of the carriage heriot fell to musing he remarked that the accident took away from mr salter the responsibility of delivering him at surrey house but that he heriot was bound for mr salters sake to conduct me to the doors an unintelligible refinement of reasoning to my wits we reached our town between two and three in the morning there was a ladder leaning against one of the houses in repair near the school you are here are you said heriot speaking to the ladder yous do me a servicethe last i shall want in the neighbourhood he managed to poise the ladder on his shoulder and moved forward are we going in through the window i asked seeing him fix the ladder against the schoolhouse wall he said hush keep a lookout i saw him mount high when he tapped at the window i remembered it was julias i heard her cry out inside the window rose slowly heriot spoke i have come to say goodbye to you julia dear girl dont be afraid of me she answered inaudibly to my ears he begged her to come to him at once only once and hear him and take his hand she was timid he had her fingers first then her whole arm and she leaned over him julia my sweet dear girl he said and she heriot walter dont godont go you do not care for me if you go oh dont go weve come to it said

not have it i want to be remembered she sobbed as she said this and disappeared heriot still talked into her room i thought i heard a noise of the gardendoor opening a man came out rushing at the ladder i called in terror mr boddy stop sir he pushed me savagely aside pitching his whole force against the ladder heriot pulled down julias window he fell with a heavy thump on the ground and i heard a shriek above he tried to spring to his feet but dropped supported himself on one of his hands and cried all right no harm done how do you do mr boddy i thought id try one of the attics as we were late not to disturb the house im not hurt i tell you he cried as loud as he could the ushers words were in a confusion of rage and inquiries he commanded heriot to stand on his legs abused him

well drink the burgundy no crying kiss your hand to me i kissed my hand to him i had no tears to shed my chest kept heaving enormously my friend was gone i stood in the road straining to hear the last of the wheels after they had long been silent chapter vi a tale of a goose from that hour till the day heriots aunt came to see me i lived systematically out of myself in extreme flights of imagination locking my doors up as it were all the faster for the extremest strokes of mr rippengers rod he remarked justly that i grew an impenetrably sullen boy a constitutional rebel a callous lump and assured me that if my father would not pay for me i at least should not escape my debts the title of little impostor transmitted from the masters mouth to the school in designation of one who had come to him as a young prince and for whom he had not received one pennys indemnification naturally caused me to have fights with several of the boys whereupon i was reported i was prayed at to move my spirit and flogged to exercise my flesh the prayers i soon learnt to laugh to scorn the floggings after they were over crowned me with delicious sensations of martyrdom even while the sting lasted i could say its for heriot and julia and it gave me a wonderful penetration intothe mournful ecstasy of love julia was sent away to a relative by the seaside because one of the housemaids told me she could not bear to hear of my being beaten mr rippenger summoned me to his private room to bid me inform him whether i had other relatives besides my father such as grandfather grandmother uncles or aunts or a mother i dare say julia would have led me to break my word to my father by speaking of old riversley a place i half longed for since my father had grown so distant and dim to me but confession to mr rippenger seemed as he said of heriots behaviour to him a gross breach of trust to my father so i refused steadily to answer and suffered the consequences now on my dear fathers behalf heriots aunt brought me a cake and in a letter from him an extraordinary sum of money for a boy of my age he wrote that he knew i should want it to pay my debts for treats to the boys and keep them in good humour he believed also that his people meant to have me for the christmas holidays the sum he sent me was five pounds carefully enclosed i felt myself a prince again the money was like a golden gate through which freedom twinkled a finger forthwith i paid my debts amounting to two pounds twelve shillings and instructed a couple of dayboarders commercial fellows whose heavy and mysterious charges for commissions ran up a bill in no time to prepare to bring us materials for a feast on saturday temple abominated the trading propensities of these boys they never get licked and theyve always got money at least i know they always get mine said he but you and i and heriot despise them our position toward them was that of an encumbered aristocracy and really they paid us great respect the fact was that when they had trusted us they were compelled to continue obsequious for heriot had instilled the sentiment in the school that gentlemen never failed to wipe out debts in the long run so it was their interest to make us feel they knew us to be gentlemen who were at some time or other sure to pay and thus also they operated on our consciences from which it followed that one title of superiority among us ranking next in the order of nobility to the dignity conferred by mr rippengers rod was the being down in their books temple and i walked in the halo of unlimited credit like more than mortal twins i gave an order for four bottles of champagne on the friday evening catman walked out with us his studious habits endeared him to us immensely owing to his having his head in his book on all occasions and a walk under his superintendence was first cousin to liberty some boys roamed ahead some lagged behind while catman turned over his pages sounding the return only when it grew dark the rumour of the champagne had already intoxicated the boys there was a companion and most auspicious rumour that boddy was going to be absent on saturday if so we said we may drink our champagne under catmans nose and he be none the wiser saddlebank undertook to manage our feast for us coming home over the downs just upon twilight temple and i saw saddlebank carrying a long withy upright we asked him what it was for he shouted back its for fortune you keep the rear guard then we saw him following a man and a flock of geese and imitating the action of the man with his green wand as we were ready to laugh at anything saddlebank did we laughed at this the man walked like one half asleep and appeared to wake up now and then to find that he was right in the middle of his geese and then he waited and saddlebank waited behind him presently the geese passed a lane leading off the downs we saw saddlebank duck his wand in a coaxing way like an angler dropping his fly for fish he made all sorts of curious easy flourishes against the sky and branched up the lane we struck after him little suspecting that he had a goose in front but he had he had cut one of the loiterers off from the flock and to see him handle his wand on either side his goose encouraging it to go forward and remonstrating and addressing it in bits of latin and the creature pattering stiff and astonished sent us in a dance of laughter what have you done old saddle said temple though it was perfectly clear what saddlebank had done ive carved off a slice of michaelmas said saddlebank and he hewed the air to flick delicately at his gooses head what do you meana slice said we we wanted to be certain the goose was captured booty saddlebank would talk nothing but his fun temple fetched a roaring sigh oh how good this goose d be with our champagne the idea seized and enraptured me saddlebank ill buy him off you i said chink wont flavour him said saddlebank still at his business here you two cut back by the down and try all your might to get a dozen apples before catman counts heads at the door and you hold your tongues we shot past the man with the geesei pitied himclipped a corner of the down and by dint of hard running reached the main street mad for apples before catman appeared there apples champagne and cakes were now provided all that was left to think of was the goose we glorified saddlebanks cleverness to the boys by jingo what a treat youll have temple said among them bursting with our secret saddlebank pleaded that he had missed his way on presenting himself ten minutes after time to me and temple he breathed of goose but he shunned us he had no fun in him till saturday afternoon when catman called out to hear if we were for cricket or a walk a walk on the downs said saddlebank temple and i echoed him and saddlebank motioned his hand as though he were wheedling his goose along saddlebank spoke a word to my commissioners i was to leave the arrangements for the feast to him he said john salter was at home unwell so saddlebank was chief no sooner did we stand on the downs than he gathered us all in a circle and taking off his cap threw in it some slips of paper we had to draw lots who should keep by catman out of twentyseven fifteen blanks were marked temple dashed his hand into the cap first like my luck he remarked and pocketed both fists as he began strutting away to hide his desperation at drawing a blank i bought a substitute for him at the price of halfacrowndrew a fellow we were glad to get rid of he wanted five shillings the feast was worth fifty but to haggle about prices showed the sneak he begged us to put by a taste for him he was groaned out of hearing the fifteen looked so wretched when they saw themselves divided from us that i gave them a shilling apiece to console them they took their instructions from saddlebank as to how they were to surround catman and make him fancy us to be all in his neighbourhood and then we shook hands they requesting us feebly to drink their healths and we saying ay that we would temple was in distress of spirits because of his having been ignominiously bought off saddlebank however put on such a pace that no one had leisure for melancholy ill get you fellows up to boiling point said he there was a tremendously hot sun overhead on a sudden he halted exclaiming cooks and gridirons what about sage and onions only temple and i jumped at the meaning of this we drew lots for a messenger and it was miserable to behold an unfortunate fellow touch saddlebanks hand containing the notched bit of stick and find himself condemned to go and buy sage and onions somewhere without knowing what it was for how could he guess we were going to cook a raw goose the lot fell to a boy named barnshed a big slow boy half way up every class he was in but utterly stupid out of school which made saddlebank say theyll take it hes the bird that wants stuffing barnshed was directed where to rejoin us the others asked why he was trotted after sage and onions because hes an awful goose said saddlebank temple and i thought the word was out and hurrahed and back came barnshed we had a task in persuading him to resume his expedition as well as saddlebank to forgive us saddlebanks anger was excessive we conciliated him by calling him captain and pretending to swear an oath of allegiance he now led us through a wood on to some fields down to a shady dell where we were to hold the feast in privacy he did not descend it himself vexatious as it was to see a tramps tent there we nevertheless acknowledged the respectful greeting of the women and the man with a few questions about tentpegs pots and tin mugs saddlebank remained aloft keeping a lookout for the dayschool fellows chaunter davis and bystop my commissioners they did not keep us waiting long they had driven to the spot in a cart according to saddlebanks directions our provisions were in three large hampers we praised their forethought loudly at the sight of an extra bottle of champagne with two bottles of gingerwine two of currant two of raisin four pint bottles of ale six of gingerbeer a dutch cheese a heap of tarts three sallylunns and four shillingsworth of toffy temple and i joined our apples to the mass a sight at which some of the boys exulted aloud the trampwomen insisted on spreading things out for us ten yards off their children squatted staring the man smoked and chaffed us at last saddlebank came running over the hillside making as if he meant to bowl down what looked a black body of a baby against the sky and shouting see you fellows heres a find he ran through us swinging his goose up to the hampers saying that he had found the goose under a furzebush while the words were coming out of his mouth he saw the tramps and the male tramps eyes and his met the man had one eyebrow and his lips at one corner screwed in a queer lift he winked slowly odd aint it he said saddlebank shouldered round on us and cried confound you fellows heres a beastly place youve pitched upon his face was the colour of scarlet in patches now i call it a beautiful place said the man and if you finds gooses hereabouts growing ready for the fire all but plucking why its a bountiful place i call it the women tried to keep him silent but for them we should have moved our encampment why of course young gentlemen if you want to eat the goose well pluck it for you and cook it for you all nice they said how can young gentlemen do that for theirselves it was clear to us we must have a fire for the goose certain observations current among us about the necessity to remove the gooses inside and not to lose the giblets which even the boy who named them confessed his inability to recognize inclined the majority to accept the womans proposal saddlebank said it was on our heads then to revive his good humour temple uncorked a bottle of champagne the trampwoman lent us a tin mug and round it went one boy said thats a commencement another said hang old rippenger temple snapped his fingers and bystop a farmers son said well now ive drunk champagne i meant to before i died most of the boys seemed puzzled by it as for me my heart sprang up in me like a colt turned out of stables to graze i determined that the humblest of my retainers should feed from my table and drink to my fathers and heriots honour and i poured out champagne for the women who just sipped and the man who vowed he preferred beer a spoonful of the mashed tarts i sent to each of the children only one the eldest a girl about a year older than me or younger with black eyebrows and rough black hair refused to eat or drink let her bide young gentlemen said a woman shes a regular obstinate once she sets in for it ah said the man ive seen pigs druv and ive seen iron bent double shes harder n both once she takes t into her head by jingo shes pigiron cried temple and sighed oh dear old heriot i flung myself beside him to talk of our lost friend a great commotion stirred the boys they shrieked at beholding their goose vanish in a pot for stewing they wanted roastgoose they exclaimed not boiled who cared for boiled goose but the woman asked them how it was possible to roast a goose on the top of woodflames where there was nothing to hang it by and nothing would come of it except smoked bones the boys groaned in consternation and saddlebank sowed discontent by grumbling now you see what your jolly new acquaintances have done for you so we played at catch with the dutch cheese and afterwards bowled it for longstopping when to the disgust of saddlebank and others down ran the blackhaired girl and caught the ball clean at wicketdistance as soon as she had done it she was ashamed and slunk away the boys called out now then pigiron one fellow enraged me by throwing an apple that hit her in the back we exchanged halfadozen blows whereupon he consented to apologize and roared hulloa pigiron sorry if i hurt you temple urged me to insist on the rascals going on his knees for flinging at a girl why said chaunter you were the first to call her pigiron temple declared he was a blackguard if he said that i made the girl take a piece of toffy aha saddlebank grumbled this comes of the precious company you would keep in spite of my caution the man told us to go it for he liked to observe young gentlemen enjoying themselves temple tossed him a pint bottle of beer with an injunction to him to shut his trap now you talk my mother tongue said the man youre what goes by the name of a learned gentleman thank ye sir youll be a counsellor some day i wont get off thieves i can tell you said temple he was the son of a barrister nor you wont help cook their gooses for them may be said the man well kindness is kindness all over the world the women stormed at him to command him not to anger the young gentlemen for saddlebank was swearing awfully in an undertone he answered them that he was the mildest lamb afloat despairing of the goose we resolved to finish the cold repast awaiting us the dutch cheese had been bowled into bits with a portion of the mashed tarts on it and champagne it tasted excellently toffy to follow those boys who chose gingerwine had it and drank despised the gingerbeer and ale apples and sallylunns were reserved for supper my mind became like a driving sky with glimpses of my father and heriot bursting through if im not a prince im a nobleman i said to temple he replied army or navy i dont much care which were sure of a foreign war some time then youll see fellows rise lieutenant captain colonel generalquick as barrels popping at a bird i should like to be governor of gibraltar ill come and see you temple said i done old richie he said grasping my hand warmly the truth is temple i confided to him ive an unclei mean a grandfatherof enormous property he owns half hampshire i believe and hates my father like poison i wont stand it youve seen my father havent you gentlemen never forget their servants temple lets drink lots more champagne i wish you and i were knights riding across that country there as they used to and you saying i wonder whether your fathers at home in the castle expecting our arrival the baron said temple hes like a baron too his health your health sir its just the wine to drink it in richie hes one of the men i look up to its odd he never comes to see you because hes fond of you the right sort of father big men cant be always looking after little boys not that were so young though now lots of fellows of our age have done things fellows write about i feel temple sat up swelling his chest to deliver an important sentiment i feel uncommonly thirsty so did i we attributed it to the air of the place temple going so far as to say that it came off the chalk which somehow stuck in the throat saddleback dont look glum said temple lord richie you should hear my father plead in court with his wig on they used to say at home i was a clever boy when i was a baby saddleback youve looked glum all the afternoon treat your superiors respectfully saddlebank retorted the tramp was irritating him that tramp had never left off smoking and leaning on his arm since we first saw him two boys named hackman and montague not bad fellows grew desirous of a whiff from his pipe they had it and lay down silent back to back bystop was led away in a wretched plight two others paynter and ashworth attacked the apples rendered desperate by thirst saddlebank repelled them furiously he harangued those who might care to listen you fellows by george you shall eat the goose i tell you youve spoilt everything and i tell you whether you like it or not you shall have apples with it and sage and onions too i dont ask for thanks and i propose to post outposts in the wood to keep watch he wanted us to draw lots again his fun had entirely departed from him all he thought of was seeing the goose out of the pot i had a feeling next to hatred for one who could talk of goose temple must have shared it weve no real captain now dear old heriots gone he said the schools topsyturvy were like a lot of things rattled in a box oh dear how i do like a good commander on he goes you after him never mind what happens a pair of inseparable friends happitt and larkins nicknamed happygolucky were rolling arminarm declaring they were perfectly sober and for a proof of it trying to direct their feet upon a lump of chalk and marching and missing it up came chaunter to them fat goose he saidno more both the boys rushed straight as far as they could go both sung out im done and they were temple and i contemplated these proceedings as matters belonging to the ordinary phenomena of feasting we agreed that gentlemen were always the last to drop and were assured therefore of our living out the field but i dreaded the moment of the gooses appearance and i think he did also saddlebanks pertinacity in withholding the cool gingerbeer and the apples offended us deeply we should have conspired against him had we reposed confidence in our legs and our tongues twilight was around us the trampchildren lay in little bundles in one tent another was being built by the women and the girl overhead i counted numbers of stars all small and lights in the valleylights of palaces to my imagination stars and tramps seemed to me to go together houses imprisoned us i thought a lost father was never to be discovered by remaining in them plunged among dark green leaves smelling woodsmoke at night at morning waking up and the world alight and you standing high and marking the hills where you will see the next morning and the next morning after morning and one morning the dearest person in the world surprising you just before you wake i thought this a heavenly pleasure but observing the narrowness of the tents it struck me there would be snoring companions i felt so intensely sensitive that the very idea of a snore gave me tremours and qualms it was associated with the sense of fat saddlebank had the lid of the pot in his hand we smelt the goose and he cried now for supper now for it halloa you fellows bother it saddlebank youll make catman hear you said temple wiping his forehead i perspired coldly catman hes been at it for the last hour and a half saddlebank replied one boy ran up he was ready and the only one who was presently chaunter rushed by barnsheds in custody im away home he said passing we stared at the black opening of the dell oh its catman we dont mind him saddlebank reassured us but we heard ominous voices and perceived people standing over a prostrate figure then we heard a voice too well known to us it said the explanation of a pupil in your charge mr catman being sent barefaced into the towna scholar of minefor sage and onions old rippenger breathed temple we sat paralyzed now we understood the folly of despatching a donkey like barnshed for sage and onions oh what asses we have been temple continued come alongwe run for it come along richie theyre picking up the fellows like windfalls i told him i would not run for it in fact i distrusted my legs and he was staggering answering saddlebanks reproaches for having come among tramps temple i see you sir called mr rippenger poor temple had advanced into the firelight with the instinct to defeat the master i crawled in the line of the shadows to the farther side of a tent where i felt a hand clutch mine hide me said i and the curtain of the tent was raised after squeezing through boxes and straw i lay flat covered by a mat smelling of abominable cheese and felt a head outside it on my chest several times mr rippenger pronounced my name in the way habitual to him in anger rye temples answer was inaudible to me saddlebank spoke and other boys and the man and the woman then a light was thrust in the tent and the man said me deceive you sir see for yourself to satisfy yourself heres our little uns laid warm and a girl there head on the mat going down to join her tribe at lipcombe and one of our women sleeps here and all told but for you to suspect me of combiningthank ye sir youve got my word as a man the light went away my chest was relieved of the weight on it i sat up and the creature who had been kind to me laid mat and straw on the ground and drew my head on her shoulder where i slept fast chapter vii a free life on the road i woke very early though i had taken kindly to my pillow as i found by my having an arm round my companions neck and her fingers intertwisted with mine for awhile i lay looking at her eyes which had every imaginable light and signification in them they advised me to lie quiet they laughed at my wonder they said dear little fellow they flashed as from under a cloud darkened flashed out of it seemed to dip in water and shine and were sometimes like a view into a forest sometimes intensely sunny never quite still i trusted her and could have slept again but the sight of the tent stupefied me i fancied the sky had fallen and gasped for air my head was extremely dizzy too not one idea in it was kept from wheeling this confusion of my head flew to my legs when imitating her i rose to go forth in a fit of horror i thought ive forgotten how to walk summoning my manful resolution i made the attempt to step across the children swaddled in matting and straw and old gowns or petticoats the necessity for doing it with a rush seized me after the first step i pitched over one little bundle right on to the figure of a sleeping woman all she did was to turn round murmuring naughty jackie my companion pulled me along gravely and once in the air with a good breath of it in my chest i felt tall and strong and knew what had occurred the tent where i had slept struck me as more curious than my own circumstances i lifted my face to the sky it was just sunrise beautiful bits of long and curling cloud brushed any way close on the blue and rosy and white deliciously cool the grass was all grey our dell in shadow and the tops of the trees burning a few birds twittering i sucked a blade of grass i wish it was all water here i said come and have a drink and a bathe said my companion we went down the dell and over a juniper slope reminding me of my day at john salters house and the last of dear heriot rather to my shame my companion beat me at running she was very swift and my legs were stiff can you swim she asked me i can row and swim and fence and ride and fire a pistol i said oh dear said she after eyeing me enviously i could see that i had checked a recital of her accomplishments we arrived at a clear stream in a gentlemans park where grass rolled smooth as seawater on a fine day and cows and horses were feeding i can catch that horse and mount him she said i was astonished straddle she nodded down for yes no saddle she nodded level for no my respect for her returned but she could not swim only up to my knees she confessed have a look at me said i and i stripped and shot into the water happy as a fish and thinking how much nicer it was than champagne my enjoyment made her so envious that she plucked off her stockings and came in as far as she dared i called to her youre like a cow and she showed her teeth bidding me not say that a cow a cow i repeated in my superior pleasure she spun out in a breath if you say that ill run away with every bit of your clothes and youll come out and run about naked you will now i float was my answer now i dive and when i came up she welcomed me with a big bright grin a smart run in the heat dried me i dressed finding half my money on the grass she asked me to give her one of those bitsa shilling i gave her two upon which she asked me invitingly if ever i tossed i replied that i never tossed for money but she had caught a shilling and i could not resist guessing heads and won the same with her second shilling she handed them to me sullenly sobbing yet she would not take them back byandby you give me another two she said growing lively again we agreed that it would be a good thing if we entered the village and bought something none of the shops were open we walked through the churchyard i said heres where dead people are buried ill dance if you talk about dead people said she and began whooping at the pitch of her voice on my wishing to know why she did it her reply was that it was to make the dead people hear my feelings were strange the shops not open and no living people to be seen we climbed trees and sat on a branch talking of birds eggs till hunger drove us to the village street where near the publichouse we met the mantramp who whistled he was rather amusing he remarked that he put no questions to me because he put no question to anybody because answers excited him about subjects that had no particular interest to him and did not benefit him to the extent of a pipe of tobacco and all through not being inquisitive yesterday afternoon he had obtained as if it had been chucked into his lap a fineflavoured fat goose honourably for his supper besides bottles of ale bottles of gingerpop and a fairearned halfcrown that was through his not being inquisitive and he was not going to be inquisitive now knowing me for a gentleman my master had tipped him halfacrown fortunately for him and perhaps for my liberty he employed a verb marvellously enlightening to a schoolboy i tipped him another halfcrown he thanked me observing that there were days when you lay on your back and the sky rained apples while there were other days when you wore your fingers down to the first joint to catch a flea such was fortune in a friendly manner he advised me to go to school if not there then to go home my idea which i had only partly conceived was to have a look at riversley over a hedge kiss my aunt dorothy unaware and fly subsequently in search of my father breakfast however was my immediate thought he and the girl sat down to breakfast at the inn as my guests we ate muttonchops and eggs and drank coffee after it though i had no suspicions i noticed that the man grew thoughtful he proposed to me supposing i had no objection against slow travelling to join company for a couple of days if i was for hampshire which i stated was the county i meant to visit well then here now come along dye see look said he i mustnt be pounced on and no missing young gentleman in my society and me took halfacrown for his absence that wont do you get on pretty well with the gal and thats a screaming farce none of us do lord she looks down on such scum as us shes gipsy blood true sort everythings sausages that gets into their pockets no matter what it was when it was out well then now here you and the gal go t other side o bedlming and you wait for us on the heath and wes be there to comfort ye fore dark is it a fister he held out his hand i agreed and he remarked that he now counted a breakfast in the list of his gains from never asking questions i was glad enough to quit the village in a hurry for the driver of the geese or a man dreadfully resembling him passed me near the publichouse and attacked my conscience on the cowardly side which is i fear the first to awaken and always the liveliest half while we are undisciplined i would have paid him money but the idea of a conversation with him indicated the road back to school my companion related her history she belonged to a hampshire gipsy tribe and had been on a visit to a relative down in the east counties who died on the road leaving her to be brought home by these tramps she called them mumpers and made faces when she spoke of them gipsies she said were a different sort gipsies camped in gentlemens parks gipsies horses fiddles and the wide worldthat was what she liked the wide world she described as a heath where you looked and never saw the end of it i let her talk on for me to talk of my affairs to a girl without bonnet and boots would have been absurd otherwise her society pleased me she was so like a boy and unlike any boy i knew my mental occupation on the road was to calculate how many hilltops i should climb before i beheld riversley the sunday bells sounded homely from village to village as soon as i was convinced that i heard no bells summoning boarders to rippengers school the shops in the villages continued shut however i told the girl they should pay me for it next day and we had an interesting topic in discussing as to the various things we would buy she was for bright ribands and drapers stuff i for pastry and letterpaper the smell of peoples dinners united our appetites going through a village i saw a man carrying a great baked pie smelling overpoweringly so that to ask him his price for it was a natural impulse with me what sell my sunday dinner he said and appeared ready to drop the dish nothing stopped his staring until we had finished a plateful apiece and some beer in his cottage among his family he wanted to take me in alone shes a common tramp he said of the girl thats a lie she answered of course i would not leave her hungry outside so in the end he reluctantly invited us both and introduced us to his wife heres a young gentleman asks a bit o dinner and a young idnknowwhats after the same i leaves it to you missus his wife took it off his shoulders in good humour saying it was lucky she made the pie big enough for her family and strays they would not accept more than a shilling for our joint repast the man said that was the account to a farthing if i was too proud to be a poor mans guest and insisted on treating him like a public perhaps i would shake hands at parting i did cordially and remembered him when people were not so civil they wanted to know whether we had made a runaway match of it the fun of passing a boysschool and hearing the usher threaten to punish one fellow for straying from ranks entertained me immensely i laughed at them just as the stupid people we met laughed at me which was unpleasant for the time but i knew there was not a single boy who would not have changed places with me only give him the chance though my companion was a gipsy girl and she certainly did look odd company for a gentlemans son in a teagarden and publichouse parlour at nightfall however i was glad of her and she of me and we walked hand in hand i narrated tales of roman history it was very well for her so say ill mother you as we lay down to sleep i discovered that she would never have hooted over churchyard graves in the night she confessed she believed the devil went about in the night our bed was a cart under a shed our bedclothes fernleaves and armfuls of straw the shafts of the cart were down so we lay between upright and level and awakening in the early light i found our four legs hanging over the seat in front how you have been kicking said i she accused me of the same next minute she pointed over the side of the cart and i saw the tramps horse and his tents beneath a broad roadside oaktree her face was comical just like a boys who thinks he has escaped and is caught lets run she said preferring positive independence i followed her and then she told me that she had overheard the tramp last night swearing i was as good as a fistful of halfcrowns lost to him if he missed me the image of rippengers school overshadowed me at this communication with some melancholy i said youll join your friends wont you she snapped her fingers mumpers and walked on carelessly we were now on the great heaths they brought the memory of my father vividly the smell of the air half inclined me to turn my steps toward london i grew so full of longing for him nevertheless i resolved to have one gaze at riversley my aunt dorothy and sewis the old greybrown butler and the lamb that had grown a sheep wonderful contrasts to my grand kings of england career my first clear recollection of riversley was here like an outline of a hill seen miles away i might have shed a tear or two out of love for my father had not the thought that i was a very queer boy displaced his image i could not but be a very queer boy such a lot of things happened to me suppose i joined the gipsies my companion wished me to she had brothers horsedealers beautiful fiddlers suppose i learnt the fiddle suppose i learnt their language and went about with them and became king of the gipsies my companion shook her head she could not encourage this ambitious idea because she had never heard of a king of the gipsies or a queen either we fool people she said and offended me for our school believed in a gipsy king and one fellow hackman used to sing a song of a gipsy king and it was as much as to say that my schoolfellows were fools every one of them i accused her of telling lies she grinned angrily i dont tell em to friends she said we had a quarrel the truth was i was enraged at the sweeping out of my prospects of rising to distinction among the gipsies after breakfast at an inn where a waiter laughed at us to our faces and we fed scowling shy and hungry we had another quarrel i informed her of my opinion that gipsies could not tell fortunes they can and you come to my mother and my aunt and see if they cant tell your fortune said she in a fury yes and thats how they fool people said i i enjoyed seeing the flash of her teeth but my daring of her to look me in the eyes and swear on her oath she believed the fortunes true ones sent her into a fit of sullenness go along you nasty little fellow your shadow isnt half a yard she said and i could smile at that my shadow stretched half across the road we had a quarrelsome day wherever we went rarely walking close together till nightfall when she edged up to my hand with i say ill keep you warm tonight i will she hugged me almost too tight but it was warm and social and helped to the triumph of a feeling i had that nothing made me regret running away from rippengers school an adventure befell us in the night a farmers wife whom we asked for a drink of water after dark lent us an old blanket to cover us in a dry ditch on receiving our promise not to rob the orchard an old beggar came limping by us and wanted to share our covering my companion sank right under the blanket to peer at him through one of its holes he stood enormous above me in the moonlight like an apparition touching earth and sky cold cold he whined theres neer a worse off but theres a better off young un his words dispersed the fancy that he was something horrible or else my father in disguise going to throw off his rags and shine and say he had found me are ye one or are ye two he asked i replied that we were two then ill come and lie in the middle said he you cant theres no room i sang out lord said he theres room for any reckoning o empty stomachs in a ditch no i prefer to be alone goodnight said i why he exclaimed where ha you been t learn language halloa please leave me alone its my intention to go to sleep i said vexed at having to conciliate him he had a big stick oho went the beggar then he recommenced tell me youve stole nothing in your life youve stole a gentlemans tongue i knows the ring o that how comes you out here whos your mate there down below now see im going to lift my stick at these menacing words the girl jumped out of the blanket and i called to him that i would rouse the farmer why because im goin to knock down a apple or two on your head he inquired in a tone of reproach its a young woman youve got there eh well odd grows odder like the man who turned three shillings into five now you gi me a lie under your blanket ill knock down a apple apiece if ever youve tasted gin yous say a apple at nights a cordial though it dont intoxicate the girl whispered in my ear hes lame as ducks her meaning seized me at once we both sprang out of the ditch and ran dragging our blanket behind us he pursued but we eluded him and dropped on a quiet sleepingplace among furzes next morning when we took the blanket to the farmhouse we heard that the old wretch had traduced our characters and got a breakfast through charging us with the robbery of the appletree i proved our innocence to the farmers wife by putting down a shilling the sight of it satisfied her she combed my hair brought me a bowl of water and a towel and then gave us a bowl of milk and bread and dismissed us telling me i had a fair face and daredevil written on it as for the girl she said of her that she knew gipsies at a glance and what god almighty made them for there was no guessing this set me thinking all through the day what can they have been made for i bought a red scarf for the girl and other things she fixed her eyes on but i lost a great deal of my feeling of fellowship with her i dare say they were made for fun i thought when people laughed at us now and i laughed also i had a day of rollicking laughter puzzling the girl who could only grin two or three seconds at a time and then stared like a dog that waits for his master to send him off again running the corners of her mouth twitching for me to laugh or speak exactly as a dog might wag his tail i studied her in the light of a harmless sort of unaccountable creature witness at any rate for the fact that i had escaped from school we loitered half the morning round a cricketers booth in a field where there was moderately good cricketing the people thought it of firstrate quality i told them i knew a fellow who could bowl out either eleven in an hour and a half one of the men frightened me by saying by gearge ill in with you into a gig and off with you after that ther faller he pretended to mean it and started up i watched him without flinching he remarked that if i had not cut my lucky from school and tossed my cap for a free life he was whatever may be expressed by a slap on the thigh we played a singlewicket side game he giving me six runs and crestfallen he was to find himself beaten but as i let him know one who had bowled to heriot for hours and stood against saddlebanks bowling was a tough customer never mind his age this man offered me his friendship he made me sit and eat beside him at the afternoon dinner of the elevens and sent platefuls of food to the girl where she was allowed to squat and said he you and ill tie a knot and be friends for life i replied with pleasure we nodded over a glass of ale in answer to his questions i stated that i liked farms i would come and see his farm i would stay with him two or three days i would give him my address if i had one i was on my way to have a look at riversley grange hey says he riversley grange well to be sure now im a tenant of squire belthams and a right sort of landlord too oh says i hes my grandfather but i dont care much about him lord says he what be you the little boy why master harry richmond that was carried off in the night and the old squire shut up doors for a fortnight and made out you was gone in a hearse why i know all about you you see and back you are hurrah the squire ll be hearty that he will weve noticed a change in him ever since you left gouts been at his leg off and on a deal shrewder but he rides to hounds and dines his tenants still that he does hes one o th old style everything you eat and drinks off his estate the day he dines his tenants no humbug bout old squire beltham i asked him if sewis was alive why old sewis says he youre acquainted with old sewis why of course you are yes old sewiss alive master harry and you bet me at singlewicket thats be something to relate to em all by gearge if i didnt think id got a nettle in my fist when i saw you pitch into my stumps dash it thinks i but th old squire ll be proud of you that he will my farm lies three miles away you look at a crow flying due southeast five minutes from riversley and hes over throckham farm and there ill drive ye tonight and tomorrow clean and tidy out o my wifes soap and water straight to riversley done eh my names eckerthy no matter where you comes from here you are eh master harry and i see you last time in a donkeybasket and here you come in breeches and defy me to singlewicket and you bet me too he laughed for jollity an extraordinary number of emotions had possession of me the most intelligible one being a restless vexation at myself as the principal person concerned for not experiencing anything like the farmers happiness i preferred a gipsy life to riversley gipsies were on the road and that road led to my father i endeavoured to explain to farmer eckerthy that i was travelling in this direction merely to have a short look at riversley but it was impossible he could not understand me the more i tried the more he pressed me to finish my glass of ale which had nothing to do with it i drank nevertheless and i suppose said many funny things in my anxiety that the farmer should know what i meant he laughed enough while he was fielding against the opposite eleven the tramp came into the booth and we had a match of cunning schoolmasters out after you young gentleman said he advising me to hurry along the road if i sought to baffle pursuit i pretended alarm and then said oh youll stand by me and treated him to ale he assured me i left as many tracks behind me as if i went spilling a box of lucifermatches he was always for my hastening on until i ordered fresh ale for him the girl and he grimaced at one another in contempt so we remained seeing the game out by the time the game ended the tramp had drunk numbers of glasses of ale a fineflavoured fat goose he counted his gains since the commencement of our acquaintance bottles of ale and gingerpop two halfcrowns more ale and more to follow lets hope you only stick to your friends young gentleman wont you sir its a hard case for a poor man like me if you dont we aint got such chances every morning of our lives do you perceive sir i request you to inform me do you perceive sir im muddled a bit sir but a man must look after his interests i perceived he was so muddled as to be unable to conceal that his interests were involved in my capture but i was merry too farmer eckerthy dealt the tramp a scattering slap on the back when he returned to the booth elated at having beaten the enemy by a single run master harry richmond go to riversley to his grandfather in your company you scoundrel he cried in a rage after listening to him i mean to drive him over its a comfortable tenmile and no more but i say master harry what do you say to a peck o supper he communicated to me confidentially that he did not like to seem to slink away from the others who had made up their minds to stop and sup so we would drive home by moonlight singing songs and so we did i sat beside the farmer the girl scrambled into the hinder part of the cart and the tramp stood moaning oh dear oh dear you goes away to riversley without your best friend i tossed him a shilling we sang beginnings and ends of songs the farmer looked at the moon and said lord she stares at us then he sang the moon is shining on latworth lea and wherell she see such a jovial three as we boys we and why is she pale its because she drinks water instead of ale wheres the remainder theres the song oh handsome miss gammon has married lord mammon and jilted her suitors all cupids sharpshooters and gone in a carriage and six to her marriage singing hey for ive landed my salmon my salmon wheres the remainder i heard it th only time i ever was in london town never rested till id learnt it and now its clean gone whats come to me he sang to mary of ellingmere and another maid of some place and a loud song of britons it was startling to me to wake up to twilight in the open air and silence for i was unaware that i had fallen asleep the girl had roused me and we crept down from the cart horse and farmer were quite motionless in a green hollow beside the roadway looking across fields and fir plantations i beheld a house in the strange light of the hour and my heart began beating but i was overcome with shyness and said to myself no no thats not riversley im sure it isnt though the certainty of it was in my teeth refuting me i ran down the fields to the park and the bright little river and gazed when i could say yes it is riversley i turned away hurt even to a sense of smarting pain without knowing the cause i dare say it is true as the girl declared subsequently that i behaved like one in a fit i dropped and i may have rolled my body and cried an indefinite resentment at riversley was the feeling i grew conscious of after very fast walking i would not have accepted breakfast there about midday crossing a stubblefield the girl met a couple of her peoplemen near evening we entered one of their tents the women set up a cry kiomi kiomi like a rising rookery their eyes and teeth made such a flashing as when you dabble a hand in a dark waterpool the strange tongue they talked with a kind of peck of the voice at a word rapid never high or low and then a slide of similar tones all roundnot musical but catching and incessantgave me an idea that i had fallen upon a society of birds exceedingly curious ones they welcomed me kindly each of them looking me in the face a bright second or so i had two helps from a splendid pot of broth that hung over a fire in the middle of the tent kiomi was my companions name she had sisters adeline and eveleen and brothers osric and william and she had a cousin a prizefighter thats what ill be said i fiddling for money was not a prospect that charmed me though it was pleasant lying in kiomis arms to hear osric play us off to sleep it was like floating down one of a number of visible rivers i could see them converging and breaking away while i floated smoothly and a wonderful fair country nodded drowsy from that to cockcrow at a stride sleep was no more than the passage through the arch of a canal kiomi and i were on the heath before sunrise jumping gravelpits chasing sandpipers mimicking pewits it seemed to me i had only just heard the last of osrics fiddle when yellow colour filled in along the sky over riversley the curious dark thrill of the fiddle in the tent by night seemed close up behind the sun and my quiet fancies as i lay dropping to sleep followed me like unobtrusive shadows during daylight or to speak truthfully till about dinnertime when i thought of nothing but the great stewpot we fed on plenty nicer food than rippengers minus puddings after dinner i was ready for mischief my sensations on seeing kiomi beg of a gentleman were remarkable i reproached her she showed me sixpence shining in the palm of her hand i gave her a shilling to keep her from it she had now got one and sixpence she said meaning i supposed upon reflection that her begging had produced that sum and therefore it was a good thing the money remaining in my pocket amounted to five shillings and a penny i offered it to kiomis mother who refused to accept it so did the father and osric also i might think of them they observed on my return to my own house they pointed at riversley no said i i shant go there you may be sure the women grinned and the men yawned the business of the men appeared to be to set to work about everything as if they had a fire inside them and then to stretch out their legs and lie on their backs exactly as if the fire had gone out excepting osrics practice on the fiddle and the fathers bringing in and leading away of horses they did little work in my sight but brown themselves in the sun one morning osrics brother came to our camp with their cousin the prizefightera young man of lighter complexion upon whom i gazed remembering john threshers reverence for the heroical profession kiomi whispered some story concerning her brother having met the tramp i did not listen i was full of a tempest owing to two causes a studious admiration of the smart young prizefighters person and wrathful disgust at him for calling kiomi his wife and telling her he was prepared to marry her as soon as she played her harp like king david the intense folly of his asking a girl to play like david made me despise him but he was splendidly handsome and strong and to see him put on the gloves for a spar with big william kiomis brother and evade and ward the huge blows would have been a treat to others besides old john of dipwell farm he had the agile grace of a leopard his waistcoat reminded me of one he was like a piece of machinery in free action pleased by my enthusiasm he gave me a lesson promising me more hell be champion some day said kiomi at gnaw upon an apple he had given her i knocked the apple on the ground and stamped on it she slapped my cheek in a minute we stood in a ring i beheld the girl actually squaring at me fight away i said to conceal my shame and imagining i could slip from her hits as easily as the prizefighter did from big williams i was mistaken oh you think i cant defend myself said kiomi and rushed in with one two quick as a cat and cool as a statue fight my merry one she takes punishment the prizefighter sang out first blood to you kiomi uncork his claret my duck straight at the nozzle he sees more lamps than shine in london i warrant make him lively cook him tell him who taught you a downer to him and ill marry you tomorrow i conceived a fury against her as though she had injured me by appearing the mans propertyand i was getting the worst of it her little fists shot straight and hard as bars of iron she liked fighting she was at least my match to avoid the disgrace of seriously striking her or of being beaten at an open exchange of blows i made a feint and caught her by the waist and threw her not very neatly for i fell myself in her grip they had to pluck her from me by force and youve gone a course of tuition in wrestling squire the prizefighter said to me rather savagely the others were cordial and did not snarl at me for going to the ropes as he called it kiomi desired to renew the conflict i said aloud i never fight girls and i tell you i dont like their licking me then you come down to the river and wash your face said she and pulled me by the fingers and when she had washed my face clear of blood kissed me i thought she tasted of the prizefighter late in the afternoon osric proposed that he and i and the prizefighter should take a walk i stipulated for kiomi to be of the party which was allowed and the gipsywomen shook my hand as though i had been departing on a long expedition entreating me not to forget them and never to think evil of poor gipsyfolk why i mean to stay with you said i they grinned delightedly and said i must be back to see them break up camp in the evening every two or three minutes kiomi nudged my elbow and pointed behind where i saw the women waving their coloured neckerchiefs out of sight of our tents we came in view of the tramp kiomi said hide i dived into a furze dell the tramp approached calling out for news of me now at rippengers school thanks to heriot lying was not the fashion still i had heard boys lie and they can let it out of their mouths like a fish so lively simple and solid that you could fancy a master had asked them for it and they answered there it is but boys cannot lie in one key spontaneously a number of them to the same effect as my friends here did i was off they said all swung round to signify the direction of my steps my plans were hinted at particulars were not stated on the plea that there should be no tellings it was remarked that i ought to have fair play and law kiomi said she hoped he would not catch me the tramp winced with vexation and the gipsies chaffed him i thanked them in my heart for their loyal conduct creeping under cover of the dell i passed round to the road over a knoll of firs as quick as my feet could carry me and had just cried now im safe when a lady stepping from a carriage on the road caught me in her arms and hugged me blind it was my aunt dorothy chapter viii janet ilchester i was a prisoner captured by fraud and with five shillings and a penny still remaining to me for an assurance of my power to enjoy freedom osric and kiomi did not show themselves on the road they answered none of my shouts she is afraid to look me in the face i said keeping my anger on kiomi harry harry said my aunt they must have seen me here do you grieve and you have me dear her eager brown eyes devoured me while i stood panting to be happy if only i might fling my money at kiomis feet and tell her there take all i have i hate you one minute i was curiously perusing the soft shade of a moustache on my aunts upper lip the next we jumped into the carriage and she was my dear aunt dorothy again and the world began rolling another way the gipsies had made an appointment to deliver me over to my aunt farmer eckerthy had spoken of me to my grandfather the tramp had fetched mr rippenger on the scene rippenger paid the tramp i dare say my grandfather paid rippengers bill and for saddlebanks goose my aunt paid the gipsies and i think it doubtful that they handed the tramp a share so he came to the end of his list of benefits from not asking questions i returned to riversley more of a man than most boys of my age and more of a child a small child would not have sulked as i did at kiomis behaviour but i met my grandfathers ridiculous politeness with a mans indifference so youre back sir are you i am sir ran like a hare stead of a fox eh i didnt run like either sir do you ride yes sir a horse that was his greeting and how i took it i had not run away from him so i had a quiet conscience he said shortly after look here your name is harry richmond in my housedo you understand my servants have orders to call you master harry richmond according to your christening you were born here sir you will please to recollect ill have no vagabond names herehe puffed himself hot muttering nor vagabond airs neither i knew very well what it meant a sore spirit on my fathers behalf kept me alive to any insult of him and feeling that we were immeasurably superior to the beltham blood i merely said apart to old sewis shrugging my shoulders the squire expects me to recollect where i was born im not likely to forget his nonsense sewis in reply counselled me to direct a great deal of my attention to the stables and drink claret with the squire in the evening things so little difficult to do that i moralized reflectively heres a way of gaining a relatives affection the squires punctilious regard for payments impressed me it is true he had saved me from the disgrace of owing money to my detested schoolmaster and besides i was under his roof eating of his bread my late adventurous life taught me that i incurred an obligation by it kiomi was the sole victim of my anger that really seemed to lie down to be trampled on as she deserved for her unpardonable treachery by degrees my grandfather got used to me and commenced saying in approval of certain of my performances theres beltham in thatbeltham in that once out hunting i took a nasty hedge and ditch in front of him he bawled proudly beltham all over and praised me at night drinking claret he said on a sudden and egad harry you must jump your head across hedges and ditches my little fellow it wont do in these confounded days to have you clever all at the wrong end in my time good in the saddle was good for everything but now you must get your brains where you canpick here pick thereand sell em like a huckster some do natures goneits damned artifice rules i tell ye and a squire of our country must be three parts lawyer to keep his own you must learn by god sir you must cogitate you must stew at books and maps or youll have some infernal upstart taking the lead of you and leaving you nothing but the whiff of his tail he concluded im glad to see you toss down your claret my boy thus i grew in his favour till i heard from him that i was to be the heir of riversley and his estates but on one condition which he did not then mention if i might have spoken to him of my father i should have loved him as it was i liked old sewis better for he would talk to me of the night when my father carried me away and though he never uttered the flattering words i longed to hear he repeated the story often and made the red hall glow with beams of my fathers image my walks and rides were divided between the road he must have followed toward london bearing me in his arms and the vacant place of kiomis camp kiomi stood for freedom pointing into the darkness i wished to penetrate that i might find him if i spoke of him to my aunt she trembled she said yes harry tell me all you are thinking about whatever you want to know but her excessive trembling checked me and i kept my feelings to myselfa boy with a puzzle in his head and hunger in his heart at times i rode out to the utmost limit of the hour giving me the proper number of minutes to race back and dress for dinner at the squires table and a great wrestling i had with myself to turn my little horses head from hills and valleys lying east they seemed to have the secret of my father blank enough they looked if ever i despaired of their knowing more than i my winter and summer were the moods of my mind constantly shifting i would have a week of the belief that he was near riversley calling for me a week of the fear that he was dead long dreams of him as travelling through foreign countries patting the foreheads of boys and girls on his way or driving radiantly and people bowing radiantly i say had there been touches of colour in these visions i should have been lured off in pursuit of him the dreams passed colourlessly i put colouring touches to the figures seen in them afterward when i was cooler and could say what is the use of fancying things yet knew that fancying things was a consolation by such means i came to paint the mystery surrounding my father in tender colours i built up a fretted cathedral from what i imagined of him and could pass entirely away out of the world by entering the doors want of boys society as well as hard headwork produced this mischief my lessons were intermittent resident tutors arrived to instruct me one after another they were clergymen and they soon proposed to marry my aunt dorothy or they rebuked the squire for swearing the devil was in the parsons he said in his time they were modest creatures and stuck to the bottle and heaven my aunt was of the opinion of our neighbours who sent their boys to school and thought i should be sent likewise no no said the squire my lifes short when the gouts marching up to my middle and ill see as much of my heir as i can why the lads my daughters son he shall grow up among his tenantry well beat the country and start a man at last to drive his yard of learning into him without rolling sheeps eyes right and left unfortunately the squires description of man was not started my aunt was handsome an heiress that is she had money of her own coming from her mothers side of the family and the tenderest woman alive with a voice sweeter than flutes there was a saying in the county that to marry a beltham you must pochay her a greataunt of mine the squires sister had been carried off she died childless a favourite young cousin of his likewise had run away with a poor baronet sir roderick ilchester whose son charles was now and then our playmate and was a scapegrace but for me he would have been selected by the squire for his heir he said and he often confounded me to my face on that account as he shook my hand breaking out id as lief fetch you a cuff o the head harry richmond upon my honour and cursing at his luck for having to study for his living and be what he called a sloppy curate now that i had come to riversley for good he informed me that i should have to marry his sister janet for that they could not allow the money to go out of the family janet ilchester was a quaint girl a favourite of my aunt dorothy and the squires especial pet redcheeked with a good upright figure in walking and riding and willing to be friendly but we always quarrelled she detested hearing of kiomi dont talk of creatures you met when you were a beggar harry richmond she said i never was a beggar i replied then she was a beggar said janet and i could not deny it though the only difference i saw between janet and kiomi was that janet continually begged favours and gifts of people she knew and kiomi of people who were strangers my allowance of pocketmoney from the squire was fifty pounds a year i might have spent it all in satisfying janets wishes for ridingwhips knives pencilcases cairngorm buttons and dogs a large part of the money went that way she was always getting notice of fine dogs for sale i bought a mastiff for her a brown retriever and a little terrier she was permitted to keep the terrier at home but i had to take care of the mastiff and retriever when janet came to look at them she called them by their names of course they followed me in preference to her she cried with jealousy we had a downright quarrel lady ilchester invited me to spend a day at her house charley being home for his midsummer holidays charley janet and i fished the river for trout and janet to flatter me of which i was quite aware while i dressed her rod as if she was likely to catch something talked of heriot and then said oh dear we are good friends arent we charley says we shall marry one another some day but mamas such a proud woman she wont much like your having such a father as youve got unless hes dead by that time and i neednt go up to him to be kissed i stared at the girl in wonderment but not too angrily for i guessed that she was merely repeating her brothers candid speculations upon the future i said now mind what i tell you janet i forgive you this once for you are an ignorant little girl and know no better speak respectfully of my father or you never see me again here charley sang out hulloa you dont mean to say youre talking of your father janet whimpered that i had called her an ignorant little girl if she had been silent i should have pardoned her the meanness of the girl in turning on me when the glaring offence was hers struck me as contemptible beyond words charley and i met half way he advised me not to talk to his sister of my father they all knew he said that it was no fault of mine and for his part had he a rascal for a father he should pension him and cut him to tell the truth no objection against me existed in his family except on the score of the sort of father i owned to and i had better make up my mind to shake him off before i grew a man he spoke as a friend i might frown at him and clench my fists but he did speak as a friend janet all the while was nibbling a biscuit glancing over it at me with mouseeyes her short frock and her greediness contrasting with the talk of my marrying her filled me with renewed scorn though my heart was sick at the mention of my father i asked her what she knew of him she nibbled her biscuit mumbling he went to riversley pretending he was a singingmaster i know thats true and more oh and a drawingmaster and a professor of legerdemain added her brother expunge him old fellow hes no good no im sure hes no good said janet i took her hand and told her you dont know how you hurt me but youre a child you dont know anything about the world i love my father remember that and what you want me to do is mean and disgraceful but you dont know better i would forfeit everything in the world for him and when youre of age to marry marry anybody you likeyou wont marry me and goodbye janet think of learning your lessons and not of marrying i cant help laughing so i said but without the laughter her brother tried hard to get me to notice him janet betook herself to the squire her prattle of our marriage in days to come was excuseable it was the squires notion he used to remark generally that he liked to see things look safe and fast and he had as my aunt confided to me arranged with lady ilchester in the girls hearing that we should make a match my grandfather pledged his word to janet that he would restore us to an amicable footing he thought it a light task invitations were sent out to a large party at riversley and janet came with all my gifts on her dress or in her pockets the squire led the company to the gates of his stables the gates opened and a beautiful pony with a sidesaddle on was trotted forth amid cries of admiration then the squire put the bridlereins in my hands bidding me present it myself i asked the name of the person he pointed at janet i presented the pony to janet and said its from the squire she forgot in her delight our being at variance no no you stupid harry im to thank you hes a darling pony i want to kiss you i retired promptly but the squire had heard her back sir he shouted swearing by this and that you slink from a kiss and youre beltham blood back to her lad take it up with her in your arms or down on your knees take it manfully somehow see there shes got it ready for you ive got a letter ready for you harry to sayoh so sorry for offending you janet whispered when i reached the ponys head and if youd rather not be kissed before people then byandby but do shake hands pull the ponys mane said i that will do as well observei pull and now you pull janet mechanically followed my actions she grimaced and whimpered i could pull the ponys mane right out dont treat animals like your dolls said i she ran to the squire and refused the pony the squires face changed from merry to black young man he addressed me dont show that worse half of yours in genteel society or by the lord you wont carry beltham buttons for long this young lady mind you is a lady by birth both sides she thinks she is marriageable said i and walked away leaving loud laughter behind me but laughter did not console me for the public aspersion of him i loved i walked off the grounds and thought to myself it was quite time i should be moving wherever i stayed for any length of time i was certain to hear abuse of my father why not wander over the country with kiomi go to sea mount the andes enlist in a prussian regiment and hear the soldiers tell tales of frederick the great i walked over kiomis heath till dark when one of our grooms on horseback overtook me saying that the squire begged me to jump on the horse and ride home as quick as possible two other lads and the coachman were out scouring the country to find me and the squire was anxious it appeared i rode home like a wounded man made to feel proud by victory but with no one to stop the bleeding of his wounds and the more my pride rose the more i suffered pain there at home sat my grandfather dejected telling me that the loss of me a second time would kill him begging me to overlook his roughness calling me his little harry and his heir his bravespirited boy yet i was too sure that a word of my father to him would have brought him very near another ejaculation concerning beltham buttons youre a fiery young fellow i suspect he said when he had recovered his natural temper i like you for it plucks beltham have a will of your own sweat out the bad blood here drink my health harry youre three parts beltham at least and itll go hard if youre not all beltham before i die old blood always wins that race i swear were the oldest in the county damn the mixing my father never let any of his daughters marry if he could help it norll i bar rascals heres to you young squire beltham harry lepel belthamdoes that suit ye anon anon as they say in the play take my name and drop the richmondno drop the subject well talk of it byandby so he wrestled to express his hatred of my father without offending me and i studied him coldly thinking that the sight of my father in beggars clothes raising a hand for me to follow his steps would draw me forth though riversley should beseech me to remain clad in wealth chapter ix an evening with captain bulsted a dream that my father lay like a wax figure in a bed gave me thoughts of dying i was ill and did not know it and imagined that my despair at the foot of the stairs of ever reaching my room to lie down peacefully was the sign of death my aunt dorothy nursed me for a week none but she and my dogs entered the room i had only two faint wishes left in me one that the squire should be kept out of my sight the other that she would speak to me of my mothers love for my father she happened to say musing harry you have your mothers heart i said no my fathers from that we opened a conversation the sweetest i had ever had away from him though she spoke shyly and told me very little it was enough for me in the narrow world of my dogs faces and the redleaved creeper at the window the firtrees on the distant heath and her hand clasping mine my father had many faults she said but he had been cruelly used or deceived and he bore a grievous burden and then she said yes and yes and yes in the voice one supposes of a ghost retiring to my questions of his merits i was refreshed and satisfied like the parched earth with dews when it gets no rain and i was soon well when i walked among the household again i found that my week of seclusion had endowed me with a singular gift i found that i could see through everybody looking at the squire i thought to myself my father has faults but he has been cruelly used and immediately i forgave the old man his antipathy to my father seemed a craze and to account for it i lay in wait for his numerous illogical acts and words and smiled visibly in contemplation of his rough unreasonable nature and of my magnanimity he caught the smile and interpreted it grinning at me harry have i made a slip in my grammar eh who could feel any further sensitiveness at his fits of irritation reading him as i did i saw through my aunt she was always in dread of a renewal of our conversation i could see her ideas flutter like birds to escape me and i penetrated the others who came in my way just as unerringly farmer eckerthy would acknowledge astonished his mind was running on cricket when i taxed him with it crops was the cartload of my thoughts master harry but there was a bit o cricket in it too neer a doubt my aunts maid davis was shocked by my discernment of the fact that she was in love and it was useless for her to pretend the contrary for i had seen her granting tender liberties to lady ilchesters footman old sewis said gravely youve been to the witches master harry and others were sure i had got it from the gipsies off the common the maids were partly incredulous but i perceived that they disbelieved as readily as they believed with my latest tutor the rev simon hart i was not sufficiently familiar to offer him proofs of my extraordinary power so i begged favours of him and laid hothouse flowers on his table in the name of my aunt and had the gratification of seeing him blush his approval of my latin exercise was verbal and weak praise in comparison besides i cared nothing for praises not referring to my grand natural accomplishment and my father now is thinking of me that was easy to imagine but the certainty of it confirmed me in my conceit how can you tellhow is it possible for you to know peoples thoughts said janet ilchester whose head was as open to me as a hat she pretended to be rather more frightened of me than she was and now you think you are flattering me i said she looked nervous and now youre asking yourself what you can do better than i can she said go on i stopped she charged me with being pulled up short i denied it guess guess said she you cant my reply petrified her you were thinking that you are a lady by birth on both sides at first she refused to admit it no it wasnt that harry it wasnt really i was thinking how clever you are yes after not before no harry but you are clever i wish i was half as clever fancy reading peoples ideas i can read my ponys but thats different i know by his ears and as for my being a lady of course i am and so are youi mean a gentleman i was thinkingnow this is really what i was thinkingi wished your father lived near that we might all be friends i cant bear the squire when he talks and you quite as good as me and better dont shake me off harry i shook her in the gentlest manner not suspecting that she had read my feelings fully as well as i her thoughts janet and i fell to talking of my father incessantly and were constantly together the squire caught one of my smiles rising when he applauded himself lustily for the original idea of matching us but the idea was no longer distasteful to me it appeared to me that if i must some day be married a wife who would enjoy my narratives and travel over the four quarters of the globe as janet promised to do in search of him i loved would be the preferable person i swore her to secresy she was not to tell her brother charley the subject we conversed on oh dear no said she and told him straightway charley home for his winter holidays blurted out at the squires table so harry richmond youre the cleverest fellow in the world are you theres janet telling everybody your fathers the cleverest next to you and shes never seen him how hulloa whats that sang out the squire charley was speaking of my father sir i said preparing for thunder we all rose the squire looked as though an apoplectic seizure were coming on dont sit at my table again he said after a terrible struggle to be articulate his hand was stretched at me i swung round to depart no no not you that fellow he called getting his arm level toward charley i tried to intercedethe last who should have done it you like to hear him eh said the squire i was ready to say that i did but my aunt whose courage was up when occasion summoned it hushed the scene by passing the decanter to the squire and speaking to him in a low voice biters bit ive dished myself thats clear said charley and he spoke the truth and such was his frankness that i forgave him he and janet were staying at riversley they left next morning for the squire would not speak to him nor i to janet ill tell you what theres no doubt about one thing said charley janets rightsome of those girls are tremendously deep youre about the cleverest fellow ive ever met in my life i thought of working into the squire in a sort of collateral manner you know a cornetcy in the dragoon guards in a year or two i thought the squire might do that for me without much damaging youperhaps a couple of hundred a year just to reconcile me to a nose out of joint for upon my honour the squire spoke of making me his heiror words to that effect neatly conjugatedbefore you came back and rather than be a curate like that reverend hart of yours who hands raisins and almonds and orangeflower biscuits to your aunt the way of all the reverends who drop down on riversleyid betray my bosom friend im regularly hoist on my own petard as they say in the newspapers im a curate and no mistake you did it with a turn of the wrist without striking out and i like neat boxing i bear no malice when im floored neatly five minutes after he had spoken it would have been impossible for me to tell him that my simplicity and not my cleverness had caused his overthrow from this i learnt that simplicity is the keenest weapon and a beautiful refinement of cleverness and i affected it extremely i pushed it so far that i could make the squire dance in his seat with suppressed fury and jealousy at my way of talking of venice and other continental cities which he knew i must have visited in my fathers society and though he raged at me and pshawed the continent to the deuce he was ready out of sheer rivalry to grant anything i pleased to covet at every stage of my growth one or another of my passions was alert to twist me awry and now i was getting a false self about me and becoming liker to the creature people supposed me to be despising them for blockheads in my heart as boys may who preserve a last trace of the ingenuousness denied to seasoned men happily my aunt wrote to mr rippenger for the address of little gus temples father to invite my schoolfellow to stay a month at riversley temple came everybody liked him as for me my delight was unbounded and in spite of a feeling of superiority due to my penetrative capacity and the suspicion it originated that temple might be acting the plain wellbred schoolboy he was i soon preferred his pattern to my own he confessed he had found me changed at first his father it appeared was working him as hard at latin as mr hart worked me and he sat down beside me under my tutor and stumbled at tacitus after his fluent cicero i offered excuses for him to mr hart saying he would soon prove himself the better scholar theres my old richie said temple fondling me on the shoulder and my nonsensical airs fell away from me at once we roamed the neighbourhood talking old schooldays over visiting houses hunting and dancing declaring every day we would write for heriot to join us instead of which we wrote a valentine to julia rippenger and despatched a companion one composed in a very different spirit to her father lady ilchester did us the favour to draw a seamonster an andromeda and a perseus in the shape of a flying british hussar for julias valentine it seemed to us so successful that we scattered halfadozen over the neighbourhood and rode round it on the morning of st valentines day to see the effect of them meeting the postman on the road he gave me two for myself one was transparently from janet a provoking counterstroke of mine to her but when i opened the other my heart began beating the standard of great britain was painted in colours at the top down each side encricled in laurels were kings and queens of england with their sceptres and in the middle i read the initials a fg r r embedded in blue forgetmenots i could not doubt it was from my father riding out in the open air as i received it i could fancy in my hot joy that it had dropped out of heaven hes alive i shall have him with me i shall have him with me soon i cried to temple oh why cant i answer him where is he what address lets ride to london dont you understand temple this letters from my father he knows im here ill find him never mind what happens yes but said temple if he knows where you are and you dont know where he is theres no good in your going off adventuring if a fellow wants to be hit the best thing he can do is to stop still struck by the perspicacity of his views i turned homeward temple had been previously warned by me to avoid speaking of my father at riversley but i was now in such a boiling state of happiness believing that my father would certainly appear as he had done at dipwell farm brilliant and cheerful to bear me away to new scenes and his own dear society that i tossed the valentine to my aunt across the breakfasttable laughing and telling her to guess the name of the sender my aunt flushed miss bannerbridge she said a stranger was present the squire introduced us my grandson harry richmond captain william bulsted frigate polyphemus captain bulsted master augustus temple for the sake of conversation temple asked him if his ship was fully manned all but a mate said the captain i knew him by reputation as the brother of squire gregory bulsted of bulsted notorious for his attachment to my aunt and laughingstock of the county so youve got a valentine the captain addressed me i went on shore at rio last year on this very day of the month just as lively as you youngsters for one saltwater keeps a mans youth in pickle no valentine for me paid off my ship yesterday at spithead and here i am again on valentines day temple and i stared hard at a big man with a bronzed skin and a rubicund laugh who expected to receive valentines my aunt thrust the letter back to me secretly it must be from a lady said she why whod have a valentine from any but a lady exclaimed the captain the squire winked at me to watch his guest captain bulsted fed heartily he was thoroughly a sailorgentleman between the old school and the new and as i perceived as far gone in love with my aunt as his brother was presently sewis entered carrying a foaming tankard of old ale and he and the captain exchanged a word or two upon jamaica now when youve finished that washy tea of yours take a draught of our october brewed here long before you were a lieutenant captain said the squire thank you sir the captain replied i know that ale a moment and i will gladly i wish to preserve my faculties i dont wish to have it supposed that i speak under fermenting influences sewis hold by if you please my aunt made an effort to retire no no fair play stay said the squire trying to frown but twinkling my aunt tried to smile and sat as if on springs miss beltham the captain bowed to her and to each one as he spoke squire beltham mr harry richmond mr temple my ship was paid off yesterday and till a captains ship is paid off hes not his own master you are aware if you think my behaviour calls for comment reflect i beseech you on the nature of a sailors life a threeyears cruise in a cabin is pretty much equivalent to the same amount of time spent in a coffin i can assure you with the difference that youre hard at work thinking all the time like thehum ay he thinks hard enough the squire struck in pardon me sir like thehumplumbline on a leeshore i meant to observe this is now the thirdthe fourth occasion on which i have practised the observance of paying my first visit to riversley to know my fate that i might not have it on my conscience that i had missed a day a minute as soon as i was a free man on english terra firma my brother greg and i were brought up in close association with riversley one of the beauties of riversley we lost one was left and we both tried our luck with her honourably in turn each of us nothing underhand aboveboard on the quarterdeck before all the company ill say it of my brother i can say it of myself gregs chances i need not remark are superior to mine he is always in port if he wins then i tell himgod bless you my boy youve won the finest woman the handsomest and the best in or out of christendom but my chance is my property though it may be value only one farthing coin of the realm and there is always pity for poor sinners in the female bosom miss beltham i trespass on your kind attention if i am to remain a bachelor and you a maiden lady why the will of heaven be done if you marry another never mind who the man theres my stock to the fruit of the union never mind what the sex but if you will have one so unworthy of you as me my hand and heart are at your feet maam as i have lost no time in coming to tell you so captain bulsted concluded our eyes were directed on my aunt the squire bade her to speak out for she had his sanction to act according to her judgement and liking she said with a gracefulness that gave me a little aching of pity for the poor captain i am deeply honoured by you captain bulsted but it is not my intention to marry the captain stood up and bowing humbly replied i am ever your servant maam my aunt quitted the room now for the tankard sewis said the captain gradually the bottom of the great tankard turned up to the ceiling he drank to the last drop in it the squire asked him whether he found consolation in that the captain sighed prodigiously and said its a commencement sir egad its a commencement d be something like a final end to any dozen of our fellows round about here ill tell you what if stout stomachs gained the day in loveaffairs i suspect youd run a good race against the male half of our county william and a damned good test of a mans metal i say it is what are you going to do today i am going to get drunk sir well you might do worse then stop here william and give my old port the preference no tongue in the morning i promise you and pleasant dreams at night the captain thanked him cordially but declined saying that he would rather make a beast of himself in another place the squire vainly pressed his hospitality by assuring him of perfect secresy on our part as regarded my aunt and offering him sewis and one of the footmen to lift him to bed you are very good squire said the captain nothing but a sense of duty restrains me i am bound to convey the information to my brother that the coast is clear for him well then fall light and forard said the squire shaking him by the hand forty years ago a gentleman a baronet had fallen on the back of his head and never recovered ay ay launch stern foremost if you like said the captain nodding no no i dont go into port pulled by the tail my word for it squire and good day to you sir no ill will about this bothering lovebusiness of yours william on my soul sir i cherish none temple and i followed him out of the house fascinated by his manners and oddness he invited us to jump into the chariot beside him we were witnesses of the meeting between him and his brother a little sniffling man as like the captain as a withered nut is like a milky one same luck william said squire gregory not a point of change in the wind greg said the captain they wrenched hands thereupon like two carpetshakers with a report and much in a similar attitude these young gentlemen will testify to you solemnly greg that i took no unfair advantage said the captain no whispering in passages no appointments in gardens no letters i spoke out bravely man and now greg referring to the state of your cellar our young friends here mean to float with us tonight it is now halfpast eleven am your dinnerhour the same as usual of course therefore at four pm the hour of execution and come greg you and i will visit the cellar a dozen and half of light and halfadozen of the old familythat will be about the number of bottles to give me my quietus and you yoursall of us and you young gentlemen take your guns or your rods and back and be dressed by the four bell or yous not find the same man in billy bulsted temple was enraptured with him he declared he had been thinking seriously for a long time of entering the navy and his admiration of the captain must have given him an intuition of his character for he persuaded me to send to riversley for our eveningdress clothes appearing in which at the dinnertable we received the captains compliments as being gentlemen who knew how to attire ourselves to suit an occasion the occasion squire gregory said happened to him too often for him to distinguish it by the cut of his coat i observe nevertheless greg that you have a black tie round your neck instead of a red one said the captain then it came there by accident said squire gregory accident theres no such thing as accident if i wander out of the house with a half dozen or so in me and topple into the brook am i accidentally drowned if a squall upsets my ship is she an accidental residue of spars and timber and old iron if a woman refuses me is that an accident theres a cause for every disaster too much cargo want of foresight want of pluck pooh when im hauled prisoner into a foreign port in time of war you may talk of accidents mr harry richmond mr temple i have the accidental happiness of drinking to your healths in a tumbler of hock wine nominative hic haec hoc squire gregory carried on the declension not without pride the vocative confused him claret will do for the vocative said the captain gravely the more so as there is plenty of it at your table greg ablative hoc hac hoc which sounds as if the gentleman had become incapable of speech beyond the name of his wine so we will abandon the declension of the article for a dash of champagne which theres no declining i hope wonderful men those romans they fought their ships well too a question to you greg those heathen pagan dogs had a religion that encouraged them to swear now my experience of life pronounces it to be a human necessity to rap out an oath here and there what do you say squire gregory said drinking and no thinking at dinner william the captain pledged him ill take the opportunity as were not on board ship of drinking to you sir now temple addressed the captain whose face was resplendent and he bowed and drank and said as we are not on board ship i like you temple thanked him for the compliment no compliment my lad you see me in my weakness and you have the discernment to know me for something better than i seem you promise to respect me on my own quarterdeck you are of the right stuff do i speak correctly mr harry temple is my dear friend i replied and he would not be so if not of the right stuff good thats a way of putting much in little by jove a royal style and harrys a royal fellow said temple we all drank to one another the captains eyes scrutinized me speculatingly this boy might have been yours or mine greg i heard him say in a faltering rough tone they forgot the presence of temple and me but spoke as if they thought they were whispering the captain assured his brother that squire beltham had given him as much fair play as one who holds a balance squire gregory doubted it and sipped and kept his nose at his wineglass crabbedly repeating his doubts of it the captain then remarked that doubting it his conscience permitted him to use stratagems though he the captain not doubting it had no such permission i count i run away with her every night of my life said squire gregory nothing comes of it but empty bottles court her serenade her said the captain blockade the port lay siege to the citadel id give a year of service for your chances greg half a word from her and you have your horses ready shes past pochaises squire gregory sighed shes to be won by a bold stroke brother greg oh lord no shes past pochaises humph its come to be halfbottle halfbeauty with your worship greg i suspect no i tell you william shes got her mind on that fellow you cant pochay her after he jilted her for her sister wrong greg wrong you are muddled she has a fright about matrimonya common thing at her age i am told wheres the man in the bench of course whered you have him i sir if i knew my worst enemy to be there id send him six dozen of the best in my cellar temple shot a walnut at me i pretended to be meditating carelessly and i had the heat and roar of a conflagration round my head presently the captain said are you sure the mans in the bench cock squire gregory replied he had money from his wife and he had the wheels to make it go here they whispered in earnest oh the billings were as rich as the belthams said the captain aloud pretty nigh william thats our curse greg money settled on their male issue and money in hand by the lord weve always had the look of a pair of highwaymen lurking for purses when it was the woman the woman penniless naked mean destitute nothing but the woman we wanted and there was one apiece for us greg old boy when will the old county show such another couple of beauties greg sir youre not half a man or youd have carried her with your opportunities the fellows in the bench you say how are you cocksure of that mr greg company was the answer and the captain turned to temple and me apologizing profusely for talking over family matters with his brother after a separation of three years i had guessed but hastily at the subject of their conversation until they mentioned the billings the family of my maternal grandmother the name was like a tongue of fire shooting up in a cloud of smoke i saw at once that the man in the bench must be my father though what the bench was exactly and where it was i had no idea and as i was left to imagination i became as usual childish in my notions and brooded upon thoughts of the man in the iron mask things i dared not breathe to temple of whose manly sense i stood in awe when under these distracting influences remember our feast in the combe i sang across the table to him never forget it said he and we repeated the tale of the goose at rippengers school to our entertainers making them laugh and next morning richie ran off with a gipsy girl said temple and i composed a narrative of my wanderings with kiomi much more amusing than the real one the captain vowed he would like to have us both on board his ship but that times were too bad for him to offer us a prospect of promotion spin round the decanters said he nows the hour for them to go like a hummingtop and each man lend a hand whip hard my lads its once in three years hurrah and the cause is a cruel woman toast her but no name heres to the nameless fair for its not my intention to marry says she and maam im a man of honour or id catch you tight my nutbrown maid and clap you into a cage fallal like a squirrel to trot the wheel of mattrimony shame to the first man down that wont be i said temple be me sir me the captain corrected his grammar pardon me captain bulsted the verb to be governs the nominative case in our climate said temple then im nominative hic i say sir im in the tropics mr tem mr tempus point of honour not forget a mans name rippenger your schoolmaster mr rippenger youve knocked some knowledge into this young gentleman temple and i took counsel together hastily we cried in a breath heres to julia rippenger the prettiest nicest girl living and we drank to her julia the captain echoed us i join your toast gentlemen mr richmond mr tempusjulia by all thats holy she floats a sinking ship julia consoles me for the fairest cruellest woman alive a rough sailor julia at your feet the captain fell commendably forward squire gregory had already dropped temple and i tried to meet but did not accomplish it till next morning at breakfast a couple of footmen carried us each upstairs in turn as if they were removing furniture out of this strange evening came my discovery of my father and the captains winning of a wife chapter x an expedition i wondered audibly where the bench was when temple and i sat together alone at squire gregorys breakfasttable next morning very thirsty for tea he said it was a place in london but did not add the sort of place only that i should soon be coming to london with him and i remarked shall i and smiled at him as if in a fit of careless affection then he talked runningly of the theatres and pantomimes and londons charms the fear i had of this bench made me passingly conscious of temples delicacy in not repeating its name though why i feared it there was nothing to tell me i must have dreamed of it just before waking and i burned for reasonable information concerning it temple respected my father too much to speak out the extent of his knowledge on the subject so we drank our tea with the grandeur of london for our theme where temple assured me you never had a headache after a carouse overnight a communication that led me to think the country a far less favourable place of abode for gentlemen we quitted the house without seeing our host or the captain and greatly admired by the footmen the maids and the grooms for having drunk their masters under the table which it could not be doubted that we had done as temple modestly observed while we sauntered off the grounds under the eyes of the establishment we had done it fairly too with none of those jack the giantkiller tricks my grandfather accused us of the squire would not and he could not believe our story until he heard the confession from the mouth of the captain after that he said we were men and heroes and he tipped us both much to janet ilchesters advantage for the squire was a royal giver and temples money had already begun to take the same road as mine temple in fact was falling desperately in love for this reason he shrank from quitting riversley i perceived it as clearly as a thing seen through a windowpane he was always meditating upon dogs and what might be the price of this dog or that and whether lapdogs were good travellers the fashionable value of pugs filled him with a sort of despair my goodness he used an exclamation more suitable to women forty or fifty pounds you say one costs richie i pretended to estimate the probable cost of one yes about that but ill buy you one one day or other temple the dear little fellow coloured hot he was too much in earnest to laugh at the absurdity of his being supposed to want a pug for himself and walked round me throwing himself into attitudes with shrugs and loud breathings i dont dont think that i i care for nothing but newfoundlands and mastiffs said he he went on shrugging and kicking up his heels girls like pugs i remarked i fancy they do said temple with a snort of indifference then i suggested a pocketknife for the huntingfield is a very good thing do you think so was temples rejoinder and i saw he was dreadfully afraid of my speaking the persons name for whom it would be such a very good thing you can get one for thirty shillings well get one when were in london theyre just as useful for women as they are for us you know why of course they are if they hunt said temple and we mustnt lose time i drew him to the point i had at heart for hunting ll soon be over its february mind oh lots of time temple cried out and on every occasion when i tried to make him understand that i was bursting to visit london he kept evading me simply because he hated saying goodbye to janet ilchester his dulness of apprehension in not perceiving that i could not commit a breach of hospitality by begging him downright to start struck me as extraordinary and i was so acute i saw every single idea in his head every shift of his mind and how he half knew that he profited by my shunning to say flatly i desired to set out upon the discovery of the bench he took the benefit of my shamefacedness for which i daily punished his i really felt that i was justified in giving my irritability an airing by curious allusions to janet yet though i made him wince it was impossible to touch his conscience he admitted to having repeatedly spoken of londons charms and oh yes you and ill go back together richie and saying that satisfied him he doubled our engagements with janet that afternoon and it was a riding party a dancingparty and a drawing of a pond for carp and we over to janet and janet over to us until i grew so sick of her i was incapable of summoning a spark of jealousy in order the better to torture temple now he was a quickwitted boy well i one day heard janet address my big dog ajax in the style she usually employed to inform her hearers and especially the proprietor that she coveted a thing oh you own dear precious pet darling beauty if i might only feed you every day of my life i should be happy i curtsey to him every time i see him if i were his master the men should all off hats and the women all curtsey to emperor ajax my dog my own my great dear irresistible love then she nodded at me i would make them though and then at temple you see if i wouldnt ajax was a source of pride to me however i heard temple murmur in a tone totally unlike himself he would be a great protection to you and i said to him you know temple i shall be going to london tomorrow or the next day not later i dont know when i shall be back i wish you would dispose of the dog just as you like get him a kind master or mistress thats all i sacrificed my dog to bring temple to his senses i thought it would touch him to see how much i could sacrifice just to get an excuse for begging him to start he did not even thank me ajax soon wore one of janets collars like two or three other of the riversley dogs and i had the satisfaction of hearing temple accept my grandfathers invitation for a further fortnight and meanwhile i was the one who was charged with going about looking lovelorn i smothered my feelings and my reflections on the wisdom of people at last my aunt dorothy found the means of setting me at liberty on the road to london we had related to her how captain bulsted toasted julia rippenger and we had both declared in joke that we were sure the captain wished to be introduced to her my aunt reserved her ideas on the subject but byandby she proposed to us to ride over to julia and engage her to come and stay at riversley for some days kissing me my aunt said she was my harrys friend when he was an outcast the words revived my affection for julia strong in the sacred sense of gratitude i turned on temple reproaching him with selfish forgetfulness of her good heart and pretty face without defending himself as he might have done he entreated me to postpone our journey for a day he and janet had some appointment here was given me a noble cause and matter i need not shrink from speaking of i lashed temple in my aunts presence with a rod of real eloquence that astonished her and him and myself too and as he had a sense of guilt not quite explicable in his mind he consented to bear what was in reality my burden for julia had distinguished me and not him with all the signs of affection and of the two i had the more thoroughly forgotten her i believe temple was first in toasting her at squire gregorys table there is nothing like a pentup secret of the heart for accumulating powers of speech i mean in youth the mental distilling process sets in later and then you have irony instead of eloquence from brooding on my father and not daring to mention his name lest i should hear evil of it my thoughts were a proud family proud of their origin proud of their isolationand not to be able to divine them was for the world to confess itself basely beneath their level but when they did pour out they were tremendous as temple found this oratorical display of mine gave me an ascendancy over him he adored eloquence not to say grandiloquence he was the son of a barrister lets go and see her at once richie he said of julia im ready to be off as soon as you like im ready to do anything that will please you which was untrue but it was useless to tell him so i sighed at my sad gift of penetration and tossed the fresh example of it into the treasury of vanity temple said i dissembling a little i tell you candidly you wont please me by doing anything disagreeable to you a dog pulled by the collar is not much of a companion i start for julia tomorrow before daylight if you like your bed best stop there and mind you amuse janet for me during my absence im not going to let any one make comparisons between us temple muttered he dropped dozens of similar remarks and sometimes talked downright flattery i had so deeply impressed him we breakfasted by candlelight and rode away on a frosty foggy morning keeping our groom fifty yards to the rear a laughable sight with both his coatpockets bulging a couple of riversley turnover pasties in one and a bottle of champagne in the other for our lunch on the road now and then when near him we galloped for the fun of seeing him nurse the bottlepocket he was generally invisible temple did not think it strange that we should be riding out in an unknown world with only a little ring half a stonesthrow clear around us and blots of copse and queer vanishing cottages and hard grey meadows firtrees wonderfully magnified and larches and birches rigged like fairy ships all starting up to us as we passed and melting instantly one could have fancied the firtrees black torches and here the shoulder of a hill invited us to race up to the ridge some way on we came to crossroads careless of our luck in hitting the right one yonder hung a village church in the air and churchsteeple piercing ever so high and out of the heart of the mist leaped a brook and to hear it at one moment and then to have the sharp freezing silence in ones ear was piercingly weird it all tossed the mind in my head like hay on a pitchfork i forgot the existence of everything but what i loved passionatelyand that had no shape was like a wind up on a knoll of firs in the middle of a heath glowing rosy in the frost we dismounted to lunch leaning against the warm saddles temple and i and uberly our groom who reminded me of a certain tramp of my acquaintance in his decided preference of beer to champagne he drank though and sparkled after his draught no sooner were we on horseback againere the flanks of the dear friendly brutes were in any way coolthan temple shouted enthusiastically richie we shall do it yet ive been funking but now im sure we shall do it janet said whats the use of my coming over to dine at riversley if harry richmond and you dont come home before ten or eleven oclock i told her wed do it by dinnertime dont you like janet richiethat is if our horses hichaechocks didnt get strained on this hard nominativepluralmasculine of the article road dont you fancy yourself dining with the captain richie dative huic says old squire gregory i like to see him at dinner because he loves the smell of his wine oh its nothing to boast of but we did drink them under the table it cant be denied janet heard of it hulloa you talk of a huntingknife what do you say to a pair of skates here we are in for a frost of six weeks it strikes me a pair of skates this was the champagne in temple in me it did not bubble to speech and i soon drew him on at a pace that rendered conversation impossible uberly shouted after us to spare the horses legs we heard him twice out of the deepening fog i called to temple that he was right we should do it temple hurrahed rather breathlessly at the end of an hour i pulled up at an inn where i left the horses to be groomed and fed and walked away rapidly as if i knew the town temple following me with perfect confidence and indeed i had no intention to deceive him we entered a new station of a railway oh said temple the rest of the way by rail when the railway clerk asked me what place i wanted tickets for london sprang to my mouth promptly in a murmur and taking the tickets i replied to temple the rest of the way by rail uberlys sure to stop at that inn but my heart beat as the carriages slid away with us an affectionate commiseration for temple touched me when i heard him count on our being back at riversley in time to dress for dinner he laughed aloud at the idea of our plumping down on rippengers school getting a holiday for the boys tipping them and then off with julia exactly like two gods of the mythology apollo and mercury i often used to think they had the jolliest lives that ever were lived he said and trying to catch glimpses of the country and musing and singing he continued to feel like one of those blissful gods until wonder at the passage of time supervened amazement when he looked at my watch struck him dumb ten minutes later we were in yellow fog then in brown temple stared at both windows and at me he jumped from his seat and fell on it muttering no nonsense i say but he had accurately recognized londons fog i left him unanswered to bring up all his senses which the railway had outstripped for the contemplation of this fact that we two were in the city of london chapter xi the great fog and the fire at midnight it was london city and the bench was the kernel of it to me i throbbed with excitement though i sat looking out of the windows into the subterranean atmosphere quite still and firm when you think long undividedly of a single object it gathers light and when you draw near it in person the strange thing to your mind is the absence of that light but i approaching it in this dense fog seemed to myself to be only thinking of it a little more warmly than usual and instead of fading it reversed the process and became from light luminous not being able however to imagine the bench a happy place i corrected the excess of brightness and gave its walls a pinetorch glow i set them in the middle of a great square and hung the standard of england drooping over them in a sort of mournful family pride then because i next conceived it a foreign kind of place different altogether from that home growth of ours the tower of london i topped it with a multitude of domes of pumpkin or turban shape resembling the kremlin of moscow which had once leapt up in the eye of winter glowing like a million pinetorches and flung shadows of stretching red horses on the black smokedrift but what was the kremlin that had seen a city perish to this bench where my father languished there was no comparing them for tragic horror and the kremlin had snowfields around it this bench was caught out of sight hemmed in by an atmosphere thick as charon breathed it might as well be underground oh its london temple went on correcting his incorrigible doubts about it he jumped on the platform we had to call out not to lose one another i say richie this is london he said linking his arm in mine you know by the size of the station and besides theres the fog oh its london weve overshot it were positively in london i could spare no sympathy for his feelings and i did not respond to his inquiring looks now that we were here i certainly wished myself away though i would not have retreated and for awhile i was glad of the discomforts besetting me my step was hearty as i led on meditating upon asking some one the direction to the bench presently we had to walk and it was nothing but traversing on a slippery pavement atmospheric circles of black brown and brown red and sometimes a larger circle of pale yellow the colours of old bruised fruits medlars melons and the smell of them nothing is more desolate neither of us knew where we were nor where we were going we struggled through an interminable succession of squalid streets from the one lamp visible to its neighbour in the darkness you might have fancied yourself peering at the head of an old saint on a smoky canvas it was like the painting of light rather than light figures rushed by we saw no faces temple spoke solemnly our dinnerhour at home is halfpast six a streetboy overheard him and chaffed him temple got the worst of it and it did him good for he had the sweetest nature in the world we declined to be attended by linkboys they would have hurt our sense of independence possessed of a sovereign faith that by dint of resolution i should ultimately penetrate to the great square enclosing the bench i walked with the air of one who had the map of london in his eye and could thread it blindfold temple was thereby deceived into thinking that i must somehow have learnt the direction i meant to take and knew my way though at the slightest indication of my halting and glancing round his suspicions began to boil and he was for asking some one the name of the ground we stood on he murmured fellows get lost in london by this time he clearly understood that i had come to london on purpose he could not but be aware of the object of my coming and i was too proud and he still too delicate to allude to it the fog choked us perhaps it took away the sense of hunger by filling us as if we had eaten a dinner of soot we had no craving to eat until long past the dinnerhour in temples house and then i would rather have plunged into a bath and a bed than have been requested to sit at a feast temple too i fancy we knew we were astray without speaking of it temple said i wish we hadnt drunk that champagne it seemed to me years since i had tasted the delicious crushing of the sweet bubbles in my mouth but i did not blame them i was after my father he dear little fellow had no light ahead except his devotion to me he must have had a touch of conscious guilt regarding his recent behaviour enough to hold him from complaining formally he complained of a london without shops and lights wondered how any one could like to come to it in a fog and so forth and again regretted our having drunk champagne in the morning a sort of involuntary whimpering easily forgiven to him for i knew he had a gallant heart i determined as an act of signal condescension to accost the first person we met male or female for temples sake having come to this resolve which was to be an open confession that i had misled him wounding to my pride i hoped eagerly for the hearing of a footfall we were in a labyrinth of dark streets where no one was astir a wretched dog trotted up to us followed at our heels a short distance and left us as if he smelt no luck about us our cajoleries were unavailing to keep that miserable companion sinbad escaped from the pit by tracking a lynx i happened to remark temple would not hear of sinbad oh come were not mussulmen said he i declare richie if i saw a church open id go in and sleep there were you thinking of tracking the dog then beer may be had somewhere we shall have to find an hotel what can the time be i owed it to him to tell him so i climbed a lamppost and spelt out the hour by my watch when i descended we were three a man had his hands on temples shoulders examining his features now speak the man said roughly i was interposing but temple cried all right richie we are two to one the man groaned i asked him what he wanted my son ive lost my son the man replied and walked away and he would give no answer to our questions i caught hold of the lamppost overcome i meant to tell temple in response to the consoling touch of his hand that i hoped the poor man would discover his son but said instead i wish we could see the bench tonight temple exclaimed ah pretending by his tone of voice that we had recently discussed our chance of it and then he ventured to inform me that he imagined he had heard of the place being shut up after a certain hour of the night my heart felt released and gushed with love for him very well temple i said then well wait till tomorrow and strike out for some hotel now off we went at a furious pace saddlebanks goose was reverted to by both of us with an exchange of assurances that we should meet a dish the fellow to it before we slept as for life said i as soon as the sharp pace had fetched my breathing to a regular measure adventures are what i call life temple assented theyre capital if you only see the end of them we talked of ulysses and penelope temple blamed him for leaving calypso i thought ulysses was right otherwise we should have had no slaying of the suitors but temple shyly urged that to have a goddess caring for you and she was handsomer than penelope who must have been an oldish woman was something to make you feel as you do on a hunting morning when there are halfadozen ridinghabits speckling the fielda whole glorious day your own among them this view appeared to me very captivating save for an obstruction in my mind which was that goddesses were always conceived by me as statues they talked and they moved it was true but the touch of them was marble and they smiled and frowned but they had no variety they were never warm if i thought that muttered temple puffing at the raw fog he admitted he had thought just the contrary and that the cold had suggested to him the absurdity of leaving a goddess look here temple said i has it never struck you i wont say im like him its true ive always admired ulysses he could fight best talk best and plough and box and how clever he was take him all round who wouldnt rather have had him for a father than achilles and there were just as many women in love with him more said temple well then i continued thanking him in my heart for it must have cost him something to let ulysses be set above achilles telemachus is the one i mean he was in search of his father he found him at last upon my honour temple when i think of it im ashamed to have waited so long i call that luxury ive lived in senseless yes while i was uncertain whether my father had enough to eat or not i say hush temple breathed in pain at such allusions richie the squire has finished his bottle by about now bottle number two he wont miss us till the morning but miss beltham will shell be at your bedroom door three or four times in the night i know its getting darker and darker we must be in some dreadful part of london the contrast he presented to my sensations between our pleasant home and this foggy solitude gave me a pang of dismay i diverged from my favourite straight line which seemed to pierce into the bowels of the earth sharp to the right soon or late after i cannot tell we were in the midst of a thin stream of people mostly composed of boys and young women going at double time hooting and screaming with the delight of loosened animals not quite so agreeably but animals never hunted on a better scent a dozen turnings in their company brought us in front of a fire there we saw two houses preyed on by the flames just as if a lion had his paws on a couple of human creatures devouring them we heard his jaws the cracking of bones shrieks and the voracious inandout of his breath edged with anger a girl by my side exclaimed its not the bench after all would i have run to see a paltry twostory washerwomans manglingshed flare up when six pennorth of squibs and shavings and a cracker make twice the fun i turned to her hardly able to speak wheres the bench if you please she pointed i looked on an immense high wall the blunt flames of the fire opposite threw a sombre glow on it the girl said and dont you go hopping into debt my young cocksparrow or youll know one side o the turnkey better than t other she had a friend with her who chid her for speaking so freely is it too late to go in tonight i asked she answered that it was and that she and her friend were the persons to show me the way in there her friend answered more sensibly yes you cant go in there before some timein the morning i learnt from her that the bench was a debtors prison the saucy girl of the pair asked me for money i handed her a crownpiece now wont you give another big bit to my friend said she i had no change and the wellmannered girl bade me never mind the saucy one pressed for it and for a treat she was amusing in her talk of the quantity of different fires she had seen she had also seen accidentaldeath corpses but never a suicide in the act and here she regretted the failure of her experiences this conversation of a goodlooking girl amazed me presently temple cried a third house caught and no engines yet richie theres an old woman in her nightdress we cant stand by the saucy girl joked at the poor halfnaked old woman temple stood humping and agitating his shoulders like a cat before it springs both the girls tried to stop us the one i liked best seized my watch and said leave this to me to take care of and i had no time to wrestle for it i had a glimpse of her face that let me think she was not fooling me the watchchain flew off my neck temple and i clove through the crowd of gapers we got into the heat which was in a minute scorching three men were under the window they had sung out to the old woman above to drop a blanketshe tossed them a waterjug she was saved by the blanket of a neighbour temple and i strained at one corner of it to catch her she came down the men said like a singed turkey the flames illuminated her as she descended there was a great deal of laughter in the crowd but i was shocked temple shared the painful impression produced on me i cannot express my relief when the old woman was wrapped in the blanket which had broken her descent and stood like a blot instead of a figure i handed a sovereign to the three men complimenting them on the humanity of their dispositions they cheered us and the crowd echoed the cheer and temple and i made our way back to the two girls both of us lost our pockethandkerchiefs and temple a penknife as well then the engines arrived and soused the burning houses we were all in a crimson mist boys smoking girls laughing and staring men hallooing hats and caps flying about fights going on people throwing their furniture out of the windows the great wall of the bench was awful in its reflection of the labouring flamesit rose out of sight like the flametops till the columns of water brought them down i thought of my father and of my watch the two girls were not visible a glorious life a firemans said temple the firemen were on the roofs of the houses handsome as greek heroes and it really did look as if they were engaged in slaying an enormous dragon that hissed and tongued at them and writhed its tail paddling its broken big red wings in the pit of wreck and smoke twisting and darkeningsomething fine to conquer i felt with temple a mutual disgust at the inconvenience created by the appropriation of our pockethandkerchiefs by members of the crowd induced us to disentangle ourselves from it without confiding to any one our perplexity for supper and a bed we were now extremely thirsty i had visions of my majority bottles of burgundy lying under john threshers care at dipwell and would have abandoned them all for one on the spot after ranging about the outskirts of the crowd seeking the two girls we walked away not so melancholy but that a draught of porter would have cheered us temple punned on the loss of my watch and excused himself for a joke neither of us had spirit to laugh at just as i was saying with a last glance at the fire anyhow it would have gone in that crowd the nice good girl ran up behind us crying there as she put the watchchain over my head there temple said i didnt i tell you so and temple kindly supposed so the girl said i was afraid id missed you little fellow and youd take me for a thief and thank god im no thief yet i rushed into the crowd to meet you after you caught that old creature and i could have kissed you both youre so brave we always go in for it together said temple i made an offer to the girl of a piece of gold oh im poor she cried yet kept her hand off it like a bird alighting on ground not on prey when i compelled her to feel the money tight she sighed if i wasnt so poor i dont want your gold why are you out so late we informed her of our arrival from the country and wanderings in the fog and youll say youre not tired i know the girl remarked and laughed to hear how correctly she had judged of our temper our thirst and hunger however filled her with concern because of our not being used to it as she was and no place was open to supply our wants her friend the saucy one accompanied by a man evidently a sailor joined us and the three had a consultation away from temple and me at the end of which the sailor whose name was joe raised his leg dancingly and smacked it we gave him our hands to shake and understood without astonishment that we were invited on board his ship to partake of refreshment we should not have been astonished had he said on board his balloon down through thick fog of a lighter colour we made our way to a narrow lane leading to the riverside where two men stood thumping their arms across their breasts smoking pipes and swearing we entered a boat and were rowed to a ship i was not aware how frozen and befogged my mind and senses had become until i had taken a desperate and long gulp of smoking rumandwater and then the whole of our adventures from morning to midnight with the firtrees in the country fog and the lamps in the london fog and the man who had lost his son the fire the bench the old woman with her fowllike cry and limbs in the air and the row over the misty river swam flashing before my eyes and i cried out to the two girls who were drinking out of one glass with the sailor joe my entertainer well im awake now and slept straight off the next instant chapter xii we find ourselves bound on a voyage it seemed to me that i had but taken a turn from right to left or gone round a wheel when i repeated the same words and i heard temple somewhere near me mumble something like them he drew a long breath so did i we cleared our throats with a sort of whinny simultaneously the enjoyment of lying perfectly still refreshed incurious unexcited yet having our minds animated excursive reaping all the incidents of our lives at leisure and making a dream of our latest experiences kept us tranquil and incommunicative occasionally we let fall a sigh fathoms deep then byandby began blowing a bit of a wanton laugh at the end of it i raised my foot and saw the boot on it which accounted for an uneasy sensation setting in through my frame i said softly what a pleasure it must be for horses to be groomed just what i was thinking said temple we started up on our elbows and one or the other cried theres a chart these are bunks hark at the row overhead were in a ship the ships moving is it foggy this morning its time to get up ive slept in my clothes oh for a dip how i smell of smoke what a noise of a steamer and the squire at riversley fancy uberlys tale temple with averted face asked me whether i meant to return to riversley that day i assured him i would on my honour if possible and of course he also would have to return there why youve an appointment with janet ilchester said i and we may find a pug well buy the huntingknife and the skates and she shall know you saved an old womans life no dont talk about that temple entreated me biting his lip richie were going fast through the water it reminds me of breakfast i should guess the hour to be nine am my watch was unable to assist us the hands pointed to halfpast four and were fixed we ran up on deck looking over the stern of the vessel across a line of rippling eddying red gold we saw the sun low upon cushions of beautiful cloud no trace of fog anywhere blue sky overhead and a mild breeze blowing sunrise i said temple answered yes most uncertainly we looked round a steamtug was towing our ship out toward banks of redreflecting cloud and a smell of sea air why thats the east there cried temple we faced about to the sun and behold he was actually sinking nonsense we exclaimed in a breath from seaward to this stupefying sunset we stood staring the river stretched to broad lengths gulls were on the grey water knots of seaweed and the seafoam curled in advance of us by jingo temple spoke out musing heres a whole day struck out of our existence it cant be said i for that any sensible being could be tricked of a piece of his life in that manner i thought a preposterous notion but the sight of a lessening windmill in the west shadows eastward the wide water and the air now full salt convinced me we two had slept through an entire day and were passing rapidly out of hail of our native land we must get these fellows to put us on shore at once said temple we wont stop to eat theres a town a boat will row us there in halfanhour then we can wash too ive got an idea nothings clean here and confound these fellows for not having the civility to tell us they were going to start we were rather angry a little amused not in the least alarmed at our position a sailor to whom we applied for an introduction to the captain said he was busy another gave us a similar reply with a monstrous grimace which was beyond our comprehension the sailor joe was nowhere to be seen none of the sailors appeared willing to listen to us though they stopped as they were running by to lend half an ear to what we had to say some particular movement was going on in the ship temple was the first to observe that the steamtug was casting us loose and cried he shell take us on board and back to london bridge lets hail her he sang out whoop ahoy i meanwhile had caught sight of joe well young gentleman he accosted me and he hoped i had slept well my courteous request to him to bid the tug stand by to take us on board only caused him to wear a look of awful gravity youre such a deuce of a sleeper he said you see we had to be off early to make up for forty hours lost by that there fog i tried to wake you both no good so i let you snore away we took up our captain midway down the river and now youre in his hands and hell do what he likes with you and thats a fact and my opinion is yous see a foreign shore before youre in the arms of your family again at these words i had the horrible sensation of being caged and worse transported into the bargain i insisted on seeing the captain a big bright round moon was dancing over the vessels bowsprit and this together with the tug thumping into the distance and the land receding gave mecoming on my wrathsuffocating emotions no difficulties were presented in my way i was led up to a broad man in a pilotcoat who stood square and looked by the bend of his eyebrows as if he were always making head against a gale he nodded to my respectful salute cabin he said and turned his back to me i addressed him excuse me i want to go on shore captain i must and will go i am here by some accident you have accidentally overlooked me here i wish to treat you like a gentleman but i wont be detained joe spoke a word to the captain who kept his back as broad to me as a schoolslate for geography and euclids propositions cabin cabin the captain repeated i tried to get round him to dash a furious sentence or so in his face since there was no producing any impression on his back but he occupied the whole of a way blocked with wirecoil and rope and boxes and it would have been ridiculous to climb this barricade when by another rightaboutface he could in a minute leave me volleying at the blank space between his shoulders joe touched my arm which in as friendly a way as i could assume i bade him not do a second time for i could ill contain myself as it was and beginning to think i had been duped and tricked i was ready for hostilities i could hardly bear meeting temple on my passage to the cabin captain jasper welsh he was reiterating as if sounding it to discover whether it had an ominous ring it was the captains name that he had learnt from one of the seamen irritated by his repetition of it i said i know not why or how the words came a highwayman notorious for his depredations in the vicinity of the city of bristol this set temple off laughing and so he bought a ship and had traps laid down to catch young fellows for ransom i was obliged to request temple not to joke but the next moment i had launched captain jasper welsh on a piratical exploit temple lifted the veil from his history revealing him amid the excesses of a cannibal feast i dragged him before a british jury temple hanged him in view of an excited multitude as he boasted that there was the end of captain welsh i broke the rope but temple spoiled my triumph by depriving him of the use of his lower limbs after the fall for he was a heavy man i could not contradict it and therefore pitched all his ships crew upon the gallows in a rescue temple allowed him to be carried off by his faithful ruffians only stipulating that the captain was never after able to release his neck from the hangmans slip knot the consequence was that he wore a shirtcollar up to his eyebrows for concealment by day and a pillowcase over his head at night and his wife said she was a deceived unhappy woman and died of curiosity the talking of even such nonsense as this was a relief to us in our impatience and helplessness with the lights of land heaving far distant to our fretful sight through the cabin windows when we had to talk reasonably we were not so successful captain welsh was one of those men who show you whether you care to see them or not all the processes by which they arrive at an idea of you upon which they forthwith shape their course thus when he came to us in the cabin he took the oillamp in his hand and examined our faces by its light he had no reply to our remonstrances and petitions all he said was humph well i suppose youre both gentlemen born and he insisted on prosecuting his scrutiny without any reference to the tenour of our observations we entreated him half imperiously to bring his ship to and put us on shore in a boat he bunched up his mouth remarking know their grammar habit o speaking to grooms eh humph we offered to pay largely loose o their cash was his comment and so on and he was the more exasperating to us because he did not look an evilminded man only he appeared to be cursed with an evil opinion of us i tried to remove it i spoke forbearingly temple imitating me was sugarsweet we exonerated the captain from blame excused him for his error named the case a mistake on both sides that long sleep of ours we said was really something laughable we laughed at the recollection of it a lamentable piece of merriment our artfulness and patience becoming exhausted for the captain had vouchsafed us no direct answer i said at last captain welsh here we are on board your ship will you tell us what you mean to do with us he now said bluntly i will youll behave like a man of honour said i and to that he cried vehemently i will well then said i call out the boat if you please were anxious to be home so you shall the captain shouted and per shipmy barque priscilla and better men than you left or im no christian temple said briskly thank you captain you may wait awhile with that my lad he answered and to our astonishment recommended us to go and clean our faces and prepare to drink some tea at his table thank you very much captain well do that when were on shore said we youll have black figureheads and empty gizzards then by that time he remarked we beheld him turning over the leaves of a bible now this sight of the bible gave me a sense of personal security and a notion of hypocrisy in his conduct as well and perceiving that we had conjectured falsely as to his meaning to cast us on shore per ship his barque priscilla i burst out in great heat what we are prisoners you dare to detain us temple chimed in in a similar strain fairly enraged we flung at him without anything of what i thought eloquence the captain ruminated up and down the columns of his bible i was stung to feel that we were like two small terriers baiting a huge mild bull at last he said the story of the prodigal son oh groaned temple at the mention of this wornout old fellow who has gone in harness to tracts ever since he ate the fatted calf but the captain never heeded his interruption young gentlemen ive finished it while youve been barking at me if id had him early in life on board my vessel i hope im not presumptuous in sayingthe lord forgive me if i be soid have stopped his downward careeray sowith a trip in the right direction the lord young gentlemen has not thrown you into my hands for no purpose whatsoever thank him on your knees tonight and thank joseph double my mate when you rise for he was the instrument of saving you from bad company if this was a vessel where youd hear an oath or smell the smell of liquor id have let you run when there was terra firma within stones throw i came on board i found you both asleep with those marks of dissipation round your eyes and i sworein the lords name mind youid help pluck you out of the pit while you had none but one leg in its said its no use barking i am not to be roused the devil in me is chained by the waist and a twentypound weight on his tongue with your assistance ill do the same for the devil in you since youve had plenty of sleep ill trouble you to commit to memory the whole story of the prodigal son twixt now and morrows sunrise wes have our commentary on it after labour done labour you will in my vessel for your souls health and let me advise you not to talk in your situation talkings temptation to lying youll do me the obligation to feed at my table and when i hand you back to your parents why theyll thank me if you wont but its not thanks i look for its my bounden christian duty i look to i reckon a couple o stray lambs equal to one lost sheep the captain uplifted his arm ejaculating solemnly by and faltered you were going to swear said temple with savage disdain by the blessing of omnipotence ill save a pair o pups from turning wolves and im a weak mortal man thats too true he was going to swear temple muttered to me i considered the detection of captain welshs hypocrisy unnecessary almost a condescension toward familiarity but the ire in my bosom was boiling so that i found it impossible to roll out the flood of eloquence with which i was big soon after i was trying to bribe the man with all my money and my watch who gave you that watch said he downright church catechism muttered temple my grandfather said i the captains head went like a mechanical hammer to express something indescribable my grandfather i continued will pay you handsomely for any service you do to me and my friend now thats not far off forgoing said the captain in a tone as much as to say we were bad all over i saw the waters slide by his cabinwindows my desolation my humiliation my chained fury tumbled together out it came captain do behave to us like a gentleman and you shall never repent it our relatives will be miserable about us theycaptainthey dont know where we are we havent even a change of clothes of course we know were at your mercy but do behave like an honest man you shall be paid or not just as you please for putting us on shore but we shall be eternally grateful to you of course you mean kindly to us we see that i thank the lord for it he interposed only you really are under a delusion its extraordinary you cant be quite in your right senses about us you must bei dont mean to speak disrespectfullywhat we call on shore cracked about us doddered dont they say in one of the shires he remarked halfencouraged and in the belief that i might be getting eloquent i appealed to his manliness why should he take advantage of a couple of boys i struck the key of his possible fatherly feelings what misery were not our friends suffering now ay a bucketful now saves an ocean in time to come he flung in his word i bade him with more pathetic dignity reflect on the dreadful hiatus in our studies is that latin or greek he asked i would not reply to the coldblooded question he said the new testament was written in greek he knew and happy were those who could read it in the original well and how can we be learning to read it on board ship said temple an observation that exasperated me because it seemed more to the point than my lengthy speech and betrayed that he thought so however i took it up how can we be graduating for our sphere in life captain welsh on board your vessel tell us that he played thumb and knuckles on his table just when i was hoping that good would come of the senseless tune temple cried tell us what your exact intentions are captain welsh what do you mean to do with us mean to take you the voyage out and the voyage home providence willing said the captain and he rose we declined his offer of tea though i fancy we could have gnawed at a bone theres no compulsion in that matter he said you share my cabin while youre my guests shipmates and apprentices in the path of living my cabin and my substance the same as if you were what the northcountrymen call bairns o mine ive none o my own my wife was a barren woman ive none but my old mother at home have your sulks out lads youll come round like the priscilla on a tack and discover youve made way by it we quitted his cabin bowing stiffly temple declared old rippenger was better than this canting rascal the sea was around us a distant yellow twinkle telling of land his wife a barren woman whats that to us temple went on exploding at intervals so was sarah his cabin and his substance he talks more like a preacher than a sailor i should like to see him in a storm hes no sailor at all his men hate him it wouldnt be difficult to get up a mutiny on board this ship richie i understand the whole plot hes in want of cabinboys the fellow has impressed us we shall have to serve till we touch land thank god theres a british consul everywhere i say that seriously i love my country may she always be powerful my life is always at herdid you feel that pitch of the ship of all the names ever given to a vessel i do think priscilla is without exception the most utterly detestable oh there again no itll be too bad richie if were beaten in this way if you are beaten said i scarcely venturing to speak lest i should cry or be sick we both felt that the vessel was conspiring to ruin our selfrespect i set my head to think as hard as possible on latin verses my instinct must have drawn me to them as to a species of intellectual biscuit steeped in spirit tough and comforting and fundamentally opposed to existing circumstances otherwise i cannot account for the attraction they helped me for a time they kept off selfpity and kept the machinery of the mind at work they lifted me as it were to an upper floor removed from the treacherously sighing priscilla but i came down quickly with a crash no dexterous management of my mental resources could save me from the hemplike smell of the ship nor would leaning over the taffrail nor lying curled under a tarpaulin the sailors heaped pilotcoats upon us it was a bad ship they said to be sick on board of for no such thing as brandy was allowed in the old priscilla still i am sure i tasted some before i fell into a state of semiinsensibility as in a trance i heard temples moans and the captains voice across the gusty wind and the forlorn crunching of the ship down great waves the captains figure was sometimes stooping over us more greatcoats were piled on us sometimes the wind whistled thinner than one fancies the shrieks of creatures dead of starvation and restless that spend their souls in a shriek as long as they can hold it on say nurserymaids the ship made a truce with the waters and grunted we took two or three playful blows we were drenched with spray uphill we laboured we caught the moon in a net of rigging away we plunged we mounted to plunge again and again i reproached the vessel in argument for some imaginary inconsistency memory was like a heavy barrel on my breast rolling with the sea chapter xiii we conduct several learned arguments with the captain of the priscilla captain welsh soon conquered us the latest meal we had eaten was on the frosty common under the firtrees after a tremendous fast with seasickness supervening the eggs and bacon and pleasant benevolentsmelling tea on the captains table were things not to be resisted by two healthy boys who had previously stripped and faced buckets of maddening icecold saltwater dashed at us by a jolly sailor an open mind for new impressions came with the warmth of our clothes we ate bearing within us the souls of injured innocents nevertheless we were thankful and to the captains grace a long one we bowed heads decently it was a glorious breakfast for which land and sea had prepared us in about equal degrees i confess my feelings when i jumped out of the cabin were almost those of one born afresh to life and understanding temple and i took counsel we agreed that sulking would be ridiculous unmanly ungentlemanly the captain had us fast as if we were under a lions paw he was evidently a wellmeaning man a fanatic deluded concerning our characters the barque priscilla was bound for a german port and should arrive there in a few dayswhy not run the voyage merrily since we were treated with kindness neither the squire nor temples father could complain of our conduct we were simply victims of an error that was assisting us to a knowledge of the world a youths proper ambition and were not going to be starved said temple i smiled thinking i perceived the reason why i had failed in my oration overnight so i determined that on no future occasion would i let pride stand in the way of provender breakfast had completely transformed us we held it due to ourselves that we should demand explanations from joseph double the mate and then after hearing him furnish them with a cordial alacrity to which we might have attached unlimited credence had he not protested against our dreaming him to have supplied hot rumandwater on board we wrote our names and addresses in the captains logbook and immediately asked permission to go to the masthead he laughed out of his cabin there was no smack of the preacher in him his men said he was a stout seaman mad on the subject of grog and girls why it was on account of grog and girls that he was giving us this dish of saltwater to purify us grog and girls cried we we vowed upon our honour as gentlemen we had tasted grog for the first time in our lives on board the priscilla how about the girls they asked we informed them we knew none but girls who were ladies thereupon one sailor nodded one sent up a crow one said the misfortune of the case lay in all girls being such precious fine ladies and one spoke in dreadfully blank language he accused us of treating the priscilla as a tavern for the entertainment of bad company stating that he had helped to row me and my associates from the shore to the ship poor mr double says he there was only one way for him to jump you two young gentlemen out o that snapdragon bowl you was inor quashmire call it so he ticed you on board wi the bait you was swallowing which was making the devil serve the lords turn and ill remember that night for i yielded to swearing and drank too the other sailors roared with laughter i tipped them not to appear offended by their suspicions we thought them all hypocrites and were as much in error as if we had thought them all honest things went fairly well with the exception of the lessons in scripture our work was mere playing at sailoring helping furl sails haul ropes study charts carry messages and such like temple made his voice shrewdly emphatic to explain to the captain that we liked the work but that such lessons as these out of scripture were what the eeriest youngsters were crammed with such lessons as these maybe dont have the meaning on land they get to have on the high seas replied the captain and those youngsters you talk of were not called in to throw a light on passages for i may teach you ships business aboard my barque but were all children inside the book he groaned heartily to hear that our learning lay in the direction of pagan gods and goddesses and heathen historians and poets adding it was not new to him and perhaps that was why the world was as it was nor did he wonder he said at our running from studies of those filthy writings loose upon london it was as natural as dunghill steam temple pretended he was forced by the captains undue severity to defend venus he said i thought rather wittily sailors ought to have a respect for her for she was born in the middle of the sea and she steered straight for land so she must have had a pretty good idea of navigation but the captain answered none the less keenly she had her idea of navigating as the devil of mischief always has in the direction where theres most to corrupt and my lad she teaches the navigation that leads to the bottom beneath us he might be right still our mien was evil in reciting the lessons from scripture and though captain welsh had intelligence we could not draw into it the how and the why of the indignity we experienced we had rather he had been a savage captain to have braced our spirits to sturdy resistance instead of a mild goodhumoured man of kind intentions who lent us his linen to wear fed us at his table and taxed our most gentlemanly feelings to find excuses for him our way of revenging ourselves becomingly was to laud the heroes of antiquity as if they had possession of our souls and touched the fountain of worship whenever captain welsh exclaimed well done or the equivalent thats an idea we referred him to plutarch for our great exemplar it was alcibiades gracefully consuming his black broth that won the captains thanks for theological acuteness or the young telemachus suiting his temper to the dolphins moods since he must somehow get on shore on the dolphins back captain welsh could not perceive in temple the personifier of alcibiades nor telemachus in me but he was aware of an obstinate obstruction behind our compliance this he called the devil coiled like a snake in its winter sleep he hurled texts at it openly or slyly dropped a particularly heavy one in the hope of surprising it with a deathblow we beheld him poring over his bible for texts that should be sovereign medicines for us deadly for the devil within us consequently we were on the defensive bits of cicero bits of seneca soundly and nobly moral did service on behalf of paganism we remembered them certainly almost as if an imp had brought them from afar nor had we any desire to be in opposition to the cause he supported what we were opposed to was the dogmatic arrogance of a just but ignorant man who had his one specific for everything and saw mortal sickness in all other remedies or recreations temple said to him if the archbishop of canterbury were to tell me greek and latin authors are bad for me i should listen to his remarks because hes a scholar he knows the languages and knows what they contain captain welsh replied if the archbishop o canterbury sailed the sea and lived in foul alley waterside when on shore and so felt what it is to toss on top of the waves o perdition hed understand the value of a big clean wellmanned wellprovisioned ship instead o your galliots wi gaudy sails your barges that cant rise to a sea your yachts that run to port like mothers pets at first pipe o the storm your trimbuilt wherries so youd have only one sort of vessel afloat said i theres the difference of a man whos a scholar id have said the captain every lad like you my lad trained in the big ship and he wouldnt capsize and be found betrayed by his light timbers as i found you serve your apprenticeship in the lords threedecker then to command what you may no no captain welsh says temple you must grind at latin and greek when youre a chick or you wont ever master the rudiments upon my honour i declare its the truth you must if youd like to try and are of a mind for a go at greek well do our best to help you through the aorists it looks harder than latin but after a start its easier only im afraid your threedeckers apprenticeship ll stand in your way greek s to be done for me i can pay clever gentlemen for doing greek for me said the captain the knowledge and the love of virtue i must do for myself and not to be wrecked i must do it early well thats neither learning nor human nature said i its the knowledge o the right rules for human nature my lad would you kidnap youngsters to serve in your ship captain id bless the wind that blew them there foul or not my lad and there theyd stick when you had them captain id think it was the lords will they should stick there awhile my ladyes and what of their parents youngsters out like gossamers on a wind their parents are where they sow themselves my lad i call that hard on the real parents captain welsh said temple its harder on providence when parents breed that kind o light creature my lad we were all getting excited talking our best such as it was the captain leaning over his side of the table clasping his hands unintentionally preacherlike we on our side supporting our chins on our fists quick to be at him temple was brilliant he wanted to convert the captain and avowed it for said he youre not like one of those tractfellows youre a man we can respect a good seaman master of your ship and hearty and no mewing sanctimoniousness and we can see and excuse your mistake as to us two but now theres my father at homehes a good man but hes a man of the world and reads his classics and his bible hes none the worse for it i assure you where was his son the night of the fog said the captain well he happened to be out in it whered he be now but for one o my men who can answer that captain welsh i can my ladstewing in an anteroom of hellgates i verily believe temple sighed at the captains infatuation and said ill tell you of a fellow at our school named drew he was old rippengers best theological scholaralways got the prize for theology well he was a confirmed sneak ive taken him into a corner and described the torments of dying to him and his look was disgustinghe broke out in a clammy sweat dont dont hed cry youre just the fellow to suffer intensely i told him and what was his idea of escaping it why by learning the whole of deuteronomy and the acts of the apostles by heart his idea of judgement day was old rippengers halfyearly examination these are facts you know captain welsh i testified to them briefly the captain said a curious thing ill make an appointment with you in leviathans jaws the night of a storm my lad with pleasure said temple the lord send it exclaimed the captain his head was bent forward and he was gazing up into his eyebrows before we knew that anything was coming he was out on a narrative of a scholar of one of the universities our ears were indifferent to the young mans career from the heights of fortune to delirium tremens down the cataract of brandy until the captain spoke of a dark night on the pool of the thames and here his voice struggled and we tried hard to catch the thread of the tale two men and a girl were in the boat the men fought the girl shrieked the boat was upset the three were drowned all this came so suddenly that nothing but the captains heavy thump of his fist on the table kept us from laughing he was quite unable to relate the tale and we had to gather it from his exclamations one of the men was mate of a vessel lying in the pool having only cast anchor that evening the girl was his sweetheart the other man had once been a fine young university gentleman and had become an outfitters drunken agent the brave sailor had nourished him often when on shore and he with the fluent tongue which his college had trimmed for him had led the girl to sin during her lovers absence howsoever they put off together to welcome him on his arrival never suspecting that their secret had been whispered to robert welsh beforehand howsoever robert gave them hearty greeting and down to the cabin they went and there sat drinking up to midnight three lost souls said the captain see how they run temple sang half audibly and flushed hot ashamed of himself twas i had to bear the news to his mother the captain pursued and it was a task my lads for i was then little more than your age and the glass was roberts only fault and he was my only brother i offered my hand to the captain he grasped it powerfully that crew in a boat and wouldnt you know the devild be coxswain he called loudly and buried his face no he said looking up at us i pray for no storm but by the lords mercy for a way to your hearts through fire or water and now on deck my lads while your beds are made up three blind things we verily are captain welsh showed he was sharp of hearing his allusion to the humming of the tune of the mice gave temple a fit of remorse and he apologized ay said the captain it is so own it frivolitys the fruit of that training thats all for the flesh but dip you into some o my books on my shelves here and learn to see living man half skeleton like life and shadow and never to living man need you pray forgiveness my lad by sheer force of character he gained the command of our respect though we agreed on deck that he had bungled his story it impressed us we felt less able to cope with him and less willing to encounter a storm we shall have one of course temple said affecting resignation with a glance aloft i was superstitiously of the same opinion and praised the vessel oh priscillas the very name of a ship that founders with all hands and sends a bottle on shore said temple there isnt a bottle on board said i and this piece of nonsense helped us to sleep off our gloom chapter xiv i meet old friends notwithstanding the prognostications it pleased us to indulge we had a tolerably smooth voyage on a clear cold sunday morning we were sailing between a foreign rivers banks and temple and i were alternately reading a chapter out of the bible to the assembled ships crew in advance of the captains short exhortation we had ceased to look at ourselves inwardly and we hardly thought it strange but our hearts beat for a view of the great merchant city which was called a free city and therefore temple suggested must bear certain portions of resemblance to old england so we made up our minds to like it a wonderful place for beer cellars a sailor observed to us slyly and hitched himself up from the breech to the scalp at all events it was a place where we could buy linen for that purpose captain welsh handed us over to the care of his trusted mate mr joseph double and we were soon in the streets of the city desirous of purchasing half their contents my supply of money was not enough for what i deemed necessary purchases temple had split his clothes mine were tarred we were appearing at a disadvantage and we intended to dine at a good hotel and subsequently go to a theatre yet i had no wish to part with my watch mr double said it might be arranged it was pawned at a shop for a sum equivalent in our money to about twelve pounds and temple obliged me by taking charge of the ticket thus we were enabled to dress suitably and dine pleasantly and as mr double remarked no one could rob me of my gold watch now we visited a couple of beercellars to taste the drink of the people and discovered three of our men engaged in a similar undertaking i proposed that it should be done at my expense they praised their captain but asked us as gentlemen and scholars whether it was reasonable to object to liquor because your brother was carried out on a high tide mr double commended them to moderation their reply was to estimate an immoderate amount of liquor as due to them with profound composure those rascals mr double informed us are not in the captains confidence theyre tidy seamen though and they submit to the captains laws on board and have their liberty ashore we inquired what the difference was between their privileges and his why said he if theyre so much as accused of a disobedient act off theyre scurried and lose fair wages and a kind captain and let any man jack of em accuse me and he bounds a indiarubber ball against a wall and gets it all he meant to give he gets once you fix the confidence of your superior youre waterproof we held our peace but we could have spoken mr double had no moral hostility toward theatres supposing he did not relish the performance he could enjoy a spell in the open air he said and this he speedily decided to do had we not been bound in honour to remain for him to fetch us we also should have retired from a representation of which we understood only the word ja it was tiresome to be perpetually waiting for the return of this word we felt somewhat as dogs must feel when human speech is addressed to them accordingly we professed without concealment to despise the whole performance i reminded temple of a saying of the emperor charles v as to a knowledge of languages hem he went critically its all very well for a german to talk in that way but you cant be five times an englishman if youre a foreigner we heard english laughter near us presently an english gentleman accosted us mr villiers i believe he bowed at me my name is richmond he bowed again with excuses talked of the play and telegraphed to a lady sitting in a box fronting us i saw that she wrote on a slip of paper she beckoned the gentleman quitted us and soon after placed a twisted note in my hand it ran miss goodwin whose christian name is clara wishes very much to know how it has fared with mr harry richmond since he left venice i pushed past a number of discontented knees trying on my way to her box to recollect her vividly but i could barely recollect her at all until i had sat beside her five minutes colonel goodwin was asleep in a corner of the box awakened by the sound of his native tongue he recognized me immediately on your way to your father he said as he shook my hand i thought it amazing he should guess that in germany do you know where he is sir i asked we saw him replied the colonel when was it clara a week or ten days ago yes said miss goodwin we will talk of that byandby and she overflowed with comments on my personal appearance and plied me with questions but would answer none of mine i fetched temple into the box to introduce him we were introduced in turn to captain malet the gentleman who had accosted me below you understand german then said miss goodwin she stared at hearing that we knew only the word ja for it made our presence in germany unaccountable the most dangerous word of all said colonel goodwin and begged us always to repeat after it the negative nein for an antidote you have both seen my father i whispered to miss goodwin both we have been separated do tell me everything dont look at the stagethey speak such nonsense how did you remember me how happy i am to have met you oh i havent forgotten the gondolas and the striped posts and stali and the other word but soon after we were separated and i havent seen him since she touched her fathers arm at once if you like said he jumping up erect in germany was it i persisted she nodded gravely and leaned softly on my arm while we marched out of the theatre to her hoteli in such a state of happiness underlying bewilderment and strong expectation that i should have cried out loud had not pride in my partner restrained me at her teatable i narrated the whole of my adventure backwards to the time of our parting in venice hurrying it over as quick as i could with the breathless termination and now they had an incomprehensible reluctance to perform their part of the implied compact miss goodwin looked at captain malet he took his leave then she said how glad i am you have dropped that odious name of roy papa and i have talked of you frequentlylatterly very often i meant to write to you harry richmond i should have done it the moment we returned to england you must know said the colonel that i am an amateur inspector of fortresses and my poor clara has to trudge the continent with me to pick up the latest inventions in artillery and other matters for which i get no thanks at headquartersbut its one way of serving ones country when the steel lies rusting we are now for home by way of paris i hope that you and your friend will give us your company i will see this captain welsh of yours before we start clara you decided on dragging me to the theatre tonight with your usual admirable instinct i reminded miss goodwin of my father being in germany yes he is at one of the courts a long distance from here she said rapidly and you came by accident in a merchantship you are one of those who are marked for extraordinary adventures confess you would have set eyes on me and not known me its a miracle that i should meet my little friend harrylittle no longer my friend all the same are you not i hoped so ardently she with great urgency added then come with us prove that you put faith in our friendship in desperation i exclaimed but i must i must hear of my father she turned to consult the colonels face certainly he said and eulogized a loving son clara will talk to you im for bed what was the name of the play we saw this evening oh struensee to be sure we missed the scaffold he wished us goodnight on an appointment of the hour for breakfast and ordered beds for us in the hotel miss goodwin commenced but really i have nothing to tell you or very little you know papa has introductions everywhere we are like continental people and speak a variety of languages and i am almost a foreigner we are so much abroad but i do think english boys should be educated at home i hope youll go to an english college noticing my painful look we saw him at the court of the prince of eppenwelzen she said as if her brows ached he is very kindly treated there he was there some weeks ago the place lies out in the hanover direction far from here he told us that you were with your grandfather and i must see riversley grange and the truth is you must take me there i suspect you have your peace to make perhaps i shall help you and be a true peribanou we go over amsterdam the hague brussels and you shall see the battlefield paris straight to london yes you are fickle you have not once called me peribanou her voluble rattling succeeded in fencing off my questions before i could exactly shape them as i staggered from blind to blind idea now thinking of the sombre red bench and now of the german princes court wont you tell me any more tonight i said when she paused indeed i have not any more to tell she assured me it was clear to me that she had joined the mysterious league against my father i began to have a choking in the throat i thanked her and wished her goodnight while i was still capable of smiling at my next interview with colonel goodwin he spoke promptly on the subject of my wanderings i was of an age he said to know my own interests no doubt filial affection was excellent in its way but in fact it was highly questionable whether my father was still at the court of this german prince my father had stated that he meant to visit england to obtain an interview with his son and i might miss him by a harumscarum chase over germany and besides was i not offending my grandfather and my aunt to whom i owed so much he appealed to my warmest feelings on their behalf this was just the moment he said when there was a turningpoint in my fortunes he could assure me most earnestly that i should do no good by knocking at this princes doors and have nothing but bitterness if i did in the end discover my father surely you understand the advantages of being bred a gentleman he wound up under your grandfathers care you have a career before you a fine fortune in prospect everything a young man can wish for and i must tell you candidly you run great risk of missing all these things by hunting your father to earth give yourself a little time reflect on it i have i cried i have come out to find him and i must the colonel renewed his arguments and persuasions until he was worn out i thanked him continually for his kindness clara goodwin besought me in a surprising manner to accompany her to england called herself peribanou and with that name conjured up my father to my eyes in his breathing form she said as her father had done that i was called on now to decide upon my future she had a presentiment that evil would come to me of my unchecked headstrong will which she dignified by terming it a true but reckless affection she believed she had been thrown in my path to prove herself a serviceable friend a peribanou of twentysix who would not expect me to marry her when she had earned my gratitude they set temple on me and that was very funny to hear him with his i say richie come perhaps its as well to know where a thing should stop your father knows youre at riversley and hell be after you when convenient and just fancy the squire was laughable he had some anxiety to be home again or at least at riversley i offered him to miss goodwin she reproached me and coaxed me she was exceedingly sweet well she said in an odd resigned fashion rest a day with us will you refuse me that i consented she knew not with what fretfulness we went out to gaze at the shops and edifices and i bought two light bags for slinging over the shoulder two nightshirts toothbrushes and pocketcombs and a large map of germany by dint of vehement entreaties i led her to point to the territory of the prince of eppenwelzensarkeld his income is rather less than that of your grandfather friend harry she remarked i doated on the spot until i could have dropped my finger on it blindfold two or three pitched battles brought us to a friendly arrangement the colonel exacted my promise that if i saw my father at sarkeld in eppenwelzen i would not stay with him longer than seven days and that if he was not there i would journey home forthwith when i had yielded the promise frankly on my honour he introduced me to a banker of the city who agreed to furnish me money to carry me on to england in case i should require it a diligence engaged to deliver me within a few miles of sarkeld i wrote a letter to my aunt dorothy telling her facts and one to the squire beginning we were caught on our arrival in london by the thickest fog ever remembered as if it had been settled on my departure from riversley that temple and i were bound for london miss goodwin was my postbag she said when we had dined about two hours before the starting of the diligence dont you think you ought to go and wish that captain of the vessel you sailed in goodbye i fell into her plot so far as to walk down to the quays on the riverside and reconnoitre the ship but there i saw my prison i kissed my hand to captain welshs mainmast rather ironically though not without regard for him miss goodwin lifted her eyelids at our reappearance as she made no confession of her treason i did not accuse her and perhaps it was owing to a movement of her conscience that at our parting she drew me to her near enough for a kiss to come of itself fourandtwenty german words of essential service to a traveller in germany constituted our knowledge of the language and these were on paper transcribed by miss goodwins own hand in the gloom of the diligence packed between germans of a size that not even tacitus had prepared me for smoked over from all sides it was a fascinating study temple and i exchanged the paper halfhourly while the light lasted when that had fled nothing was left us to combat the sensation that we were in the depths of a manurebed for the windows were closed the tobaccosmoke thickened the hides of animals wrapping our immense companions reeked fire occasionally glowed in their pipebowls they were silent and gave out smoke and heat incessantly like inanimate forces of nature i had most fantastic ideasthat i had taken root and ripened and must expect my head to drop off at any instant that i was deep down wedged in the solid mass of the earth but i need not repeat them they were accurately translated in imagination from my physical miseries the dim revival of light when i had wellnigh ceased to hope for it showed us all like malefactors imperfectly hanged or drowned wretches in a cabin under water i had one colossus bulging over my shoulder temple was blotted out his face emerging from beneath a block of curly bearskin was like that of one frozen in wonderment outside there was a melting snow on the higher hills the clouds over them grew steelblue we were going through a valley in a firforest chapter xv we are accosted by a beautiful little lady in the forest bowls of hot coffee and milk with white rolls of bread to dip in them refreshed us at a forest inn for some minutes after the meal temple and i talked like interchangeing puffs of steam but soon subsided to our staring fit the pipes were lit again what we heard sounded like a language of the rocks and caves and roots plucked up a language of gluttons feasting the word ja was like a door always on the hinge in every mouth dumpy children bulky men compressed old women with baked faces and comical squat dogs kept the villages partly alive we observed one young urchin sitting on a stone opposite a dog and he and the dog took alternate bites off a plattershaped cake big enough to require both his hands to hold it whether the dog ever snapped more than his share was matter of speculation to us it was an education for him in good manners and when we were sitting at dinner we wished our companions had enjoyed it they fed with their heads in their plates splashed and clattered jaws without paying us any hospitable attention whatever so that we had the dish of lazarus they were perfectly kind notwithstanding and allowed a portion of my great map of germany to lie spread over their knees in the diligence whilst temple and i pored along the lines of the rivers one would thrust his squarenailed finger to the name of a city and pronounce it one gave us lessons in the expression of the vowels with the softening of three of them which seemed like a regulation drill movement for taking an egg into the mouth and showing repentance of the act sarkeld we exclaimed mutually and they made a galloping motion of their hands pointing beyond the hills sarkeld was to the right sarkeld to the left as the road wound on sarkeld was straight in front of us when the conductor according to directions he had received requested us to alight and push through this endless firforest up a hilly branch road and away his hand galloped beyond it coming to a deep place and then to grapes then to a tiptoe station and under it lay sarkeld the pantomime was not bad we waved our hand to the diligence and set out cheerfully with our bags at our backs entering a gorge in the fircovered hills before sunset after starting the propositiondoes the sun himself look foreign in a foreign country yes he does said temple and so i thought but denied it for by the suns favour i hoped to see my father that night and hail apollo joyfully in the morning a hope that grew with exercise of my limbs beautiful cascades of dark bright water leaped down the gorge we chased an invisible animal suddenly one of us exclaimed were in a german forest and we remembered grim tales of these forests their awful castles barons knights ladies longbearded dwarfs gnomes and thin people i commenced a legend offhand no no said temple as if curdling lets call this place the mouth of hades greek things dont make you feel funny i laughed louder than was necessary and remarked that i never had cared so much for greek as on board captain welshs vessel its because he was all on the opposite tack i went on quoting said temple i used to read with my father in the holidays and your rev simon has kept you up to the mark so it was all fair its not on our consciences that we crammed the captain about our knowledge no im glad of it said i temple pursued whatever happens to a fellow he can meet anything so long as he can sayive behaved like a man of honour and those german talesthey only upset you you dont see the reason of the thing why is a man to be haunted half his life well suppose he did commit a murder but if he didnt cant he walk through an old castle without meeting ghosts or a forest the dusky scenery of a strange land was influencing temple it affected me so i made the worst of it for a cure fancy those pines saying there go two more temple well and fancy thisa little earthdwarf as broad as im long and high as my shoulder one day he met the loveliest girl in the whole country and she promised to marry him in twenty years time in return for a sack of jewels worth all germany and half england you should have seen her dragging it home people thought it full of charcoal she married the man she loved and the twenty years passed over and at the stroke of the hour when she first met the dwarf thousands of bells began ringing through the forest and her husband cries out what is the meaning of it and they rode up to a garland of fresh flowers that dropped on her head and right into a gold ring that closed on her finger andlook temple look where asked the dear little fellow looking in all earnest from which the gloom of the place may be imagined for by suddenly mixing it with my absurd story i discomposed his air of sovereign indifference as much as one does the surface of a lake by casting a stone in it we rounded the rocky corner of the gorge at a slightly accelerated pace in dead silence it opened out to restorative daylight and we breathed better and chaffed one another and beholding a house with pendent gold grapes applauded the diligence conductors expressive pantomime the opportunity was offered for a draught of wine but we held water preferable so we toasted the priscilla out of the palms of our hands in draughts of water from a rill that had the sound of aspenleaves such as i used to listen to in the riversley meadows pleasantly familiar several commanding elevations were in sight some wooded some bare we chose the nearest to observe the sunset and concurred in thinking it unlike english sunsets though not so very unlike the sunset we had taken for sunrise on board the priscilla a tumbled dark and light green country of swelling forestland and slopes of meadow ran to the west and the west from flaming yellow burned down to smoky crimson across it temple bademe catch the discthat was english enough a glance at the suns disc confirmed the truth of his observation gazing on the outline of the orb one might have fancied oneself in england yet the moment it had sunk under the hill this feeling of ours vanished with it the coloured clouds drew me ages away from the recollection of home a tower on a distant hill white among pines led us to suppose that sarkeld must lie somewhere beneath it we therefore descended straight toward the tower instead of returning to the road and struck confidently into a rugged path recent events had given me the assurance that in my search for my father i was subject to a special governing direction i had aimed at the benchmissed itbeen shipped across sea and precipitated into the arms of friends who had seen him and could tell me i was on his actual track only blindly and no longer blindly now follow the path i said when temple wanted to have a consultation so we did in the london fog said he with some gloom but my retort hasnt it brought us here was a silencer dark night came on every height stood for a ruin in our eyes every dip an abyss it grew bewilderingly dark but the path did not forsake us and we expected at halfhour intervals to perceive the lights of sarkeld soon to be thundering at one of the inns for admission and supper i could hear temple rehearsing his german vocabulary brod butter wasser fleisch bett as we stumbled along then it fell to brod wasser bett and then bett by itself his confession of fatigue our path had frequently the nature of a waterway and was very fatiguing more agreeable to mount than descend for in mounting the knees and shins bore the brunt of it and these sufferers are not such important servants of the footfarer as toes and ankles in danger of tripping and being turned i was walking on leveller ground my head bent and eyes halfshut when a flash of light in a brook at my feet caused me to look aloft the tower we had marked after sunset was close above us shining in a light of torches we adopted the sensible explanation of this mysterious sight but were rather in the grip of the superstitious absurd one until we discerned a number of reddened men robbers exclaimed one of us our common thought was no robbers would never meet on a height in that manner and we were emboldened to mount and request their help fronting the tower which was of white marble a high tent had been pitched on a green platform semicircled by pines torches were stuck in clefts of the trees or in the fork of the branches or held by boys and men and there were clearly men at work beneath the tent at a busy rate we could hear the paviours breath escape from them outside the ring of torchbearers and others was a long cart with a dozen horses harnessed to it all the men appeared occupied too much for chatter and laughter what could be underneath the tent seeing a boy occasionally lift one of the flapping corners we took licence from his example to appease our curiosity it was the statue of a bronze horse rearing spiritedly the workmen were engaged fixing its pedestal in the earth our curiosity being satisfied we held debate upon our immediate prospects the difficulty of making sure of a bed when you are once detached from your home was the philosophical reflection we arrived at for nothing practical presented itself to arm ourselves we pulled out miss goodwins paper gasthof is the word cried temple gasthof zimmer bett that means inn hot supper and bed well ask we asked several of the men those in motion shot a stare at us the torchbearers pointed at the tent and at an unseen height muttering morgen referring to miss goodwins paper we discovered this to signify the unintelligible word morning which was no answer at all but the men apparently deeming our conduct suspicious gave us to understand by rather menacing gestures that we were not wanted there so we passed into the dusk of the trees angry at their incivility had it been summer we should have dropped and slept the night air of a sharp season obliged us to keep active yet we were not willing to get far away from the torches but after a time they were hidden then we saw one moving ahead the holder of it proved to be a workman of the gang and between us and him the strangest parley ensued he repeated the word morgen and we insisted on zimmer and bett he takes us for twin caspar hausers sighed temple nein said the man and perhaps enlightened by hearing a foreign tongue beckoned for us to step at his heels his lodging was a woodmans hut he offered us bread to eat milk to drink and straw to lie on we desired nothing more and were happy though the bread was black the milk sour the straw mouldy our breakfast was like a continuation of supper but two little girls of our host whose heads were cased in tightfitting dirty linen caps munched the black bread and drank the sour milk so thankfully while fixing solemn eyes of wonder upon us that to assure them we were the same sort of creature as themselves we pretended to relish the stuff rather to our amazement we did relish it mutter i said to them they pointed to the room overhead temple laid his cheek on his hand one of the little girls laid hers on the table i said doctor they nodded and answered princess which seemed perfectly good english and sent our conjectures as to the state of their mothers health astray i shut a silver english coin in one of their fat little hands we now with the name sarkeld craved of their father a direction to that place at the door of his hut he waved his hand carelessly south for sarkeld and vigorously west where the tower stood then swept both hands up to the tower bellowed a fire of cannon waved his hat and stamped and cheered temple glancing the way of the tower performed on a trumpet of his joined fists to show we understood that prodigious attractions were presented by the tower we said ja and ja and nevertheless turned into the sarkeld path some minutes later the sound of hoofs led us to imagine he had despatched a messenger after us a little lady on a pony attended by a tawnyfaced great squareshouldered groom on a tall horse rode past drew up on one side and awaited our coming she was dressed in a grey ridinghabit and a warm winterjacket of gleaming grey fur a soft white boa loose round her neck crossed at her waist white gauntlets and a pretty black felt hat with flowing rim and plume there she passed as under review it was a curious scene the ironfaced greatsized groom on his bony black charger dead still his mistress a girl of about eleven or twelve or thirteen with an arm bowed at her side whip and reins in one hand and slips of golden brown hair straying on her flushed cheek rocks and trees high silver firs rising behind her and a slender water that fell from the rocks running at her ponys feet halfadozen yards were between the chargers head and the ponys flanks she waited for us to march by without attempting to conceal that we were the objects of her inspection and we in good easy swing of the feet gave her a look as we lifted our hats that look was to me like a net thrown into moonlighted water it brought nothing back but broken lights of a miraculous beauty burning to catch an excuse for another look over my shoulder i heard her voice young english gentlemen we turned sharp round it was she without a doubt who had addressed us she spurred her pony to meet us stopped him and said with the sweetest painful attempt at accuracy in pronouncing a foreign tongue i sthink you go a wrong way our hats flew off again and bareheaded i seized the reply before temple could speak is not this may i ask you the way to sarkeld she gathered up her knowledge of english deliberately yes one goes to sarkeld by sthis way here but today goes everybody up to our bella vista and i entreat you do not miss it for it is somesthing to write to your home of up at the tower then oh we were there last night and saw the

books i have my english governess we read english tales english poetryand sthat is your excellence and so will you not come sirs up when a way is to be shown to you it is my question temple thanked her for the kindness of the offer i was hesitating half conscious of surprise that i should ever be hesitating in doubt of taking the direction toward my father hearing temples boldness i thanked her also and accepted then she said bowing i beg you will cover your heads we passed the huge groom bolt upright on his towering horse he raised two fingers to the level of his eyebrows in the form of a salute temple murmured i shouldnt mind entering the german army just as after our interview with captain bulsted he had wished to enter the british navy this was no more than a sign that he was highly pleased for my part delight fluttered the words in my mouth so that i had to repeat half i uttered to the attentive ears of our gracious new friend and guide ah she said one does sthink one knows almost all before experiment i am ashamed yet i will talk for is it not so experiment is a school and you if you please will speak slow for i say of you english gentlemen silk you spin from your lips

impatient wid my breaths for de gun to go i said it would be a fine sight for strangers yes you should be of de palace to know what a fine sight sthe finest and you are for sarkeld you have friends in sarkeld my father is in sarkeld mademoiselle i am told he is at the palace indeed and he is english your fater yes i have not seen him for years i have come to find him indeed it is for love of him your fater sir you come and not speak german i signified that it was so she stroked her ponys neck musing because of love is not much in de family in england it is said she remarked very shyly and in recovering her selfpossession asked the name of my father his name mademoiselle is mr richmond mr richmond mr richmond roy she sprang in her saddle you are son to mr richmond roy oh it is wonderful mademoiselle then you have seen him lately yes yes i have seen him i have heard of his beautiful child his son and you it is she studied my countenance a moment tell me is he well mademoiselle is he quite well oh yes she answered and broke into smiles of merriment and then seemed to bite her underlip he is our funmaker he must always be well i owe to him some of my english you are his son you were for sarkeld you will see him up at our bella vista quick let us run she put her pony to a canter up the brown path between the firtrees crying that she should take our breath but we were tight runners and i though my heart beat wildly was full of fire to reach the tower on the height so when she slackened her pace finding us close on her ponys hoofs she laughed and called us brave boys temples being no more than my friend who had made the expedition with me out of friendship surprised her not that she would not have expected it to be done by germans further she was unable to explain her astonishment at a turning of the ascent she pointed her whip at the dark knots and lines of the multitude mounting by various paths to behold the ceremony of unveiling the monument i besought her to waste no time you must if you please attend my pleasure if i guide you she said tossing her chin i thank you i cant tell you how much mademoiselle said i she answered you were kind to my two pet lambs sir so we moved forward chapter xvi the statue on the promontory the little lady was soon bowing to respectful salutations from crowds of rustics and others on a broad carriageway circling level with the height i could not help thinking how doubly foreign i was to all the world herei who was about to set eyes on my lost living father while these people were tiptoe to gaze on a statue but as my father might also be taking an interest in the statue i got myself round to a moderate sentiment of curiosity and a partial share of the general excitement temple and mademoiselle did most of the conversation which related to glimpses of scenery pine oak beechwood and lakewater until we gained the plateau where the tower stood when the giant groom trotted to the front and worked a clear way for us through a mass of travelling sightseers and she leaned to me talking quite inaudibly amid the laughter and chatting a band of wind instruments burst out this is glorious i conceived temple to cry like an openmouthed mute i found it inspiriting the rush of pride and pleasure produced by the music was irresistible we marched past the tower all of us i am sure with splendid feelings a stones throw beyond it was the lofty tent over it drooped a flag and flags were on poles round a wide ring of rope guarded by foresters and gendarmes mounted and afoot the band dressed in green with black plumes to their hats played in the middle of the ring outside were carriages and ladies and gentlemen on horseback full of animation rustics foresters town and village people men women and children pressed against the ropes it was a day of rays of sunshine now from off one edge now from another of large slow clouds so that at times we and the tower were in a blaze next the lakepalace was illuminated or the long grey lake and the woods of pine and of bare brown twigs making bays in it several hands beckoned on our coming in sight of the carriages there he is then i thought and it was like swallowing my heart in one solid lump mademoiselle had free space to trot ahead of us we saw a tallsitting lady attired in sables raise a finger to her and nip her chin away the little lady flew to a second carriage and on again as one may when alive with an inquiry i observed to temple i wonder whether she says in her german it is my question do you remember there was no weight whatever in what i said or thought she rode back exclaiming nowhere he is nowhere and nobody knows he will arrive but he is not yet now she bent coaxingly down to me can you not a few words of german only a smallest sum it is the markgrfin my good aunt would speak wid you and she can no englishonly she is eager to behold you and come you will know for my sake some scrap of germanja you willnicht wahr or french make your plompudding of it will you i made a shocking plumpudding of it temple was no happier the margravine a fine vigorous lady with a lively mouth and livelier eyes of a restless grey that rarely dwelt on you when she spoke and constantly started off on a new idea did me the honour to examine me much as if i had offered myself for service in her corps of grenadiers and might do in time but was decreed to be temporarily wanting in manly proportions she smiled a form of excuse of my bungling halfenglish horrid french talked over me and at me forgot me and recollected me all within a minute and fished poor temple for intelligible replies to incomprehensible language in the same manner then threw her head back to gather the pair of us in her sight then eyed me alone cest peuttre le fils de son petit papa et cest tout dire such was her summary comment but not satisfied with that she leaned out of the carriage and making an extraordinary grimace appear the mother in labour of the difficult words said doos yo laff there was no helping it i laughed like a madman giving one outburst and a dead stop far from looking displeased she nodded i was again put to the dreadful test can yo mak laff it spurred my wits i had no speech to mak laff with at the very instant of my dilemma i chanced to see a soberlyclad old townsman hustled between two helpless women of the crowd his pipe in his mouth and his hat wig and handkerchief sliding over his face showing his bald crown and he not daring to cry out for fear his pipe should be trodden under foot he can your highness her quick eyes caught the absurd scene she turned to one of her ladies and touched her forehead her hand was reached out to me temple she patted on the shoulder he canja du auch a grand gentleman rode up they whispered gazed at the tent and appeared to speak vehemently all the mens faces were foreign none of them had the slightest resemblance to my fathers i fancied i might detect him disguised i stared vainly temple to judge by the expression of his features was thinking yes thought i we might as well be at home at old riversley that distant spot were as out of place here as frogs in the desert riding to and fro and chattering and commotion of which the margravine was the centre went on and the band played beautiful waltzes the workmen in and out of the tent were full of their business like seamen under a storm frulein sibley the margravine called i hoped it might be an english name so it proved to be and the delight of hearing english spoken and what was more having english ears to speak to was blissful as the leap to daylight out of a nightmare i have the honour to be your countrywoman said a lady english all over to our struggling senses we became immediately attached to her as a pair of shipwrecked boats lacking provender of every sort are taken in tow by a wellstored vessel she knew my father knew him intimately i related all i had to tell and we learnt that we had made acquaintance with her pupil the princess ottilia wilhelmina frederika hedwig only child of the prince of eppenwelzen your father will certainly be here he is generally the margravines right hand and its wonderful the margravine can do without him so long said miss sibley and conversed with the margravine after which she informed me that she had been graciously directed to assure me my father would be on the field when the cannon sounded perhaps you know nothing of court life she resumed we have very curious performances in sarkeld and we owe it to the margravine that we are frequently enlivened you see the tall gentleman who is riding away from her i mean the one with the black hussar jacket and thick brown moustache that is the prince do you not think him handsome he is very kindrather capricious but that is a way with princes indeed i have no reason to complain he has lost his wife the princess frederika and depends upon his sister the margravine for amusement he has had it since she discovered your papa is the gun never going off i groaned if they would only conduct their ceremonies without their guns exclaimed miss sibley the origin of the present ceremony is this the margravine wished to have a statue erected to an ancestor a renowned soldierand i would infinitely prefer talking of england but never mind oh you wont understand what you gaze at well the prince did not care to expend the money instead of urging that as the ground of his refusal he declared there were no sculptors to do justice to prince albrecht wohlgemuth and one could not rely on their effecting a likeness we have him in the dininghall he was strikingly handsome afterward he pretendedim speaking now of the existing prince ernestthat it would be ages before the statue was completed one day the margravine induced him to agree to pay the sum stipulated for by the sculptor on condition of the statue being completed for public inspection within eight days of the hour of their agreement the whole court was witness to it they arranged for the statue horse and man to be exhibited for a quarter of an hour of course the margravine did not signify it would be a perfectly finished work we are kept at a great distance that we may not scrutinize it too closely they unveil it to show she has been as good as her word and then cover it up to fix the rider to the horsea screw is employed i imagine for one thing we know about it we know that the horse and the horseman travelled hither separately in all probability the margravine gave the order for the statue last autumn in berlin now look at the prince he has his eye on you look down now he has forgotten you he is impatient to behold the statue our chief fear is that the statue will not maintain its balance fortunately we have plenty of guards to keep the people from pushing against it if all turns out well i shall really say the margravine has done wonders she does not look anxious but then she is not one ever to show it the prince does every other minute he is glancing at the tent and at his watch can you guess my idea your fathers absence leads me to thinkoh only a passing glimmer of an ideathe statue has not arrived and he is bringing it on otherwise he would be sure to be here the margravine beckons me dont go we cried simultaneously the princess ottilia supplied her place i have sent to our stables for two little pretty hungarian horses for you two to ride she said no i have not yet seen him he is asked for and de markgrfin knows not at all he bades in our lake he has been seen since the man is exciteable but he is so sensible oh no and he is full of laughter we shall soon see him would he not ever be cautious of himself for a son like you her compliment raised a blush on me the patience of the people was creditable to their phlegm the smoke of pipes curling over the numberless heads was the most stirring thing about them temple observed to me well give the old statue a british cheer wont we richie after coming all the way from england said i in dejection no no richie youre sure of him now hes somewhere directing affairs i suspect i say do let us show them we can ring out the right tune upon occasion by jingo there goes a fellow with a match we saw the cannonier march up to the margravines carriage for orders she summoned the prince to her side ladies in a dozen carriages were standing up handkerchief in hand and the gentlemen got their horses heads on a line temple counted nearly sixty persons of quality stationed there the workmen were trooping out of the tent miss sibley ran to us saying the gunhorror has been commanded now then the prince can scarcely contain himself the gunner is ready near his gun he has his frightful match lifted see the managersuperintendent is receiving the margravines last injunctions how firm womens nerves are now the margravine insists on the princes reading the exact time by her watch everybody is doing it let us see by my watch it is all but fifteen minutes to eleven am dearest she addressed the little princess would you not like to hold my hand until the gun is fired dearest replied the princess whether in childish earnest or irony i could not divine if i would hold a hand it would be a gentlemans all eyes were on the prince of eppenwelzen as he gazed toward the covered statue with imposing deliberation his hand rose to his hat we saw the hat raised the cannon was fired and roared the band struck up a pompous slow march and the tentveil broke apart and rolled off it was like the dawn flying and sunrise mounting i confess i forgot all thought of my father for awhile the shouts of the people the braying of the brass instruments the ladies cheering sweetly the gentlemen giving short hearty expressions of applause intoxicated me and the statue was superbhorse and rider in new bronze polished by sunlight it is lifelike it is really noble it is a true prince exclaimed miss sibley she translated several exclamations of the ladies and gentlemen in german they were entirely to the same effect the horse gave us a gleam of his neck as he pawed a forefoot just reined in we knew him he was a gallant horse but it was the figure of the prince albrecht that was so fine i had always laughed at sculptured figures on horseback this one overawed me the marshal was acknowledging the salute of his army after a famous victory over the infidel turks he sat upright almost imperceptibly but effectively bending his head in harmony with the curve of his horses neck and his baton swept the air low in proud submission to the honours cast on him by his acclaiming soldiery his threecornered lace hat curled wig heavytrimmed surcoat and high boots reminded me of prince eugene no prince eugenenay nor marlborough had such a martial figure such an animated high old warriors visage the bronze features reeked of battle temple and i felt humiliated without cause i granted at the success of a work of art that struck us as a new military triumph of these germans and it was impossible not to admire it the little princess ottilia clapped hands by fits what words she addressed to me i know not i dealt out my stock of germanja jato her english we were drawn by her to congratulate the margravine whose hand was then being kissed by the prince he did it most courteously and affectionately other gentlemen counts and barons bowed over her hand ladies according to their rank and privileges saluted her on the cheek or in some graceful fashion when our turn arrived miss sibley translated for us and as we were at concert pitch we did not acquit ourselves badly temples remark was that he wished she and all her family had been english nothing was left for me to say but that the margravine almost made us wish we had been german smiling cordially the margravine spoke miss sibley translated her royal highness asks you if you have seen your father i shook my head the princess ottilia translated her highness my good aunt would know would you know him did you see him yes anywhere i cried the margravine pushed me back with a gesture yes your highness on my honour anywhere on earth she declined to hear the translation her insulting disbelief in my ability to recognize the father i had come so far to embrace would have vexed me but for the wretched thought that i was losing him again we threaded the carriages gazed at the horsemen in a way to pierce the hair on their faces the little princess came on us hurriedly here see are the horses i will you to mount are they not pretty animals she whispered i believe your fater have been hurt in his mind by something it is only perhaps now mount for de markgrfin says you are our good guests we mounted simply to show that we could mount for we would rather have been on foot and drew up close to the right of the margravines carriage hush a poet is reading his ode said the princess it is count fretzel von wolfenstein this ode was dreadful to us and all the court people pretended they liked it when he waved his right hand toward the statue there was a shout from the rustic set when he bowed to the margravine the ladies and gentlemen murmured agreeably and smiled we were convinced of its being downright hypocrisy rustic stupidity court flattery we would have argued our case too i proposed a gallop temple said no well give the old statue our cheer as soon as this awful fellow has done i dont care much for poetry but dont let me ever have to stand and hear german poetry again for the remainder of my life we could not imagine why they should have poetry read out to them instead of their fine band playing but supposed it was for the satisfaction of the margravine with whom i grew particularly annoyed on hearing miss sibley say she conceived her highness to mean that my father was actually on the ground and that we neither of us father and son knew one another i swore on my honour on my life he was not present and the melancholy in my heart taking the form of extreme irritation i spoke passionately i rose in my stirrups ready to shout father heres harry richmond come to see you where are you i did utter somethinga syllable or two make haste i think the words were they sprang from my inmost bosom addressed without forethought to that drawling mouthing poet the margravines face met mine like a challenge she had her lips tight in a mere lipsmile and her eyes gleamed with provocation her highness miss sibley translated asks whether you are prepared to bet that your father is not on the ground beg her to wait two minutes and ill be prepared to bet any sum said i temple took one half the circle i the other riding through the attentive horsemen and carriagelines and making sure the face we sought was absent more or less discomposing everybody the poet finished his ode he was cheered of course mightily relieved i beheld the band resuming their instruments for the cheering resembled a senseless beating on brass shields i felt that we english could do it better temple from across the sector of the circle running about two feet in front of the statue called aloud richie hes not here not here cried i the people gazed up at us wondering at the tongue we talked richie now lets lead these fellows off with a tiptop cheer little temple crowed lustily the head of the statue turned from temple to me i found the people falling back with amazed exclamations iso prepossessed was isimply stared at the suddenflashing white of the statues eyes the eyes from being an instant ago dull carved balls were animated they were fixed on me i was unable to give out a breath its chest heaved both bronze hands struck against the bosom richmond my son richie harry richmond richmond roy that was what the statue gave forth my head was like a ringing pan i knew it was my father but my father with death and strangeness earth metal about him and his voice was like a human cry contending with earth and metalmine was stifled i saw him descend i dismounted we met at the ropes and embraced all his figure was stiff smooth cold my arms slid on him each time he spoke i thought it an unnatural thing i myself had not spoken once after glancing by hazard at the empty saddle of the bronze horse i called to mind more clearly the appalling circumstance which had stupefied the whole crowd they had heard a statue speakhad seen a figure of bronze walk for them it was the ancestor of their prince it was the famous dead old warrior of a hundred and seventy years ago set thus in motion imagine the behaviour of people round a slain tiger that does not compel them to fly and may yet stretch out a dreadful paw much so they pressed for a nearer sight of its walnut visage and shrank in the act perhaps i shared some of their sensations i cannot tell my sensations were tranced there was no warmth to revive me in the gauntlet i clasped i looked up at the sky thinking that it had fallen dark chapter xvii my father breathes moves and speaks the people broke away from us like furrowed water as we advanced on each side of the ropes toward the margravines carriage i became a perfectly mechanical creature incapable of observing just capable of taking an impression here and there and in such cases the impressions that come are stamped on hot wax they keep the scene fresh they partly pervert it as well temples version is i am sure the truer historical picture he however could never repeat it twice exactly alike whereas i failed not to render image for image in clear succession as they had struck me at the time i could perceive that the figure of the prince albrecht in its stiff condition was debarred from vaulting or striding or stooping so that the ropes were a barrier between us i saw the little princess ottilia eyeing us with an absorbed comprehensive air quite unlike the manner of a child dots of heads curious faces peering and starting eyes met my vision i heard sharp talk in german and a rider flung his arm as if he wished to crash the universe and flew off the margravine seemed to me more an implacable parrot than a noble lady i thought to myself this is my father and i am not overjoyed or grateful in the same way i felt that the daylight was bronze and i did not wonder at it nay i reasoned on the probability of a composition of sun and mould producing that colour the truth was the powers of my heart and will were frozen i thought and felt at random and i crave excuses for dwelling on such trifling phenomena of the sensations which have been useful to me by helping me to realize the scene even as at the time they obscured it according to temples description when the statue moved its head toward him a shudder went through the crowd and a number of forefingers were levelled at it and the head moved toward me marked of them all its voice was answered by a dull puling scream from women and the men gaped when it descended from the saddle the act was not performed with one bound as i fancied but difficultly and it walked up to me like a figure dragging logs at its heels halfadozen workmen ran to arrest it some townswomen fainted there was a heavy altercation in german between the statue and the superintendent of the arrangements the sun shone brilliantly on our march to the line of carriages where the prince of eppenwelzen was talking to the margravine in a fury and he dashed away on his horse after bellowing certain directions to his foresters and the workmen by whom we were surrounded while the margravine talked loudly and amiably as though everything had gone well her watch was out she acknowledged my fathers bow and overlooked him she seemed to have made her courtiers smile the ladies and gentlemen obeyed the wave of her hand by quitting the ground the band headed a long line of the commoner sort and a body of foresters gathered the remnants and joined them to the rear of the procession a liveried groom led away temples horse and mine temple declared he could not sit after seeing the statue descend from its pedestal her highnesss behaviour roughened as soon as the place was clear of company she spoke at my father impetuously with manifest scorn and reproach struck her silvermounted stick on the carriage panels again and again stamped her foot lifting a most variable emphatic countenance princess ottilia tried to intercede the margravine clenched her hands and to one not understanding her speech appeared literally to blow the little lady off with the breath of her mouth her whole bearing consisted of volleys of abuse closed by magisterial interrogations temple compared her highnesss language to the running out of captain welshs chaincable and my fathers replies to the hauling in his sentences were short they sounded like manful protestations i barely noticed them temples version of it went and there was your father apologizing and the margravine rating him etc my father as it happened was careful not to open his lips wide on account of the plaster or thick coating of paint on his face no one would have supposed that he was burning with indignation the fact being that to give vent to it he would have had to exercise his muscular strength he was plastered and painted from head to foot the fixture of his wig and hat too constrained his skin so that his looks were no index of his feelings i longed gloomily for the moment to come when he would present himself to me in his natural form he was not sensible of the touch of my hand nor i of his there we had to stand until the voluble portion of the margravines anger came to an end she shut her eyes and bowed curtly to our salute you have seen the last of me madam my father said to her whirling carriagewheels he tried to shake and strained in his ponderous garments temple gazed abashed i knew not how to act my father kept lifting his knees on the spot as if practising a walk the tent was in its old place covering the bronze horse a workman stepped ahead of us and we all went at a strange leisurely pace down the hill through tall pinetrees to where a closed vehicle awaited us here were also a couple of lackeys who deposited my father on a bed of moss and with much effort pulled his huge boots off leaving him in red silk stockings temple and i snatched his gauntlets temple fell backward but we had no thought of laughter people were seen approaching and the three of us jumped into the carriage i had my fathers living hand in mine to squeeze feeling him scarcely yet the living man i had sought and with no great warmth of feeling his hand was very moist often i said dear fatherpapa im so glad at last in answer to his shortbreathed richie my little lad my son richmond you found me out you found me we were conscious that his thick case of varnished clothing was against us one would have fancied from his way of speaking that he suffered from asthma i was now gifted with a tenfold power of observation and let nothing escape me temple sitting opposite grinned cheerfully at times to encourage our spirits he had not recovered from his wonderment nor had i introduced him my father however had caught his name temple who might as well have talked i thought was perpetually stealing secret glances of abstracted perusal at him with a pair of round infants eyes sucking his reflections the while my father broke our silence mr temple i have the honour he said as if about to cough the honour of making your acquaintance i fear you must surrender the hope of making mine at present temple started and reddened like a little fellow detected in straying from his spellingbook which was the windowframe in a minute or so the fascination proved too strong for him his eyes wandered from the window and he renewed his shy inspection bit by bit as if casting up a column of figures yes mr temple we are in high germany said my father it must have cost temple cruel pain for he was a thoroughly gentlemanly boy and he could not resist it finally he surprised himself in his stealthy reckoning arrived at the fullbreech or buttoned waistband about halfway up his ascent from the red silk stocking he would pause and blink rapidly sometimes jump and cough to put him at his ease my father exclaimed as to this exterior he knocked his knuckles on the heaving hard surface i can only affirm that it was on horsebackahem particularly as the horse betrayed no restivity pronounced perfect the sole complaint of our interior concerns the resemblance we bear to a lobster human somewhere i do believe myself to be i shall have to be relieved of my shell before i can at all satisfactorily proclaim the fact i am a human being believe me he begged permission to take breath a minute i know you for my sons friend mr temple here is my son my boy harry lepel richmond roy have patience i shall presently stand unshelled i have much to relate you likewise have your narrative in store that you should have lit on me at the critical instant is one of those miracles which combine to produce overwhelming testimonyay richie without a doubt there is a hand directing our destiny his speaking in such a strain out of pure kindness to temple huskily with his painful attempt to talk like himself revived his image as the father of my heart and dreams and stirred my torpid affection though it was still torpid enough as may be imagined when i state that i remained plunged in contemplation of his stocking of red silk emerging from the full bronzed breech considering whether his comparison of himself to a shellfish might not be a really just one we neither of us regained our true natures until he was free of every vestige of the garb of prince albrecht wohlgemuth attendants were awaiting him at the gardengate of a beautiful villa partly girdled by rising firwoods on its footing of bright green meadow they led him away and us to bathrooms chapter xviii we pass a delightful evening and i have a morning vision in a long saloon ornamented with stags horns and instruments of the chase tusks of boars spearstaves boarknives and silver horns my father i and temple sat down to a memorable breakfast my father in his true form dressed in black silken jacket and kneebreeches purplestockings and pumps without a wig i thanked heaven to see how blithely he flung out his limbs and heaved his chest released from confinement his face was stained brownish but we drank old rhine wine and had no eye for appearances so you could bear it no longer richie my father interrupted the narrative i doled out anxious for his and he began and i interrupted him you did think of me often papa didnt you his eyes brimmed with tenderness think of you he sighed i gave him the account of my latest adventures in a few panting breaths suppressing the bench he set my face to front him we are two fools mr temple he said no sir said temple now you speak papa said i he smiled warmly richie begins to remember me i gazed at him to show it was true i do papaim not beginning to at his request i finished the tale of my life at school ah well that was bad fortune this is good he exclaimed tis your father my son tis daylight though you look at it through a bedcurtain and think you are halfdreaming now then for me richie my father went on in this wise excitedly i was laying the foundation of your fortune here my boy heavens when i was in that bronze shell i was astonished only at my continence in not bursting you have grownyou have shot up and filled out i register my thanks to your grandfather beltham the same in a minor degree to captain jasper welsh between that man rippenger and me there shall be dealings he flogged you let that pass he exposed you to the contempt of your schoolfellows because of a breach in my correspondence with a baseborn feruleswinger what are we coming to richie my son i was building a future for you here and colonel goodwincolonel goodwin you encountered him too and his marriageable daughteri owe it to them that i have you here well in the event of my sitting out the period this morning as the presentment of prince albrecht i was to have won something would have astonished that unimpressionable countryman of ours goodness gracious my boy when i heard your english shout it went to my marrow could they expect me to look down on my own flesh and blood on my sonmy son richmondafter a separation of years and continue a statue nay i followed my paternal impulse grant that the show was spoilt does the markgrfin insist on my having a bronze heart to carry on her pastime why naturally i deplore a failure let the cause be what it will whose regrets can eclipse those of the principal actor quotha as our old plays have it regrets did i not for fifteen minutes and more of mortal time sit in view of a multitude motionless i ask you like a chiselled block of stoneand the compact was one quarter of an hour and no farther that was my stipulation i told heri can hold out one quarter of an hour i pledged myself to it who then is to blame i was exposed to view twentythree minutes odd seconds is there not some ancient story of a monstrous wretch baked in his own bull my situation was as bad if i recollect aright he could roar no such relief was allowed to me and i give you my word richie lads both that while that most infernal count fretzel was pouring forth his execrable humdrum i positively envied the privilege of an old palsied fellow chief boatman of the forest lake for thinks i hang him he can nod his head and i can not let me assure you twenty minutes of an ordeal like thatone posture mind you no raising of your eyelids taking your breath mechanically and your heart beatingjumping like an enraged balletdancer boxed in your bosoma literal description upon my honour and not only jumping jumping every now and then i may say with a toe in your throat i was halfchokedwell i say twenty minutes twentyseven minutes and a half of that getting on in fact to halfanhour it is superhumanby heavens it is heroical and observe my reward i have a sonmy only one i have been divided from him for years i am establishing his fortune i know he is provided with comforts richie you remember the woman waddy a faithful soul she obtained my consent at lastpreviously i had objections in fact your address was withheld from the womanto call at your school she saw rippenger a girl of considerable attractions she heard you were located at riversley i say i know the boy is comfortably provided for but we have been separated since he was a little creature with curls on his forehead scarce breeched i protested papa i have been in jacket and trousers i dont know how long let me pursue said my father and to show you richie it is a golden age ever when you and i are together and ever shall be till we lose our manly spirit and we cling to thattill we lose our princely spirit which we never will abandonperish ratheri drink to you and challenge you and mind you old hock wine has charms if burgundy is the emperor of wines hock is the empress for youngsters perhaps i should except the hock that gets what they would fancy a trifle pique turned with age so as to lose in their opinion its empress flavour temple said modestly i should call that the margravine of wines my father beamed on him with great approving splendour join us mr temple you are a man of wit and may possibly find this specimen worthy of you this wine has a history you are drinking wine with blood in it well i was saying the darling of my heart has been torn from me i am in a foreign land foreign that is by birth and on the whole foreign yesi am the cynosure of eyes i am in a singular posture a singular situation i hear a cry in the tongue of my native land and what i presume is my boys name i look i behold him i follow a parents impulse on my soul none but a fishfather could have stood against it well for this my reward isand i should have stepped from a cathedral spire just the same if i had been mounted on itthat i iand the woman knows all my secreti have to submit to the foul tirade of a vixen she drew language i protest from the slums and i entreat you mr temple with your margravine of wineswhich was very neatly said to be surenote you this curious point for the confusion of radicals in your after life her highnesss pleasure was to lend her tongue to the languageor something like itof a besotted fishwife so very well and just as it is the case with that particular old hock you youngsters would disapprove of and we cunning oldsters know to contain more virtues in maturity than a nunnery of mayblooming virgins just so the very faults of a royal ladyroyal by birth and in temper a termagantimpart a perfume a flavour you must age you must live in courts you must sound the human bosom rightly to appreciate it she is a woman of the most malicious fine wit imaginable she is a generous woman a magnanimous woman wear her chains and she will not brain you with her club she is the light the centre of every society where she appears like what shall i say like the moon in a bowl of old rhenish and you will drain that bowl to the bottom to seize her as it werecatch a correct idea of her ay and your brains are drowned in the attempt yes richie i was aware of your residence at riversley were you reminded of your wandering dada on valentines day come my boy we have each of us a thousand things to relate i may be dulli do not understand what started you on your journey in search of me an impulse an accident say a directing angel we rest our legs here till evening and then we sup you will be astonished to hear that you have dined tis the fashion with the germans i promise you good wine shall make it up to you for the return to schoolhabits we sup and we pack our scanty baggage and we start tonight brook no insult at courts if you are of material value if not it is unreservedly a question whether you like kickings my father paused yawned and stretched to be rid of the remainder of his aches and stiffness out of a great yawn he said dear lads i have fallen into the custom of the country i crave your permission that i may smoke wander if you choose within hail of me or sit by me if you can bear it and talk of your schoollife and your studies your aunt dorothy richie she is well i know not her like i could bear to hear of any misfortune but that she suffered pain my father smoked his cigar peacefully he had laid a guitar on his knees and flipped a string or chafed over all the strings and plucked and thrummed them as his mood varied we chatted and watched the going down of the sun and amused ourselves idly fermenting as we were anything that gave pleasure to us two boys pleased and at once occupied my father it was without aid from temples growing admiration of him that i recovered my active belief and vivid delight in his presence my younger days sprang up beside me like brothers no one talked looked flashed frowned beamed as he did had such prompt liveliness as he such tenderness no one was ever so versatile in playfulness he took the colour of the spirits of the people about him his vivacious or sedate manoftheworld tone shifted to playfellows fun in a twinkling i used as a little fellow to think him larger than he really was but he was of good size inclined to be stout his eyes were grey rather prominent and his forehead sloped from arched eyebrows so conversational were his eyes and brows that he could persuade you to imagine he was carrying on a dialogue without opening his mouth his voice was charmingly clear his laughter confident fresh catching the outburst of his very self as laughter should be other sounds of laughter were like echoes strange to say i lost the links of my familiarity with him when he left us on a short visit to his trunks and portmanteaux and had to lean on temple who tickled but rejoiced me by saying richie your father is just the one i should like to be secretary to we thought it a pity to have to leave this nice foreign place immediately i liked the scenery and the wine and what i supposed to be the habit of the gentlemen here to dress in silks on my fathers return to us i asked him if we could not stay till morning till morning then he said and to england with the first lark his complexion was ruddier his valet had been at work to restore it he was getting the sanguine hue which coloured my recollection of him wearing a black velvet cap and a spanish furred cloak he led us over the villa in sarkeld he resided at the palace and generally at the lakepalace on the removal of the court thither the margravine had placed the villa which was her own property at his disposal the better to work out their conspiracy it would have been mine said my father bending suddenly to my ear and humming his philosophical heigho as he stepped on in minuet fashion we went through apartments rich with gilded oak and pine panellings in one was a rough pattern of a wooden horse opposite a mirror by no means a figure of a horse but apparently a number of pieces contributed by a carpenters workshop having a rueful seat in the middle my father had practised the attitude of prince albrecht wohlgemuth on it she timed me five and twenty minutes there only yesterday he said and he now supposed he had sat the bronze horse as a statue in public view exactly thirtyseven minutes and a quarter tubs full of colouring liquid to soak the garments of the prince pots of paint and paint and plaster brushes hinted the magnitude of the preparations here said my father in another apartment i was this morning apparelled at seven oclock and i would have staked my right arm up to the collarbone on the success of the undertaking werent they sure to have found it out in the end papa i inquired i am not so certain of that he rejoined i cannot quaff consolation from that source i should have been covered up after exhibition i should have been pronounced imperfect in my fittingapparatus the sculptor would have claimed me and i should have been enjoying the fruits of a brave and harmless conspiracy to do honour to an illustrious prince while he would have been moulding and casting an indubitable bronze statue in my image a fig for rumours we show ourself we are caught from sight we are again on show now this being successfully done do you see royalty declines to listen to vulgar tattle presumably richie it was suspected by the court that the margravine had many months ago commanded the statue at her own cost and had set her mind on winning back the money the wonder of it was my magnificent resemblance to the defunct i sat some three hours before the old warriors portraits in the diningsaloon of the lakepalace accord me one good spell of meditation over a tolerable sketch i warrant myself to represent him to the life provided that he was a personage i incline to stipulate for handsome as well on my word of honour as a man and a gentleman i pity the margravinemy poor good frau feldmarschall now here richiemy father opened a sidedoor out of an elegant little room into a spacious dark place here is her cabinettheatre where we act german and french comediettas in spring and autumn i have superintended it during the two or more years of my stay at the court humph tis over he abruptly closed the door his dress belonged to the part of a spanish nobleman personated by him in a play called the hidalgo enraged he said pointing a thumb over his shoulder at the melancholy door behind which gay scenes had sparkled papa said i sadly for consolation youre change for a sovereign to the amount of four hundred and fortynine thousand shillings every time you speak cried he kissing my forehead he sparkled in good earnest on hearing that i had made acquaintance with the little princess ottilia what i thought of her how she looked at me what i said to her what words she answered how the acquaintance began who were observers of iti had to repair my omission to mention her by furnishing a precise description of the circumstances describing her face and style repeating her pretty english my father nodded he thought i exaggerated that foreign english of hers but as i said i was new to it and noticed it he admitted the greater keenness of attention awakened by novelty only said he i rather wonder and here he smiled at me inquiringly tis true he added a boy of fourteen or fifteenay richie have your fun out a youngster saw the comic side of her do you know that child has a remarkable character her disposition is totally unfathomable you are a deep reader of english poetry i hope she adores it and the english navy she informed me that if she had been the english people she would have made nelson king the royal family of england might see objections to that i told her cries she oh anything for a seahero you will find these young princes and princesses astonishingly revolutionary when they entertain brains now at present just at present an english naval officer and a poet stand higher in the esteem of that young princess ottilia than dukes kings or emperors so you have seen her my father ejaculated musingly and hummed and said by the way we must be careful not to offend our grandpapa beltham richie good acresgood anchorage good coffersgood harbourage regarding poetry my dear boy you ought to be writing it for i dothe diversion of leisure hours impromptus in poetry i would scorn anything but impromptus i was saying richie that if tremendous misfortune withholds from you your legitimate prestige you must have the substantial element tis your springboard to vault by and cushions on the other side if you make a miss and fall tis the essence if you have not the odour i followed my fathers meaning as the shadow of a bird follows it in sunlight it made no stronger an impression than a flying shadow on the grass still i could verify subsequently that i had penetrated himi had caught the outline of his meaningthough i was little accustomed to his manner of communicating his ideas i had no notion of what he touched on with the words prestige essence and odour my efforts to gather the reason for his having left me neglected at school were fruitless business business sad necessity hurry worrythehounds was his nearest approach to an explicit answer and seeing i grieved his kind eyes i abstained nor did i like to defend mr rippenger for expecting to be paid we came to that point once or twice when so sharply wronged did he appear and vehement and indignant that i banished thoughts which marred my luxurious contentment in hearing him talk and sing and behave in his old ways and new habits plain velvet was his dress at dinner we had a yellow hock temples meditative face over it to discover the margravine or something in its flavour was a picture it was an evening of incessant talking no telling of events straightforwardly but all by fitsall here and there my father talked of turkey so i learnt he had been in that country temple of the routine of our life at riversley i of kiomi the gipsy girl then we two of captain jasper welsh my father of the princess ottilia when i alluded to the margravine he had a word to say of mrs waddy so i learnt she had been in continual correspondence with him and had cried heavily about me poor soul temple laughed out a recollection of captain bulsteds hic haec hoc i jumped janet ilchester up on the table my father expatiated on the comfort of a volume of shakespeare to an exiled englishman we drank to one another and heartily to the statue my father related the history of the margravines plot in duckanddrake skips and backward to his first introduction to her at some austrian baths among the mountains she wanted amusementhe provided it she never let him quit her sight from that moment and now he said she has lost me he drew out of his pocketbook a number of designs for the statue of prince albrecht to which the margravines initials were appended and shuffled them and sighed and said most complete arrangements most complete no body of men were ever so well drilled as those fellows up at bella vistacould not have been and at the climax in steps the darling boy for whom i laboured and sweated and down we topple incontinently nothing would have shaken me but the apparition of my son i was proof against everything but that i sat invincible for close upon an hourcall it an hour not a muscle of me moved i repeat the heart in my bosom capered like an independent organ had it all its own way leaving me mine until mr temple take my word for it there is a guiding hand in some families believe it and be serene in adversity the change of life at a merry court to life in a london alley will exercise our faith but the essential thing is that richie has been introduced here and i intend him to play a part here the grandson and heir of one of the richest commoners in englandi am not saying commoner as a term of reproachpossessed of a property that turns itself over and doubles itself every ten years maymind you mayon such a solid foundation as thatand as to birth your highness has only to grant us a private interview temple was dazed by this mystifying address to him nor could i understand it why papa you always wished for me to go into parliament said i i do he replied and i wish you to lead the london great world such topics are for byandby adieu to them he kissed his wafting fingertips we fell upon our random talk again with a merry rattle i had to give him a specimen of my pianoplaying and singing he shook his head the cricketer and the scholar have been developed at the expense of the musician and music richie music unlocks the chamber of satinrose late at night we separated temple and i slept in companionrooms deadly drowsy the dear little fellow sat on the edge of my bed chattering of his wonder my dreams led me wandering with a ships diver under the sea where we walked in a light of pearls and exploded old wrecks i was assuring the glassy man that it was almost as clear beneath the waves as above when i awoke to see my father standing over me in daylight and in an ecstasy i burst into sobs here richiehe pressed fresh violets on my nostrilsyou have had a morning visitor quick out of bed and you will see the little fairy crossing the meadow i leapt to the window in time to have in view the little princess ottilia followed by her faithful gaunt groom before she was lost in the shadow of the firtrees chapter xix our return homeward we started for england at noon much against my secret wishes but my father would not afford the margravine time to repent of her violent language and injustice toward him reflection increased his indignation anything that went wrong on the first stages of the journey caused him to recapitulate her epithets and reply to them proudly he confided to me in cologne cathedral that the entire course of his life was a grand plot resembling an unfinished piece of architecture which might at a future day prove the wonder of the world and he had therefore packed two dozen of hoar old uralt he used comical german hock for a present to my grandfather beltham in the hope of its being found acceptable for richie said he you may not knowand it is not to win your thanks i inform you of itthat i labour unremittingly in my sons interests i have established him on his majority in germany at a court my object now is to establish him in england promise me that it shall be the decided endeavour of your energies and talents to rise to the height i point out to you you promise i perceive he added sharp in detecting the unpleasant predicament of a boy who is asked to speak priggishly so then i could easily promise with a firm voice he dropped certain explosive hints which reminded me of the funny ideas of my state and greatness i had when a child i shrugged at them i cared nothing for revelations to come byandby my object was to unite my father and grandfather on terms of friendship this was the view that now absorbed and fixed my mind to have him a frequent visitor at riversley if not a resident in the house enlivening them all while i perhaps trifled a cavalry sabre became one of my settled dreams the difficult part of the scheme appeared to me the obtaining of my fathers consent i mentioned it and he said immediately that he must have his freedom now for instance said he what is my desire at this moment i have always a big one perched on a rock in the distance but i speak of my present desire and let it be supposed that the squire is one of us we are returning to england well i want to show you a storks nest we are not far enough south for the stork to build here it is a fact richie that i do want to show you the bird for luck and as a feature of the country and in me a desire to do a thing partakes of the impetus of steam well you see we are jogging home to england i resist myself for dutys sake that i can do but if the squire were here with his yea and his nay by heavens i should be off to the top of the rhine like a tornado i submit to circumstances i cannot and i will not be dictated to by men that seems to me rather unreasonable i remonstrated it is i am ashamed of it he answered do as you will richie set me down at riversley but under no slight mark you i keep my honour intact like a bottled cordial my unfailing comfort in adversity i hand it to you my son on my deathbed and say you have there the essence of my life never has it been known of me that i swallowed an insult then papa i shall have a talk with the squire make good your ground in the castle said he i string a guitar outside you toss me a key from the walls if there is room and i have leisure i enter if not you know i am paving your way in other quarters riversley my boy is an excellent foothold and fortress riversley is not the world at riversley i should have to wear a double face and egad a double stomachbag like young jack feeding with the giantone full of ambition the other of provender that place is our touchstone to discover whether we have prudence we have i hope and we will have mr temple a pleasant day or two in paris it was his habit to turn off the bent of these conversations by drawing temple into them temple declared there was no feeling we were in a foreign country while he was our companion we simply enjoyed strange scenes looking idly out of our windows our recollection of the strangest scene ever witnessed filled us with i know not what scornful pleasure and laughed in the background at any sight or marvel pretending to amuse us temple and i cantered over the great belgian battlefield talking of bella vista tower the statue the margravine our sour milk and blackbread breakfast the little princess ottilia with her it is my question and you were kind to my lambs sir thoughtless of glory and dead bones my father was very differently impressed he was in an exultant glow far outmatching the bloom on our faces when we rejoined him i cried papa if the prince wont pay for a real statue i will and ill present it in your name to the nation cried he staring and arresting his arm in what seemed an orchestral movement to the margravine he heard but had to gather his memory he had been fighting the battle and made light of bella vista i found that incidents over which a day or two had rolled lost their features to him he never smiled at recollections if they were forced on him noisily by persons he liked perhaps his face was gay but only for a moment the gaiety of his nature drew itself from hotsprings of hopefulness our arrival in england our interviews there my majority burgundy my revisitation of germanythese events to come gave him the aspect children wear out amaying or in an orchard he discussed the circumstances connected with the statue as dry matteroffact and unless it was his duty to be hilarious at the dinnertable he was hardly able to respond to a call on his past life and mine his future too was present tense we do this not we will do this so that generally no sooner did we speak of an anticipated scene than he was acting in it i studied him eagerly i know and yet quite unconsciously and i came to no conclusions boys are always putting down the ciphers of their observations of people beloved by them but do not add up a sum total our journey home occupied nearly eleven weeks owing to stress of money on two occasions in brussels i beheld him with a little beggargirl in his arms she has asked me for a copper coin richie he said squeezing her fat cheeks to make cherries of her lips i recommended him to give her a silver one something richie i must give the little wench for i have kissed her and in my list of equivalents gold would be the sole form of repayment after that you must buy me off with honour my boy i was compelled to receive a dab from the childs nose by way of a kiss in return for buying him off with honour the child stumped away on the pavement fronting our hotel staring at its fist that held the treasure poor pet wee drab of it exclaimed my father one is glad richie to fill a creature out of ones emptiness now she toddles she is digesting it rapidly the last performance of ones purse is rarely so pleasant as that i owe it to her that i made the discovery in time in this manner i also made the discovery that my father had no further supply of money none whatever how it had run out without his remarking it he could not tell he could only assure me that he had become aware of the fact while searching vainly for a coin to bestow on the beggargirl i despatched a letter attested by a notary of the city applying for money to the banker to whom colonel goodwin had introduced me on my arrival on the continent the money came and in the meantime we had formed acquaintances and entertained them they were chiefly halfpay english military officers dashing men one a major dykes my father established in our hotel and we carried him on to paris where consequent upon our hospitalities the purse was again deficient two reasons for not regretting it were adduced by my father firstly that it taught me not to despise the importance of possessing money secondly that we had served our country by assisting dykes who was on the scent of a new and terrible weapon of destruction which he believed to be in the hands of the french government major dykes disappeared on the scent but we had the satisfaction of knowing that we had done our best toward saving the navy of great britain from being blown out of water temple and i laughed over major dykes and he became our puppet for byplay on account of his enormous whiskers his passion for strong drinks and his air of secresy my fathers faith in his patriotic devotedness was sufficient to withhold me from suspicions of his character whenever my instinct or common sense would have led me to differ with my father in opinion fun supervened i was willing that everything in the world should be as he would have it be and took up with a spirit of laughter too happy in having won him in having fished him out of the deep sea at one fling of the net as he said to care for accuracy of sentiment in any other particular our purse was at its lowest ebb he suggested no means of replenishing it and i thought of none he had heard that it was possible to live in paris upon next to nothing with very great luxury so we tried it we strolled through the lilac aisles among bonnes and babies attended military spectacles rode on omnibuses dined on the country heights went to theatres and had a most pleasurable time gaining everywhere front places friendly smiles kind little services in a way that would have been incomprehensible to me but for my consciousness of the magical influence of my fathers address a mixture of the ceremonious and the affable such as the people could not withstand the poet is perhaps on the whole more exhilarating than the alderman he said these were the respective names given by him to the empty purse and the full purse we vowed we preferred the poet ay said he but for all that the alderman is lighter on his feet i back him to be across the channel first the object of my instructions to you will be lost richie if i find you despising the aldermans pegasus on money you mount we are literally chained here you know there is no doubt about it and we are adding a nail to our fetters daily true you are accomplishing the parisian accent paris has also this immense advantage over all other cities tis the central hotel on the highroad of civilization in paris you meet your friends to a certainty it catches them every one in turn so now we must abroad early and late and cut for trumps a meeting with a friend of my father mr monterez williams was the result of our resolute adoption of this system he helped us on to boulogne where my father met another friend to whom he gave so sumptuous a dinner that we had not money enough to pay the hotel bill now observe the inconvenience of leaving paris said he ten to one we shall have to return we will try a weeks whistling on the jetty and if no luck comes and you will admit richiemr temple i call your attention to itthat luck will scarcely come in profuse expedition through the narrow neck of a solitary seaport why we must return to paris i proposed to write to my aunt dorothy for money but he would not hear of that after two or three days of whistling i saw my old friend mr bannerbridge step out of the packetboat on condition of my writing to my aunt to say that i was coming home he advanced me the sum we were in need of grudgingly though and with the prediction that we should break down again which was verified it occurred only a stage from riversley where my grandfathers name was good as coin of the realm besides my father remained at the inn to guarantee the payment of the bill while temple and i pushed on in a fly with the two dozen of hock it could hardly be called a breakdown but my father was not unwilling for me to regard it in that light among his parting remarks was an impressive adjuration to me to cultivate the squires attachment at all costs do this he said and i shall know that the lesson i have taught you on your journey homeward has not been thrown away my darling boy my curse through life has been that the sense of weight in money is a sense i am and was born utterly a stranger to the consequence is my grandest edifices fall there is no foundation for them not that i am worse understand me than under a temporary cloud and the blessing of heaven has endowed me with a magnificent constitution heaven forefend that i should groan for myself or you for me but digest what you have learnt richie press nothing on the squire be guided by the advice of that esteemed and admirable woman your aunt dorothy and by the way you may tell her confidentially of the progress of your friendship with the princess ottilia here i shall employ my hours in a tranquil study of nature until i see you thus he sped me forward we sighted riversley about midday on a sunny june morning compared with the view from bella vista our firs looked scanty our heathtracts dull as places having no page of history written on them our fresh green meadows not more than commonly homely i was so full of my sense of triumph in my adventurous journey and the recovery of my father that i gazed on the old grange from a towering height the squire was on the lawn surrounded by a full company the ilchesters the ambroses the wilfords captain and squire gregory bulsted the rubreys and others all bending to roses to admire smell or pluck charming groups of ladies were here and there and temple whispered as we passed them we beat foreigners in our women richie i making it my business to talk with perfect unconcern replied do you think so perhaps not in all cases all the while i was exulting at the sweet beams of england radiating from these dear earlymorninglooking women my aunt dorothy swam up to me and kissing me murmured take no rebuff from your grandpapa darling my answer was i have found him captain bulsted sang out our names i caught sight of julia rippengers face the squire had his back turned to me which reminded me of my first speech with captain jasper welsh and i thought to myself i know something of the world now and the thing is to keep a good temper here there was no wirecoil to intercept us so i fronted him quickly hulloa he cried and gave me his shoulder temple is your guest sir said i he was obliged to stretch out his hand to temple a prompt instinct warned me that i must show him as much beltham as i could summon dogs and horses all right sir i asked captain bulsted sauntered near here william said the squire tell this fellow about my stables in excellent condition harry richmond returned the captain oh hes got a new name ill swear said the squire not i then what have you got of your trip eh a sharper eye than i had sir youve been sharpening it in london have you ive been a little farther than london squire well youre not a liar there you see the lad can stand fire captain bulsted broke in harry richmond im proud to shake your hand but ill wait till youre through the ceremony with your grandad the squires hands were crossed behind him i smiled boldly in his face shall i make the tour of you to get hold of one of them sir he frowned and blinked shuffle in among the ladies you seem to know how to make friends among them he said and pretended to disengage his right hand for the purpose of waving it toward one of the groups i seized it saying heartily grandfather upon my honour i love you and im glad to be home again mind you youre not at home till youve begged uberlys pardon in public you know what for he rejoined leaving the horse at that inn is on my conscience said i the squire grumbled all the better keep him there a bit suppose he kicks said i and the captain laughed and the squire too and i was in such high spirits i thought of a dozen witty suggestions relative to the seat of the conscience and grieved for a minute at going to the ladies captain bulsted convoyed me to pretty irisheyed julia rippenger temple had previously made discovery of janet ilchester relating our adventures on different parts of the lawn we both heard that colonel goodwin and his daughter had journeyed down to riversley to smooth the way for my return so my easy conquest of the squire was not at all wonderful nevertheless i maintained my sense of triumph and was assured in my secret heart that i had a singular masterfulness and could when i chose to put it forth compel my grandfather to hold out his hand to my father as he had done to me julia rippenger was a guest at riversley through a visit paid to her by my aunt dorothy in alarm at my absence the intention was to cause the squire a distraction it succeeded for the old man needed lively prattle of a less childish sort than janet ilchesters at his elbow and that young lady though true enough in her fashion was the ardent friend of none but flourishing heads whereas julia finding my name under a cloud at riversley spoke of me i was led to imagine by captain bulsted as a ballad hero a gloriful fellow a darling whose deeds were all pardonablea mere puff of smoke in the splendour of his nature to hear the young lady allude to me in that style he confided to my ear with an ineffable heave of his big chest certain good influences at any rate preserved the squire from threatening to disinherit me colonel goodwin had spoken to him very manfully and wisely as to my relations with my father the squire it was assumed by my aunt and by captain bulsted and julia had undertaken to wink at my fathers claims on my affection all three vehemently entreated me to make no mention of the present of hock to him and not to attempt to bring about an interview concerning the yellow wine i disregarded their advice for i held it to be a point of filial duty and an obligation religiously contracted beneath a cathedral dome so i performed the task of offering the hock stating that it was of ancient birth the squire bunched his features he tutored his temper and said not a word i fancied all was well before i tried the second step captain bulsted rode over to my father who himself generously enjoined the prudent course in accordance with his aforegone precepts he was floated off as he termed it from the inn where he lay stranded to london by i knew not what heavensent gift of money bidding me keep in view the grand career i was to commence at dipwell on arriving at my majority i would have gone with him had he beckoned a finger the fourandtwenty bottles of hock were ranged in a line for the stableboys to cockshy at them under the squires supervision and my enforced attendance just as revolutionary criminals are executed i felt like the survivor of friends who had seen their blood flow he handed me a cheque for the payment of debts incurred in my recent adventures who could help being grateful for it and yet his remorseless spilling of the kindly wine full of mellow recollections of my father and the little princess drove the sense of gratitude out of me chapter xx news of a fresh conquest of my fathers temple went to sea the wonder is that i did not go with him we were both in agreement that adventures were the only things worth living for and we despised english fellows who had seen no place but england i could not bear the long separation from my father that was my reason for not insisting on the squires consent to my becoming a midshipman after passing a brilliant examination temple had the good fortune to join captain bulsteds ship and there my honesthearted friend dismally composed his letter of confession letting me know that he had been untrue to friendship and had proposed to janet ilchester and interchanged vows with her he begged my forgiveness but he did love her sohe hoped i would not mind i sent him a reproachful answer i never cared for him more warmly than when i saw the letter shoot the slope of the postoffice mouth aunt dorothy undertook to communicate assurances of my undying affection for him as for janettemples letter in which he spoke of her avowed preference for oriental presents and declared his intention of accumulating them on his voyages was a harpoon in her side by means of it i worried and terrified her until she was glad to have it all out before the squire what did he do he said that margery her mother was niggardly a girl wanted presents and i did not act up to my duty i ought to buy turkey and tunis to please her if she had a mind for them the further she was flattered the faster she cried she had the face of an old setter with these hideous tears the squire promised her fifty pounds per annum in quarterly payments that she might buy what presents she liked and so tie herself to constancy he said aside to me as if he had a knowledge of the sexyoung ladies must have lots of knickknacks or their eyes ll be caught right and left remember that i should have been delighted to see her caught she talked of love in a ludicrous secondhand way sending me into fits of disgusted laughter on other occasions her lips were not hypocritical and her figure anything but awkward she was a bold plump girl fond of male society heriot enraptured her i believed at the time she would have appointed a year to marry him in had he put the question but too many women were in love with heriot he and i met kiomi on the road to the racecourse on the southdowns the prettiest racecourse in england shut against gipsies a barefooted swarthy girl ran beside our carriage and tossed us flowers he and a friend of his young lord destrier son of the marquis of edbury who knew my father well talked and laughed with her and thought her so very handsome that i likewise began to stare and i suddenly called kiomi she bounded back into the hedge this was our second meeting it would have been a pleasant one had not heriot and destrier pretended all sorts of things about our previous acquaintance neither of us they said had made a bad choice but why had we separated she snatched her hand out of mine with a grin of anger like puss in a fury we had wonderful fun with her they took her to a great house near the racecourse and there assisted by one of the young ladies dressed her in flowing silks and so passed her through the gate of the enclosure interdicted to bare feet there they led her to groups of fashionable ladies and got themselves into pretty scrapes they said she was an indian heriot lost his wagers and called her a witch she replied youll find im one young man and that was the only true thing she spoke of the days to come owing to the hubbub around the two who were guilty of this unmeasured joke upon consequential ladies i had to conduct her to the gate instantly and without a goodbye she scrambled up her skirts and ran at strides across the road and through the wood out of sight she won her dress and a piece of jewelry with heriot i went on a sad expedition the same i had set out upon with temple this time i saw my father behind those high red walls once so mysterious and terrible to me heriot made light of prisons for debt he insisted for my consolation that they had but a temporary dishonourable signification very estimable gentlemen as well as scamps inhabited them he said the impression produced by my visitthe feasting among ruined men who believed in good luck the more the lower they fell from it and their fearful admiration of my imprisoned fatherwas as if i had drunk a stupefying liquor i was unable clearly to reflect on it daily afterwards until i released him i made journeys to usurers to get a loan on the faith of the reversion of my mothers estate heriot like the real friend he was helped me with his name to the bond when my father stood free i had the proudest heart alive and as soon as we had parted the most amazed for a long while for years the thought of him was haunted by racketballs and bearded men in their shirtsleeves a scene sickening to ones pride yet it had grown impossible for me to think of him without pride i delighted to hear him we were happy when we were together and moreover he swore to me on his honour in mrs waddys presence that he and the constable would henceforth keep an even pace his exuberant cheerfulness and charming playfulness were always fascinating his visions of our glorious future enchained me how it was that something precious had gone out of my life i could not comprehend julia rippengers marriage with captain bulsted was an agreeable distraction unfortunately for my peace of mind she went to the altar poignantly pale my aunt dorothy settled the match she had schemed it her silence and halfdowncast look seemed to confess for the sake of her own repose but neither to her nor to others did that come of it i wrote a plain warning of the approaching catastrophe to heriot and received his reply after it was over to this effect in my regiment we have a tolerable knowledge of women they like change old richie and we must be content to let them take their twenty shillings for a sovereign i myself prefer the navy to the army i have no right to complain once she swore one thing now she has sworn another we will hope the lady will stick to her choice and not seek smaller change i could not forgive coppers thats quoting your dad i have no wish to see the uxorious object though you praise him his habit of falling under the table is middling oldfashioned but she may like him the better or she may cure him whatever she is as a woman she was a very nice girl to enliven the atmosphere of the switch i sometimes look at a portrait i have of j r which i fancy mrs william bulsted has no right to demand of me but supposing her husband thinks he has why then i must consult my brother officers we want a war old richie and i wish you were sitting at our mess and not mooning about girls and women i presumed from this that heriots passion for julia was extinct aunt dorothy disapproved of his tone which i thought admirably philosophical and coxcombically imitable an expression of the sort of thing i should feel on hearing of janet ilchesters nuptials the daring and success of that foreign adventure of mine had with the aid of colonel and clara goodwin convinced the squire of the folly of standing between me and him i loved it was considered the best sign possible that he should take me down on an inspection of his various estates and his great coalmine and introduce me as the heir who would soon relieve him of the task perhaps he thought the smell of wealth a promising cure for such fits of insubordination as i had exhibited my occasional absences on my own account were winked at on my return the squire was sour and snappish i cheerful and complaisant i grew cold and he solicitous he would drink my health with a challenge to heartiness and i drank to him heartily and he relapsed to a fit of sulks informing me that in his time young men knew when they were well off and asking me whether i was up to any young mens villanies had any concealed debts perchance because if sooh he knew the ways of youngsters especially when they fell into bad hands the list of bad titles rumbled on in an underbreath like cowardly thunderwell to cut the matter short because if so his chequebook was at my service didnt i know that eh not being immediately distressed by debt i did not exhibit the gush of gratitude and my sedate thank you sir confused his appeal for some sentimental show of affection i am sure the poor old man suffered pangs of jealousy i could even at times see into his breast and pity him he wanted little more than to be managed but a youth when he perceives absurdity in opposition to him chafes at it as much as if he were unaware that it is laughable had the squire talked to me in those days seriously and fairly of my fathers character i should have abandoned my system of defence to plead for him as before a judge by that time i had gained the knowledge that my father was totally of a different construction from other men i wished the squire to own simply to his loveable nature i could have told him women did without citing my dear aunt dorothy or so humble a creature as the devoted mrs waddy he had sincere friends among women who esteemed him and were staunch adherents to his cause and if the widow of the city knight lady sampleman aimed openly at being something more she was not the less his friend nor was it only his powerful animation generosity and grace that won them there occurred when i was a little past twenty already much in his confidence one of those strange crucial events which try a man publicly and bring out whatever can be said for and against him a young welsh heiress fell in love with him she was i think seven or eight months younger than myself a handsome intelligent highspirited girl rather wanting in polish and perhaps in the protecting sense of decorum she was wellborn of courseshe was welsh she was really wellbred too though somewhat brusque the young lady fell hopelessly in love with my father at bath she gave out that he was not to be for one moment accused of having encouraged her by secret addresses it was her unsolicited avowalthought by my aunt dorothy immodest not by methat she preferred him to all living men her name was anna penrhys the squire one morning received a letter from her family requesting him to furnish them with information as to the antecedents of a gentleman calling himself augustus fitzgeorge frederick william richmond guelph roy for purposes which would they assured him warrant the inquiry he was for throwing the letter aside shouting that he thanked his god he was unacquainted with anybody on earth with such an infernal list of names as that roy who knew anything of roy it happens to be my fathers present name said i it sounds to me like the name of one of those blackguard adventurers who creep into families to catch the fools pursued the squire not hearing me with his eyes the letter at least must be answered my aunt dorothy said it shall be answered the squire worked himself up to roar he wrote a reply the contents of which i could guess at from my aunts refusal to let me be present at the discussion of it the letter despatched was written by her with his signature her eyes glittered for a whole day then came a statement of the young ladys case from bath look at that look at that cried the squire and went on look at that in a muffled way there was a touch of dignity in his unforced anger my aunt winced displeasingly to my sight i see nothing to astonish one nothing to astonish one the squire set his mouth in imitation of her you see nothing to astonish one well maam when a man grows old enough to be a grandfather i do see something astonishing in a child of nineteenby george its out o nature but you women like monstrosities oh i understand heres an heiress to fifteen thousand a year its not astonishing if every ruined gambler and scapegrace in the kingdoms hunting her hot no no thats not astonishing i suppose she has her money in a coal mine the squire had some of his in a coalmine my mother once had it was the delivery of a blow at my father signifying that he had the scent for this description of wealth i left the room the squire then affected that my presence had constrained him by bellowing out epithets easy for me to hear in the hall and out on the terrace he vowed by solemn oath he was determined to save this girl from ruin my aunts speech was brief i was summoned to bath by my father in a curious peremptory tone implying the utmost urgent need of me i handed the letter to the squire at breakfast saying you must spare me for a week or so sir he spread the letter flat with his knife and turned it over with his fork harry said he halfkindly and choking youre better out of it im the best friend he could have by him sir youre the best tool he could have handy for youre a gentleman i hope i shant offend you grandfather but i must go dont you see harry richmond youre in for an infernal marriage ceremony there the young lady is not of age interposed my aunt eh an infernal elopement then its clear the girls madheads cracked as a cocoanut bowled by a monkey brains nowhere harry youre not a greenhorn you dont suspect youre called down there to stop it do you you jump plump into a furious lot of the girls relatives you might as well take a header into a leechpond come youre a man think for yourself dont have this affair on your conscience boy i tell you harry richmond im against your going you go against my will you offend me sir you drag my name and blood into the mire shes welsh is she those welsh are addlepated every one poor girl he threw a horrible tremour into his accent of pity my aunt expressed her view mildly that i was sent for to help cure the young lady of her delusion and take her himself cried the squire harry you wouldnt go and do that why the law man the lawthe whole country d be up about it youll be stuck in a coloured caricature he was really alarmed lest this should be one of the consequences of my going and described some of the scourging caricatures of his day with an intense appreciation of their awfulness as engines of the moral sense of the public i went nevertheless chapter xxi a promenade in bath i found my father at his hotel sitting with his friend jorian dewitt whom i had met once before and thought clever he was an excaptain of dragoons a martyr to gout and addicted to burgundy which necessitated his resorting to the waters causing him as he said between his appetites and the penance he paid for them to lead the life of a pendulum my father was in a tempered gay mood examining a couple of the county newspapers one abused him virulently he was supported by the other after embracing me he desired me to listen while he read out opposing sentences from the columns of these eminent journals the person calling himself roy whose monstrously absurd pretensions are supposed to be embodied in this selfdubbed surname the celebrated and courtly mr richmond roy known no less by the fascination of his manners than by his romantic history has very soon succeeded in making himself the talk of the town has latterly become the theme of our teatables which is always the adventurers privilege through no fault of his own that we may throw light on the blushing aspirations of a crowsconced cupid it will be as well to recall the antecedents of this if no worse preposterous imitation buck of the old school suffice it without seeking to draw the veil from those affecting chapters of his earlier career which kindled for him the enthusiastic sympathy of all classes of his countrymen that he is not yet free from a tender form of persecution we think we are justified in entitling him the perkin warbeck of society reference might be made to mythological heroes hereat i cried out mercy captain dewitt stretched nursing a leg removed his silk handkerchief from his face to murmur the bass stedfastly drowns the treble if this is meant for harmony my father rang up the landlord and said to him the choicest of your cellar at dinner today mr lumley and mind you i am your guest and i exercise my right of compelling you to sit down with us and assist in consuming a doubtful quality of wine we dine four lay for five if your conscience is bad and i excuse you the man smirked he ventured to say he had never been so tempted to supply an inferior article my father smiled on him you invite our editorial advocate said captain dewitt our adversary said my father i protested i would not sit at table with him but he assured me he believed his advocate and his adversary to be one and the same and referred me to the collated sentences the man must earn his bread richie boy to tell truth it is the advocate i wish to rebuke and to praise the adversary it will confound him it does me said dewitt you perceive jorian a policy in dining these men of the press now and occasionally considering their growing power do you not ay ay its a great gossiping machine mon roy i prefer to let it spout i crave your permission to invite him in complimentary terms cousin jorian he is in the town remember it is for the good of the nation that he and his like should have the opportunity of studying good society as to myself personally i give him carte blanche to fire his shots at me near the fashionable hour of the afternoon my father took my arm captain dewitt a stick and we walked into the throng and buzz whenever you are to quote our advocate the theme of teatables richie said my father walk through the crowd it will wash you it is doing us the honour to observe us we in turn discover an interest in its general countenance he was received as we passed with much staring here and there a lifting of hats and some blunt nodding that incensed me but he feeling me bristle squeezed my hand and talked of the scene and ever and anon gathered a line of heads and shed an indulgent bow along them so on to the casino not once did he offend my taste and make my acute sense of selfrespect shiver by appearing grateful for a recognition or anxious to court it though the curtest salute met his acknowledgement the interior of the casino seemed more hostile i remarked it to him a trifle more eyeglassy he murmured he was quite at his easy there we walk up and down my son he said in answer to a question of mine because there are very few who can even walking is an art and if nobody does the place is dull the place is pretty well supplied with newspapers said captain dewitt and dowagers friend jorian they are cousins tis the fashion to have our tattle done by machinery they have their opportunity to compare the portrait with the original come invent some scandal for us let us make this place our social exchange i warrant a good bold piece of invention will fit them too some of them madammy father bowed low to the beckoning of a fan i trust your ladyship did not chance to overhear that last remark i made the lady replied i should have shut my eyes if i had i called you to tell me who is the young man for twenty years i have lived in the proud belief that he is my son i would not disturb it for the world she did me the honour to inspect me from the lowest waistcoat button to the eyebrows bring him to me tonight captain dewitt you have forsaken my whisttables purely temporary fits of unworthiness my lady in english gout not gout in the conscience i trust said my father oh thats curable laughed the captain you men of repartee would be nothing without your wickedness the lady observed man was supposed to be incomplete captain dewitt affected a murmur she nodded yes yes and lifted eyes on my father so you have not given up going to church he bent and spoke low she humphed her lips very well i will see it must be a night in the early part of the week after next then i really dont know why i should serve you but i like your courage i cannot consent to accept your ladyships favour on account of one single virtue said he drooping she waved him to move forward during this frothy dialogue i could see that the ear of the assembly had been caught by the sound of it that my father informed me is the great lady wilts now you will notice a curious thing lady wilts is not so old but that as our jorian here says of her she is marriageable hence richie she is a queen to make the masculine knee knock the ground i fear the same is not to be said of her rival lady denewdney whom our good jorian compares to an antiquated fledgeling emerging with effort from a nest of ill construction and worse cement she is rich she is sharp she uses her quill she is emphatically not marriageable bath might still accept her as a rival queen only she is always behindhand in seizing an occasion now you will catch sight of her fan working in a minute she is envious and imitative it would be undoubtedly better policy on her part to continue to cut me she cannot she is beginning to rustle like decembers oaks if lady wilts has me why she must we refrain from noticing her until we have turned twice ay richie there is this use in adversity it teaches one to play sword and target with etiquette and retenue better than any crowned king in europe for me now to cross to her summons immediately would be a gross breach of homage to lady wilts who was inspired to be the first to break through the fence of scandal environing me but i must still show that i am independent these people must not suppose that i have to cling to a party let them take sides i am on fair terms with both the rivals i show just such a nuance of a distinction in my treatment of them just suchenough i mean to make the flattered one warm to me and t other be jealous of her ay richie these things are trivial things beyond the grave but here are we my boy and by the way i suspect the great campaign of my life is opening captain dewitt said that if so it would be the tenth to his certain knowledge not great campaign my father insisted mere skirmishes before this they conversed in humorous undertones each in turn seeming to turn over the earth of some amusing reminiscence so rapt that as far as regarded their perception of it the assembly might have been nowhere perhaps consequently they became observed with all but undivided attention my fathers hand was on my shoulder his head toward captain dewitt instead of subduing his voice he gave it a moderate pitch at which it was not intrusive and was musical to my ear charming especially when he continued talking through his soft laughter like a hunter that would in good humour press for his game through links of waternymphs lady denewdneys fan took to beating time meditatively two or three times she kept it elevated and in vain the flow of their interchangeing speech was uninterrupted at last my father bowed to her from a distance she signalled his eyelids pleaded short sight awakening to the apprehension of a pleasant fact the fan tapped and he halted his march leaning scarce perceptibly in her direction the fan showed distress thereupon his voice subsided in his conversation with a concluding flash of animation across his features like a brook that comes to the leap on a descent and he left us captain dewitt and i were led by a common attraction to the portico the truth being that we neither of us could pace easily nor talk with perfect abandonment under eyefire any longer look said he to me pointing at the equipages and equestrians youll see a sight like this in dozensdozens of our cities and towns the wealth of this country is frightful my reply addressed at the same time mentally to temple at sea was well as long as we have the handsomest women i dont care captain dewitt was not so sure that we had the provenal women the women of a part of south germany and certain favoured spots of italy might challenge us he thought this was a point i could argue on or i should rather say take up the cudgels for i deemed such opinions treason to ones country and an outrage to common sense and i embarked in controversy with the singleminded intention of knocking down the man who held them he accepted his thrashing complacently now here comes a young lady on horseback he said do you spy her dark hair thick eyebrows rides well followed by a groom is she a beauty in the heat of patriotism i declared she was handsome and repeated it though i experienced a twinge of remorse like what i should have felt had i given minerva the apple instead of venus oh he commented and stepped down to the road to meet her beginning in my hearing i am the bearer of a compliment her thick eyebrows stood in a knot then she glanced at me and hung pensive she had not to wait a minute before my father came to her side i knew you would face them she said he threw back his head like a swimmer tossing spray from his locks you have read the paper he asked you have horsewhipped the writer she rejoined oh the poor penster nay we cant pretend to pity him could we condescend to offer him satisfaction would he dare to demand it we will lay the case before lady wilts tonight you are there tonight at lady denewdneys tomorrow nightif i may indulge a hope both oh bravo bravo tell me nothing more just now how did you manage it i must have a gallop yes i shall be at both be sure of that my father introduced me let me present to your notice my son harry lepel richmond miss penrhys she touched my fingers and nodded at me speaking to him he has a boys taste i hear he esteems me moderately wellfavoured an inherited error certain to increase with age now you have started me she exclaimed and lashed the flanks of her horse we had evidently been enacting a part deeply interesting to the population of bath for the heads of all the strolling groups were bent on us and when miss penrhys cantered away down dropped eyeglasses and the promenade returned to activity i fancied i perceived that my father was greeted more cordially on his way back to the hotel you do well richie he observed in preserving your composure until you have something to say wait for your opening it will come and the right word will come with it the main things are to be able to stand well walk well and look with an eye at home in its socket i put you my hand on any man or woman born of high bloodnot a brazen eyeof the two extremes i prefer the beaten spaniel sortblindfold me but i put you my hand on them as to repartee you must have it wait for that too do not he groaned do not force it bless my soul what is there in the world so bad and rising to the upper notes of his groan ignorance density total imbecility is better i would rather any day of my life sit and carve for gueststhe grossest of human trialsa detestable dinner than be doomed to hear some wretched fellowand you hear the old as well as the youngexcruciate feelings which where they exist cannot but be exquisitely delicate goodness gracious me to see the man pumping up his wit for me my visage is of an unalterable gravity whenever i am present at one of these exhibitions i care not if i offend let them say i wish to revolutionize societyi declare to you richie boy delightful to my heart though i find your keen stroke of repartee still your fellow who takes the thrust gracefully knows when hes traversed by a masterstroke and yields sign of it instead of plunging like a spitted buffalo and asking us to admire his agilityyou follow mei say i hold that manand i delight vastly in ready wit it is the wine of languagei regard that man as the superior being true he is not so entertaining my father pressed on my arm to intimate with a cavernous significance of eyebrow that captain dewitt had the gift of repartee in perfection jorian said he will you wager our editor declines to dine with us the answer struck me as only passable i think it was when rats smell death in toasted cheese captain dewitt sprang up the staircase of our hotel to his bedroom i should not have forced him my father mused jorian dewitt has at times brilliant genius richiein the way of rejoinders i mean this is his happy momenthis one hours dressing for dinner i have watched him he most thoroughly enjoys it i am myself a quick or slow dresser as the case may be but to watch jorian you cannot help entering into his enjoyment of it he will have his window with a view of the sunset there is his fire his warmed linen and his shirtstuds his bath his choice of a dozen things he will or will not wear the landlords or hosts menu is up against the lookingglass and the extremely handsome miniature likeness of his wife who is in the madhouse by a celebrated painter i forget his name jorian calls this new birthyou catch his idea he throws off the old and is on with the new with a highly hopeful anticipation his valet is a scoundrel but never fails in extracting the menu from the cook wherever he may be and in fine is too attentive to the hours devotion to be discarded poor jorian i know no man i pity so much i conceived him i confessed hardly pitiable though not enviable he has but six hundred a year and a passion for burgundy said my father we were four at table the editor came and his timidity soon wore off in the warmth of hospitality he appeared a kind exciteable little man glad of his dinner from the first and in due time proud of his entertainer his response to the toast of the fourth estate was an apology for its behaviour to my father he regretted it he regretted it a vinous speech my father heard him out addressing him subsequently i would not interrupt you in the delivery of your sentiments he said i must however man to man candidly tell you i should have wished to arrest your expressions of regret they convey to my mind an idea that on receipt of my letter of invitation you attributed to me a design to corrupt you protest nothing i beg editors are human after all now my object is that as you write of me you should have some knowledge of me and i naturally am interested in one who does me so much honour the facts of my life are at your disposal for publication and comment simply i entreat you say this one thing of me i seek for justice but i never complain of my fortunes providence decidesthat might be the motto engraven on my heart nay i may risk declaring it is in the end i shall be righted meanwhile you contribute to my happiness by favouring me with your society ah sir replied the little man were all our great people like you in the countrythe provincesthey treat the representatives of the fourth estate as the squires a couple of generations back used to treat the parsons what have you got a place at their tables inquired captain dewitt no i cannot say thatnot even below the salt mr richmondmr roy you may not be aware of it i am the proprietor of the opposition journals in this county i tell you in confidence one by itself would not pay and i am a printer sir and it is on my conscience to tell you i have in the course of business been compelled this very morning to receive orders for the printing of various squibs and i much fear scurrilous things my father pacified him you will do your duty to your family mr hickson deeply moved the little man pulled out proofsheets and slips even now at the eleventh hour he urged there is time to correct any glaring falsehoods insults what not my father accepted the copy of proofs not a wordnot a line you spoke of the eleventh hour mr hickson if we are at all near the eleventh i must be on my way to make my bow to lady wilts or is it lady denewdneys tonight no tomorrow night a light of satisfaction came over mr hicksons face at the mention of my fathers visiting both these sovereign ladies as soon as we were rid of him captain dewitt exclaimed if thats the fourth estate whats the realm the estate pleaded my father is here in its infancyon all fours prehensile egad it has the vices of the other three besides its own do you mean that by putting it on all fours jorian i have noticed that when you are malignant you are not witty we have to thank the man for not subjecting us to a pledge of secresy my lady wilts will find the proofs amusing and mark i do not examine their contents before submitting them to her inspection you will testify to the fact i was unaware that my father played a masterstroke in handing these proofsheets publicly to lady wilts for her perusal the incident of the evening was the display of her character shown by miss penrhys in positively declining to quit the house until she likewise had cast her eye on them one of her aunts wept their carriage was kept waiting an hour you ask too much of me i cannot turn her out lady wilts said to her uncle and aside to my father you will have to marry her in heavens name keep me from marriage my lady i heard him reply there was sincerity in his tone when he said that chapter xxii conclusion of the bath episode the friends of miss penrhys were ill advised in trying to cry down a man like my father active persecution was the breath of life to him when untroubled he was apt to let both his ambition and his dignity slumber the squibs and scandal set afloat concerning him armed his wit nerved his temper touched him with the spirit of enterprise he became a new creature i lost sight of certain characteristics which i had begun to ponder over critically i believed with all my heart that circumstances were blameable for much that did not quite please me upon the question of his magnanimity as well as of his courage there could not be two opinions he would neither retort nor defend himself i perceived some grandeur in his conduct without however appreciating it cordially as i did a refinement of discretion about him that kept him from brushing good taste while launched in ostentatious displays he had a fine tact and a keen intuition he may have thought it necessary to throw a little dust in my eyes but i doubt his having done it for he had only as he knew to make me jealous to blind me to his faults utterly and he refrained in his allusions to the young lady he was apologetic affectionate one might have fancied oneself listening to a gracious judge who had well weighed her case and exculpated her from other excesses than that of a generous folly jorian dewitt a competent critic pronounced his behaviour consummate at all points for my behoof he hinted antecedent reverses to the picture meditating upon which i traced them to the fatal want of money and that i might be able to fortify him in case of need i took my own counsel and wrote to my aunt for the loan of as large a sum as she could afford to send her eagerness for news of our doings was insatiable you do not describe her she replied not naming miss penrhys and again i can form no image of her your accounts of her are confusing tell me earnestly do you like her she must be very wilful but is she really nice i want to know how she appears to my harrys mind my father borrowed these letters and returning them to me said a good soul the best of women therethere is a treasure lost his forehead was clouded in speaking he recommended me to assure my aunt that she would never have to take a family interest in miss penrhys but this was not deemed perfectly satisfactory at riversley my aunt wrote am i to understand that you harry raise objections to her think first whether she is in herself objectionable she is rich she may be prudent she may be a forethoughtful person she may not be able to support a bitter shock of grief she may be one who can help she may not be one whose heart will bear it put your own feelings aside my dearest our duties cannot ever be clear to us until we do it is possible for headstrong wilfulness and secret tenderness to go together think whether she is capable of sacrifice before you compel her to it do not inflict misery wantonly one would like to see her harry i brood on your future that is why i seem to you preternaturally anxious about you she seemed to me preternaturally anxious about miss penrhys my father listened in silence to my flippant satire on womens letters he answered after a pause our jorian says that womens letters must be read like anagrams to put it familiarly they are like a childs field of hopscotch you may have noticed the urchins at their game a bit of tile and a variety of compartments to pass it through to the base hopping or no richie pooh tis an unworthy comparison this hopscotch i mean laddie they write in zigzags and so will you when your heart trumpets in your ear tell her tell that dear noble good womansay we are happy you and i and alone and shall be and do me the favourshe loves you my sonaddress her sometimesshe has been itcall her mother she will like it she deservesnothing shall supplant her he lost his voice she sent me three hundred pounds she must have supposed the occasion pressing thus fortified against paternal improvidence i expended a hundred in the purchase of a horse and staked the remainder on him in a match and was beaten disgusted with the horse i sold him for half his purchasemoney and with that sum paid a bill to maintain my fathers credit in the town figuratively speaking i looked at my hands as astonished as i had been when the poor little rascal in the street snatched my cake and gave me the vision of him gorging it in the flurried alley of the london crowd money goes i remarked that is the general experience of the nature of money said my father freshly but nevertheless you will be surprised to find how extraordinarily few are the people to make allowance for particular cases it plays the trick with everybody and almost nobody lets it stand as a plea for the individual here is jorian and you my son and perhaps your aunt dorothy and upon my word i think i have numbered all i knowor ay sukey sampleman i should not omit her in an honourable listand that makes positively all i know who would commiserate a man touched on the shoulder by a sheriffs officernot that such an indignity is any longer done to me i hope we have seen the last of shylocks greatgrandnephew said i emphatically merely to give you the instance richie ay i hope so i hope so but it is the nature of money that you never can tell if the boardings sound once be dependent upon it but this is talk for tradesmen thinking it so myself i had not attempted to discover the source of my fathers income such as it was it was paid halfyearly and spent within a month of the receipt for the most signal proof possible of its shameful insufficiency thus ten months of the year at least he lived protesting and many with him compulsorily for two months he was a brilliant man i penetrated his mystery enough to abstain from questioning him and enough to determine that on my coming of age he should cease to be a pensioner petitioner and adventurer he aimed at a manifest absurdity in the meantime after the lesson i had received as to the nature of money i saw with some alarm my father preparing to dig a great pit for it he had no doubt performed wonders despite of scandal and tattle and the deadly report of a penniless fortunehunter having fascinated the young heiress he commanded an entrance to the receptions of both the rival ladies dominant these ladies lady wilts and lady denewdney who moved each in her select halfcircle and could heretofore be induced by none to meet in a common centre had pledged themselves to honour with their presence a ball he proposed to give to the choice world here assembled on a certain illuminated day of the calendar so i have now possession of bath richie said he twinkling to propitiate me lest i should suspect him of valuing his achievements highly he had he continued promised hickson of the fourth estate that he would before leaving the place do his utmost to revive the ancient glories of bath bath had once set the fashion to the kingdom why not again i might have asked him why at all or why at his expense but his lead was irresistible captain dewitt and his valet and i and a score of ladies scores of tradesmen were rushing reluctant or not on a torrent my part was to show that i was an athlete and primarily that i could fence and shoot it will do no harm to let it be known said dewitt he sat writing letters incessantly my father made the tour of his fair stewardesses from noon to three after receiving in audience his jewellers linendrapers carpenters confectioners from nine in the morning till twelve at three oclock business ceased workmen then applying to him for instructions were despatched to the bar of the hotel bearing the recommendation to the barmaid not to supply them refreshment if they had ever in their lives been seen drunk at four he dressed for afternoon parade nor could his enemy have said that he was not the chief voice and eye along his line of march his tall full figure maintained a superior air without insolence and there was a leaping beam in his large blue eyes together with the signification of movement coming to his kindly lips such as hardly ever failed to waken smiles of greeting people smiled and bowed and forgot their curiosity forgot even to be critical while he was in sight i can say this for i was acutely critical of their bearing the atmosphere of the place was never perfectly pleasing to me my attitude of watchful reserve and my reputation as the heir of immense wealth tended possibly to constrain a certain number of the inimical party to be ostensibly civil lady wilts who did me the honour to patronize me almost warmly complimented me on my manner of backing him as if i were the hero but i felt his peculiar charm she partly admitted it making a whimsical mouth saying in allusion to miss penrhys i you know am past twenty at twenty forty is charming at forty twenty where i served him perhaps was in showing my resolution to protect him he had been insulted before my arrival the male relatives of miss penrhys did not repeat the insult they went to lady wilts and groaned over their hard luck in not having the option of fighting me i was in her phrase a new piece on the board and checked them thus if they provoked a challenge from me they brought the destructive odour of powder about the headstrong creatures name i was therefore of use to him so far i leaned indolently across the rails of the promenade while she bent and chattered in his ear and her attendant cousin and cavalier chewed vexation in the form of a young mustachios curl his horse fretted he murmured deep notes and his look was savage but he was bound to wait on her and she would not go until it suited her pleasure she introduced him to meas if conversation could be carried on between two young men feeling themselves simply pieces on the board one giving check and the other chafing under it i need not say that i disliked my situation it was worse when my father took to bowing to her from a distance unobservant of her hands prompt pull at the reins as soon as she saw him lady wilts had assumed the right of a woman still possessing attractions to exert her influence with him on behalf of the family for i had done my best to convince her that he entertained no serious thought of marrying and decidedly would not marry without my approval he acted on her advice to discourage the wilful girl how is it i am so hateful to you miss penrhys accosted me abruptly i fancied she must have gone mad and an interrogative frown was my sole answer oh i hear that you pronounce me everywhere unendurable she continued you are young and you misjudge me in some way and i should be glad if you knew me better byandby in walesare you fond of mountain scenery we might be good friends my temper is not badat least i hope not heaven knows what ones relatives think of one will you visit us i hear you have promised your confidante lady wilts at a dancing party where we met she was thrown on my hands by her ungovernable vehemence and i as i had told lady wilts not being able to understand the liking of twenty for forty fifty would have been nearer the actual mark or sixty offered her no lively sympathy i believe she had requested my father to pay public court to her if captain dewitt was to be trusted she desired him to dance and dance with her exclusively and so confirm and defy the tattle of the town but my father hovered between the dowagers she in consequence declined to dance which was the next worse thing she could do an aunt a miserable woman was on her left on her right she contrived too frequently for my peace of mind to reserve a vacant place for me and she eyed me intently across the room under her persistent brows until perforce i was drawn to her side i had to listen to a repetition of sharp queries and replies and affect a flattered gaiety feeling myself most uncomfortably as captain dewitt who watched us said chip the son of block the father by fixing the son beside her she defeated the fathers scheme of coldness and made it appear a concerted piece of policy even i saw that i saw more than i grasped love for my father was to my mind a natural thing a proof of taste and goodness women might love him but the love of a young girl with the mornings mystery about her and for my progenitora girl as i reflected in the midst of my interjections wellbuilt cleareyed animated clever with soft white hands and pretty feet how could it be she was sombre as a sunken fire until he at last came round to her and then her sudden vivacity was surprising affairs were no further advanced when i had to obey the squires commands and return to riversley missing the night of the grand ball with no profound regret except for my fathers sake he wrote soon after one of his characteristic letters to tell me that the ball had been a success immediately upon this announcement he indulged luxurious reflections as his manner was to have stirred up the old place and given it something to dream of for the next half century is a satisfaction richie i have a kindness for bath i leave it with its factions reconciled its teatables furnished with inexhaustible supplies of the chief thing necessary and the persuasion firmly established in my own bosom that it is impossible to revive the past so we must march with the age and let me add all but every one of the bills happily discharged to please you pray fag at your german if as i myself confess to you have enjoyment of old ways habits customs and ceremonies look to court life it is only in courts that a man may now air a leg and there the women are works of art if you are deficient in calves which my boy thank heaven will never be charged with you are there found out and in fact every deficiency every qualification is at once in patent exhibition at a court i fancy parliament for you still and that is no impediment as a step jorian would have you sit and wallow in ease and buy by the way we might think of it a famous burgundy vineyard for an investment devote the prime of your life to the discovery of a cook your manhood to perfect the creatures educationso forth i imagine you are to get five years of ample gratification a promise hardly to be relied on in the sere leaf and so perish take poor jorian for an example of what the absence of ambition brings men to i treasure jorian i hoard the poor fellow to have him for a lesson to my boy witty and shrewd and a masterly tactician i wager he would have won his spurs on the field of battle you see him now living for one hour of the dayabsolutely twentythree hours of the mans life are chained slaves beasts of burden to the fourandtwentieth so i repeat fag at your german miss penrhys retires to her native wales jorian and i on to london to the continent plinlimmon guard us all i send you our local newspapers that i cut entrechats is false it happens to be a thing i could do and not an englishman in england except myself only i did not do it i did appear in what i was educated to believe was the evening suit of a gentleman and i cannot perceive the immodesty of showing my leg a dress that is not indecent and is becoming to me and is the dress of my fathers i wear and i impose it on the generation of my sex however i dined hickson of the fourth estate jorian considers him hungry enough to eat up his twentieth before he diesi forget the wording of the mot that he might know i was without rancour in the end as originally i had been without any intention of purchasing his allegiance he offered me his columns he wished me luck with the heiress by his gods he swore he worshipped entrechats and held a silk leg the most admirable work of the manufactures sir youre a gentleman says he youre a nobleman sir youre a prince youre a star of the first magnitude cries jorian retract that scum you see nothing large but what you dare to think neighbours you and quarrels the inebriate dog and this is the maker and destroyer of reputations in his day i study hickson as a miraculous engine of the very simplest contrivance he is himself the epitome of a verdict on his period next day he disclaimed in his opposition penny sheet the report of the entrechats and the spectators laughing consumedly and sent me as i had requested him to do the names of his daughters to whom i transmit little comforting presents for if they are nice children such a parent must afflict them cultivate lady wilts you have made an impression she puts you forward as a good specimen of our young men hem madam but my dear boy as i said we cannot revive the past i acknowledge it bath rebukes my last fit of ambition and the experience is very well worth the expense you have a mind richie for discussing outlay upon which i congratulate you so long as you do not overlook equivalents the system of the world is barter varied by robbery show that you have something in hand and you enjoy the satisfaction of knowing that you were not robbed i pledge you my word to iti shall not repeat bath and mark you an heiress is never compromised i am not i hope responsible for every creature caught up in my circle of attraction believe me dear boy i should consult you and another one estimable beyond mortal speech if i had become involvedimpossible no i am free of all fresh chains because of the old ones years will not be sufficient for us when you and i once begin to talk in earnest when i open to resumeso i leave bath with a light conscience mixed with pleasant recollections is the transient regret that you were not a spectator of the meeting of the wilts and denewdney streams jorian compared them to the rhone and thei forget the name of the river below genevadirtyish for there was a transparent difference in the denewdney style of dress and did i choose it i could sit and rule those two factions as despotically as buonaparte his frenchmen ask me what i mean by scaling billows richie i will some day tell you i have done it all my life and here i am but i thank heaven i have a son i love and i can match him against the best on earth and henceforward i live for him to vindicate and right the boy and place him in his legitimate sphere from this time i take to looking exclusively forward and i labour diligently i have energies not to boast darling old son i tell truth i am only happy when my heart is beating near you here comes the mother in me pumping up adieu lebe wohl the germanthe germanmay god in his barmherzigkeittell her i never encouraged the girl have literally nothing to trace a temporary wrinkle on my forehead as regards conscience i say may it please providence to make you a good german scholar by the day of your majority hurrah for it present my humble warm respects to your aunt dorothy i pray to heaven nightly for one of its angels on earth kunst wissenschaft ehre liebe die liebe quick at the german poets frau frulein i am actually dazzled at the prospect of our future to be candid i no longer see to write grss dich herzlich from vienna to you next lebe wohl my aunt dorothy sent a glance at the letter while i was folding it evidently thinking my unwillingness to offer it a sign of bad news or fresh complications she spoke of miss penrhys oh thats over said i heiresses soon get consoled she accused me of having picked up a vulgar idea i maintained that it was my fathers it cannot be your fathers said she softly and on affirming that he had uttered it and written it she replied in the same tone more effective than the ordinary language of conviction he does not think it the rage of a youth to prove himself in the right of an argument was insufficient to make me lay the letter out before other eyes than my own and i shrank from exposing it to compassionate gentle eyes that would have pleaded similar allowances to mine for the wildness of the style i should have thanked but despised the intelligence of one who framed my excuses for my father just as the squire by abusing him would have made me a desperate partisan in a minute the vitality of the delusion i cherished was therefore partly extinct not so the love yet the love of him could no longer shake itself free from oppressive shadows out of his circle of attraction books were my resource chapter xxiii my twentyfirst birthday books and dreams like the two rivers cited by my father flowed side by side in me without mixing and which the bright rhone was which the brown arve needs not to be told to those who know anything of youth they were destined to intermingle soon enough i read well for i felt ground and had mounting views the real world and the mind and passions of the world grew visible to me my tutor pleased the squire immensely by calling me matteroffact in philosophy and history i hated speculation but nothing was too fantastic for my ideas of possible occurrences once away from books i carried a head that shot rockets to the farthest hills my dear friend temple was at sea or i should have had one near me to detect and control the springs of nonsense i was deemed a remarkably quiet sober thoughtful young man acquiescent in all schemes projected for my welfare the squire would have liked to see me courting the girl of his heart as he termed janet ilchester a little more demonstratively we had however come to the understanding that i was to travel before settling traditional notions of the importance of the grand tour in the education of gentlemen led him to consent to my taking a year on the continent accompanied by my tutor he wanted some one he said to represent him when i was out over there which signified that he wanted some one to keep my father in check but as the rev ambrose peterborough successor to the rev simon hart was hazy and manageable i did not object such faith had the quiet thoughtful young man at riversley in the convulsions of the future the whirlwinds and whirlpools spinning for him and all connected with him that he did not object to hear his name and janets coupled though he had not a spark of love for her i tried to realize to myself the general opinion that she was handsome her eyebrows were thick and level and long her eyes direct in their gaze of a flinty blue with dark lashes her nose firm her lips fullish firm when joined her shape straight moderately flexible but she had no softness she could admire herself in my presence she claimed possession of me openly and at the same time openly provoked a siege from the remainder of my sex she was not maidenly she caught imagination by the sleeve and shut it between square whitewashed walls heriot thought her not only handsome but comparable to mrs william bulsted our julia rippenger of old at his meeting with julia her delicious loss of colour made her seem to me one of the loveliest women on earth janet never lost colour rarely blushed she touched neither nerve nor fancy you want a rousing coquette said heriot you wont be happy till youve been racked by that nice instrument of torture and the fair bulsted will do it for you if you like you dont want a snake or a common serpent you want a python i wanted bloom and mystery a woman shifting like the light with evening and night and dawn and sudden fire janet was bald to the heart inhabiting me then as if quite shaven she could speak her affectionate mind as plain as print and it was dull print facing me not the arches of the sunset julia had only to lisp my husband to startle and agitate me beyond expression she said simple thingsi slept well last night or i dreamed or i shivered and plunged me headlong down impenetrable forests the mould of her mouth to a reluctant no and her almost invariable drawing in of her breath with a yes surcharged the everyday monosyllables with meanings of life and death at last i was reduced to tell her seeing that she reproached my coldness for janet how much i wished janet resembled her her irish eyes lightened me harry then they shadowed she is worth ten of me such pathetic humility tempted me to exalt her supremely i talked like a boy feeling like a man she behaved like a woman blushing like a girl julia i can never call you mrs bulsted you have an affection for my husband have you not harry of a season when this was adorable language to me the indication is sufficient riding out perfectly crazed by it i met kiomi and transferred my emotions the squire had paid her people an annual sum to keep away from our neighbourhood while there was a chance of my taking to gipsy life they had come back to their old campingground rather dissatisfied with the squire speak to him yourself kiomi said i whatever you ask for he cant refuse anything to such eyes as yours you she rallied me why cant you talk sensible stuff she had grown a superb savage proof against weather and compliments her face was like an egyptian sky fronting night the strong old eastern blood put ruddy flame for the red colour tawny olive edged from the red rare vivid yellow all but amber the light that first looks down upon the fallen sun was her complexion above the brows and round the cheeks the necks nape the throat and the firm bosom prompt to lift and sink with her vigour of speech as her eyes were to flash and darken meeting her you swore she was the personification of wandering asia there was no question of beauty and grace for these have laws the curve of her brows broke like a beaten wave the lips and nostrils were wide tragic in repose but when she laughed she illuminated you where she stepped she made the earth hers she was as fresh of her east as the morning when her ancient people struck tents in the track of their shadows i write of her in the style consonant to my ideas of her at the time i would have carried her off on the impulse and lived her life merely to have had such a picture moving in my sight and call it mine youre not married i said ludicrously faintly ive not seen the man id marry she answered grinning scorn the prizefighter had adopted drinking for his pursuit one of her aunts was dead and she was in quest of money to bury the dead woman with the conventional ceremonies and shows of respect dear to the hearts of gipsies whose sense of propriety and adherence to customs are a sentiment indulged by them to a degree unknown to the stabled classes in fact they have no other which does not come under the definite title of pridepride in their physical prowess their dexterity ingenuity and tricksiness and their purity of blood kiomi confessed she had hoped to meet me confessed next that she had been waiting to jump out on me and next that she had sat in a tree watching the grange yesterday for six hours and all for money to do honour to her dead relative poor little soul heriot and i joined the decent procession to the grave her people had some quarrel with the durstan villagers and she feared the scandal of being pelted on the way to the church i knew that nothing of the sort would happen if i was present kiomi walked humbly with her head bent leaving me the thick rippling coarse black locks of her hair for a mark of observation we were entertained at her camp in the afternoon i saw no sign of intelligence between her and heriot on my asking her the day before if she remembered him she said i do im dangerous for that young man heriots comment on her was impressed on me by his choosing to call her a fine doe leopard and maintaining that it was a defensible phrase she was swept from my amorous mind by mabel sweetwinter the millers daughter of dipwell this was a saxon beauty in full bud yellow as midmay with the eyes of opening june beauty you will say is easily painted in that style but the sort of beauty suits the style and the wellworn comparisons express the wellknown type beside kiomi she was like a rich meadow on the border of the heaths we saw them together on my twentyfirst birthday to my shame i awoke in the early morning at riversley forgetful of my fathers old appointment for the great dipwell feast not long after sunrise when blackbirds peck the lawns and swallows are out from under eaves to the floods face i was hailed by janet ilchester beneath my open windows i knew she had a bet with the squire that she would be the first to hail me legal man and was prepared for it she sat on horseback alone in the hazy dewy midsummer morning giving clear note whoop harry richmond halloo to which i tossed her a foxs brush having a jewelled bracelet pendant she missed it and let it lie and laughed no no its foxie himselfanybody may have the brush youre dressed are you harry you were sure i should come a thousand happy years to you and me to see them if you dont mind im first to wish it im certain i was awake at three out at halfpast over durstan heath across eckerthys fieldswell pay the old man for damagedown by the plantation bran and sailor at my heels and here i am crow cocks bark dogs up larks i said id be first and now im round to stables to stir up uberly dont be tardy mr harry and well be commodore arson and his crew before the worlds awake we rode out for a couple of hours and had to knock at a farmhouse for milk and bread possibly a sense of independence owing to the snatching of a meal in midflight away from home made janet exclaim that she would gladly be out all day such freaks were exceedingly to my taste then i remembered dipwell and sure that my father would be there though he had not written of it i proposed to ride over she pleaded for the horses and the squire alternately feasting was arranged at riversley as well as at dipwell and she said musically harry the squire is a very old man and you may not have many more chances of pleasing him today do do tomorrow ride to your father if you must of course you must if you think it right but dont go this day not upset my fortune janet dont hurt the kind old mans heart today oh youre the girl of his heart i know well harry you have first place and i want you to keep it but heres an oath ive sworn to my father he should not have exacted it i think i promised him when i was a youngster then be wiser now harry you have brilliant ideas of the sacredness of engagements i think i have common sense thats all this is a matter of feeling it seems that you forgot it though kiomis tents on durstan heath rose into view i controlled my verbal retort upon janet to lead her up to the gipsy girl for whom she had an odd aversion dating from childhood kiomi undertook to ride to dipwell a distance of thirty miles and carry the message that i would be there by nightfall tears were on janets resolute face as we cantered home after breakfast the squire introduced me to his lawyer mr burgin who closeted alone with me said formally mr harry richmond you are squire belthams grandson his sole male descendant and you are established at present and as far as we can apprehend for the future as the direct heir to the whole of his property which is enormous now and likely to increase so long as he lives you may not be aware that your grandfather has a most sagacious eye for business had he not been born a rich man he would still have been one of our very greatest millionaires he has rarely invested but to double his capital never speculated but to succeed he may not understand men quite so well but then he trusts none entirely so if there is a chasm in his intelligence there is a bridge thrown across it the metaphor is obscure perhaps you will doubtless see my meaning he knows how to go on his road without being cheated for himself your grandfather mr harry is the soul of honour now i have to explain certain family matters the squires wife your maternal grandmother was a rich heiress part of her money was settled on her to descend to her children by reversion upon her death what she herself possessed she bequeathed to them in reversion likewise to their children thus at your maternal grandmothers death your mother and your aunt inherited money to use as their own and the interest of money tied fast in reversion to their children in case of marriage after their death your grandfather as your natural guardian has left the annual interest of your money to accumulate and now you are of age he hands it to you as you see without much delay thus you become this day the possessor of seventy thousand pounds respecting the disposal of which i am here to take your orders ahemas to the remaining property of your mothersthe sum held by her for her own use i mean it devolved to her husband your father who it is probable will furnish you an account of itahat his leisureah um and now in addition mr harry i have the squires commands to speak to you as a man of business on what may be deemed a delicate subject though from the business point of view no peculiar delicacy should pertain to it your grandfather will settle on you estates and money to the value of twenty thousand pounds per annum on the day of your union with a young lady in this district miss janet ilchester he undertakes likewise to provide her pinmoney also let me observe that it is his requestbut he makes no stipulation of it that you will ultimately assume the name of beltham subscribing yourself harry lepel richmond beltham or if it pleases you richmondbeltham with the junction hyphen needless to say he leaves it to your decision and now mr harry i have done and may most cordially congratulate you on the blessings it has pleased a kind and discerning providence to shower on your head none so grimly ironical as the obsequious i thought of burgins discerning providence he spoke with all professional sincerity in after days on the occasion i thought of nothing but the squires straightforwardness and grieved to have to wound him janet helped me she hinted with a bashfulness quite new to her that i must go through some ceremony guessing what it was i saluted her on the cheek the squire observed that a kiss of that sort might as well have been planted on her back hair but said he and wisely id rather have the girl worth ten of you than you be more than her match girls like my girl here are precious owing to her intercession he winked at my departure after i had done duty among the tenants he barely betrayed his vexation and it must have been excessive heriot and i rode over to dipwell next night we rode back by moonlight with matter for a year of laughter singing like two arabian poets praises of dark and fair challengeing one to rival the other kiomi mabel we shouted separately we had just seen the dregs of the last of the birthday burgundy kiomi what a splendid panther she is cries heriot and i teeth and claws and a skin like a burnt patch on a common mabels like a wonderful sunflower butter and eggs old richie and about as much fire as a rushlight if the race were fat shed beat the world heriot i give you my word of honour the very look of hers eternal summer kiomi rings thinshe tinkles its the difference between metal and flesh did she tinkle as you call it when that fellow destrier confound him touched her the little cat did you notice mabels blush how could i help it weve all had a dozen apiece you saw little kiomi curled up under the hop and briony i took her for a dead jackdaw i took her for what she is and she may slap scream tear and bite ill take her yetand all her tribe crying thief by way of a diversion she and i are footed a pair his impetuosity surpassed mine so much that i fell to brooding on the superior image of my charmer the result was i could not keep away from her i managed to get home with leaden limbs next day i was back at dipwell such guilt as i have to answer for i may avow i made violent love to this silly country beauty and held every advantage over her other flatterers she had met me on the evening of the great twentyfirst she and a line of damsels dressed in white and wearing wreaths and i had claimed the privilege of saluting her the chief superintendent of the festivities my fathers old cook monsieur alphonse turned twilight into noonday with a sheaf of rockets at the moment my lips brushed her cheek it was a kiss marred i claimed to amend it besides we had been bosom friends in childhood my wonder at the growth of the rose i had left but an insignificant thorny shoot was exquisite natural flattery sweet reason to which she could not say nonsense at each step we trod on souvenirs innocent in themselves had they recurred to childish minds the whisper hark its sunset mabel martha thresher calls clouded her face with stormy sunset colours i respected martha even then for boldly speaking to me on the girls behalf mrs waddys courage failed john thresher and mark sweetwinter were overcome by my fathers princely prodigality their heads were turned they appeared to have assumed that i could do no wrong to cut short the episode some one wrote to the squire in uncouth english telling him i was courting a country lass and he at once started me for the continent we had some conversation on money before parting the squire allowed me a thousand a year independent of my own income he counselled prudence warned me that i was on my trial and giving me his word of honour that he should not spy into my bank accounts desired me to be worthy of the trust reposed in me speculation he forbade i left him satisfied with the assurance that i meant to make my grand tour neither as a merchant a gambler nor a rake but simply as a plain english gentleman theres nothing better in the world than that said he arrived in london i left my travelling companion the rev ambrose peterborough sipping his port at the hotel and rushed down to dipwell shot a pebble at mabels window by morning twilight and soon had her face at the casement but it was a cloudy and rainbeaten face she pointed toward the farm saying that my father was there has he grieved you mabel i asked softly oh no not he he wouldnt he couldnt he talked right oh go go for i havent a foot to move and dont speak so soft i cant bear kindness my father in admonishing her had done it tenderly i was sure tenderness was the weapon which had wounded her and so she shrank from it and if i had reproached and abused her she might perhaps have obeyed me by coming out not to return she was deaf i kissed my hand to her regretfully a condition of spirit gradually dissolved by the haunting phantom of her forehead and mouth crumpling up for fresh floods of tears had she concealed that vision with her handkerchief i might have waited to see her before i saw my father he soon changed the set of the current our little mabel here he said is an inflammable puss i fear by the way talking of girls i have a surprise for you remind me of it when we touch ostend we may want a yacht there to entertain high company i have set inquiries afloat for the hire of a schooner this child mabel can read and write i suppose best write no letters boy do not make old dipwell a thorny bed i have a portrait to show you richie a portrait i think you will say the original was worthy of more than to be taken up and thrown away like a weed you see richie girls have only one chance in the world and good god to ruin thatno no you shall see this portrait a pretty little cowlike mabel i grant you but to have her on the conscience what a coronet to wear my young lord destrieryou will remember him as one of our guests here i brought him to make your acquaintance well he would not be scrupulous it is possible ay but compare yourself with him richie and you and i let us love one another and have no nettles he flourished me away to london into new spheres of fancy he was irresistible in a london club i was led up to the miniature of a youthful woman singular for her endearing beauty her cheeks were merry red her lips lively with the spark of laughter her eyes in good union with them showing you the laughter was gentle eyes of overflowing blue light who is she i asked the oldfashioned building of the powdered hair counselled me to add who was she captain dewitt though a member of the club seemed unable to inform me his glance consulted my father he hummed and drawled and said mistress anastasia dewsbury that was her name she does not look a grandmother said my father she would be one by this time i dare say said i we gazed in silence yes he sighed she was a charming actress and one of the best of women a nobleminded young woman a woman of cultivation and genius do you see a broken heart in that face no very well a walk will take us to her grave she died early i was breathing who when he said she was my mother my dear it was piteous we walked to an old worn flat stone in a london street where under i had to imagine those features of beautiful humanity lying shut from us she had suffered in life miserably chapter xxiv i meet the princess hearing that i had not slept at the hotel the rev ambrose rushed down to riversley with melancholy ejaculations and was made to rebound by the squires contemptuous recommendation to him to learn to know something of the spirit of young bloods seeing that he had the nominal charge of one and to preach his sermon in secret if he would be sermonizing out of church the good gentleman had not exactly understood his duties or how to conduct them far from objecting to find me in company with my father as he would otherwise have done by transmitting information of that fact to riversley he now congratulated himself on it and after the two had conversed apart cordially agreed to our scheme of travelling together the squire had sickened him i believe that by comparison he saw in my father a better friend of youth we shall not be the worse for a ghostly adviser at hand my father said to me with his quaintest air of gravity and humour mixed which was not insincerely grave for the humour was unconscious an accredited casuist may frequently be a treasure and i avow it i like to travel with my private chaplain mr peterboroughs temporary absence had allowed me time for getting ample funds placed at our disposal through the agency of my fathers solicitors messrs dettermain and newson whom i already knew from certain transactions with them on his behalf they were profoundly courteous to me and showed me his box and alluded to his casea long one and a lamentable i was taught to apprehend by their lugubriously professional tone about it the question was naturally prompted in me why do you not go on with it want of funds theres no necessity to name that now i insisted but my father desired them to postpone any further exposition of the case saying pleasure first business byandby that i take it is in the order of our great mother nature gentlemen i will not have him help shoulder his fathers pack until he has had his fill of entertainment a smooth voyage brought us in view of the towers of ostend at sunrise standing with my father on deck and gazing on this fringe of the grand romantic continent i remembered our old travels and felt myself bound to him indissolubly ashamed of my recent critical probings of his character my boys love for him returned in full force i was sufficiently cognizant of his history to know that he kept his head erect lighted by the fire of his robust heart in the thick of overhanging natal clouds as the way is with men when they are too happy to be sentimental i chattered of anything but my feelings what a capital idea that was of yours to bring down old alphonse to dipwell you should have heard old john thresher and mark sweetwinter and the others grumbling at the interference of french frogs with their beef though alphonse vowed he only ordered the ox to be turned faster and he dressed their potatoes in six different ways i doubt if dipwell has composed itself yet you know i sat for president in their tent while the beef went its first round and alphonse was in an awful hurry to drag me into what he called the royal tent by the way you should have hauled the standard down at sunset not when the son had not come down among us said my father smiling well i forgot to tell you about alphonse by the way well have him in our service there was he plucking at me monsieur henririchie monsieur henririchie mille complimens et les potages monsieur la camrani la tortue aux petits pois cest en vrai artiste que jai su tout retarder jusquau dernier moment monsieur cher monsieur henririchie je vous en supplie laissezl ces planteurs de choux and john thresher as spokesman for the rest master harry we beg to say in my name we cant masticate comfortably while weve got a notion mr frenchman hes present here to play his frenchified tricks with our plain wholesome dishes our opinion is he dont know beef from hedgehog and let him trim em and egg em and breadcrumb em and pound the mess all his might and then tak and roll em into balls we say we wunt for we cant make english muscle out o thatand alphonse quite indifferent to the vulgar h mais pensez donc au papa monsieur henririchie sans doute il a une sant de fer mais encore fautil lui mnager le suc gastrique pancratique ay ay laughed my father what sets you thinking of alphonse i suppose because i shall have to be speaking french in an hour german richie german but these belgians speak french such french as it is you will however be engaged in a german conversation first i suspect very well ill stumble on i dont much like it in six hours from this second of time richie boy i undertake to warrant you fonder of the german tongue than of any other spoken language i looked at him he gave me a broad pleasant smile without sign of a jest lurking in one corner the scene attracted me laughing fishwife faces radiant with seabloom in among the weedy pierpiles and sombre bluecheeked officers of the douane with their double row of buttons extending the breadth of their shoulders my father won mr peterboroughs approval by declaring cigars which he might easily have passed and now sirhe used the commanding unction of a ladys doctoryou to bed and a short repose we will if it pleases you breakfast at eight i have a surprise for mr richie we are about to beat the drum in the marketplace and sing out for echoes indeed sir said the simple man i promise you we shall not disturb you mr peterborough you have reached that middle age have you not when sleep is so to put it your capital and your activity is the interest you draw from it to live on you have three good hours so then till we meet at the breakfasttable my fathers first proceeding at the hotel was to examine the list of visitors he questioned one of the waiters aside took information from him and seized my arm rather tremulously saying they are here tis as i expected and she is taking the morning breath of seaair on the dunes come richie come whos the she i asked incuriously well she is young she is of high birth she is charming we have a crowned head or two here i observe in you richie an extraordinary deficiency of memory she has had an illness neptune speed her recovery now for a turn at our german die strassen ruhen die stadt schlft aber dort siehst du dort liegt das blaue meer das nimmerschlafende she is gazing on it and breathing it richie ach ihr jauchzende seejungfern on my soul i expect to see the very loveliest of her sex you must not be dismayed at pale cheeksblasse wangen her illness has been alarming why this air is the top of life it will and it shall revive her how will she address himfreund in my presence perchance she has her invalids privilege theure prinzessin you might venture on no ice ay there she is solitary on the long level of the sandbank i perceived a group that became discernible as three persons attached to an invalids chair moving leisurely toward us i was in the state of mind between divination and doubt when the riddle is not impossible to read would but the heart cease its hurry an instant a tumbled sky where the break is coming it came the dear old days of my wanderings with temple framed her face i knew her without need of pause or retrospect the crocus raising its cup pointed as when it pierced the earth and the crocus stretched out on earth wounded by frost is the same flower the face was the same though the features were changed unaltered in expression but wan and the kind blue eyes large upon lean brows her aspect was that of one who had been half caught away and still shook faintly in the relaxing invisible grasp we stopped at a distance of halfadozen paces to allow her time for recollection she eyed us softly in a fixed manner while the seawind blew her thick redbrown hair to threads on her cheek colour on the fair skin told us we were recognized princess ottilia said my father it is i my friend she answered and you with more health than i am in need of dearest princess and he harry richmond my son now of age commencing his tour and he has not forgotten the farewell bunch of violets her eyelids gently lifted asking me nor the mount you did me the honour to give me on the little hungarian said i how nice this seaair is she spoke in english england and sea go together in my thoughts and you are here i have been down very low near the lowest but your good old sea makes me breathe again i want to toss on it have you yet seen the markgrfin my father explained that we had just landed from the boat is our meeting then an accident dear princess i heard of your being out by the shore ah kind and you walked to meet me i love that as well though i love chance and it is chance that brings you here i looked out on the boat from england while they were dressing me i cannot have too much of the morning for then i have all to myself sea and sky and i the night people are all asleep and you come like an old marchen her eyelids dropped without closing speak no more to her just at present said an english voice miss silbeys schwartz the huge dragoon whose big black horse hung near him in my memory like a phantom pulled the chair at a quiet pace head downward a young girl clad in plain black walked beside miss sibley following the wheels danger is over miss sibley answered my gaze she is convalescent you see how weak she is i praised the lady for what i deemed her great merit in not having quitted the service of the princess oh said she my adieux to sarkeld were uttered years ago but when i heard of her fall from the horse i went and nursed her we were once in dread of her leaving us she sank as if she had taken some internal injury it may have been only the shock to her system and the cessation of her accustomed exercise she has a little overstudied the margravine the margravine is really very good and affectionate and has won my esteem so you and your father are united at last we have often talked of you oh that day up by the tower but do you know the statue is positively there now and no oneno one who had the privilege of beholding the first bronze albrecht wohlgemuth furst von eppenwelzensarkeld no one will admit that the second is half worthy of him i can feel to this day the leap of the heart in my mouth when the statue dismounted the prince sulked for a month the margravine still longer at your fathers evasion she could not make allowance for the impulsive man such a father such a son thank you thank you most humbly said i bowing to her shadow of a mock curtsey the princesss hand appeared at a side of the chair we hastened to her let me laugh too she prayed miss sibley was about to reply but stared and delight sprang to her lips in a quick cry what medicine is this why the light of morning has come to you my darling i am better dearest better you sigh my own no i breathe lots lots of salt air now and lift like a boat ask himhe had a little friend much shorter than himself who came the whole way with him out of true friendshipask him where is the friend miss sibley turned her head to me temple said i temple is a midshipman he is at sea that is something to think of the princess murmured and dropped her eyelids a moment she resumed the grand seigneur was at vienna last year and would not come to sarkeld though he knew i was ill my father stooped low the grand seigneur your servant dear princess was an ottoman turk and his grand vizier advised him to send flowers in his place weekly i had them and when we could get those flowers nowhere else she replied so it was you so my friends have been about me during the remainder of the walk i was on one side of the chair and her little maid on the other while my father to rearward conversed with miss sibley the princess took a pleasure in telling me that this aennchen of hers knew me well and had known me before ever her mistress had seen me aennchen was the eldest of the two children temple and i had eaten breakfast with in the foresters hut i felt myself as if in the forest again merely wondering at the growth of the trees and the narrowness of my vision in those days at parting the princess said is my english improved you smiled at it once i will ask you when i meet you next it is my question i whispered to my own ears she caught the words why do you sayit is my question i was constrained to remind her of her old forms of english speech you remember that adieu she said my father considerately left me to carry on my promenade alone i crossed the ground she had traversed noting every feature surrounding it the curving wheeltrack the thin prickly sandherbage the wavemounds the sparse wet shells and pebbles the gleaming flatness of the water and the vast horizonboundary of pale flat land level with shore looking like a dead sister of the sea by a careful examination of my watch and the suns altitude i was able to calculate what would in all likelihood have been his height above yonder waves when her chair was turned toward the city at a point i reached in the track but of the matter then simultaneously occupying my mind to recover which was the second supreme task i proposed to myselfof what i also was thinking upon the stroke of five oclock i could recollect nothing i could not even recollect whether i happened to be looking on sun and waves when she must have had them full and glorious in her face chapter xxv on board a yacht with the heartiest consent i could give and a blank cheque my father returned to england to hire forthwith a commodious yacht fitted and manned before going he discoursed of prudence in our expenditure though not for the sake of the mere money in hand which was a trifle barely more than the half of my future income but that the squire should he by and by bethink him of inspecting our affairs might perceive we were not spendthrifts i promised you a surprise richie said he and you have had it whether at all equal to your expectations is for you to determine i was aware of the margravines intention to bring the princess to these seasands they are famous on the continent it was bruited last winter and spring that she would be here in the season for bathing so i held it likely we should meet we have you behold in point of fact we owe the good margravine some show of hospitality the princess has a passion for tossing on the sea to her a yacht is a thing dropped from the moon his highness the prince her father could as soon present her with one as with the moon itself the illustrious serenitys revenue is absorbed my boy in the state he has to support as for his daughters dowry the young gentleman who anticipates getting one with her i commend to the practise of his whistling it will be among the sums you may count if you are a moderate arithmetician in groschen the margravines income i should reckon to approach twenty thousand per annum and she proves her honourable sense that she holds it in trust for others by dispersing it rapidly i fear she loves cards so then i shall go and hire the yacht through dettermain and newson furnish it with piano and swingcot etc and if the ladies shrink from a cruise they can have an occasional sail here are we at their service i shall be seriously baffled by fortune if i am not back to you at the end of a week you will take your early morning walk i presume on sunday see that our chaplain the excellent mr peterborough officiates for the assembled protestants of all nations it excites our english enthusiasm in addition son richie it is peculiarly our duty i at least hold the view that it is a family duty think it over richie boy providence you see has sent us the man as for me i feel as if i were in the dawn of one life with all the mature experience of another i am calm i am perfectly unexcited and i tell you old son i believepick among the highestour destinies are about the most brilliant of any couple in great britain his absence relieved me in spite of my renewed pleasure in his talk i may call it a thirsty craving to have him inflating me puffing the deep unillumined treasurepits of my nature with laborious hints as mines are filled with air to keep the miners going while he talked he made these inmost recesses habitable but the pain lay in my having now and then to utter replies the task of speaking was hateful i found a sweetness in brooding unrealizingly over hopes and dreams and possibilities and i let him go gladly that i might enjoy a week of silence just taking impressions as they came like the sands in the ebbtide the impression of the morning was always enough for a days meditation the green colour and the crimson athwart it and higher up the pinky lights flamingo feathers on a warm halfcircle of heaven in hue between amethyst and milky opal then the rim of the suns disc not yet severe and then the monstrous shadow of tall schwartz darting at me along the sand then the princess this picture seen at sunrise lasted till i slept it stirred no thoughts conjured no images it possessed me in the afternoon the margravine accompanied the princess to a point facing seaward within hearing of the military band she did me the favour to tell me that she tolerated me until i should become efficient in german to amuse her but the dulness of the belgian city compared with her lively german wateringplaces compelled her to try my powers of fun in french and in french i had to do duty and failed in my office do you know said she that your honourable papa is one in a million he has the life of a regiment in his ten fingers what astonishes me is that he does not make fury in that england of yoursthat lapland je ne puffs me passer de cet homme he offends me he trifles he outrages he dares permit himself to be indignant bon we part and absence pleads for him with the eloquence of satan i am his victim does he then produce no stir whatever in your england but what a people but yes you resemble us as bottlesbottles seulement you are emptied of your wine ce monsieur ptrbooroo il magace les nerfs it cannot be blood in his veins one longs to see him cuffed to see if he has the english lion in him one knows not where but you are so you english when not intoxicated and so censorious you win your battles they say upon beer and cordials it is why you never can follow up a success je tiens cela du marchal prince b let that pass one groans at your intolerable tristesse la vie en angleterre est comme un marais it is a scandal to human nature it blows fogs foul vapours jointstiffnesses agues pestilences over us hereyes here that is your best side but your worst is too atrocious mon dieu your menrascals your womenrascals good soul the princess arrested her i beg that you will not abuse england have i abused england exclaimed the margravine nay then it was because england is shockingly unjust to the most amusing the most reviving charming of men there is he fresh as a green bubbling well and those english decline to do honour to his source now tell me you she addressed me imperiously are you prosecuting his claims are you besieging your government what you are in the season of generosity an affectionate son wealthy as a magyar prince of flocks herds mines and men and you let him stand in the shade deprived of his birthright are you a purseproud commoner or an imbecile my whimsy aunt the princess interposed again now you have taken to abusing a defenceless englishman nothing of the sort child i compliment him on his looks and manners he is the only one of his race who does not appear to have marched out of a sentinels box with a pocketmirror in his hand i thank him from my soul for not cultivating the national cats whisker none can imagine what i suffer from the oppressive sight of his monsieur peterbooroo and they are of one patternthe entire nation he no he has the step of a trained bloodhorse only as kaunitz or somebody said of joseph ii or somebody he thinks or he chews englishmens mouths were clearly not made for more purposes than one in truth i am so utterly wearied i could pray for the diversion of a descent of rain the life here is as bad as in rippau i might just as well be in rippau doing duty the silly people complain i hear i am gathering dust these my dear these are the experiences which age women at a prodigious rate i feel chains on my limbs here madame i would said i that i were the perseus to relieve you of your monster ennui but he is coming quickly you see he has his pretty phrases cried the margravine adding encouragingly sil nest pas tant sort peu impertinent the advance of some german or russian nobleman spared me further efforts we were on shore listening to the band in the afternoon when a sail like a spark of pure white stood on the purple black edge of a stormcloud it was the yacht by sunset it was moored off shore and at night hung with variegated lamps early next morning we went on board the ladies were astonished at the extent of the vessel and its luxurious fittings and cunning arrangements my father in fact had negotiated for the hire of the yacht some weeks previously with his accustomed forethought house and town and fortress provisioned and moveable at will the margravine interjected repeatedly the princess was laid on raised pillows in her swingcot under an awning aft and watched the sailors the splendid offspring of old seafights as i could observe her spirited fancy conceiving them they were a set of men to point to for an answer to the margravines strictures on things english then are you the captain my good herr heilbrunn the margravine asked my father he was dressed in cheerful blue wearing his cheerfullest air and seemed strongly inclined for the part of captain but presented the actual commander of the schooneryacht and helped him through the margravines interrogations all is excellentexcellent for a days sail she said i have no doubt you could nourish my system for a month but to deal frankly with youprepared meats and cold piesto face them once is as much as i am capable of dear lady fieldmarshal returned my father the sons of neptune would be of poor account if they could not furnish you cookery at sea they did for alphonse was on board he and my father had a hot discussion about the margravines dishes alphonse declaring that it was against his conscience to season them pungently and my father preaching expediency alphonse spoke of the artist and his duty to his art my father of the wise diplomatist who manipulated individuals without any sacrifice of principle they were partly at play of course both having humour it ended in the margravines being enraptured the delicacy of the invalids dishes was beyond praise so then we are absolutely better housed and accommodated than on shore the margravine made her wonder heard and from that fell to enthusiasm for the vessel after a couple of pleasant smoothsailing days she consented to cruise off the coasts of france and england adieu to the sands throughout the cruise she was placable satisfied with earth and sea and constantly eulogizing herself for this novel state of serenity cards and a collection of tripping french books bound in yellow danced the gavotte with time which made the flying minutes endurable to her and for relaxation there was here the view of a shining town dropped between green hills to dip in seawater yonder a ship of merchandise or war to speculate upon trawlers collierbrigs seabirds wave over wave no cloud on sun and moon we had gold and silver in our track like the believable children of fairyland the princess lying in her hammockcot on deck both day and night or for the greater part of the night let her eyes feast incessantly on a laughing sea when she turned them to any of us pure pleasure sparkled in them the breezy salt hours were visible ecstasy to her blood if she spoke it was but to utter a few hurried happy words and shrink as you see the lightning behind a cloudrack suggestive of fiery swift emotion within and she gazed away overjoyed at the swoop and plunge of the gannet the sunny spray the waves curling crested or downlike at night a couple of sailors tender as women moved her in the cot to her cabin we heard her voice in the dark of the morning and her little maid aennchen came out and was met by me and i at that hour had the privilege to help move her back to her favourite place and strap the ironstand fast giving the warmhooded cot room to swing the keen sensations of a return to health amid unwonted scenes made things magical to her when she beheld our low green devon hills she signalled for help to rise and that is england she said summoning to her beautiful clear eyeballs the recollection of her first desire to see my country her petition was that the yacht should go in nearer and nearer to the land till she could discern men women and children and their occupations a fisherman and his wife sat in the porch above their hanging garden the woman knitting the man mending his nets barefooted boys and girls astride the keel of a boat below them the princess eyed them and wept they give me happiness i can give them nothing she said the margravine groaned impatiently at talk of such a dieaway sort my father sent a couple of men on shore with a gift of money to their family in the name of the princess ottilia how she thanked him for his prompt ideas it is because you are generous you read one well she had never thanked me i craved for that vibrating music as of her deep heart penetrated and thrilling but shrank from grateful words which would have sounded payment running before the wind swiftly on a night of phosphorescent sea when the waves opened to white hollows with frayed white ridges wreaths of hissing silver her eyelids closed and her hand wandered over the silken coverlet to the hammock cloth and up in a blind effort to touch mine joined to it little aennchen was witness ottilia held me softly till her slumber was deep chapter xxvi in view of the hohenzollerns birthplace our cruise came to an end in time to save the margravine from yawning the last day of it was windless and we hung in sight of the colourless low flemish coast for hours my father tasking his ingenuity to amuse her he sang with miss sibley rallied mr peterborough played picquet to lose threw over the lead line to count the fathoms and whistling for the breeze said to me we shall decidedly have to offer her an exhibition of tipsy british seamen as a final resource the case is grave either way but we cannot allow the concluding impression to be a dull one it struck me with astonishment to see the vigilant watch she kept over the princess this day after having left her almost uninterruptedly to my care you are better she addressed ottilia you can sit up you think you can walk then i have acted rightly nay judiciouslyi have not made a sacrifice for nothing i took the cruise mind you on your account you would study yourself to the bone till you looked like a canarys quill with that herr professor of yours now ive given you a dose of life yes you begin to look like human flesh something has done you good the princess flushing scarlet the margravine cried theres no occasion for you to have the whole british army in your cheeks goodness me whats the meaning of it why you answer me like flags banners uhlans pennons fullfrocked cardinals my father stepped in ah yes said the margravine but you little know my good roy the burden of an unmarried princess and heartily glad shall i be to hand her over to baroness turckems thats her instituted governess duenna dragon what you will she was born for responsibility i was not it makes me miserable i have had no holiday true while she was like one of their wax virgins i had a respite fortunately i hear of you english that when you fall to sighing you suck your thumbs and are consoled my father bowed her and smiled her and whirled her away from the subject i heard him say under his breath that he had half a mind to issue orders for an allowance of grog to be served out to the sailors on the spot i suggested as i conceived in a similar spirit the forcible ducking of mr peterborough he appeared to entertain and relish the notion in earnest it might do it would gratify her enormously he said and eyed the complacent clerical gentleman with transparent jealousy of his claims to decent treatment otherwise i must confess he added i am at a loss my wits are in the doldrums he went up to mr peterborough and with an air of great sincerity and courtesy requested him in french to create a diversion for her highness the margravine of rippau during the extreme heat of the afternoon by precipitating himself headlong into forty fathoms either attached or unattached his art in baffling mr peterboroughs attempts to treat the unheardof request as a jest was extraordinary the ingenuity of his successive pleas for pressing such a request pertinaciously upon mr peterborough in particular his fixed eye yet cordial deferential manner and the stretch of his forefinger and argumentative turn of the headindicative of an armed disputant fully on the alert and as if it were of profound and momentous importance that he should thoroughly defeat and convince his manoverwhelmed us mr peterborough not being supple in french fell back upon his english with a flickering smile of protestation but even in his native tongue he could make no head against the tremendous volubility and brief eager pauses besetting him the farce was too evanescent for me to reproduce it peterborough turned and fled to his cabin half the crew were on the broad grin the margravine sprang to my fathers arm and entreated him to be her guest in her austrian mountain summerseat ottilia was now her darling and her comfort whether we english youth sucked our thumbs or sighed furiously she had evidently ceased to care mr peterborough assured me at night that he had still a difficulty in persuading himself of my fathers absolute sanity so urgent was the fire of his eye in seconding his preposterous proposal and as my father invariably treated with the utmost reserve a farce played out they never arrived at an understanding about it beyond a sententious agreement once in the extreme heat of an austrian highland valley that the option of taking a header into seawater would there be divine our yacht winged her way home prince ernest of eppenwelzensarkeld accompanied by baroness turckems and prince otto his nephew son of the prince of eisenberg a captain of austrian lancers joined the margravine in wurtemberg and we felt immediately that domestic affairs were under a different management baroness turckems relieved the margravine of her guard she took the princess into custody prince ernest greeted us with some affability but it was communicated to my father that he expected an apology before he could allow himself to be as absolutely unclouded toward us as the blaze of his titles my father declined to submit so the prince inquired of us what our destination was down the danube to the black sea and asia minor greece egypt the nile the desert india possibly and the himalayas my father said the prince bowed the highest personages if they cannot travel are conscious of a sort of airy majesty pertaining to one who can command so wide and far a flight we were supplicated by the margravine to appease her brothers pride with half a word my father was firm the margravine reached her two hands to him he kissed over them each in turn they interchanged smart semiflattering or cutting sentences good she concluded now i sulk you for five years you would decapitate me madam and weep over my astonished head would you not upon my honour i would she shook herself to reply he smiled rather sadly no pathos she implored him not while i live madam said he at this her countenance underwent a tremour and when that ends friend well i shall have had my last laugh in the world both seemed affected my father murmured some soothing word then you do mean to stay with me the margravine caught him up not in livery your highness to the deuce with you would be a fair translation of the exalted ladys reply she railed at his insufferable pride and you were wrong wrong she pursued you offended the prince mightily you travestied his most noble ancestor in your service may it please you you offended offended him i say and you havent the courage to make reparation and when i tell you the prince is manageable as your ship if you will only take and handle the rudder do you perceive she turned to me hither mr harry come persuade him why you do not desire to leave me do you much the reverse but i had to congratulate myself subsequently on having been moderate in the expression of my wishes for as my father explained to me with sufficient lucidity to enlighten my dulness the margravine was tempting him grossly she saw more than i did of his plans she could actually affect to wink at them that she might gain her point and have her amusement and live for the hour treacherously beguiling a hoodwinked pair to suppose her partially blind or wholly complaisant my father knew her and fenced her had i yielded he said when my heart was low after the parting i should have shown her my hand i do not choose to manage the prince that the margravine may manage me i pose my prideimmolate my son to it richie i hope not no at vienna we shall receive an invitation to sarkeld for the winter if we hear nothing of entreaties to turn aside to ischl at munich she is sure to entreat me to accompany her on her annual visit to her territory of rippau which she detests and indeed there is not a vine in the length and breadth of it she thought herself broad awake and i have dosed her with an opiate he squeezed my fingers tenderly i was in want both of consolation and very delicate handling when we drove out of the little wurtemberg town i had not taken any farewell from ottilia baroness turckems was already exercising her functions of dragon with the terrible forbidding word repose she had wafted the princess to her chamber in the evening and folded her inextricably round and round in the morning the margravine huffed the prince icy ottilia invisible i found myself shooting down from the heights of a dream among shattered fragments of my cloudpalace before i well knew that i had left off treading common earth all my selfish nature cried out to accuse ottilia we drove along a dusty country road that lay like a glaring shaft of the desert between vineyards and hills there said my father waving his hand where the hills on our left fell to a distance and threw up a lofty head and neck cut with one white line your hohenzollerns shot up there their castle looks like a tight military stock upon my word their native mountain has the air of a drum major mr peterborough have you a mind to climb it we are at your disposal thank you thank you sir said the rev ambrose gazing enthusiastically but daunted by the heat if it is your wish we have none that is not yours mr peterborough you love ruins and we are adrift just now i presume we can drive to the foot of the ascent i should wish my son perhaps to see the source of great houses here it was that my arm was touched by old schwartz he saluted stiffly and leaning from the saddle on the trot of his horse at an even pace with our postillion stretched out a bouquet of roses i seized it palpitating smelt the roses and wondered may a man write of his foolishnesstears rushed to my eyes schwartz was far behind us when my father caught sight of the magical flowers come said he glowing we will toast the hohenstaufens and the hohenzollerns tonight richie later when i was revelling in fancies sweeter than the perfume of the roses he pressed their stems reflectively unbound them and disclosed a slip of crested paper on it was written violets are over plain words but a princess had written them and never did so golden a halo enclose any piece of human handiwork chapter xxvii the time of roses i sat and thrilled from head to foot with a deeper emotion than joy not i but a detached self allied to the careering universe and having life in it violets are over the first strenuous effort of my mind was to grasp the meaning subtle as odour in these words innumerable meanings wreathed away unattainable to thought the finer senses could just perceive them ere they vanished then as i grew material two camps were pitched and two armies prepared to fight to establish one distinct meaning violets are over so i send you roses she writes you simple fact nay our time of violets is over now for us the roses she gives you heavenly symbolism from violets to roses so run the seasons or is it from violets to roses thus far have we two travelled but would she merely say i have not this kind of flower and i send you another true but would she dare to say the violets no longer express my heart take the roses maidenly and a princess yet sweet and grateful she gives you the gracefullest good speed noble above all human distinctions she binds you to herself if you will it the two armies came into collision the luck of the day going to the one i sided with but it was curiously observable that the opposing force recovered energy from defeat while mine languished in victory i headed them alternately andit invariably happened so she cannot mean so much as this she must mean more than that thus the absolute and the symbolical factions struggled on a princess drew them as the moon the tides by degrees they subsided and united each reserving its view a point at which i imagined myself to have regained my proper humility the princess has sent you these flowers out of her homely friendliness not seeing you to speak her farewell she for the very reason that she can do it innocent of any meaning whatsoever bids you be sure you carry her esteem with you is the sun of blue heavens guilty of the shadow it casts clear your mind she means nothing warmth and beauty come from her and are on you for the moment but full surely she is a thing to be won she is human did not her hand like a gentle snake seek yours and detain it and bear it away into the heart of her sleepbe moderate let not a thought or a dream spring from her condescension lest you do outrage to her noble simplicity look on that high hohenzollern hilltop she also is of the line of those who help to found illustrious houses what are you i turned to my father and stared him in the face what was he were we not losing precious time in not prosecuting his suit i put this question to him believing that it would sound as too remote from my thoughts to betray them he glanced at the roses and answered gladly yesno no we must have our holiday mr peterborough is for exploring a battlefield in the neighbourhood of munich he shall i wish him to see the salzkammergut and have a taste of german courtlife allow me to be captain richie will you i will show you how battles are gained and mountains are scaled that young prince otto of eisenberg is a fine young fellow those austrian cavalry regiments are good trainingschools for the carriage of a young mans head and limbs i would match my boy against him in the exercisesfencing shooting riding as you did at bath said i he replied promptly we might give him anna penrhys to marry english wives are liked hereadoredif they fetch a dowry concerning my suit richie enough if it keeps pace with us and we are not going slow it is a thing certain dettermain and newson have repeatedly said money money hand us money and we guarantee you a public recognition money we now have but we cannot be in two fields at once is it your desire to return to england not at all said i with a chill at the prospect if it is he pressed me and relenting added i confess i enjoy this suabian land as much as you do indolence is occasionally charming i am at work nevertheless but richie determine not to think little of yourself there is the main point believe me that is half the battle you sir are one of the wealthiest gentlemen in europe you are pronouncedly a gentleman that is what we can say of you at present as you appear in the worlds eye and you are by descent illustrious well no more of that but consider if you kneel down who will decline to put a foot on you princes have the habit and they do it as a matter of course challenge them and they richie are particularly susceptible to pity for the misfortunes of their classkind i should say for class it is not now i have done all i tell you is i intend you under my guidance to be happy i thought his remarks the acutest worldly wisdom i had ever heardhis veiled method of treating my case the shrewdest delicatest and most consoling most inspiring it had something of the mystical power of the oraclesthe power which belongs to anonymous writing had he disposed of my apparent rival and exalted me to the level of a princely family in open speech he would have conveyed no balm to mei should have classed it as one confident mans opinion disguised and vague but emphatic and interpreted by the fine beam of his eye it was intoxicating and when he said subsequently our majority burgundy was good emperor wine richie you approved it i laid that vintage down to give you a lesson to show you that my plans come safe to maturityi credited him with a large share of foresight though i well knew his habit of antedating his sagacity and could not but smile at the illustration of it you perceive my state without rendering it necessary for me to label myself i saw her next in a pinewood between ischl and the traun i had climbed the steep hill alone while my father and mr peterborough drove round the carriageroad to the margravines white villa ottilia was leaning on the arm of baroness turckems walkinga miracle that disentangled her cruelly from my net of fancies the baroness placed a second hand upon her as soon as i was seen standing in the path ottilias face coloured like the cyclamen at her feet you she said i might ask is it you princess some wonder has been worked you see i thank heaven you had a part in it the poorest possible yet i shall presume to call you doctor oceanus will you repeat his medicine the yacht awaits you always when i am well i study do not you i have never studied in my life ah lose no more time the yacht is delicious idleness but it is idleness i am longing for it now i am still so very weak my dear sibley has left me to be married she marries a hanoverian officer we change countriesi mean the princess caught back her tongue she will become german not compatriot of your ships of war my english rebukes me i cease to express it is like my walking done half for pride i think baroness lower me and let me rest the baroness laid her gently on the dry brown pinesheddings and blew a whistle that hung at her girdle by which old schwartzy kept out of sight to encourage the princesss delusion of pride in her walking was summoned ottilia had fainted the baroness shot a suspicious glance at me it comes of this everlasting english talk i heard her mutter she was quick to interpose between me and the form i had once raised and borne undisputedly schwartz is the princesss attendant sir she said in future may i request you to talk german the prince of eppenwelzen and prince otto were shooting in the mountains the margravine after conversing with the baroness received me stiffly she seemed eager to be rid of us was barely hospitable my mind was too confused to take much note of words and signs i made an appointment to meet my father the day following and walked away and returned at night encountered schwartz and fed on the crumbs of tidings i got from him a good rough old faithful fellow far past the age for sympathy but he had carried ottilia when she was an infant and meant to die in her service i thought him enviable above most creatures his principal anxiety was about my finding sleeping quarters when he had delivered himself three times over of all that i could lead him to say i left him still puffing at his pipe he continued on guard to be in readiness to run for a doctor should one be wanted twice in the night i came across his path the night was quiet dark blue and starry the morning soft and fragrant the burden of the night was bearable but that of daylight i fled from and all day i was like one expecting a crisis laughter with so much to arouse it hardly had any foothold within me to stir my wits for if i said folly i did not feel it and what i felt i did not understand my heart and head were positively divided days and weeks were spent in reconciling them a little days passed with a pencil and scribbled slips of paperthe lines written with regular commencements and irregular terminations you know them why had ottilia fainted she recommended hard studythinks me idle worthless she has a grave intelligence a serious estimation of life she thinks me intrinsically of the value of a summer fly but why did she say we change countries and immediately flush break and falter lose command of her english grow pale and swoon why with this question my disastrous big heart came thundering up to the closed doors of comprehension it was unanswerable we change countries that is she and miss sibley change countries because the english woman marries a german and the german princessoh enormous folly pierce it slay it trample it under is that what the insane heart is big with throughout my nightwatch i had been free of it as one who walks meditating in cloisters on a sentence that once issued from divine lips there was no relief save in those pencilled lines which gave honest laughter a chance they stood like such a hasty levy of raw recruits raised for war going through the goosestep with pretty accurate shoulders and feet of distracting degrees of extension enough to craze a rhythmical drillsergeant i exulted at the first reading shuddered at the second and at the third felt desperate destroyed them and sat staring at vacancy as if i had now lost the power of speech at last i flung away idleness and came to a good resolution and i carried it through i studied at a famous german university not far from hanover my father after discussing my project with me from the point of view of amazement settled himself in the university town a place of hopeless dulness where the stones of the streets and the houses seemed to have got their knotty problem to brood over and never knew holiday a fire for acquisition possessed me and soon an ungovernable scorn for english systems of teachingsound enough for the producing of gentlemen and perhaps of merchants but gentlemen rather bare of graces and merchants not too scientific in finance mr peterborough conducted the argument against me until my stout display of facts or it may have been my insolence combined with the ponderous pressure of the atmosphere upon one who was not imbibing a counteracting force drove him on a tour among german cathedrals letters from riversley informed me that my proceedings were approved though the squire wanted me near him we offered entertainments to the students on a vast scale the local newspaper spoke of my father as the great lord roy so it happened that the margravine at sarkeld heard of us returning from a visit to the princes palace my father told me that he saw an opportunity for our being useful to the prince who wanted money to work a newlydiscovered coalmine in his narrow dominions and he suggested that i might induce the squire to supply it as a last extremity i could advance the money meanwhile he had engaged to accompany the prince in mufti to england to examine into the working of coalmines and hire an overseer and workmen to commence operations on the sarkeld property it would be obligatory to entertain him fitly in london certainly said i during our absence the margravine will do her best to console you richie the prince chafes at his poverty we give him a display of wealth in england here we are particularly discreet we shall be surer of our ground in time i set dettermain and newson at work i have written for them to hire a furnished mansion for a couple of months carriages horses lacqueys but over here we must really begoodness me i know how hard it iswe must hold the reins on ourselves tight baroness turckems is a most estimable person on the side of her duty why the dragon of wantley sat on its eggs you may be convinced she is a praiseworthy dragon the side she presents to us is horny and not so agreeable talk german when she is on guard further i need not counsel a clever old son counsel me richie would it be adviseable to run the prince down to riversleya prince oh decidedly not was my advice well well he assented i empowered him to sell out bank stock he wrote word from england of a very successful expedition the prince travelling under the title of count delzenburg had been suitably entertained received by lady wilts serena marchioness of edbury lady denewdney lady sampleman and others he had visited my grandfathers mine and that of miss penrhys and was astounded had said of me that i wanted but a title to be as brilliant a parti as any in europe the margravine must have received orders from her brother to be civil to me she sent me an imperious invitation from her villa and for this fruit of my fathers diplomacy i yielded him up my daintier feelings my judgement into the bargain snows of early spring were on the pinewood country i had traversed with temple ottilia greeted me in health and vivacity the margravine led me up to her in the very saloon where temple my father and i had sat after the finale of the statue scene saying our sealieutenant it delights me to hear he has turned university student she said and in english you have made friends of your books she was dressed in blue velvet to the throat the hair was brushed from the temples and bound in a simple knot her face and speech fair and unconstrained had neither shadow nor beam directed specially for me i replied at least i have been taught to despise idleness my professor tells me it is strange for any of your countrymen to love books we have some good scholars princess you have your bentley and porson oh i know many of the worlds men have grown in england who can deny that what we mean is your society is not penetrated with learning but my professor shall dispute with you now you are facile in our german you can defend yourself he is a deep scholar broad over tongues and dialects european asiatica lion to me poor little mouse i am speaking of herr professor von karsteg lady aunt speak intelligibly and dont drum on my ear with that hybrid language rejoined the margravine hybrid it is my herr professors word but english is the choice gathering of languages and honey is hybrid unless you condemn the bee to suck at a single flower ha you strain compliments like the poet fretzel the margravine exclaimed luckily theyre not addressed to human creatures you will find the villa dull herr harry richmond for my part every place is dull to me that your father does not enliven we receive no company in the princes absence so we are utterly cut off from fools we have simply none about us the deprivation is one we are immensely sensible of said the princess laugh on you will some day be aware of their importance in daily life ottilia the princess answered if i could hate it would be such persons a sentence that hung in the memory of one knowing himself to be animated by the wildest genius of folly we drove to the statue of prince albrecht wohlgemuth overlooking leagues of snowroofed branches again ottilia reverted to temple that dear little friend of yours who wandered out with you to seek your father and is now a sailor i cannot forget him it strikes me as a beautiful piece of the heroism of boys you both crossed the sea to travel over the whole continent until you should find him did you not what is hard to understand is your fathers not writing to you while he did us the favour to reside at the palace roy is a butterfly said the margravine that i cannot think roy was busy he was occupied i wont have him abused besides one cant be always caressing and cajoling ones pretty brats he is an intensely loving father very well establish that and what does it matter whether he wrote or not a good reputation is the best vindication the princess smiled see here dearest aunty the two boys passed half the night here until my aennchens father gave them shelter apparently he passes half or all the night in the open air everywhere said the margravine i glanced hurriedly over both faces the margravine was snuffing her nostrils up contemptuously the princess had vividly reddened her face was luminous over the nest of white fur folding her neck yes i must have the taste for it for when i was a child said i plunging at anything to catch a careless topic i was out in my fathers arms through a winter night and i still look back on it as one of the most delightful i have ever known i wish i could describe the effect it had on me a track of blood in the snow could not be brighter the margravine repeated a track of blood in the snow my good young man you have excited forms of speech i shuddered ottilia divined that her burning blush had involved me divination is fiery in the season of blushes and i too fell on the track of her fair spirit setting out from the transparent betrayal by schwartz of my nightwatch in the pinewood near the traun riverfalls my feelings were as if a wave had rolled me helpless to land at the margravines mercy should she put another question she startled us with a loud outburst of laughter no no man upon this earth but roy could have sat that horse i dont know how many minutes by the clock as a figure of bronze she exclaimed ottilia and i exchanged a grave look the gentleness of the old time was sweet to us both but we had the wish that my fathers extravagant prominency in it might be forgotten at the dinnertable i made the acquaintance of the herr professor dr julius von karsteg tutor to the princess a grey broadheaded man whose chin remained imbedded in his neckcloth when his eyelids were raised on a speaker the first impression of him was that he was chiefly neckcloth coatcollar grand head and gruffness he had not joined the ceremonial step from the reception to the dining saloon but had shuffled in from a sidedoor no one paid him any deference save the princess the margravine had the habit of thrumming the table thrice as soon as she heard his voice nor was i displeased by such an exhibition of impatience considering that he spoke merely for the purpose of snubbing me his powers were placed in evidence by her not daring to utter a sarcasm which was possibly the main cause of her burning fretfulness i believe there was not a word uttered by me throughout the dinner that escaped him nevertheless he did his business of catching and worrying my poor unwary sentences too neatly for me an admirer of real force and aptitude to feel vindictive i behaved to him like a gentleman as we phrase it and obtained once an encouraging nod from the margravine she leaned to me to say that they were accustomed to think themselves lucky if no learned talk came on between the professor and his pupil the truth was that his residence in sarkeld was an honour to the prince and his acceptance of the tutorship a signal condescension accounted for by his appreciation of the princesss intelligence he was a man distinguished even in germany for scholarship rather notorious for his political and social opinions too the margravine with infinite humour in her countenance informed me that he wished to fit the princess for the dignity of a doctor of laws it says much for her that he has not spoilt her manners her health you know he succeeded in almost totally destroying and he is at it again the man is i suspect at heart arrant republican he may teach a girl whatever nonsensical politics he likesit goes at the lifting of the bridegrooms little finger we could not permit him to be near a young prince alas we have none the professor allowed himself extraordinary liberties with strangers the guests of the margravine i met him crossing an inner court next day he interrupted me in the middle of a commonplace remark and to this effect you are either a most fortunate or a most unfortunate young man so profoundly penetrated with thoughtfulness was the tone of his voice that i could not take umbrage the attempt to analyze his signification cost me an aching forehead perhaps because i knew it too acutely chapter xxviii ottilia she was on horseback i on foot schwartz for sole witness and a wide space of rolling silent white country around us we had met in the fall of the winter noon by accident you like my professor said ottilia i do i respect him for his learning you forgive him his irony it is not meant to be personal to you england is the object and partly i may tell you it springs from jealousy you have such wealth you embrace half the world you are such a little island all this is wonderful the bitterness is you are such a mindless peoplei do but quote to explain my professors ideas mindless he says and arrogant and neither in the material nor in the spiritual kingdom of noble or gracious stature and ceasing to have a brave aspect he calls you squat goths can you bear to hear me princess and to his conception you who were pioneers when the earth had to be shaped for implements and dug for gold will turn upon us and stop our march you are to be overthrown and left behind there to gain humility from the only teacher you can understandfrom poverty will you defend yourself well no frankly i will not the proper defence for a nation is its history for an individual for a man his readiness to abide by his word for a womanwhat for a princess her ancestry ah but i spoke of women there there is my ground of love for my professor i meet my equals princes princesses and the man the woman is out of them gone flown they are out of the tide of humanity they are walking titles now says my professor that tide is the blood of our being the blood is the lifegiver and to be cut off from it is to perish our princely houses he esteems as dead wood not near so much say i yet i hear my equals talk and i think oh my professor they testify to your wisdom i love him because he has given my every sense a faceforward attitude you will complain of my feebleness of speech to exterior existence there is a princely view of life which is a true one but it is a false one if it is the sole one in your parliament your house of commons shows us real princes your throne merely titled ones i speak what everybody knows and you i am sure are astonished to hear me i am said i it is owing to my professor my minds father and mother they say it is the pleasure of lowborn people to feel themselves princes mine it is to share their natural feelings for a princess her ancestry yes but for a princess who is no more than princess her ancestors are a bundle of faggots and she with her mind and heart tied fast to them is at least a good half of her dead wood this is our opinion may i guess at your thoughts its more than i could dare to do myself princess how different from the ottilia i had known or could have imagined that was one thought out of the number then this she resumed you think that your english young ladies have command over their tongues is it not so there are prattlers among them are they educated strictly i know little of them they seem to me to be educated to conceal their education they reject ideas it is uncertain whether they have had the offer ottilia smiled would it be a home in their midst something moved my soul to lift wings but the passion sank i questioned you of english ladies she resumed because we read your writings of us your kindness to us is that which passes from nurse to infant your criticism reminds one of paedagogue and urchin you make us sorry for our manners and habits if they are so bad but most of all you are merry at our simplicity not only we say what we feel we display it now i am so german this offence is especially mine i touched her horses neck and said i have not seen it yet you understand me you know me well how is that the murmur of honest confession came from me i have seen it she laughed i bring you to be german you see could you forsake your england instantly though not willingly not regrettingly cheerfully if i had my work and mymy friend no but well i know a mans field of labour is his country you have your ambition yes now i have she struck a firbranch with her ridingwhip scattering flakes on my head would that extinguish it in the form of an avalanche perhaps it would then you make your aims a part of your life i do then you win or it is written of you that you never knew failure so with me i set my life upon my aim when i feel that the object is of true worth i win or death hides from me my missing it this i look to this obtains my professors nod and the approval of my conscience worthiness howeverthe mind must be trained to discern it we can err very easily in youth and to find ourselves shooting at a false mark uncontrollably must be a cruel thing i cannot say it is undeserving the scourge of derision do you know yourself i do not and i am told by my professor that it is the sole subject to which you should not give a close attention i can believe him for who beguiles so much as self tell her to play she plays her sweetest lurk to surprise her and what a serpent she becomes she is not to be aware that you are watching her you have to review her acts observe her methods always be above her then byandby you catch her hesitating at crossroads then she is bare you catch her bewailing or exulting then she can no longer pretend she is other than she seems i make self the feminine for she is the weaker and the soul has to purify and raise her on that point my professor and i disagree dr julius unlike our modern germans esteems women over men or it is a further stroke of his irony he does not think your english ladies have heads of us he is proud as a laurelled poet have i talked you dumb princess you have given me matter to think upon she shook her head smiling with closed eyelids i now that speech had been summoned to my lips could not restrain it and proceeded scarcely governing the words quite without ideas for you to be indifferent to rankyes you may well be you have intellect you are high above me in both so on against good taste and common sense she cried oh no compliments from you to me i will receive them if you please by deputy let my professor hear your immense admiration for his pupils accomplishments hear him then in return he will beat at me like the rainy west wind on a lily see he will say when i am broken and bespattered she is fair she is stately is she not and really i feel at the sound of praise though i like it that the opposite satire condemnation has its good right to pelt me look there is the tower theres the statue and under that line of pinetrees the path we ran updear english boys as i remember saying to myself and what did you say of me her hand was hanging loose i grasped it she drew a sudden long breath and murmured without fretting to disengage herself my friend not that her voice carried an unmistakeable command i kissed above the fingers and released them are you still able to run said she leading with an easy canter face averted she put on fresh speed i was outstripped had she quitted me in anger had she parted from me out of view of the villa windows to make it possible for us to meet accidentally again in the shadow of her old protecting warhead as we named him from his appearance gaunt schwartz chapter xxix an evening with dr julius von karsteg in my perplexity i thought of the professors saying a most fortunate or a most unfortunate young man these words began to strike me as having a prophetic depth that i had not fathomed i felt myself fast becoming bound in every limb every branch of my soul ottilia met me smiling she moved free as air she could pursue her studies and argue and discuss and quote keep unclouded eyes and laugh and play and be her whole living self unfettered as if the pressure of my hand implied nothing perhaps for that reason i had her pardon my friend not that her imperishably delicious english rang me awake and lulled me asleep was it not too securely friendly or was it not her natural voice to the best beloved bidding him respect her that we might meet with the sanction of her trained discretion the professor would invite me to his room after the sleep well of the ladies and i sat with him much like his pipebowl which burned bright a moment at one sturdy puff but generally gave out smoke in fantastical wreaths he told me frankly he had a poor idea of my erudition my fancifulness he commended as something to be turned to use in writing stories give me time and ill do better things i groaned he rarely spoke of the princess with grave affection always when he did he was evidently observing me comprehensively the result was beyond my guessing one night he asked me what my scheme of life was on the point of improvizing one of an impressive character i stopped and confessed i have so many that i may say i have none expecting reproof i begged him not to think the worse of me for that quite otherwise said he i have never cared to read deliberately in the book you open to me my good young man the book herr professor collect your wits we will call it shakespeares book or gthes in the minor issues no not minor but a narrower volume you were about to give me the answer of a hypocrite was it not so i admitted it feeling that it was easily to have been perceived he was elated good then i apprehend that you wait for the shifting of a tide to carry you on i try to strengthen my mind so i hear said he dryly well as far as your schools of teaching will allow that is you read and commit to memory like other young scholars whereunto have you no aim you have or i am told you are to have fabulous wealtha dragons heap you are one of the main drainpipes of english gold what is your object to spend it i shall hope to do good with it to do good there is hardly a prince or millionaire in history or alive who has not in his young days hugged that notion pleasure swarms he has the pick of his market you english live for pleasure we are the hardest workers in the world that you may live for pleasure deny it he puffed his tobaccosmoke zealously and resumed yes you work hard for money you eat and drink and boast of your exercises they sharpen your appetites so goes the round we strive we fail you are our frogchorus of critics and you suppose that your brekekkoax affects us i say we strive and fail but we strive on while you remain in a past age and are proud of it you reproach us with lack of common sense as if the belly were its seat now i ask you whether you have a scheme of life that i may know whether you are to be another of those huge human pumpkins called rich men who cover your country and drain its blood and intellectthose impoverishers of nature here we have our princes but they are rulers they are responsible they have their tasks and if they also run to gourds the scandal punishes them and their order all in seasonable time they stand eminent do you mark me they are not a community and are notbad enough bad enoughbut they are not protected by laws in their right to do nothing for what they receive that system is an invention of the commercial genius and the english we have our aristocracy herr professor your nobles are nothing but rich men inflated with empty traditions of insufferable because unwarrantable pride and drawing substance from alliances with the merchant class are they your leaders do they lead you in letters in the arts ay or in government no not i am informed not even in military service and there our titled witlings do manage to hold up their brainless pates you are all in one mass struggling in the stream to get out and lie and wallow and belch on the banks you work so hard that you have all but one aim and that is fatness and ease pardon me herr professor i interposed i see your drift still i think we are the only people on earth who have shown mankind a representation of freedom and as to our aristocracy i must with due deference to you maintain that it is widely respected i could not conceive why he went on worrying me in this manner with his jealous outburst of continental bile widely he repeated it is widely respected and you respect it and why do you respect it we have illustrious names in our aristocracy we beat you in illustrious names and in the age of the lines my good young man but not in a race of nobles who have stood for the countrys liberties so long as it imperilled their own any longer well they have known how to yield they have helped to build our constitution reverence their ancestors then the worse for such descendants but you have touched the exact stamp of the english mindit is to accept whatsoever is bequeathed it without inquiry whether there is any change in the matter nobles in very fact you would not let them be if they could nobles in name with a remote recommendation to posteritythat suits you he sat himself up to stuff a fresh bowl of tobacco while he pursued yes yes you worship your aristocracy it is notorious you have a sort of sagacity i am not prepared to contest the statement that you have a political instinct here it is chiefly social you worship your socalled aristocracy perforce in order to preserve an ideal of contrast to the vulgarity of the nation this was downright insolence it was intolerable i jumped on my feet the weapons i would use in reply to such remarks i cannot address to you herr professor therefore excuse me he sent out quick spirts of smoke rolling into big volumes nay my good young englishman but on the other hand you have not answered me and hear me yes you have shown us a representation of freedom true but you are content with it in a world that moves by computation some considerable sum upwards of sixty thousand miles an hour not on a fresh journeya recurring course said i good he applauded and i was flattered i grant you the physical illustration the professor continued and with a warm gaze on me i thought the mind journeys somewhat in that way and we in our old germany hold that the mind advances notwithstanding astronomers condescending to earthly philosophy may admit that advance in the physical universe is computable though not perceptible somewhither we tend shell and spirit you english fighting your little battles of domestic policy and sneering at us for flying at higher game you unimpressionable english who wont believe in the existence of aims that dont drop on the ground before your eyes and squat and stare at you you assert that mans labour is completed when the poor are kept from crying out now my question is have you a scheme of life consonant with the spirit of modern philosophywith the views of intelligent moral humane human beings of this period or are you one of your robust english brotherhood worthy of a caligula in his prime lions in gymnasticsfor a time sheep always in the dominions of mind and all of one pattern all in a rut favour me with an outline of your ideas pour them out pellmell intelligibly or not no matter i undertake to catch you somewhere i mean to know you hark you rather with your assistance than without it we were deep in the night i had not a single idea ready for delivery i could have told him that wishing was a good thing excess of tobacco a bad moderation in speech one of the outward evidences of wisdom but ottilias master in the humanities exacted civility from me indeed i said i have few thoughts to communicate at present herr professor my german will fail me as soon as i quit common ground i love my country and i do not reckon it as perfect we are swillers possibly gluttons we have a large prosperous middle class many good men are to be found in it his discharges of smoke grew stifling my advocacy was certainly of a miserable sort yes herr professor on my way when a boy to this very place i met a thorough good man here i related the tale of my encounter with captain welsh dr julius nodded rapidly for continuations further further he refused to dig at the mine within me and seemed to expect it to unbosom its riches by explosion well herr professor we have conquered india and hold it as no other people could vide the articles in the last file of english newspapers said he suppose we boast of it can you he simulated wonderment why surely its something something for noncommissioned officers to boast of not for statesmen however say that you are fit to govern asiatics go on i would endeavour to equalize ranks at home encourage the growth of ideas supporting a noncelibate clergy and an intermingled aristocracy your endeavours my good young man will lessen like those of the man who employed a spade to uproot a rock it wants blasting your married clergy and merchandized aristocracy are coils they are the ivy about your social tree you would resemble laocoon in the throes if one could imagine you anything of a heroic figure forward in desperation i exclaimed its useless i have not thought at all i have been barely educated i only know that i do desire with all my heart to know more to be of some service now we are at the bottom then said he but i cried stay let me beg you to tell me what you meant by calling me a most fortunate or a most unfortunate young man he chuckled over his pipestem aha how am i one or the other by the weight of what you carry in your head how by the weight he shot a keen look at me the case i suspect is singular and does not often happen to a youth you are fortunate if you have a solid and adventurous mind most unfortunate if you are a mere sensational whipster theres an explanation that covers the whole i am as much in the dark as you are i do not say which of us two has the convex eye protesting that i was unable to read riddles though the heat of the one in hand made my frame glow i entreated to have explicit words he might be in ottilias confidence probing mewhy not any question he chose to put to me i said i was ready to answer but its the questioner who unmasks said he are we masked herr professor i was not aware of it look within and avoid lying he stood up my nights he remarked are not commonly wasted in this manner we germans use the night for work after a struggle to fling myself on his mercy and win his aid or counsel i took his hand respectfully and holding it said i am unable to speak out i would if it involved myself alone yes yes i comprehend your country breeds honourable men chivalrous youngsters he replied its not enoughnot enough i want to see a mental force energy of brain if you had that you might look as high as you liked for the match for it with my consent do you hear what i wont have is flat robbery mark me germany or england its one to me if i see vital powers in the field running to a grand career its a fine field over there as well there as here then but better here than there if its to be a wasps life do you understand me i replied i think i do if i may dare to and catching breath herr professor dear friend forgive my boldness grant me time to try me dont judge of me at once take me for your pupilam i presumptuous in asking itmake of me what you will what you can examine me you may find theres more in me than i or anybody may know i have thoughts and aims feeble at presentgood god i see nothing for me but a choice of the twomost unfortunate seems likeliest you read at a glance that i had no other choice rather the extremesi would rather grasp the limits of life and be swung to the pits below be the most unfortunate of human beings than never to have aimed at a star you laugh at me an englishman must be horribly in earnest to talk as i do now but it is a star the image of ottilia sprang fountainlike into blue night heavens before my eyes memorably she was my next word i swallowed it and with a burning face petitioned for help in my studies to such sight as i had at that instant he appeared laughing outrageously it was a composed smile right he said you shall have help in a settled course certain professors friends of mine at your university will see you through it aim your head at a staryour headand even if you miss it you dont fall its that light dancer that gambler the heart in you my good young man which aims itself at inaccessible heights and has the fallsomewhat icy to reflect on give that organ full play and you may make sure of a handful of dust do you hear its a mind that wins a mind that is why i warn you of being most unfortunate if you are a sensational whipster goodnight shut my door fast that i may not have the trouble to rise i left him with the warm lamplight falling on his forehead and books piled and sloped shut and open an enviable picture to one in my condition the peacefulness it indicated made scholarship seem beautiful attainable i hoped i had the sense to tell myself that it would give me unrotting grain though it should fail of being a practicable road to my bright star and when i spurned at consolations for failure i could still delight to think that she shone over these harvests and the reapers chapter xxx a summer storm and love the foregoing conversations with ottilia and her teacher hard as they were for passion to digest grew luminous on a relapsing heart without apprehending either their exact purport or the characters of the speakers i was transformed by them from a state of craving to one of intense quietude i thought neither of winning her nor of aiming to win her but of a foothold on the heights she gazed at reverently and if sometimes seeing and hearing her i thought oh rarest soul the wish was that brother and sisterhood of spirit might be ours my other eager thirstful self i shook off like a thing worn out men in my confidence would have supposed me more rational i was simply possessed my desire was to go into harness buried in books and for recreation to chase visions of original ideas for benefiting mankind a clearwitted friend at my elbow my dear temple perhaps could have hit on the track of all this mental vagueness but it is doubtful that he would have pushed me out of the strange mood half stupor half the foldingin of passion it was such magical happiness not to be awake yet vividly sensible to lie calm and reflect and only to reflect be satisfied with each succeeding hour and the privations of the hour and as if in the depths of a smooth water to gather fold over patient fold of the submerged self safe from wounds the happiness was not noble but it breathed and was harmless and it gave me rest when the alternative was folly and bitterness visitors were coming to the palace to meet the prince on his return with my father from england i went back to the university jealous of the invasion of my ecstatic calm by new faces and jealous when there of the privileges those new faces would enjoy and then how my recent deadness of life cried out against me as worse than a spendthrift a destroyer a nerveless absorbent of the bliss showered on methe light of her morning presence when just before embracing she made her obeisance to the margravine and kindly saluted me and stooped her forehead for the baroness to kiss it her gestures and her voice her figure on horseback with old warhead following and i meeting her but onceher walk with the professor listening to his instructions i used to see them walking up and down the cypress path of the villa garden her ear given to him wholly as she continued her grave step and he shuffling and treading out of his line across hers or on the pathborders and never apologizing nor she noticing it at night she sang sometimes mountain ditties to the accompaniment of the zither leaning on the table and sweeping the wires between snatches of talk nothing haunted me so much as those tones of her zither which were little louder than summer gnats when fireflies are at their brightest and storm impends my father brought horses from england and a couple of english grooms and so busy an air of cheerfulness that i had like a sick invalid to beg him to keep away from me and prolong unlimitedly his visit to sarkeld the rather so as he said he had now become indispensable to the prince besides the margravine only no more bronze statues i adjured him he nodded he had hired count fretzels chateau in the immediate neighbourhood and was absolutely independent he said his lawyers were busy procuring evidence he had impressed prince ernest with a due appreciation of the wealth of a young english gentleman by taking him over my grandfathers mine and richie we have advanced him a trifle of thousands for the working of this coal discovery of his in six weeks our schooner yacht will be in the elbe to offer him entertainment he graciously deigns to accept a couple of english hunters at our hands we shall improve his breed of horses i suspect now richie have i done well i flatter myself i have been attentive to your interests have i not he hung waiting for confidential communications on my part but did not press for them he preserved an unvarying delicacy in that respect you have nothing to tell he asked nothing i said i have only to thank you he left me at no other period of our lives were we so disunited i felt in myself the reverse of everything i perceived in him and such letters as i wrote to the squire consequently had a homelier tone it seems that i wrote of the pleasures of simple livingof living for learnings sake mr peterborough at the same time despatched praises of my sobriety of behaviour and diligent studiousness confessing that i began to outstrip him in some of the higher branches the squires brief reply breathed satisfaction but too evidently on the point where he had been led to misconceive the state of affairs he wanted to have me near him as did another person whom i appeared to be forgetting he granted me another years leave of absence bidding me bluffly not to be a bookworm and forget i was an englishman the idea that i was deceiving him never entered my mind i was deceiving everybody myself in the bargain as a man must do when in chase of a woman above him in rank the chase necessitates deceitwho knows chicanery of a sort as well it brings inevitable humiliations such that ever since the commencement of it at speed i could barely think of my father with comfort and rarely met him with pleasure with what manner of face could i go before the prince or the margravine and say i am an english commoner the son of a man of doubtful birth and i claim the hand of the princess what contortions were not in store for these features of mine even as affairs stood now could i make a confidant of temple and let him see me through the stages of the adventure my jingling of verses my fretting about the signification of flowers and trifling with symbols haunted me excrutiatingly taunting me with i know not what abject vileness of spirit in the midst of these tortures an arrow struck me in the shape of an anonymous letter containing one brief line the princess is in need of help i threw my books aside and repaired to count fretzels chateau from which happily my father was absent but the countenance of the princess gave me no encouragement to dream i could be of help to her yet a second unsigned note worded in a quaint blunt manner insisted that it was to me she looked i chanced to hear the margravine addressing baroness turckems say the princesss betrothal what further escaped me soon after i heard that prince otto was a visitor at the lakepalace my unknown correspondent plied me a third time i pasted the scrap in my neglected book of notes and reflections where it had ample space and about equal lucidity it drew me to the book nearly driving me desperate i was now credulous of anything except that the princess cared for help from me i resolved to go home i had no longer any zeal for study the desolation of the picture of england in my mind grew congenial it became imperative that i should go somewhere for news arrived of my fathers approach with a french company of actors and deafening entertainments were at hand on the whole i thought it decent to finish my course at the university if i had not quite lost the power of getting into the heart of books one who studies is not being a fool that is an established truth i thanked dr julius for planting it among my recollections the bone and marrow of study form the surest antidote to the madness of that light gambler the heart and distasteful as books were i had gained the habit of sitting down to them which was as good as an instinct toward the right medicine if it would but work on an afternoon of great heat i rode out for a gaze at the lakepalace that i chose to fancy might be the last foreseeing the possibility of one of my fits of movement coming on me before sunset my very pulses throbbed away transferring the sense of overwhelming heat to my moral condition i thought it the despair of silliness to stay baking in that stagnant place where the sky did nothing but shine gave nothing forth the sky was bronze a vast furnace dome the folds of light and shadow everywhere were satinrich shadows perforce of blackness had light in them and the light a swordlike sharpness over their edges it was inanimate radiance the laurels sparkled as with frostpoints the denser foliage dropped burning brown a sickly saintsring was round the heads of the pines that afternoon the bee hummed of thunder and refreshed the ear i pitied the horse i rode and the dog at his heels but for me the intensity was inspiriting nothing lay in the light i had the land to myself what hurts me i thought my physical pride was up and i looked on the cattle in black corners of the fields and here and there a man tumbled anyhow a wreck of limbs out of the insupportable glare with an even glance not an eye was lifted on me i saw nothing that moved until a boat shot out of the bight of sultry lakewater lying close below the dark promontory where i had drawn rein the rower was old schwartz warhead how my gorge rose at the impartial brute he was rowing the princess and a young man in uniform across the lake that they should cross from unsheltered paths to close covert was reasonable conduct at a time when the vertical rays of the sun were fiery arrowheads as soon as they were swallowed in the gloom i sprang in my saddle with torture transfixed by one of the coarsest shafts of hideous jealousy off i flew tearing through dry underwood and round the bend of the lake determined to confront her wave the man aside and have my last word with the false woman of the real ottilia i had lost conception blood was inflamed brain bare of vision he takes her hand she jumps from the boat he keeps her hand she feigns to withdraw it all woman to him in her eyes they pass out of sight a groan burst from me i strained my crazy imagination to catch a view of them under cover of the wood and torture myself trebly but it was now blank shut fast sitting bolt upright panting on horseback in the yellow green of one of the open woodways i saw the young officer raise a branch of chestnut and come out he walked moodily up to within a yard of my horse looked up at me and with an angry stare that grew to be one of astonishment said ah i think i have had the pleasuresomewhere in wurtemberg if i recollect it was prince otto i dismounted he stood alone the spontaneous question on my lips would have been where is she but i was unable to speak a word english he said patting the horses neck yesthe horse an english hunter how are you prince otto do you like the look of him immensely you know we have a passion for english thoroughbreds pardon me you look as if you had been close on a sunstroke do you generally take rides in this weather i was out by chance if you like him pray take him take him mount him and try him he is yours if you care to have him if he doesnt suit you send him up to count fretzels ive had riding enough in the light perhaps you have said he and hesitated its difficult to resist the offer of such a horse if you want to dispose of him mention it when we meet again shall i try him i have a slight inclination to go as hard as you have been going but he shall have good grooming in the princes stables and thats less than half as near again as count pretzels place and a horse like this ought not to be out in this weather if you will permit me the remark no im ashamed of bringing him out and shant look on him with satisfaction said i take him and try him and then take him from me if you dont mind do you know i would advise your lying down in the shade awhile he observed solicitously i have seen men on the march in hungary and italy an hours rest under cover would have saved them i thanked him ice is the thing he ejaculated ill ride and have some fetched to you rest here with visible pleasure he swung to the saddle i saw him fix his cavalry thighs and bound off as if he meant to take a gate had he glanced behind him he would have fancied that the sun had done its worst i ran at full speed down the footpath mad to think she might have returned homeward by the lake the two had partedwhy he this way she that they would not have parted but for a division of the will i came on the empty boat schwartz lay near it beneath heavy boughs smoking and perspiring in peace neither of us spoke and it was now tempered by a fit of alarm that i renewed my search so when i beheld her intense gratitude broke my passion when i touched her hand it was trembling for absolute assurance of her safety she was leaning against a tree gazing on the ground a white figure in that ironmoted gloom otto she cried shrinking from the touch but at sight of me all softly as a light in the heavens her face melted in a suffusion of wavering smiles and deep colour shot over them heavenly to see she pressed her bosom while i spoke a lovers speech breathless you love me she said you have known it yes yes forgiven me speak princess call me by my name my own soul ottilia she disengaged her arms tenderly i have known it by my knowledge of myself she said breathing with her lips dissevered my weakness has come upon me yes i love you it is spoken it is too true is it a fate that brings us together when i have just lost my little remaining strengthall power you hear me i pretend to wisdom and talk of fate she tried to laugh in scorn of herself and looked at me with almost a bitter smile on her features made beautiful by her soft eyes i feared from the helpless hanging of her underlip that she would swoon a shudder convulsed her and at the same time i became aware of the blotting out of sunlight and a strange bowing and shorelike noising of the forest do not heed me she said in happy undertones i think i am going to cry like a girl one cannot see ones pride die like this without but it is not anguish of any kind since we are here together i would have no other change she spoke till the tears came thick i told her of the letters i had received warning me of a trouble besetting her they were perhaps the excuse for my conduct if i had any schwartz burst on us with his drillsergeants shout for the princess standing grey in big raindrops he was an object of curiosity to us both he came to take her orders the thunder he announced raising a telegraphic arm rolls it rains we have a storm command me princess your highness ottilias eyelids were set blinking by one look aloft rain and lightning filled heaven and earth direct us you she said to me gently the natural proposal was to despatch her giant by the direct way down the lake to fetch a carriage from the stables or matting from the boathouse i mentioned it but did not press it she meditated an instant i believe i may stay with my beloved schwartz and i ran to the boat hauled it on land and set it keel upward against a low leafy dripping branch to this place of shelter protecting her as securely as i could i led the princess while schwartz happed a rough trench around it with one of the sculls we started him on foot to do the best thing possible for the storm gave no promise that it was a passing one in truth i knew that i should have been the emissary and he the guard but the storm overhead was not fuller of its mighty burden than i of mine i looked on her as mine for the hour and well won chapter xxxi princess ottilias letter that hour of tempest went swift as one of its flashes over our little nest of peace where we crouched like insects the lightning and the deluge seemed gloriously endless ottilias harbouring nook was dry within an inch of rushing floods and pattered mire on me the torrents descended and her gentle efforts drew me to her side as with a maternal claim to protect me or to perish in my arms if the lightning found us we had for prospect an everoutbursting flame of foliage and the hubbub of the hissing lake crimson purple dusky grey like the face of a passionate creature scourged it was useless to speak her lips were shut but i had the intent kindness of her eyes on me almost unceasingly the good hour slipped away old warheads splashed knees on the level of our heads were seen by us when the thunder had abated ottilia prepared to rise you shall hear from me she said bending with brows measuring the boatroof like a bird about to fly shall i see you ultimately you surely will ah still be patient am i not have i not been yes and can you regret it no but we separate would you have us be two feet high for ever she answered smiling one foot high or under earth if it might be together poor little gnomes said she the homeliness of our restingplace arrested her for an instant and perhaps a touch of comic pity for things of such diminutive size as to see nothing but knees where a man stood our heads were hidden adieu no pledge is needed she said tenderly none i replied she returned to the upper world with a burning blush schwartz had borne himself with extraordinary discretion by forbearing to spread alarm at the palace he saluted his young mistress in the regulation manner while receiving her beneath a vast umbrella the holiday peasants invariable companion in these parts a forester was in attendance carrying shawls clogs and matting the boat was turned and launched adieu harry richmond will you be quite patient till you hear from me said ottilia and added it is my question delightfully recalling old times i was soon gazing at the track of the boat in rough water shouts were being raised somewhere about the forest and were replied to by hearty bellow of the rowers lungs she was now at liberty to join my name to her own or not as she willed i had to wait but how much richer was i than all the world the future owed me nothing i would have registered a vow to ask nothing of it among the many determined purposes framing which i walked home was one to obtain a grant of that bit of land where we had sat together and build a temple on it the fear that it might be trodden by feet of men before i had enclosed it beset me with anguish the most absolute pain i suffered sprang from a bewildering incapacity to conjure up a vision of ottilia free of the glittering accessories of her high birth and that was the pain of shame but it came only at intervals when pride stood too loftily and the shadow of possible mischance threatened it with the axe she did not condemn me to long waiting her favourite aennchen brought me her first letter the girls face beamed and had a look as if she commended me for a worthy deed an answer aennchen i asked her yes yes said she anxiously but it will take more time than i can spare she appointed a meeting near the palace gardengates at night i chose a roof of limes to read under noblest and best beloved the princess addressed me in her own tongue doubting i perceived as her training had taught her that my english eyes would tolerate apostrophes of openhearted affection the rest was her english confided to a critic who would have good reason to be merciful the night has come that writes the chapter of the day my father has had his interview with his headforester to learn what has befallen from the storm in the forest all has not been told him that shall not be delayed beyond tomorrow i am hurried to it and i had the thought that it hung perhaps at the very end of my life among the coloured leaves the strokes of sunsetthat then it would be known or if earlier distant from this strange imperative now but we have our personal freedom now and i have learnt from minutes what i did mean to seek from years and from our forest what i hoped that change of scene travel experience would teach me yet i was right in my intention it was a discreet and a just meaning i had for things will not go smoothly for him at once he will have his hard battle he is proved he has passed his most brave ordeal but i shall i see him put to it and not certainly know myself even thus i reasoned one cannot study without knowing that our human nature is most frail daily the body changes daily the mindwhy not the heart i did design to travel and converse with various persons pardon it to one who knew that she would require superfeminine power of decision to resolve that she would dispose of herself i heard of harry richmond before i saw him my curiosity to behold the two fair boys of the sailor kingdom set me whipping my pony after them that day so remote which is always yesterday my thoughts followed you and i wondereddoes he mean to be a distinguished countryman of his nelson or a man of learning then many an argument with my professor untilfor so it will ever bethe weaker creature did succumb in the open controversy and thought her thoughts to herself contempt of england gained on me still but when i lay withered though so young by the seashore his countrys ancient grandeur insisted and i dreamed of harry richmond imagining that i had been false to my childhood you stood before me dearest you were kind you were strong and had a gentle voice our souls were caught together on the sea do you recollect my slip in the speaking of lucy sibleys marriagewe change countries at that moment i smelt salt air which would bring you to my sight and touch were you and i divided let me not think how far tomorrow i tell the prince my father that i am a plighted woman then for us the struggle for him the grief i have to look on him and deal it i can refer him to dr julius for my estimate of my husbands worth my professor was won by it he once did incline to be the young bold englishmans enemy why is he here what seeks he among us it was his jealousy not of the man but of the nation which would send one to break and bear away his carefully cultivated german lily no eye but his did read me through and you endured the trial that was forced on you you made no claim for recompense when it was over no there is no pure love but strong love it belongs to our original elements and of its purity should never be question only of its strength i could not help you when you were put under scrutiny before the margravine and the baroness help from me would have been the betrayal of both the world has accurate eyes if they are not very penetrating the world will see a want of balance immediately and also too true a balance but it will not detect a depth of concord between two souls that do not show some fretfulness on the surface so it was considered that in refusing my cousin otto and other proposed alliances i was heartfree an instructed princess they thought was of the woeful species of woman you left us i lost you i heard you praised for civil indifference to methe one great quality you do not possess then it was the fancy of people that i being very cold might be suffered to hear my cousin plead for himself the majority of our family favour otto he was permitted to woo me as though i had been a simple maid and henceforth shall i have pity for all poor little feminine things who are so persecuted asked to inflict crueltyto take a sword and strike with it but iwho look on marriage as more than a surrenderi could well withstand surpassing eloquence it was easy to me to be inflexible in speech and will when i stood there entreated to change myself but when came magically the other who is my heart my voice my mate the half of me and broke into illumination of things long hiddenoh then did i say to you that it was my weakness had come upon me it was my last outcry of selfthe i expiring i am now yours we has long overshadowed i and now engulphs it we are one if it were new to me to find myself interrogating the mind of my beloved relying on his courage taking many proofs of his devotion i might pause to reperuse my words here without scruple written i sign it before heaven your ottilia ottilia frederika wilhelmina hedwig princess of eppenwelzensarkeld chapter xxxii an interview with prince ernest and a meeting with prince otto a messenger from prince ernest commanding my immediate attendance at the palace signified that the battle had begun i could have waited for my father whose return from one of his expeditions in the princes service was expected every instant but though i knew i should have had a powerful coadjutor in him to assist me through such a conference i preferred to go down alone prince otto met me in the hall he passed by glancing an eye sharply and said over his shoulder we shall have a word together presently the library door was flung open prince ernest and the margravine were in the room she walked out with angry majesty the prince held his figure in the stiff attitude of reception he could look imposing the character of the interview was perceptible at once you have not i presume to be informed of the business in hand mr richmond your highness i believe i can guess it this started him pacing the floor an impossibility a monstrous extravagance a thing unheard of mania mania he muttered you are aware sir that you have been doing your worst to destroy the settled arrangements of my family what does it mean in common reason you cannot indulge any legitimate hope of succeeding taking you as a foreigner you must know that judge of the case by your own reigning families such events never happen amongst them do you suppose that the possession of immense wealth entitles you to the immeasurable presumption of aspiring to equality of position with reigning houses such folly is more frequently castigated than reasoned with why nownow were it publishedthat i had condescendedcondescend as i am doing i should be the laughingstock of every court in europe you english want many lessons you are taught by your scribes to despise the dignity which is not supported by a multitude of bayonets guns and gold i heard of it when i travelled incognito you make merry over little potentates good but do not cross their paths their dominion may be circumscribed but they have it and where we are now my power equals that of the kaiser and the czar you will do me the favour to understand that i am not boasting not menacing i attempt since it is extraordinarily imposed on me to instruct you i have cause to be offended i waive it i meet you on common ground and address myself to your good sense have you anything to say much sir much he said with affected incredulity the painful hardship for me was to reply in the vague terms he had been pleased to use i have much to say your highness first to ask pardon of you without excusing myself a condition apparently that absolves the necessity for the grant speak precisely but i was as careful as he in abstaining from any direct indication of his daughters complicity and said i have offended your highness you have done me the honour to suggest that it is owing to my english training you will credit my assurance that the offence was not intentional not preconceived you charge it upon your having been trained among a nation of shopkeepers my countrymen are not illiterate or unmannerly your highness i have not spoken it i may add i do not think it i feared that your highness entertained what i find to be a very general perhaps here and there wilful error with regard to england when i was in the service i had a comrade a gallant gentleman deeply beloved by me and he was an englishman he died in the uniform and under the flag i reverence i rejoice that your highness has had this experience of us i have to imagine that i expressed myself badly my english training certainly does not preclude the respect due to exalted rank your highness will i trust humbly pardon my offence i do not excuse myself because i cannot withdraw and i am incapable of saying that i regret it in cool blood you utter that exclaimed the prince his amazement was unfeigned what are the impossible monstrous ideas youwhere who leads you to fancy there is one earthly chance for you when you say you cannot withdraw cannot are you requested are you consulted it is a question to be decided in the imperative you must what wheel it is you think you have sufficient vigour to stop i am profoundly unaware but i am prepared to affirm that it is not the wheel of my household i would declare it were i a plain citizen you are a nullity in the case in point of your individual willa nullity swept away with one wave of the hand you can do this and nothing else you can apologize recognize your station repair a degree of mischief that i will not say was preconceived or plotted so for awhile pursue your studies your travels in time it will give me pleasure to receive you mr richmond he added smiling and rising even the head of a little german principality has to give numberless audiences his features took a more cordial smile to convince me that the dismissing sentence was merely playful as for me my mind was confused by the visible fact that the fathers features resembled the daughters i mention it that my minds condition may be understood hardly had i been bowed out of the room when my father embraced me and some minutes later i heard prince otto talking to me and demanding answers that he or any one else should have hostile sentiments toward a poor devil like me seemed strange my gift of the horse appeared to anger him most i reached the chateau without once looking back a dispirited wretch i shut myself up i tried to read the singular brevity of my interview with the prince from which i had expected great if not favourable issues affected me as though i had been struck by a cannon shot my brains were nowhere his perfect courtesy was confounding i was tormented by the delusion that i had behaved pusillanimously my father rushed up to me after dark embracing me and holding me by the hand he congratulated me with his whole heart the desire of his life was accomplished the thing he had plotted for ages had come to pass he praised me infinitely my glorious future he said was to carry a princess to england and sit among the highest there the husband of a lady peerless in beauty and in birth who in addition to what she was able to do for me by way of elevation in my country could ennoble in her own territory i had the option of being the father of english nobles or of german princes so forth i did not like the strain yet i clung to him i was compelled to ask whether he had news of any sort worth hearing none said he calmly none i have everything to hear nothing to relate and happily i can hardly speak for joy he wept he guaranteed to have the margravine at the chateau within a week which seemed to me a sufficient miracle the prince he said might require three months of discretionary treatment three further months to bring the family round and the princess would be mine but she is yours she is yours already he cried authoritatively she is the reigning intellect there i dreaded her very intellect would give us all the trouble and behold it is our ally the prince lives with an elbow out of his income but for me it would be other parts of his person as well i assure you and the world would see such a princely tatterdemalion as would astonish it money to him is important he must carry on his mine he can carry on nothing without my help by the way we have to deal out cheques i assented in spite of myself i caught the contagion of his exuberant happiness and faith in his genius the prince had applauded his energetic management of the affairs of the mine two or three times in my hearing it struck me that he had really found his vocation and would turn the sneer on those who had called him volatile and reckless this led me to a luxurious sense of dependence on him and i was willing to live on dreaming and amused though all around me seemed phantoms especially the french troupe the flower of the parisian stage regnault carigny desbarolles mesdames blanche bignet and dupertuy and mdlle jenny chassediane the most spirituelle of frenchwomen they are a part of our enginery richie my father said they proved to be an irresistible attraction to the margravine she sent word to my father that she meant to come on a particular day when as she evidently knew i should not be present two or three hours later i had prince ottos cartel in my hands jorian dewitt our guest at this season told me subsequently and with the utmost seriousness that i was largely indebted to mdlle jenny for a touching french song of a beau chevalier she sang before ottilia in my absence both he and my father believed in the efficacy of this kind of enginery but as the case happened the beau chevalier was down low enough at the moment his highborn lady listened to the song it appeared that when prince otto met me after my interview with prince ernest he did his best to provoke a rencontre and failing to get anything but a nod from my stunned head betook himself to my university a friendly young fellow there eckart vom hof offered to fight him on my behalf should i think proper to refuse eckart and two or three others made a spirited stand against the aristocratic party siding with prince otto whose case was that i had played him a dishonourable trick to laugh at him i had in truth persuaded him to relieve me at once of horse and rival at the moment when he was suffering the tortures of a rejection and i was rushing to take the hand he coveted i was so far guilty but to how great a degree guiltless how could i possibly explain to the satisfaction of an angry man i had the vision of him leaping on the horse while i perused his challenge saw him fix to the saddle and smile hard and away to do me of all services the last he would have performed wittingly the situation was exactly of a sort for one of his german phantasywriters to image the forest jeering at him as he flew blind deaf and unreasonable vehement for one fierce draught of speed we are all dogged by the humour of following events when we start on a wind of passion i could almost fancy myself an accomplice i realized the scene with such intensity in the light running at his heels it may be quite true that i laughed in the hearing of his messenger as i folded up the letter that was the mans report i am not commonly one to be forgetful of due observances the prospect of the possible eternal separation from my beloved pricked my mechanical wits and set them tracing the consequent line by which i had been brought to this pass as to a natural result had not my father succeeded in inspiring the idea that i was something more than something the tendency of young men is to conceive it for themselves without assistance a prolonged puff from the breath of another is nearly sure to make them mad as kings and not so pardonably i see that i might have acted wisely and did not but that is a speculation taken apart from my capabilities if a mans fate were as a forbidden fruit detached from him and in front of him he might hesitate fortunately before plucking it but as most of us are aware the vital half of it lies in the seedpaths he has traversed we are sons of yesterday not of the morning the past is our mortal mother no dead thing our future constantly reflects her to the soul nor is it ever the new man of today which grasps his fortune good or ill we are pushed to it by the hundreds of days we have buried eager ghosts and if you have not the habit of taking counsel with them you are but an instrument in their hands my english tongue admonishes me that i have fallen upon a tone resembling one who uplifts the finger of piety in a salon of conversation a mans review of the course of his life grows for a moment stringently serious when he beholds the stream first broadening perchance under the light interpenetrating mine just now my seconds were young eckart vom hof and the barely much older though already famous gregorius bandelmeyer a noted mathematician a savage republican leanfaced spectacled and long softfingered a cat to look at a tiger to touch both of them were animated by detestation of the imperial uniform they distrusted my skill in the management of the weapon i had chosen for reasons of their own they carried a case of pistols to the field prince otto was attended by count loepel and a major edelsheim of his army fresh from the garrison fortress of mainz gentlemen perfectly conversant with the laws of the game which my worthy comrades were not several minutes were spent in an altercation between edelsheim and bandelmeyer the major might have had an affair of his own had he pleased my feelings were concentrated within the immediate ring where i stood i can compare them only to those of a gambler determined to throw his largest stake and abide the issue i was not open to any distinct impression of the surrounding scenery the hills and leafage seemed to wear an iron aspect my darling my saints face was shut up in my heart and with it a little inaudible cry of love and pain the prince declined to listen to apologies he meant to teach me that this was not a laughing matter major edelsheim had misunderstood bandelmeyer no offer of an apology had been made a momentary human sensation of an unworthy sort beset me when i saw them standing together again and contrasted the collectedness and goodhumour of my adversarys representative with the vexatious and unnecessary naggling of mine the sight of whose yardlong pipe scandalized me at last the practical word was given the prince did not reply to my salute he was smoking and kept his cigar in one corner of his mouth as if he were a master fencer bidding his pupil to come on he assumed that he had to do with a bourgeois briton unused to arms such as we are generally held to be on the continent after feeling my wrist for a while he shook the cigar out of his teeth the cliquetis of the crossed steel must be very distant in memory and yourself in a most dilettante frame of mind for you to be accessible to the music of that thin skeletons clank nevertheless it is better and finer even at the time of action than the abominable hollow ogres eye of the pistolmuzzle we exchanged passes the prince chiefly attacking of all the things to strike my thoughts can you credit me that the vividest was the picture of the old woman temple and i had seen in our boyhood on the night of the fire dropping askew like forks of brown flame from the burning house in london city i must have smiled the prince cried out in french laugh sir you shall have it he had nothing but his impetuosity for an assurance of his promise and was never able to force me back beyond a foot i touched him on the arm and the shoulder and finally pierced his arm above the elbow i could have done nearly what i liked with him his skill was that of a common regimental sabreur ludere qui nescit campestribus abstinet armis bandelmeyer sang out you observed said major edelsheim and received another disconcerting discharge of a latin line the prince frowned and made use of some military slang was his honour now satisfied not a whit he certainly could not have kept his swordpoint straight and yet he clamoured to fight on stamped and summoned me to assault him proposed to fight me with his left hand after his right had failed in short he was beside himself an example of the predicament of a man who has given all the provocation and finds himself disabled my seconds could have stopped it had they been equal to their duties instead of which bandelmeyer hearing what he deemed an insult to the order of student and scholar retorted furiously and offensively and eckart out of goodfellowship joined him whereat major edelsheim in the act of bandaging the princes arm warned them that he could not pass by an outrage on his uniform count loepel stept politely forward and gave eckart a significant bow the latter remarked mockingly with pleasure and condescension at a murmur of the name of doctor from edelsheim the prince damned the doctor until he or i were food for him irritated by the whole scene and his extravagant vindictiveness in which light i regarded the cloak of fury he had flung over the shame of his defeat i called to bandelmeyer to open his case of pistols and offer them for a settlement as the proposal came from me it was found acceptable the major remonstrated with the prince and expressed to me his regrets and et caeteras of wellmeant civility he had a hard task to keep out of the hands of bandelmeyer who had seized my sword and wanted vi et armis to defend the cause of learning and the people against military brigands on the spot if i had not fallen we should have had one or two other prostrate bodies a silly business on all sides chapter xxxiii what came of a shilling the surgeon who attended us both loudly admired our mutual delicacy in sparing arteries and vital organs but a bullet cuts a rougher pathway than the neat steel blade and i was prostrate when the prince came to press my hand on his departure for his quarters at laibach the utterly unreasonable nature of a duel was manifested by his declaring to me that he was now satisfied i did not mean to insult him and then laugh at him we must regard it rather as a sudorific for feverish blood and brains i felt my wound acutely seeing his brisk step when he retired having overthrown me bodily it threw my heart back to its first emotions and i yearned to set eyes on my father with a haunting sense that i had of late injured him and owed him reparation it vanished after he had been in my room an hour to return when he had quitted it and incessantly and inexplicably it went and came in this manner he was depressed i longed for drollery relieved only by chance allusions to my beloved one whereas he could not conceal his wish to turn the stupid duel to account pencil a line to her he entreated me and dictated his idea of a moving line adding urgently that the crippled letters would be affecting to her as to the great frederick his last review of his invalid veterans your namethe signature of your name alone darling richie and he traced a crooked scrawl with a forefingerstill dearest angel in contempt of death and blood i am yours to eternity harry lepel richmond sometimes called roya point for your decision in the future should the breath everlastingly devoted to the most celestial of her sex continue to animate the frame that would rise on wings to say adieu adieurichie just a sentence he was distracting his natural tenderness and neatness of hand qualified him for spreading peace in a sickroom but he was too full of life and his scheme and knowing me out of danger he could not forbear giving his despondency an outlet i heard him exclaim in big sighs heavens how near and again she must hear of it never was man so incorrigibly dramatic he would walk up to a bookcase and take down a volume when the interjectional fit waxed violent flip the pages affecting a perplexity he would assuredly have been struck by had he perused them and read as he did onceitaly the land of the sun and she is to be hurried away there and we are left to groan the conspiracy is infamous one of the family takes it upon himself to murder us and she is to be hurried out of hearing and so we are to have the blood of the roys spilt for nothingno and he shut up the book with a report and bounded to my side to beg pardon of me from his particular abuse of the margravine the iteration of certain phrases which he uttered to denounce and defy them i gathered that an interview had passed between the two and that she had notified a blockade against all letters addressed to the princess he half admitted having rushed to the palace on his road to me but richie said he pressing me again to write the moving line a letter with a broad black border addressed by me might pass he looked mournfully astute the margravine might say to herself heres doctor death in full diploma come to cure the wench of her infatuation i am but quoting the coarse old woman richie confusion on her and me for i like her it might pass in my handwriting with a smudge for paternal griefit might to her serene highness the margravine of rippau etc etc etc in trust for the most exalted the princess of eppenwelzensarkeld i transpose or omit a title or so aha says she theres verwirrung in roys poor head poor fellow the boy has sunk to a certainty here to the princess it seems my dear this is for you pray do not communicate the contents for a day or so or a month his imitation of the margravine was the pleasantest thing i heard from him the princesss maid and confidante he regretted to state was incorruptible which i knew that line of ottilias writing violets are over read by me in view of the rootmountain of the royal house of princes scoffed at me insufferably whenever my father showed me these openings of his mind until i was dragged down to think almost that i had not loved the woman and noble soul but only the glorified princessthe carved gilt frame instead of the divine portrait a shameful acrid suspicion ransacking my conscience with the thrusting in of a foul torch here and there for why had i shunned him of late how was it that he tortured me now did i in no degree participate in the poignant savour of his scheme such questionings set me flushing in deadly chills my brain was weak my heart exhausted my body seemed truthful perforce and confessed on the rack i could not deny that i had partly insensibly clung to the vain glitter of hereditary distinction my fathers pitfall taking it for a substantial foothold when a young man of wit and sensibility and mark you true pride would have made it his first care to trample that under heel excellent is pride but oh be sure of its foundations before you go on building monument high i know nothing to equal the anguish of an examination of the basis of ones pride that discovers it not solidly fixed an imposing selfimposing structure piled upon empty cellarage it will inevitably like a tree striking bad soil betray itself at the top with time and the anguish i speak of will be the sole healthy sign about you whether in the middle of life it is adviseable to descend the pedestal altogether i dare not say few take the precaution to build a flight of steps insideit is not a labour to be proud of fewer like to let themselves down in the public eyeit amounts to a castigation you must i fear remain up there and accept your chance in toppling over but in any case delude yourself as you please your lofty baldness will assuredly be seen with time meanwhile you cannot escape the internal intimations of your unsoundness a mans pride is the front and headpiece of his character his souls support or snare look to it in youth i have to thank the interminable hours on my wretched sickbed for a singularly beneficial investigation of the ledger of my deeds and omissions and moral stock perhaps it has already struck you that one who takes the trouble to sit and write his history for as large a world as he can obtain and shape his style to harmonize with every development of his nature can no longer have much of the hard grain of pride in him a proud puppetshowman blowing into pandaean pipes is an inconceivable object except to those who judge of characteristics from posture it began to be observed by others that my father was not the most comforting of nurses to me my landlady brought a young girl up to my room and introduced her under the name of lieschen saying that she had for a long time been interested in me and had been diligent in calling to inquire for news of my condition commanded to speak for herself this lieschen coloured and said demurely i am in service here sir among goodhearted people who will give me liberty to watch by you for three hours of the afternoon and three of the early part of the night if you will honour me my father took her shoulder between finger and thumb and slightly shook her to each ejaculation of his emphatic no no no no what a young maiden nurse to a convalescent young gentleman why goodness gracious me eh she looked at me softly and i said i wished her to come my father appealed to the sagacity of the matron so jealous was he of a suggested partner in his task that he had refused my earnest requests to have mr peterborough to share the hours of watching by my side the visits of college friends and acquaintances were cut very short he soon reduced them to talk in a hush with thumbs and nods and eyebrows and if it had not been so annoying to me i could have laughed at his method of accustoming the regular visitors to make ready immediately after greeting for his affectionate dismissal of them lieschen went away with the mute blessing of his finger on one of her modest dimples but to his amazement she returned in the evening he gave her a lecture to which she listened attentively and came again in the morning he was petrified idiots insects women and the salt sea ocean said he to indicate a list of the untameables without distressing the one present and acknowledging himself beaten he ruefully accepted his holiday the girl was like sweet spring in my room she spoke of sarkeld familiarly she was born in that neighbourhood she informed me and had been educated by a dear great lady her smile of pleasure on entering the room one morning and seeing me dressed and sitting in a grandfatherly chair by the breezy window was like a salutation of returning health my father made another stand against the usurper of his privileges he refused to go out then must i go said lieschen for two are not allowed here no dont leave me i begged of her and stretched out my hands for hers while she gazed sadly from the doorway he suspected some foolishness or he was actually jealous humoh he went forth with a murmured groan she deceived me by taking her seat in perfect repose after smoothing her apron now i must go she said what to leave me here alone she looked at the clock and leaned out of the window not alone oh not alone the girl exclaimed and please please do not mention mepresently hark do you hear wheels your heart must not beat now farewell you will not be alone at least so i think see what i wear dear mr patient she drew from her bosom attached to a piece of blue ribbon the half of an english shilling kissed it and blew a soft farewell to me she had not been long gone when the princess ottilia stood in her place a shilling tossed by an english boy to a couple of little foreign girls in a woodmans hutyou would not expect it to withstand the common fate of silver coins and preserve mysterious virtues by living celibate neither multiplying nor reduced ultimately to play the part of a powerful magician in bringing the boy grown man to the feet of an illustrious lady and her to his side in sickness treasonably to the laws of her station the little women quarrelled over it and snatched and hid and contemplated it in secret each in her turn until the strife it engendered was put an end to by a doughty smith their mothers brother who divided it into equal halves through which he drove a hole and the pieces being now thrown out of the currency each one wore her share of it in her bosom from that time proudly appeased they were not ordinary peasant children and happily for them they had another friend that was not a bird of passage and was endowed by nature and position to do the work of an angel she had them educated to read write and knit and learn pretty manners and in good season she took one of the sisters to wait on her own person the second went upon her recommendation into the household of a professor of a neighbouring university but neither of them abjured her superstitious belief in the proved merits of the talisman she wore so when they saw the careless giver again they remembered him their gratitude was as fresh as on that romantic morning of their childhood and they resolved without concert to serve him after their own fashion and quickly spied a way to it they were german girls you are now enabled to guess more than was known to ottilia and me of the curious agency at work to shuffle us together the doors of her suite in the palace were barred against letters addressed to the princess the delivery of letters to her was interdicted she consenting yet she found one it lay on the broad walk of the orangetrees between the pleasure and the fruitgardens as if dropped by a falcon in mid air ottilia beheld it and started her little maid walking close by exclaimed scuttling round in front of her the while like an urchin in sabots ha what is it a snake let me let me the guileless mistress replied a letter whereupon the maid said not a window near and no wall neither why dearest princess we have walked up and down here a dozen times and not seen it staring at us oh my good heaven the letter was seized and opened and ottilia read he who loves you with his heart has been cruelly used they have shot him he is not dead he must not die he is where he has studied since long he has his medicine and doctors and they say the bullet did not lodge he has not the sight that cures now is he the strong young man laid helpless at anybodys mercy she supped at her fathers table and amused the margravine and him alternately with cards and a sonata before twelve at midnight she was driving on the road to the university saying farewell to what her mind reverenced so that her lover might but have sight of her she imagined i had been assassinated for a long time and most pertinaciously this idea dwelt with her i could not dispossess her of it even after uttering the word duel i know not how often i had flatly to relate the whole of the circumstances but otto is no assassin she cried out what was that she reverenced it was what she jeopardizedher state her rank her dignity as princess and daughter of an ancient house things typical to her of sovereign duties and the high seclusion of her name to her the escapades of foolish damsels were abominable the laws of society as well as of her exalted station were in harmony with her intelligence she thought them good but obeyed them as a subject not slavishly she claimed the right to exercise her trained reason the modestest humblest sweetest of women undervaluing nothing that she possessed least of all what was due from her to others she could go whithersoever her reason directed her putting anything aside to act justly according to her light nor would she have had cause to repent had i been the man she held me to be even with me she had not behaved precipitately my course of probation was severe and long before she allowed her heart to speak pale from a sleepless night and her hearts weariful eagerness to be near me she sat by my chair holding my hand and sometimes looking into my eyes to find the life reflecting hers as in a sunken well that has once been a spring my books and poor bachelor comforts caught her attention betweenwhiles we talked of the day of storm by the lake we read the unsigned letter with her hand in mine i slept some minutes and awoke grasping it doubting and terrified so great a wave of life lifted me up no you are not gone i sighed only come said she the nature of the step she had taken began to dawn on me but when they miss you at the palace prince ernest hush they have missed me already it is done she said it smiling ottilia will he take you away us dear us can you meet his anger our aunt will be the executioner we have a day of sweet hours before she can arrive may i see her first we will both see her as we are now we must have prompt answers for the margravine none harry i do not defend myself ever distant hills and folds of receding clouds and skies beyond them were visible from my window and beyond the skies i felt her soul ottilia you were going to italy yes or whither they please for as long as they please i wished once to go i have told you why one of the series she touched the letter lying on a readingtable beside her turned the channel of all wishes and intentions my friends left me to fall at the mercy of this one i consented to the injunction that i should neither write nor receive letters do i argue ill in saying that a trust was implied surely it was a breach of the trust to keep me ignorant of the danger of him i love now they know it i dared not consult themnot my dear father about any design of mine when i had read this odd copybook writing all in brief sentences each beginning he and he it struck me like thrusts of a sword it illuminated me like lightning that he was the heart within my heart the writer must be some clever woman or simple friend who feels for us very strongly my lover assassinated where could i be but with him her little ann coming in with chocolate and strips of fine white bread to dip in it stopped my efforts to explain the distinction between an assassination and a duel i noticed then the likeness of aennchen to lieschen she has a sister here said ottilia and let her bring lieschen to visit me here this afternoon aennchen with a blush murmured that she heard and would obey i had a memorable pleasure in watching my beloved eat and drink under my roof the duel remained incomprehensible to her she first frightened me by remarking that duels were the pastime of brainless young men her next remark in answer to my repeated attempts to shield my antagonist from a capital charge but only military men and frenchmen fight duels accompanied by a slightly investigating glance of timid surprise gave me pain together with a flashing apprehension of what she had forfeited whom offended to rush to the succour of a duellist i had to repeat to her who my enemy was so that there should be no further mention of assassination prince ottos name seemed to entangle her understanding completely otto otto she murmured he has i have heard been obliged by some socalled laws of honour once or twice totohe is above suspicion of treachery to my mind it is one and the same but i would not harshly exclude the view the world puts on things and i use the worlds language in saying that he could not do a dishonourable deed how far he honours himself is a question apart that may be low enough while the world is full of a mans praises she knew the nature of a duel it is the work of soulless creatures she broke through my stammered explanations with unwonted impatience and pressing my hand ah you are safe i have you still do you know harry i am not yet able to endure accidents and misadventures i have not fortitude to meet them or intelligence to account for them they are little ironical laughter say we build so high the lightning strikes uswhy build at all the summer fly is happier if i had lost you i can almost imagine that i should have asked for revenge for why should the bravest and purest soul of my worship be snatched away i am not talking wisdom only my shaken self will speak just now i pardon otto though he has behaved basely no not basely i felt bound to plead on his behalf thinking in spite of a veritable anguish of gathering dread that she had become enlightened and would soon take the common view of our case not basely he was excessively irritated without cause in my opinion he simply misunderstood certain matters dearest you have nations fighting a war is only an exaggerated form of duelling nations at war are wild beasts she replied the passions of these hordes of men are not an example for a living soul our souls grow up to the light we must keep eye on the light and look no lower nations appear to me to have no worse than a soiled mirror of themselves in mobs they are still uncivilized they still bear a resemblance to the old monsters of the mud do you not see their claws and fangs harry do you find an apology in their acts for intemperate conduct men who fight duels appear in my sight no nobler than the first desperate creatures spelling the cruel a b c of the passions no nor in mine i assented hastily we are not perfect but hear me yes the passions are cruel circumstances howeveri mean there are social usagesay if one were always looking up but should we not be gentle with our comparisons if we would have our views in proportion she hung studiously silent and i pursued i trust you so much as my helper and my friend that i tell you what we do not usually tell to womenthe facts and the names connected with them sooner or later you would have learnt everything beloved i do not wait to let you hear it by degrees to be reconciled to it piecemeal and i forgive him she sighed i scarcely bring myself to believe that harry has bled from ottos hand it was the accident of the case ottilia we had to meet to meet there are circumstances when men will not accept apologies theyweheaven knows i was ready to do all that a man could do to avoid this follywickedness give it the worst of titles it did not occur accidentally she inquired her voice sounded strange half withheld in the utterance it occurred said i feeling my strength ebb and despair set in it occurredthe prince compelled me to the meet him but my cousin otto is no assassin compelled i say that is he conceived i had injured him and left me no other way of making amends her defence of otto was in reality the vehement cherishing of her idea of me this caused her bewilderment and like a barrier to the flowing of her mind it resisted and resisted she could not suffer herself to realize that i was one of the brainless young savages creatures with claws and fangs her face was unchanged to me the homeliness of her large mild eyes embraced me unshadowed and took me to its inner fire unreservedly leaning in my roomy chair i contemplated her at leisure while my heart kept saying mine mine to awaken an active belief in its possession her face was like the quiet morning of a winter day when cloud and sun intermix and make an ardent silver with lights of blue and faint fresh rose and over them the beautiful fold of her full eyebrow on the eyelid like a bending upper heaven those winter mornings are divine they move on noiselessly the earth is still as if awaiting a wren warbles and flits through the lank drenched brambles hillside opens green elsewhere is mist everywhere expectancy they bear the veiled sun like a sangreal aloft to the wavy marble flooring of stainless cloud she was as fair gazing across her shoulders gentle depression i could have desired to have the couchant brow and round cheek and rounding chin no more than a young mans dream of woman a picture alive without the animating individual awful mind to judge of me by my acts i chafed at the thought that one so young and lovely should meditate on human affairs at all she was of an age to be maidenly romantic our situation favoured it but she turned to me and i was glad of the eyes i knew she kissed me on the forehead sleep she whispered i feigned sleep to catch my happiness about me some disenchanting thunder was coming i was sure and i was right my father entered princess he did amazed and delighted homage and forthwith uncontrollably poured out the history of my heroism a hundred words for onemy promptitude in picking the princes glove up on my swords point my fine play with the steel my scornful magnanimity the admiration of my fellowstudentsevery line of it in stupendous language an artillery celebration of victory i tried to stop him ottilia rose continually assenting with short affirmatives to his glorifying interrogationsa method he had of recapitulating the main points she glanced to right and left as if she felt caged is it known i heard her ask in the half audible strange voice which had previously made me tremble known i certify to you princessthe unhappy man spouted his withering fountain of interjections over us anew known in every court and garrison of germany known by this time in old england and what was more the correct version of it was known it was known that the young englishman had vanquished his adversary with the small sword and had allowed him because he had raged demoniacally on account of his lamed limb to have a shot in revenge the honour done me by the princess in visiting me is not to be known i summoned energy enough to say she shook her head my father pledged himself to the hottest secresy equivalent to a calm denial of the fact if necessary pray be at no trouble she addressed him the where am i look was painful in her aspect it led me to perceive the difference of her published position in visiting a duellist lover instead of one assassinated in the latter case the rashness of an hereditary virgin princess avowing her attachment might pass condoned or cloaked by general compassion how stood it in the former i had dragged her down to the duellists level and as she was not of a nature to practise concealments and scorned to sanction them she was condemned seeing that concealment as far as possible was imperative to suffer bitterly in her own esteem this the cruellest was the least of the evils to keep our names disjoined was hopeless my weakened frame and mental misery coined tears when thoughts were needed presently i found the room empty of our poor unconscious tormentor ottilia had fastened her hand to mine again be generous i surprised her by saying go back at once i have seen you let my father escort you the road you will meet the margravine or some one i think with you it will be the margravine and my father puts her in good humour pardon a wretched little scheme to save you from annoyance so thus you return within a day and the margravine shelters you your name will not be spoken but go at once for the sake of prince ernest i have hurt him already help me to avoid doing him a mortal injury it was schwartz who drove you our old schwartz old warhead you see we may be safe only every fresh minute adds to the danger and another reason for goinganother ah she breathed my harry will talk himself into a fever i shall have it if the margravine comes here she shall not be admitted or if i hear her or hear that she has come consent at once and revive me oh i am begging you to leave me and wishing it with all my soul think over what i have done do not write to me i shall see the compulsion of mere kindness between the lines you consent your wisdom i never doubti doubt my own when it is yours you would persuade me to confide in said she with some sorrowful archness wits clear as hers could see that i had advised well except in proposing my father for escort it was evidently better that she should go as she came i refrained from asking her what she thought of me now suing for immediate pardon would have been like the applying of a lancet to a vein for blood it would have burst forth meaning mere words coloured by commiseration kindness desperate affection anything but her souls survey of herself and me and though i yearned for the comfort passion could give me i knew the mind i was dealing with or rather i knew i was dealing with a mind and i kept my tongue silent the talk between us was of the possible date of my recovery the hour of her return to the palace the writer of the unsigned letters books we had read apart or peeped into together she was a little quicker in speech less meditative my sensitive watchfulness caught no other indication of a change my father drove away an hour in advance of the princess to encounter the margravine by said he rehearsing his exclamation of astonishment and delight at meeting her by the most miraculous piece of good fortune conceivable dear madam and now comes the question since you have condescended to notice a solitary atom of your acquaintance on the public highroad whether i am to have the honour of doubling the freight of your carriage or you will deign to embark in mine but the direction of the horses heads must be reversed absolutely it must if your highness would repose in a bed tonight good so and now at a conversational trot we may happen to be overtaken by acquaintances i had no doubt of his drawing on his rarelyabandoned sevenleague boots of jargon once so delicious to me for the margravines entertainment his lack of discernment in treating the princess to it ruined my patience the sisters aennchen and lieschen presented themselves a few minutes before his departure lieschen dropped at her feet my child said the princess quite maternally could you be quit of your service with the mahrlens for two weeks think you to do duty here the professor grants her six hours out of the twentyfour already said i to go where she asked alarmed to come here here she knows you she did not curtsey to you nurses do not usually do that the appearance of both girls was pitiable but having no suspicion of the cause for it i superadded she was here this morning ah we owe her more than we were aware of the princess looked on her kindly though with suspense in the expression she told me of my approaching visitor i said oh not told lieschen burst out did youthe princess questioned her and murmured to me these children cannot speak falsehoods they shone miserably under the burden of uprightness did you make sure that i should come lieschen thoughtshe supposed but why why did she think and suppose what made her anticipate the princesss arrival this inveterate why communicated its terrors to aennchen upon whom the princess turned scrutinizing eyes saying you write of me to your sister yes princess and she to you lieschen answered forgive me your highness dearest lady you offered yourself here unasked yes princess have you written to others besides your sister seldom princess i do not remember you know the obligation of signatures to letters ah you have been remiss in not writing to me child oh princess i did not dare to you have not written to me ah princess how dared i are you speaking truthfully the unhappy girls stood trembling ottilia spared them the leap into the gulfs of confession her intuitive glance assisted by a combination of minor facts had read the story of their misdeeds in a minute she sent them down to the carriage suffering her culprits to kiss her fingers while she said to one this might be a fable of a pair of mice when she was gone after many fits of musing the signification of it was revealed to my slower brain i felt that it could not but be an additional shock to the regal pride of such a woman that these little maidens should have been permitted to act forcibly on her destiny the mystery of the letters was easily explained as soon as a direct suspicion fell on one of the girls who lived in my neighbourhood and the other who was near the princesss person doubtless the revelation of their effective mouse plot had its humiliating bitterness for her on a day of heavy oppression smile at it as she subsequently might the torture of heart with which i twisted the meaning of her words about the pair of mice to imply that the pair had conspired to make a net for an eagle and had enmeshed her may have struck a vein of the truth i could see no other antithesis to the laudable performance of the single mouse of fable lieschen when she next appeared in the character of nurse met my inquiries by supplicating me to imitate her sisters generous mistress and be merciful she remarked byandby of her own accord princess ottilia does not regret that she had us educated a tender warmth crept round me in thinking that a mind thus lofty would surely be however severe in its insight above regrets and recantations chapter xxxiv i gain a perception of princely state i had a visit from prince ernest nominally one of congratulation on my escape i was never in my life so much at any mans mercy he might have fevered me to death with reproaches and i expected them on hearing his name pronounced at the door i had forgotten the ways of the world for some minutes i listened guardedly to his affable talk my thanks for the honour done me were awkward as if they came upon reflection the prince was particularly civil and cheerful his relative he said had written of me in high termsthe very highest declaring that i was blameless in the matter and that though he had sent the horse back to my stables he fully believed in the fine qualities of the animal and acknowledged his fault in making it a cause of provocation to all of which i assented with easy nods your shakespeare i think said the prince has a scene of young frenchmen praising their horses i myself am no stranger to the enthusiasm one could not stake life and honour on a nobler brute pardon me if i state my opinion that you young englishmen of today are sometimes rather overbearing in your assumption of a superior knowledge of horseflesh we germans in the baltic provinces and in the austrian cavalry think we have a right to a remark or two and if we have not suborned the testimony of modern history the value of our hanoverian troopers is not unknown to one at least of your generals however the odds are that you were right and otto wrong and he certainly put himself in the wrong to defend his ground i begged him to pass a lenient sentence upon fiery youth he assured me that he remembered his own our interchange of courtesies was cordially commonplace we walked as it were arminarm on thin ice rivalling one anothers gentlemanly composure satisfied with my discretion the prince invited me to the lakepalace and then a weeks shooting in styria to recruit i thanked him in as clear a voice as i could command your highness the mine flourishes i trust it does i think i may say it does he replied there is always the want of capital what can be accomplished in the present state of affairs your father performs on the whole well you smilebut i mean extraordinarily well he has with an accountant at his elbow really the genius of management he serves me busily and i repeat well a better employment for him than the direction of court theatricals undoubtedly it is or than bestriding a bronze horse personifying my good ancestor are you acquainted with the chancellor von redwitz all i know of him sir is that he is fortunate to enjoy the particular confidence of his master he has a long head but now he is a disappointing man in action responsibility overturns him he is the reverse of roy whose advice i do not take though im glad to set him running von redwitz is in the town he shall call on you and amuse an hour or so of your convalescence i confessed that i began to feel longings for society prince ernest was kind enough to quit me without unmasking i had not to learn that the simplest visits and observations of ruling princes signify more than lies on the surface interests so highly personal as theirs demand from them a decent insincerity chancellor von redwitz called on me and amused me with secret anecdotes of all the royal houses of germany amusing chiefly through the veneration he still entertained for them the grave senior was doing his utmost to divert one of my years the immoralities of blue blood like the amours of the gods were to his mind tolerable if not beneficial to mankind and he presumed i should find them toothsome nay he besought me to coincide in his excuses of a widely charming young archduchess for whom no estimable husband of a fitting rank could anywhere be discovered so she had to be bestowed upon an archducal imbecile and henceand henceoh certainly generous youth and benevolent age joined hands of exoneration over her the princess of satteberg actually married under covert a colonel of uhlans at the age of seventeen the marriage was quashed the colonel vanished the princess became the scandalous duchess of ilmilm and was surprised one infamous night in the outer court of the castle by a soldier on guard who dragged her into the guardroom and unveiled her there and would have been summarily shot for his pains but for the locket on his breast which proved him to be his sovereigns sona perfect romance mr chancellor we will say the soldier son loved a delicate young countess in attendance on the duchess the countess spies the locket takes it to the duchess is reprimanded when behold the locket opens and colonel von bein appears as in his blooming youth in lancer uniformyoung sir your piece of romance has exaggerated history to caricature romances are the destruction of human interest the moment you begin to move the individuals they are puppets nothing but poetry and i say it who do not read itchancellor von redwitz is the speaker nothing but poetry makes romances passable for poetry is the everlastingly and embracingly human without it your fictions are flat foolishness nonnourishing substancea species of brandy and grueldiet for craving stomachs that can support nothing solider and must have the weak stuff stiffened talking of poetry there was an independent hereditary princess of leiterstein in love with a poeta leonora destethis was no tasso nevertheless she proposed to come to nuptials good you observe i confine myself to the relation of historical circumstances in other words facts and of good or bad i know not chancellor von redwitz smoothed the black silk stocking of his crossed leg and set his bunch of seals and watchkey swinging he resumed entirely to amuse me the princess elizabeth of leiterstein promised all the qualities which the most solicitous of paternal princes could desire as a guarantee for the judicious government of the territory to be bequeathed to her at his demise but as there is no romance to be extracted from her story i may as well tell you at once that she did not espouse the poet on the contrary dear mr chancellor i am interested in the princess proceed and be as minute as you please it is but a commonplace excerpt of secret historical narrative buried among the archives of the family my good mr richmond the princess elizabeth thoughtlessly pledged her hand to the young sonneteer of course she could not fulfil her engagement why not you see you are impatient for romance young gentleman not at all mr chancellor i do but ask a question you fence your question was dictated by impatience yes for the facts and elucidations for the romance that is you wish me to depict emotions hereupon this destroyer of temper embrowned his nostrils with snuff addingi am unable to then one is not to learn why the princess could not fulfil her engagement judged from the point of view of the pretender to the supreme honour of the splendid alliance the fault was none of hers she overlooked his humble his peculiarly dubious birth her father interposed no the family quite inefficacious to arrest her determinations what thenwhat was in her way germany what great germany young gentleman i should have premised that besides mental she had eminent moral dispositionsi might term it the conscience of her illustrious rank she would have raised the poet to equal rank beside her had she possessed the power she could and did defy the family and subdue her worshipping father the most noble prince to a form of paralysis of acquiescenceif i make myself understood but she was unsuccessful in her application for the sanction of the diet the diet the german diet have you not lived among us long enough to know that the german diet is the seat of domestic legislation for the princely houses of germany a prince or a princess may say i will this or that the diet says thou shalt not preeminently thou shalt not mix thy blood with that of an impure race nor with blood of inferiors hence we have it what we see it a translucent flood down from the topmost founts of time so we revere it qua man and woman the diet says by implication do as you like marry in the ditches spawn plentifully qua prince and princess no your nuptials are nought or would you maintain them a legal ceremony and be bound by them you descend you go forth you are no reigning sovereign you are a private person his serene highness the prince was thus prohibited from affording help to his daughter the princess was reduced to the decision either that she the sole child born of him in legal wedlock would render him qua prince childless or that she wouldin short would have her womans way the sovereignty of leiterstein continued uninterruptedly with the elder branch she was a true princess a true woman said i thinking the sneer weighty the chancellor begged me to recollect that he had warned me there was no romance to be expected i bowed and bowed during the remainder of the interview chancellor von redwitz had performed his mission the hours of my convalescence were furnished with food for amusement sufficient to sustain a years blockade i had no further longing for society but i craved for fresh air intensely did ottilia know that this iron law enforced with the might of a whole empire environed her held her fast from any motion of heart and will i could not get to mind that the prince had hinted at the existence of such a law yet why should he have done so the word impossible in which he had not been sparing when he deigned to speak distinctly comprised everything more profitable than shooting empty questions at the sky was the speculation on his project in receiving me at the palace and that was dark my father who might now have helped me was off on duty again i found myself driving into sarkeld with a sense of a whirlwind round my head wheels in multitudes were spinning inside striking sparks for thoughts i met an orderly in hussar uniform of blue and silver trotting on his errand there he was and whether many were behind him or he stood for the army in its might he wore the trappings of an old princely house that nestled proudly in the bosom of its great jealous fatherland previously in sarkeld i had noticed members of the diminutive army to smile down on them i saw the princely arms and colours on various houses and in the windows of shops emblems of a small state they belonged to the history of the empire the courtphysician passed with a bit of ribbon in his buttonhole a lady driving in an open carriage encouraged me to salute her she was the wife of the princes minister of justice upon what foundation had i been building a reflection of the ideas possessing me showed riversley my undecorated home of rough red brick in the middle of barren heaths i entered the palace i sent my respects to the prince in return the hour of dinner was ceremoniously named to me ceremony damped the air i had been insensible to it before or so i thought the weight was now so crushing arms emblems colours liveries portraits of princes and princesses of the house of this the warrior that the seductress burst into sudden light what had i to do among them the presence of the living members of the family was an extreme physical relief for the moment beholding ottilia i counted her but as one of them she welcomed me without restraint we chattered pleasantly at the dinnertable ah you missed our french troupe said the margravine yes said i resigning them to her she nodded and one very pretty little woman they had i can tell youfor a frenchwoman you thought her pretty frenchwomen know what to do with their brains and their pins somebody has said and exceedingly well said too where is that man roy good things always remind me of him the question was addressed to no one in particular the man happened to be my father i remembered a second allusion to him was answered by prince ernest roy is off to croatia to enrol some dozens of cheap workmen the strength of those croats is prodigious and well looked after they work he will be back in three or four or more days you have spoilt a good man rejoined the margravine and that reminds me of a bad onea cutthroat have you heard of that creature the princesss tutor happily cut loose from us though he has published a booka horror all against scripture and divine right is there any one to defend him now i should like to ask i said ottilia gracious me you have not read the book right through dear aunt with all respect to you its in the house it is in my study then i dont wonder i dont wonder the margravine exclaimed best hear what the enemy has to say prince ernest observed excellently argued papa supposing that he be an enemy an enemy as much as the fox is the enemy of the poultryyard and the hound is the enemy of the fox said the margravine i take your illustration auntie said ottilia he is the enemy of chickens and only does not run before the numbers who bark at him my noble old professor is a resolute truthseeker he raises a light to show you the ground you walk on how is it that you adoring heroes as you do cannot admire him when he stands alone to support his view of the truth i would i were by him but i am whenever i hear him abused i daresay you discard nothing that the wretch has taught you nothing nothing said ottilia and made my heart live the grim and taciturn baroness turckems sitting opposite to her sighed audibly has the princess been trying to convert you the margravine asked her trying no madam reading yes my good turckems you do not get your share of sleep it is her highness the princess who despises sleep see there the way with your freethinkers they commence by treading under foot the pleasantest half of life and then they impose their bad habits on their victims ottilia ernest i do insist upon having lights extinguished in the childs apartments by twelve oclock at midnight twelve oclock is an extraordinary latitude for children said ottilia smiling the prince with a scarce perceptible degree of emphasis said women born to rule must be held exempt from nursery restrictions here the conversation opened to let me in more than once the margravine informed me that i was not the equal of my father why said she why cant you undertake this detestable coalmine and let your father disport himself i suggested that it might be because i was not his equal she complimented me for inheriting a spark of roys brilliancy i fancied there was a conspiracy to force me back from my pretensions by subjecting me to the contemplation of my bare self and actual condition had there been i should have suffered from less measured strokes the unconcerted design to humiliate inferiors is commonly successfuller than conspiracy the prince invited me to smoke with him and talked of our gradual subsidence in england to one broad level of rank through the intermixture by marriage of our aristocracy squirearchy and merchants here it is not so he said and no democratic rageings will make it so rank with us is a principle i suppose you have not read the professors book it is powerfulhe is a powerful man it can do no damage to the minds of persons destined by birth to wield authoritynone therefore to the princess i would say to youavoid it for those who have to carve their way it is bad you will enter your parliament of course there you have a fine career he asked me what i had made of chancellor von redwitz i perceived that prince ernest could be cool and sagacious in repairing what his imprudence or blindness had left to occur that he must have enlightened his daughter as to her actual position and was most dexterously and devilishly flattering her worldly good sense by letting it struggle and grow instead of opposing her his appreciation of her intellect was an idolatry he really confided in it i knew and this reacted upon her did it my hesitations and doubts my fantastic raptures and despair my loss of the power to appreciate anything at its right value revealed the madness of loving a princess there were preparations for the arrival of an important visitor the margravine spoke of him emphatically i thought it might be her farcically pompous way of announcing my fathers return and looked pleased i suppose for she added do you know prince hermann he spends most of his time in eberhardstadt he is cousin of the king a wealthy branch tant soit peu philosophe a ce quon dit a traveller they say he has a south american complexion i knew him a boy and his passion is to put together what nature has unpieced bones of fishes and animals il faut passer le temps he adores the deluge anything antediluvian excites him he can tell us the modes of those days and if i am not very much misinformed he still expects us to show him the very latest of these happily my milliner is back from paris ay and we have fossils in our neighbourhood though on my honour i dont know wheresomewhere the princess can guide him and you can help at the excavations i am told he would go through the crust of earth for the backbone of an idioiliosomethingsaurus i scrutinized prince hermann as rarely my observation had dwelt on any man he had the german head wide so as seemingly to force out the ears honest ready interested eyes in conversation parched lips a rather tropicallycoloured skin and decidedly the manners of a gentleman to all excepting his retinue of secretaries valets and chasseurshis blacks he called them they liked him one could not help liking him you study much he addressed the princess at table she answered i throw aside books now you have come to open the earth and the sea from that time the topics started on every occasion were theirs the rest of us ran at their heels giving tongue or not to me prince hermann was perfectly courteous he had made english friends on his travels he preferred english comrades in adventure to any other thought our east indian empire the most marvellous thing the world had seen and our indian government cigars very smokeable upon acquaintance when stirred he bubbled with anecdote not been there was his reply to the margravines tentatives for gossip of this and that of the german courts his museum hunting and the opera absorbed and divided his hours i guessed his age to be mounting forty he seemed robust he ate vigorously drinking he conscientiously performed as an accompanying duty and was flushed after dinner burning for tobacco and a couch for his length then he talked of the littleness of europe and the greatness of germany logical postulates fell in collapse before him america to america north and south india to europe india was for the land with the largest seaboard mistress of the baltic of the north sea and the east as eventually she must be germany would claim to take india as a matter of course and find an outlet for the energies of the most prolific and the toughest of the races of mankindthe purest in fact the only true race properly so called out of india to which it would return as to its source and there create an empire magnificent in force and solidity the actual wedding of east and west an empire firm on the ground and in the blood of the people instead of an empire of aliens that would bear comparison to a finely fretted cottonhung palanquin balanced on an elephants back all depending on the docility of the elephant his description of great britains indian empire and mind me he said the masses of india are in character elephant all over tail to proboscis servile till they trample you and not so stupid as they look but youve done wonders in india and we cant forget it your administration of justice is worth all your battles there this was the man a milder one after the evaporation of his wine in speech and peculiarly moderate on his return exhaling sandalwood to the society of the ladies ottilia danced with prince hermann at the grand ball given in honour of him the wives and daughters of the notables present kept up a buzz of comment on his personal advantages in which i heard it said you saw his german heart though he had spent the best years of his life abroad much court was paid to him by the men sarkeld visibly expressed satisfaction one remark we shall have his museum in the town left me no doubt upon the presumed object of his visit it was uttered and responded to with a depth of sentiment that showed how lively would be the general gratitude toward one who should exhilarate the place by introducing cases of fishbones so little did he think of my presence that returning from a ride one day he seized and detained the princesss hand she frowned with pained surprise but unresistingly as became a young gentlewomans dignity her hand was rudely caught and kept in the manner of a boisterous wooera harry the fifth or lusty petruchio she pushed her horse on at a bound prince hermann rode up head to head with her gallantly having now both hands free of the reins like an indian spearing the buffaloit was buffalo courtship and his shout of rallying astonishment at her resistance what what rang wildly to heighten the scene she leaning constrained on one side and he bending half his bodys length a strange scene for me to witness they proceeded with old schwartz at their heels doglike it became a question for me whether i should follow in the bitter track and further the question whether i could let them escape from sight they wound up the roadway two figures and one following now dots against the sky now a single movement in the valley now concealed buried under billows of forest making the low noising of the leaves an intolerable whisper of secresy and forward i rushed again to see them rounding a belt of firs or shadowed by rocks solitary on shorn fields once more dipping to the forest and once more emerging vanishing when i had grown sure of their reappearance from some point of view or other i spied for them in vain my destiny whatever it might be fluttered over them to see them seemed near the knowing of it and not to see them deadly i galloped so intent on the three in the distance that i did not observe a horseman face toward me on the road it was prince hermann he raised his hat i stopped short and he spoke mr richmond permit me to apologize to you i have to congratulate you it appears i was not awarehowever the princess has done me the favour to enlighten me how you will manage i cant guess but that is not my affair i am a man of honour and on my honour i conceived that i was invited here to decide as my habit is on the spot if i would or if i would not i speak clearly to you no doubt there could be no hesitation in the mind of a man of sense my way is prompt and blunt i am sorry i gave you occasion to reflect on it there i have been deceiveddeceived myself lets say sharp methods play the devil with you now and then to speak the truthperhaps you wont care to listen to itfamily arrangements are the best take my word for it they are the best and in the case of princesses of the bloodwhy look you i happen to be suitable its a matter of chance like your height complexion constitution one is just what one is born to be eh you have your english notions i my german but as a man of the world in the bargain and gentleman i hope i should say that to take a young princesss fancy and drag her from her station is notof course you know that the actual value of the title goes if she steps down very well but enough said i thought i was in a clear field we are used to having our way cleared for us nous autres i will not detain you we saluted gravely and i rode on at a mechanical pace discerning by glimpses the purport of what i had heard without drawing warmth from it the mans outrageously royal way of wooing in contempt of minor presences and flimsy sentiment made me jealous of him notwithstanding his overthrow i was in the mood to fall entirely into my fathers hands as i did by unbosoming myself to him for the first time since my heart had been under the charm fresh from a rapid course of travel and with the sense of laying the prince under weighty obligations he made light of my perplexity and at once delivered himself bluntly she plights her hand to you in the presence of our good peterborough his plans were shaped on the spot we start for england the day after tomorrow to urge on the suit richie our peterborough is up at the chateau the frau feldmarschall honours him with a farewell invitation you have a private interview with the princess at midnight in the library where you are accustomed to read as a student of books should my boy at a touch of the bell or mere opening of the door i see that peterborough comes to you it will not be a ceremony but a binding of you both by your word of honour before a ghostly gentleman he informed me that his foresight had enlisted and detained peterborough for this particular moment and identical piece of duty which seemed possible and in a singular manner incited me to make use of peterborough for the princess still denied me the look of loves intelligence she avoided me she still kept to the riddle and my delicacy went so far that i was restrained from writing i agreed with my father that we could not remain in germany but how could i quit the field and fly to england on such terms i composed the flattest letter ever written requesting the princess to meet me about midnight in the library that i might have the satisfaction of taking my leave of her and this done my spirits rose and it struck me my father was practically wise and i looked on peterborough as an almost supernatural being if ottilia refused to come at least i should know my fate was i not bound in manly honour to be to some degree adventurous so i reasoned in exclamations being to tell truth tired of seeming to be what i was not quite of striving to become what i must have divined that i never could quite attain to so my worthier or ideal self fell away from me i was no longer devoted to be worthy of a womans love but consenting to the plot to entrap a princess i was somewhat influenced too by the consideration which i regarded as a glimpse of practical wisdom that prince ernest was guilty of cynical astuteness in retaining me as his guest under manifold disadvantages personal pride stood up in arms and my fathers exuberant spirits fanned it he dwelt loudly on his services to the prince and his own importance and my heirship to mighty riches he made me almost believe that prince ernest hesitated about rejecting me nor did it appear altogether foolish to think so or why was i at the palace i had no head for reflections my father diverted me by levelling the whole battery of his comic mind upon peterborough who had a heap of manuscript directed against heretical german theologians to pack up for publication in his more congenial country how different he ejaculated from this nestthis forest of heresy where pamphlets and critical essays were issued without let or hindrance and as far as he could see no general reprobation of the press such as would most undoubtedly with one voice hail any strange opinions in our happy land at home whether he really understood the function my father prepared him for i cannot say the invitation to dine and pass a night at the lakepalace flattered him immensely we went up to the chateau to fetch him a look of woe was on peterboroughs countenance when we descended at the palace portals he had forgotten his pipe you shall smoke one of the princes my father said peterborough remarked to mewe shall have many things to talk over in england no tobacco allowed on the premises at riversley im afraid said i he sighed and bade me jocosely to know that he regarded tobacco as just one of the consolations of exiles and bachelors peterborough my good friend you are a hero cried my father he divorces tobacco to marry permit me peterborough interposed with an ingenuous pretension to subtle waggery in itself very comicalpermit me no legitimate union has taken place between myself and tobacco he puts an end to the illegitimate union between himself and tobacco that he may marry according to form cried my father we entered the palace merrily and presently peterborough who had worn a studious forehead in the midst of his consenting laughter observed well you know there is more in that than appears on the surface his sweet simpleton air of profundity convulsed me i handed my father the letter addressed to the princess to entrust it to the charge of one of the domestics thinking carelessly at the time that ottilia now stood free to make appointments and receive communications and moreover that i was too proud to condescend to subterfuge except this minor one in consideration for her of making it appear that my father and not i was in communication with her my fit of laughter clung i dressed chuckling the margravine was not slow to notice and comment on my hilarious readiness roy she said you have given your son spirit one sees he has your blood when you have been with him an hour the season has returned if your highness will let it be spring said my father far fetchedfrom the lower danube she ejaculated in mock scorn to excite his sprightliness and they fell upon a duologue as good as wit for the occasion prince hermann had gone his departure was mentioned with the ordinary commonplaces of regret ottilia was unembarrassed both in speaking of him and looking at me we had the court physician and his wife at table chancellor von redwitz and his daughter and general happenwyll chief of the princes contingent a prussian at heart said to be a good officer on the strength of a military book of some sort that he had full leisure to compose the chancellors daughter and baroness turckems enclosed me i was questioned by the baroness as to the cause of my fathers unexpected return he is generally opportune she remarked he goes with me to england i said oh he goes said she and asked why we were honoured with the presence of mr peterborough that evening there had always been a smouldering hostility between her and my father to my surprise the baroness spoke of ottilia by her name ottilia must have mountain air these late hours destroy her complexion active exercise by day and proper fatigue by night timethat is my prescription the princess i replied envying peterborough who was placed on one side of her will benefit i am sure from mountain air does she read excessively the sea the sea i pronounce bad for herunwholesome returned the baroness it is damp i laughed damp she reiterated the vapours i am convinced affect mind and body that excursion in the yacht did her infinite mischief the mountains restored her they will again take my word for it now take you my word for it they will again she is not too strong in constitution but in order to prescribe accurately one must find out whether there is seated malady to ride out in the night instead of reposing to drive on and on and not reappear till the night of the next dayi ask you is it sensible does it not approach mania the princess said i ottilia has done that baroness can i believe youand alone a marvellous twinkle of shuffle appeared in the small slatecoloured eyes i looked at under their roofing of thick black eyebrows alone she said that is she was precautious to have her giant to protect her from violence there you have a glimmering of reason in her and all of it that i can see old schwartz is a very faithful servant said i thinking that she resembled the old warhead in visage a dogs obedience to the masters whims you call faithfulness hem the baroness coughed dryly i whispered does prince ernestis he aware you are aware retorted the baroness that what a man idolizes he wont see flaw in remember i am something here or i am nothing the enigmatical remark was received by me decorously as a piece of merited chastisement nodding with gravity i expressed regrets that the sea did not please her otherwise i could have offered her a yacht for a cruise she nodded stiffly her mouth shut up a smile showing more of the door than the ray the dinner virtually a german supper ended in general conversation on political affairs preceded and supported by a discussion between the prussianhearted general and the austrianhearted margravine prince ernest true to his view that diplomacy was the weapon of minor sovereigns held the balance with now a foot in one scale now in the other a politic proceeding so long as the rival powers passively consent to be weighed we trifled with music made our bow to the ladies and changed garments for the smokingroom prince ernest smoked his one cigar among guests the general the chancellor and the doctor knew the signal for retirement and rose simultaneously with the discharge of his cigarend in sparks on the unlit logwood pile my father and mr peterborough kept their chairs there was i felt with relief no plot for nothing had been definitely assented to by me i received prince ernests proffer of his hand on making my adieux to him with a passably clear conscience i went out to the library a man came in for orders i had none to give he saw that the shutters were fixed and the curtains down examined my handlamp and placed lamps on the readingdesk and mantelpiece bronze busts of sages became my solitary companions the room was long low and dusky voluminously and richly hung with draperies at the farther end where a table stood for the prince to jot down memoranda and a sofa to incline him to the relaxation of romancereading a door at this end led to the sleeping apartments of the west wing of the palace where i sat the student had ranges of classical volumes in prospect and classic heads no other decoration to the walls i paced to and fro and should have flung myself on the sofa but for a heap of books there covered from dust perhaps concealed that the yellow parisian volumes of which i caught sight of some new dozen might not be an attraction to the eyes of chancecomers at the lakepalace the prince frequently gave audience here he had said to me when i stated my wish to read in the library you keep to the classical department i thought it possible he might not like the coloured volumes to be inspected i had no taste for a perusal of them i picked up one that fell during my walk and flung it back and disturbed a heap under cover for more fell and there i let them lie ottilia did not keep me waiting chapter xxxv the scene in the lakepalace library i was humming the burden of gthes zigeunerlied a favourite one with me whenever i had too much to think of or nothing a low rush of sound from the halldoorway swung me on my heel and i saw her standing with a silver lamp raised in her right hand to the level of her head as if she expected to meet obscurity a thin blue indian scarf muffled her throat and shoulders her hair was loosely knotted the lamps full glow illumined and shadowed her she was like a statue of twilight i went up to her quickly and closed the door saying you have come my voice was not much above a breath she looked distrustfully down the length of the room you were speaking to some one no you were speaking to myself then i suppose i remembered and repeated the gipsy burden she smiled faintly and said it was the hour for anna and ursel and kith and liese to be out her hands were gloved a small matter to tell of we heard the porticosentinel challenged and relieved midnight i said she replied you were not definite in your directions about the minutes i feared to name midnight why lest the appointment of midnighti lose my knowledge of youshould make you reflect frighten you you see i am inventing a reason i really cannot tell why if it was not that i hoped to have just those few minutes more of you and now theyre gone i would not have asked you but that i thought you free to act i am and you come freely a therefore belongs to every grant of freedom i understand your judgement was against it be comforted she said it is your right to bid me come if you think fit one of the sofavolumes fell she caught her breath and smiled at her foolish alarm i told her that it was my intention to start for england in the morning that this was the only moment i had and would be the last interview my rights if i possessed any and i was not aware that i did i threw down you throw down one end of the chain she said in the name of heaven then cried i release yourself she shook her head that is not my meaning note the predicament of a lover who has a piece of dishonesty lurking in him my chilled selflove had certainly the right to demand the explanation of her coldness and i could very well guess that a word or two drawn from the neighbourhood of the heart would fetch a warmer current to unlock the ice between us but feeling the coldness i complained of to be probably a suspicion i fixed on the suspicion as a new and deeper injury done to my loyal love for her and armed against that i dared not take an initiative for fear of unexpectedly justifying it by betraying myself yet supposing her inclination to have become diverted i was ready frankly to release her with one squeeze of hands and take all the pain and i said pray do not speak of chains but they exist things cannot be undone for us two by words the tremble as of a strung wire in the strenuous pitch of her voice seemed to say she was not cold though her gloved hand resting its fingerends on the table her restrained attitude her very calm eyes declared the reverse this and that sensation beset me in turn we shrank oddly from uttering one anothers christian name i was the first with it my ottilia brought soon after harry on her lips and an atmosphere about us much less arctic ottilia you have told me you wish me to go to england i have we shall be friends yes harry we cannot be quite divided we have that knowledge for our present happiness the happy knowledge that we may have our bone to gnaw when foods denied it is something one would like possibly after expulsion out of eden to climb the gates to see how the trees grow there what i cannot imagine is the forecasting of any joy in the privilege by nature or system then you are more impatient than i for i can said ottilia she added so much of your character i divined early it was part of my reason for wishing you to work you will find that hard work in englandbut why should i preach to you harry you have called me here for some purpose i must have detained you already too long time is not the offender since i have come the evil evil are not your actions free patience my friend the freer my actions the more am i bound to deliberate on them i have the habit of thinking that my deliberations are not in my sexs fashion of taking counsel of the nerves and the blood in truth harry i should not have come but for my acknowledgement of your right to bid me come you know princess that in honouring me with your attachment you imperil your sovereign rank i do what next except that it is grievously in peril nothing have you known it all along dimlyscarcely to some extent i knew it but it did not stand out in broad daylight i have been learning the worlds wisdom recently would you have had me neglect it surely much is due to my father my relatives have claims on me our princely houses have my country has oh princess if you are pleading can you think that i am the splendour of her high nature burst on me with a shock i could have fallen to kiss her feet and i said indifferently not pleading only it is evident the claimsi hate myself for bringing you in antagonism with them yes and i have been learning some worldly wisdom i wish for your sake it had not been so late what made me overleap the proper estimate of your rank i cant tell but now that i know better the kind of creaturethe man who won your esteem when you knew less of the world hush i have an interest in him and do not suffer him to be spurned ottilia checked me i too know him better and still if he is dragged down i am in the dust if he is abused the shame is mine her face bloomed her sweet warmth of colour was transfused through my veins we shall part in a few minutes i have a mind to beg a gift of you name it that glove she made her hand bare and gave me not the glove but the hand ah but this i cannot keep will you have everything spoken she said in a tone that would have been reproachful had not tenderness melted it there should be a spirit between us harry to spare the task you do keep it if you choose i have some little dread of being taken for a madwoman and morean actual horror of behaving ungratefully to my generous father he has proved that he can be indulgent most trusting and considerate for his daughter though he is a prince my duty is to show him that i do not forget i am a princess i owe my rank allegiance when he forgets his on my behalf my friend you are young none but an inexperienced girl hoodwinked by her tricks of intuition would have dreamed you superior to the passions of other men i was blind i am regretfultake my word as you do my handfor no ones sake but my fathers you and i are bound fast only help me that the blow may be lighter for him if i descend from the place i was born to let me tell him it is to occupy one i am fitted for or should not at least feel my familys deep blush in filling to be in the midst of life in your foremost england is in my imagination very glorious harry i remember picturing to myself when i reflected upon your countrys historyperhaps a year after i had seen the two young english gentlemen that you touch the morning and evening star and wear them in your coronet and walk with the sun west and east childs imagery but the impression does not wear off if i rail at england it is the anger of love i fancy i have good and great things to speak to the people through you there she stopped the fervour she repressed in speech threw a glow over her face like that on a frosty bare autumn sky after sunset i pressed my lips to her hand in our silence another of the fatal yellow volumes thumped the floor she looked into my eyes and asked have we been speaking before a witness so thoroughly had she renovated me that i accused and reproved the lurking suspicion with a soft laugh beloved i wish we had been if it might be she said divining me and musing why not she stared how what do you ask the look on my face alarmed her i was breathless and colourless with the heart of a hawk eyeing his birda fox would be the truer comparison but the bird was noble not one that cowered her beauty and courage lifted me into high air in spite of myself and it was a huge weight of greed that fell away from me when i said i would not urge it for an instant considerif you had just plighted your hand in mine before a witness my hand is in yours my word to you is enough enough my thanks to heaven for it but considera pledge of fidelity that should be my secret angel about me in trouble and trial my wedded soul she cannot falter she is mine for ever she guides me holds me to work inspirits meshe is secure from temptation from threats from everythingnothing can touch nothing move her she is mine i mean an attested word a form that isa betrothal for me to saymy beloved and my betrothed you hear that beloved is a lonely wordbetrothed carries us joined up to death would youi do but ask to know that you would tomorrow i am loose in the world and theres a darkness in the thought of it almost too terrible would youone sworn word that gives me my bride let men do what they may i go then singing to battlesureremember it is but the question whether you would harry i would and will she said her lips shudderingwaitfor a cry of joy escaped mei willlook you me in the eyes and tell me you have a doubt of me i looked she swam in a mist we had our full draught of the divine selfoblivion which floated those ghosts of the two immortal lovers through the bounds of their purgatorial circle and for us to whom the minutes were ages as for them to whom all time was unmarked the power of supreme love swept out circumstance such embraces cast the soul beyond happiness into no known region of sadness but we drew apart sadly even as that involved pair of bleeding recollections looked on the life lost to them i knew well what a height she dropped from when the senses took fire she raised me to learn how little of fretful thirst and its reputed voracity remains with love when it has been met midway in air by a winged mate able to sustain unable to descend farther and it was before a witness though unviewed by us the farewell had come her voice was humbled never i said delighting in the now conscious bravery of her eyes engaging mine shadowy with the struggle i would never doubt her and i renounced all pledges to be clear in my own sight as well as in hers i made mention of the halfformed conspiracy to obtain her plighted troth in a binding manner it was not necessary for me to excuse myself she did that saying could there be a greater proof of my darlings unhappiness i am to blame we closed hands for parting she hesitated and asked if my father was awake then promptly to my answer i will see him i have treated you ill i have exacted too much patience the suspicion was owing to a warning i had this evening harry a silly warning to beware of snares and i had no fear of them believe me though for some moments and without the slightest real desire to be guarded i fancied harrys father was overhearing me he is your father dearest fetch him to me my father will hear of this from my lipswhy not he ah did i suspect you ever so little i will atone for it not atone i will make it my pleasure it is my pride that has hurt you both o my lover my lover dear head dear eyes delicate and noble that you are my own stronger soul where was my heart is it sometimes dead or sleeping but you can touch it to life look at mei am yours i consent i desire it i will see him i will be bound the heavier the chains oh the better for me what am i to be proud of anything not yours harry and i that have passed over to you i will see him at once a third in the room cried out no not thatyou do not the tongue was german and struck on us like a roll of unfriendly musketry before we perceived the enemy princess ottilia you remember your dignity or i defend you and it think of me what you will baroness turckems desperately entangled by the sofacovering rushed into the ray of the lamps and laid her hand on the bellrope in a minute we had an alarm sounding my father was among us there was a mad play of chatter and we stood in the strangest nightmarelight that ever ended an interview of lovers chapter xxxvi homeward and home again the room was in flames baroness turckems plucking at the bellrope my father looking big and brilliant hold hand he shouted to the frenzied baroness she countershouted both of them stamped feet the portico sentinel struck the butt of his musket on the halldoors bell answered bell along the upper galleries foolish woman be silent cried my father incendiary she halfshrieked he turned to the princess begging her to retire but she stared at him and i too after having seen him deliberately apply the flame of her lamp to the curtains deemed him mad he was perfectly selfpossessed and said this will explain the bell and fetched a deep breath and again urged the princess to retire peterborough was the only one present who bethought him of doing firemans duty the risk looked greater than it was he had but to tear the lighted curtains down and trample on them suddenly the baroness called out the man is right come with me princess escape your highness escape and you she addressed meyou rang the bell you to repair your error baroness said my father i have my conscience pure have you she retorted he bowed and said the fire will also excuse your presence on the spot baroness i thank my god i am not so cool as you said she your warmthhe bent to hershall always be your apology baroness seeing the curtains extinguished ottilia withdrew she gave me no glance all this occurred before the nightporter who was going his rounds could reach the library lacqueys and maids were soon at his heels my father met prince ernest with a florid story of a reckless student either asleep or too anxious to secure a particular volume and showed his usual consideration by not asking me to verify the narrative with that and with high praise of peterborough as to whose gallantry i heard him deliver a very circumstantial account he i suppose satisfied the princes curiosity and appeased him the damage being small compared with the uproar prince ernest questioned two or three times what set him ringing so furiously my father made some reply ottilias cloudpale windows were the sole greeting i had from her on my departure early next morning far wretcheder than if i had encountered a misfortune it was impossible for me to deny that my father had shielded the princess she would never have run for a menace as he remarked the ringing of the bell would not of itself have forced her to retreat and the nature of the baronesss alarm demanded nothing less than a conflagration to account for it to the household but i felt humiliated on ottilias behalf and enraged on my own and i had i must confess a touch of fear of a man who could unhesitatingly go to extremities as he had done by summoning fire to the rescue he assured me that moments such as those inspired him and were the pride of his life and he was convinced that upon reflection i should rise to his pitch he deluded himself with the idea of his having foiled baroness turckems nor did i choose to contest it though it struck me that she was too conclusively the foiler she must have intercepted the letter for the princess i remembered acting carelessly in handing it to my father for him to consign it to one of the domestics and he passed it on with a flourish her place of concealment was singularly well selected under the sofacover and the little heaps of paperbound volumes i do not fancy she meant to rouse the household her notion probably was to terrorize the princess that she might compel her to quit my presence in rushing to the bellrope her impetuosity sent her stumbling on it with force and while threatening to ring and meaning merely to threaten she rang and as it was not a retractable act she continued ringing and the more violently upon my fathers appearance catching sight of peterborough at his heels she screamed a word equivalent to a clergyman she had lost her discretion but not her wits for any one save a loverthwarted as i was and perturbed by the shadow falling on the princessmy fathers aplomb and promptness in conjuring a check to what he assumed to be a premeditated piece of villany on the part of baroness turckems might have seemed tolerably worthy of admiration me the whole scene affected as if it had burnt my skin i loathed that picture of him constantly present to me of his shivering the glass of ottilias semiclassical nightlamp gravely asking her pardon and stretching the flame to the curtain with large eyes blazing on the baroness the stupid burlesque majesty of it was unendurable to thought nevertheless i had to thank him for shielding ottilia and i had to brood on the fact that i had drawn her into a situation requiring such a shield he meanwhile according to his habit was engaged in reviewing the triumphs to come we have won a princess and what england would say how england would look when on a further journey i brought my princess home entirely occupied his imagination to my excessive torturea state of mind for which it was impossible to ask his mercy his sole link with the past appeared to be this notion that he had planned all the good things in store for us consequently i was condemned to hear of the success of the plot untilfor i had not the best of consciencesi felt my hand would be spellbound in the attempt to write to the princess and with that sense of incapacity i seemed to be cut loose from her drifting back into the desolate days before i saw her wheeled in her invalid chair along the sands and my life knew sunrise but whatever the mood of our affections so it is with us island wanderers we cannot gaze over at england knowing the old country to be close under the sealine and not hail it and partly forget ourselves in the time that was the smell of seaair made me long for the white cliffs the sight of the white cliffs revived pleasant thoughts of riversley and thoughts of riversley thoughts of janet which were singularly and refreshingly free from selfaccusations some love for my home similar to what one may have for winter came across me and some appreciation of janet as well in whose society was sure to be at least myself a creature much reduced in altitude but without the cramped sensations of a man on a monument my hearty janet i thanked her then for seeing me of my natural height some hours after parting with my father in london i lay down to sleep in my old home feeling as if i had thrown off a coat of armour i awoke with a sailors song on my lips looking out of window at the wellknown features of the heaths and dark firs and waning oak copses and the shadowy line of the downs stretching their long whale backs south to west it struck me that i had been barely alive of late indeed one who consents to live as i had done in a hope and a retrospect will find his life slipping between the two like the ships under the striding colossus i shook myself braced myself and saluted every one at the breakfast table with the frankness of harry richmond congratulated on my splendid spirits i was confirmed in the idea that i enjoyed them though i knew of something hollow which sent an echo through me at intervals janet had become a fixed inmate of the house ive bought her and i shall keep her shes the apple of my eye said the squire adding with characteristic scrupulousness if apples female i asked her whether she had heard from temple latterly no dear little fellow cried she and i saw in a twinkling what it was that the squire liked in her and liked it too i caught sight of myself as through a rift of cloud trotting home from the hunt to a glad frank unpretending mate with just enough of understanding to look up to mine for a second or so it was pleasing as a glance out of his library across hill and dale will be to a strained student our familiarity sanctioned a comment on the growth of her daughteroftheregiment moustache the faintest conceivable suggestion of a shadow on her soft upper lip which a poet might have feigned to have fallen from her dark thick eyebrows why you dont mean to say hal its not to your taste said the squire no said i turning an eye on my aunt dorothy ive loved it all my life the squire stared at me to make sure of this muttered that it was to his mind a beauty and that it was nothing more on janets lip than down on a flower bloom on a plum the poetical comparisons had the effect of causing me to examine her critically she did not raise a spark of poetical sentiment in my bosom she had grown a tall young woman firmly built light of motion graceful perhaps but it was not the grace of grace the grace of simplicity rather she talked vivaciously and frankly and gave to friends her whole eyes and a fine animation in talking and her voice was a delight to friends there was always the full ring of janet in it and music also she still lifted her lip when she expressed contempt or dislike of persons nor was she cured of her trick of frowning she was as ready as ever to be flattered that was evident my grandfathers praise of her she received with a rewarding look back of kindness she was not discomposed by flattery and threw herself into no postures nor blushed very deeply thank you for perceiving my merits she seemed to say and to be just i should add that one could fancy her saying you see them because you love me she wore her hair in a plain knot peculiarly neatly rounded away from the temples which sometimes gave to a face not aquiline a look of swiftness the face was mobile various not at all suggestive of bad temper in spite of her frowns the profile of it was less assuring than the front because of the dark eyebrows extension and the occasional frown but that was not shared by the mouth which was i admitted to myself a charming bow running to a length at the corners like her eyebrows quick with smiles the corners of the mouth would often be in movement setting dimples at work in her cheek while the brows remained fixed and thus at times a tender meditative air was given her that i could not think her own upon what could she possibly reflect she had not a care she had no education she could hardly boast an ideatwo at a time i was sure she never had entertained the sort of wife for a foxhunting lord i summed up and hoped he would be a good fellow peterborough was plied by the squire for a description of german women blushing and shooting a timid look from under his pendulous eyelids at my aunt indicating that he was prepared to go the way of tutors at riversley he said he really had not much observed them theyre a whiteybrown sort of women arent they the squire questioned him with tow hair and fish eyes high o the shoulder bony and a towel skin and gone teeth so ive heard tell ive heard thats why the men have all taken to their beastly smoking peterborough ejaculated indeed sir really he assured my aunt that german ladies were most agreeable cultivated persons extremely domesticated retiring the encomiums of the roman historian were as well deserved by them in the present day as they had been in the past decidedly on the whole peterborough would call them a virtuous race why do they let the men smoke then said the squire a pretty style o courtship come sit by my hearth maam ill be your chimneyfaugh dirty rascals janet said i rather like the smell of cigars like what you please my dearhell be a lucky dog the squire approved her promptly and asked me if i smoked i was not a stranger to the act i confessed wellhe took refuge in practical philosophya man must bring some dirt home from every journey only dont smoke me out mercys sake here was a hint of janets influence with him and of what he expected from my return to riversley peterborough informed me that he suffered persecution over the last glasses of port in the evening through the squires persistent inquiries as to whether a woman had anything to do with my staying so long abroad a lady sir quoth peterborough lady if you like rejoined the squire you parsons and petticoats must always mince the meat to hash the fact peterborough defended his young friend harrys moral reputation and was amazed to hear that the squire did not think highly of a mans chastity the squire acutely chagrined the sensitive gentleman by drawling the word after him and declaring that he tossed that kind of thing into the womens washbasket peterborough not without signs of indignation protesting the squire asked him pointblank if he supposed that old england had been raised to the head of the world by such as he in fine he favoured peterborough with a lesson in worldly views but these peterborough said to me are not the views dear harryif they are the views of ladies of any description which i take leave to doubtnot the views of the ladies you and i would esteem for instance the ladies of this household my aunt dorothys fate was plain in reply to my grandfathers renewed demand to know whether any one of those highdutch women had got hold of me peterborough said mr beltham the only lady of whom it could be suspected that my friend harry regarded her with more than ordinary admiration was hereditaryprincess of one of the ancient princely houses of germany my grandfather thereupon said oh pushed the wine and was stopped peterborough chuckled over this oh and the stoppage of further questions while acknowledging that the luxury of a pipe would help to make him more charitable he enjoyed the port of his native land but he did likewise feel the want of one whiff or so of the less restrictive foreigners pipe and he begged me to note the curiosity of our worship of aristocracy and royalty and we who were such slaves to rank and such tyrants in our own householdswe britons were the great sticklers for freedom his conclusion was that we were not logical we would have a throne which we would not allow the liberty to do anything to make it worthy of rational veneration we would have a peerage of which we were so jealous that it formed almost an assembly of automatons we would have virtuous women only for them to be pursued by immoral men peterborough feared he must say that we were an inconsequent people his residence abroad had so far unhinged him but a pipe would have stopped his complainings moved perhaps by generous wine in concert with his longing for tobacco he dropped an observation of unwonted shrewdness he said the squire my dear harry a most honourable and straightforward country gentleman and one of our very wealthiest is still i would venture to suggest an example of old blood that requiresi study racevarying modifying one might venture to say correcting and really a friend with more privileges than i possess would or should throw him a hint that no harm has been done to the family by an intermixture old blood does occasionally need ityou know i study bloodit becomes too coarse or in some cases too fine the study of the mixture of blood is probably one of our great physical problems peterborough commended me to gratitude for the imaginative and chivalrous element bestowed on me by a father that was other than a country squire one who could be tolerant of innocent habits and not of guilty onesa further glance at the interdicted pipe i left him almost whimpering for it the contemplation of the curious littleness of the lives of men and women lived in this england of ours made me feel as if i looked at them out of a palace balconywindow for no one appeared to hope very much or to fear people trotted in their different kinds of harness and i was amused to think of my heart going regularly in imitation of those about me i was in a princely state of mind indeed not disinclined for a time to follow the general course of life while despising it an existence without colour without anxious throbbing without salient matter for thought challenged contempt but it was exceedingly funny my aunt dorothy the squire and janet submitted to my transparent inward laughter at them patiently waiting for me to share their contentment in the deluded belief that the hour would come the principal items of news embraced the death of squire gregory bulsted the marriage of this and that young lady a legal contention between my grandfather and lady maria higginson the wife of a rich manufacturer newly located among us on account of a right of encampment on durstan heath my grandfather taking side with the gipsies and beating her ladyshipa friend of heriots by the way concerning heriot my aunt dorothy was in trouble she could not she said approve his behaviour in coming to this neighbourhood at all and she hinted that i might induce him to keep away i mentioned julia bulsteds being in mourning merely to bring in her name tentatively ay mournings her outer rig never doubt said the squire flick your whip at her shes a charitable soul judy bulsted she knits stockings for the poor shed down and kiss the stump of a sailor on a stick o timber all the same she oughtnt to be alone pity she hasnt a baby you and ill talk it over byandby harry kiomi was spoken of and lady maria higginson and then heriot mmmm rascal hummed the squire theres three and thats not enough for him six months back a man comes over from surreywards a farm he calls dipwell and asks after you harry rigmaroles about a handsome lass gone off some scoundrel you and ill talk it over byandby harry janet raised and let fall her eyebrows the fiction that so much having been said an immediate show of reserve on such topics preserved her in ignorance of them was one she subscribed to merely to humour the squire i was half in doubt whether i disliked or admired her want of decent hypocrisy she allowed him to suppose that she did not hear but spoke as a party to the conversation my aunt dorothy blamed julia the squire thundered at heriot janet liking both contented herself with impartial comments i always think in these cases that the women must be the fools she said her affectation was to assume a knowledge of the world and all things in it we rode over to julias cottage on the outskirts of the estate now devolved upon her husband irish eyes are certainly bewitching lights i thought for my part i could not do as the captain was doing serving his country in foreign parts while such as these were shining without a captain at home janet approved his conduct and was right what can a wife think the man worth who sits down to guard his housedoor she answered my slight innuendo she compared the man to a kenneldog this said i comes of madeup matches whereat she was silent julia took her own view of her position she asked me whether it was not dismal for one who was called a grass widow and was in reality a saltwater one to keep fresh with a lapdog a cook and a maidservant and a postman that passed the gate twenty times for twice that he opened it and nothing to look for but this disappointing creature day after day at first she was shy stole out a coy line of fingers to be shaken and lisped and out of that mood came rightaboutface with an exclamation of regret that she supposed she must not kiss me now i projected she drew back shall janet go said i then if nobodys present ill be talked of said she moaning queerly the tendency of her hair to creep loose of its bands gave her handsome face an aspect deliriously wild i complimented her on her keeping so fresh in spite of her saltwater widowhood she turned the tables on me for looking so powerful though i was dying for a foreign princess oh but thatll blow over she said anything blows over as long as you dont go up to the altar and she eyed her ringed finger woebegone and flashed the pleasantest of smiles with the name of her william heriot whom she always called walter heriot was she informed me staying at durstan hall the new great house built on a plot of ground that the lancashire millionaire had caught up while the squire and the other landowners of the neighbourhood were sleeping and if you get walter heriot to come to you harry richmond itll be better for him im sure she added and naively id like to meet him up at the grange temple she said had left the navy and was reading in london for the bargood news to me you have not told us anything about your princess harry janet observed on the ride home do you take her for a real person janet one thinks of her as a snowmountain youve been admiring very well so let her be is she kind and good yes does she ride well she rides remarkably well shes fair i suppose janet if i saw you married to temple it would be the second great wish of my heart harry youre a bit too cruel as julia would say have you noticed she gets more and more irish perhaps she finds it is liked some women can adapt themselves theyre the happiest all i meant to ask you is whether your princess is like the rest of us not at all said i unconscious of hurting never mind dont be hard on julia she has the making of a good womana girl can see that only she cant bear loneliness and doesnt understand yet what it is to be loved by a true gentleman persons of that class cant learn it all at once i was pained to see her in tears her figure was straight and she spoke without a quaver of her voice heriots an excellent fellow i remarked he is i cant think ill of my friends said she dear girl is it these two who make you unhappy no but dear old grandada the course of her mind was obvious i would rather have had her less abrupt and more personal in revealing it i stammered something heriot does not know you as i do she said strangling a whimper i was sure it was serious though ones accustomed to associate princesses with young mens dreams i fear harry it will half break our dear old grandadas heart he is rough and you have often been against him for one unfortunate reason if you knew him as i do you would pity him sincerely he hardly grumbled at all at your terribly long absence poor old man he hopes on hes incurably unjust to my father your father has been with you all the time harry i guessed it well it generally bodes no good to the grange do pardon me for saying that i know nothing of him i know only that the squire is generous and that i stand for with all my might forgive me for what i said forgive youwith all my heart i like you all the better youre a brave partisan i dont expect women to be philosophers well harry i would take your side as firmly as anybodys do then tell the squire how i am situated ah she half sighed i knew this was coming how could it other than come you can do what you like with the squire im dependent on him and i am betrothed to the princess ottilia god knows how much she has to trample down on her part she casts offto speak plainly she puts herself out of the line of succession and for whom for me in her fathers lifetime she will hardly yield me her hand but i must immediately be in a position to offer mine she may who can tell she is above all women in power and firmness you talk of generosity could there be a higher example of it i daresay i know nothing of princesses janet murmured i dont quite comprehend what she has done the point is what am i to do prepare him for it soothe him in advance why dear janet you can reconcile him to anything in a minute lie to him downright now what on earth is the meaning of that and why cant you speak mildly i suppose i speak as i feel im a plain speaker a plain person you dont give me an easy task friend harry if you believe in his generosity janet should you be afraid to put it to proof grandadas generosity harry i do believe in it as i believe in my own life it happens to be the very thing i must keep myself from rousing in him to be of any service to you look at the old house she changed her tone looking on old riversley with the eyes of my head even i think im looking at something far away in the memory perhaps the deep red brick causes it there never was a house with so many beautiful creepers bright as they are you notice the roses on the wall theres a face for me forever from every window and goodbye riversley harry ill obey your wishes so saying she headed me trotting down the heathtrack chapter xxxvii janet renounces me an illness of old sewis the butleramazingly resembling a sick monkey in his bedkept me from paying a visit to temple and seeing my father for several weeks during which time janet loyally accustomed the squire to hear of the german princess and she did it with a decent and agreeable cheerfulness that i quite approved of i should have been enraged at a martyrlike appearance on her part for i demanded a sprightly devotion to my interests considering love so holy a thing that where it existed all surrounding persons were bound to do it homage and service we were thrown together a great deal in attending on poor old sewis who would lie on his pillows recounting for hours my fathers midnight summons of the inhabitants of riversley and his little harrys infant expedition into the world temple and heriot came to stay at the grange and assisted in some rough scenepaintingtorrid colours representing the island of jamaica we hung it at the foot of old sewiss bed he awoke and contemplated it and went downstairs the same day cured he declared the fact being that the unfortunate picture testified too strongly to the reversal of all he was used to in life in having those he served to wait on him the squire celebrated his recovery by giving a servants ball sewis danced with the handsomest lass swung her to supper and delivered an extraordinary speech entirely concerning me and rather to my discomposure particularly so when it was my fate to hear that the old man had made me the heir of his savings such was his announcement in a very excited voice but incidentally upon a solemn adjuration to the squire to beware of his tempergovern his temper and not be a turncoat we were present at the head of the suppertable to hear our healths drunk sewis spoke like a halfcaste oblivious of his training and of the subjects he was at liberty to touch on as well evidently there was a weight of foreboding on his mind he knew his master well the squire excused him under the ejaculation drunk by the lord sewis went so far as to mention my father he no disgrace sar he no disgrace i say but he pull one way old house pull other way and tween em my little harry torn apieces squire he set out in the night you not enter it any more very well i go my lawyer next day you see my will squire years ago and little harry so high old sewis not the man to change he no turncoat squire god bless you my master you recollect and ladies tell you if you forget old sewis no turncoat you hate turncoat you taught old sewis and god bless you and mr harry and british constitution all amen with that he bounded to bed he was dead next morning the squire was humorous over my legacy it amounted to about seventeen hundred pounds invested in government stock and he asked me what i meant to do with it proposed a charity to be established on behalf of decayed halfcastes insisting that servants money could never be appropriated to the uses of gentlemen all the while he was muttering turncoat eh turncoatproof that the word had struck where it was aimed for me after thinking on it i had a superstitious respect for the legacy so i determined in spite of the squires laughter over sixty pounds per annum to let it rest in my name i saw for the first time the possibility that i might not have my grandfathers wealth to depend upon he warned me of growing miserly with my father in london living freely on my property i had not much fear of that however i said discreetly i dont mind spending when i see my way oh see your way said he better a niggard than a chuckfist only theres my girl shes good at accounts one ll do for them harryhant been long enough at home yet few were the occasions when our conversation did not diverge to this sort of interrogation temple and heriot with whom i took counsel advised me to wait until the idea of the princess had worn its way into his understanding and leave the work to janet though said heriot to me aside upon my soul its slaughter he believed that janet felt keenly but then she admired him and so they repaid one another i won my grandfathers confidence in practical matters on a trip we took into wales but it was not enough for me to be a man of business he affirmed he wanted me to have some ambition why not stand for our county at the next general election he offered me his welsh borough if i thought fit to decline a contest this was to speak as mightily as a german prince virtually in wealth and power he was a prince but of how queer a kind he was immensely gratified by my refraining to look out for my father on our return journey through london and remarked that i had not seen him for some time he supposed to which i said no i had not he advised me to let the fellow run his length suggesting that he held it likely i contributed to the fellows support he said generously keep clear of him hal i add you a thousand a year to your allowance and damned me for being so thoughtful over it i found myself shuddering at a breath of anger from him could he not with a word dash my hopes for ever the warning i had taken from old sewis transformed me to something like a hypocrite and i dare say i gave the squire to understand that i had not seen my father for a very long period and knew nothing of his recent doings been infernally quiet these last two or three years the squire muttered of the object of his aversion i heard of a city widow last sick as a dover packetboat bout the fellow well the women are ninnies but youre a man harry youre not to be taken in any longer eh i replied that i knew my father better now and was asked how the deuce i knew him better it was the world i knew better after my stay on the continent i contained myself enough to say very well the world sir flirted with one of their princesses he winked on that subject i will talk to you some other time said i got to pay an indemnity or what he professed alarm and pushed for explanations with the air of a man of business ready to help me if need were make a clean breast of it harry youre not the son of tom fool the bastard for nothing ill swear all the same youre beltham youre my grandson and heir and ill stand by you out with t shes a princess is she the necessity for correcting his impressions taught me to think the moment favourable i said i am engaged to her sir he returned promptly then youll break it off i shook my head why you cant jilt my girl at home said he do you find a princess objectionable sir objectionable shes a foreigner i dont know her i never saw her heres my janet ive brought up for you under my own eyes out of the way of every damned softsawderer safe and plump as a melon under a glass and you fight shy of her and go and engage yourself to a foreigner i dont know and never saw by george harry ill call in a parson to settle you soon as ever we sight riversley ill couple you by george i will fore either of you know whether youre on your legs or your backs we were in the streets of london so he was obliged to moderate his vehemence have you consulted janet said i consulted her ever since she was a chick with half a feather on a chick with half a feather on i remarked is not always of the same mind as a piece of poultry of full plumage hang your sneering and your talk of a fine girl like my janet as a piece of poultry you young rooster you toss your head up like a cock too conceited to crow ill swear the girls in love with you she does you the honour to be fond of you shes one in a million a handsome girl straightbacked honest just a dash and not too much of our blood in her consult her again sir i broke in you will discover she is not of your way of thinking do you mean to say shes given you a lefthander harry i have only to say that i have not given her the option he groaned going up the steps of his hotel faced me once or twice and almost gained my sympathy by observing when were boys the old ones worry us when were old ones the boys begin to tug he rarely spoke so humanelyrarely at least to me for a wonder he let the matter drop possibly because he found me temperate i tried the system on him with good effect during our stay in london that is i took upon myself to be always cool always courteous deliberate in my replies and not uncordial though i was for representing the reserved young man i obtained some praise for my style and bearing among his acquaintances to one lady passing an encomium on me he said oh some foreign princess has been training him which seemed to me of good augury my friends temple and heriot were among the riversley guests at christmas we rode over to john threshers of whom we heard that the pretty mabel sweetwinter had disappeared and understood that suspicion had fallen upon one of us gentlemen bob her brother had gone the way of the bravest english fellows of his classto america we called on the miller a soured old man bobs evasion affected him more than mabels martha thresher said in derision of our sex i was pained to hear from her that bob supposed me the misleader of his sister and that he had as she believed left england to avoid the misery of ever meeting me again because he liked me so much she had been seen walking down the lanes with some one resembling me in figure heriot took the millers view counting the loss of one stout young englishman to his country of far greater importance than the escapades of dozens of girls for which simple creatures he had no compassion he held the expression of it a sham he had grown coxcombical without talking of his conquests he talked largely of the ladies who were possibly in the situation of victims to his grace of person though he did not do so with any unctuous boasting on the contrary there was a rather taking undertone of regret that his enfeebled overfat country would give her military son no worthier occupation he laughed at the mention of julia bulsteds name she proves richie marriage is the best of all receipts for women just as its the worst for men poor billy bulsted for instance a firstrate seaman and his hearts only half in his profession since he and julia swore their oath and no wonderhe made something his own that wont go under lock and key no military or naval man ought ever to marry stop said temple is the poor old countryhow about continuing the race of heroes heriot commended him to rectories vicarages and curates lodgings for breeding grounds and coming round to julia related one of the racy dialogues of her married life the saltwater widows delicious billy rushes home from his ship in a hurry whats this greg writes methat hes got a friend of his to drink with him dye mean williama friend of yours maamand will you say a friend of mine is not a friend of yours williamjulia youre driving me madand is that far from crazy where you said i drove you at first sight of me william back to his ship goes billy with a song of love and constancy i said nothing of my chagrin at the behaviour of the pair who had furnished my first idea of the romantic beauty of love why does she talk twice as irish as she used to heriot just to coax the world to let her be as nonsensical as she likes shes awfully dull she has only her nonsense to amuse her i repeat soldiers and sailors oughtnt to marry im her best friend i am on my honour for im going to make billy give up the service since he cant give her up there she is he cried out and waved his hat to a lady on horseback some way down the slope of a road leading to the view of our heathland theres the only girl living fit to marry a man and swear shes stick to him through life and death he started at a gallop temple would have gone too at any possible speed for he knew as well as i did that janet was the girl alone capable of winning a respectful word from heriot but i detained him to talk of ottilia and my dismal prospect of persuading the squire to consent to my proposal for her and to dower her in a manner worthy a princess he doled out his yes and no to me vacantly janet and heriot came at a walking pace to meet us he questioning her she replying but a little differently from her usual habit of turning her full face to the speaker he was evidently startled and to judge from his posture repeated his question as one would say you did this she nodded and then uttered some rapid words glanced at him laughed shyly and sank her features into repose as we drew near she had a deep blush on her face i thought it might be that janet and her loud champion had come to particular terms a supposition that touched me with regrets for temples sake but heriot was not looking pleased it happened that whatever janet uttered struck a chord of opposition in me she liked the winter and the winter sunsets had hopes of a frost for skating liked our climate thought our way of keeping christmas venerable rejoiced in dispensing the squires bountiescalled them bounties joined heriot in abusing foreign countries to the exaltation of her own all this with well harry im sorry you dont think as we do and we do dont we she addressed him i reserve a point he said and not playfully she appeared distressed and courted a change of expression in his features and i have to confess that never having seen her gaze upon any one save myself in that fashion which was with her very winning especially where some of her contralto tones of remonstrance or entreaty aided it i felt as a man does at a neighbours shadow cast over his rights of property heriot dropped to the rear i was glad to leave her with temple and glad to see them canter ahead together on the sand of tie heaths she has done it heriot burst out abruptly she has done it he said again upon my soul i never wished in my life before that i was a marrying man i might have a chance of ending worth something she has won the squire round with a thundering fib and youre to have the german if you can get her dont be in a hurry the squire ll speak to you tonight but think over it will you think what a girl this is i believe on my honour no man ever had such an offer of a true woman come dont think its heriot speakingive always liked her of course but i have always respected her and thats not of course depend upon it a woman who can be a friend of men is the right sort of woman to make a match with do you suppose she couldnt have a dozen fellows round her at the lift of her finger the pick of the land id trust her with an army i tell you janet ilchesters the only girl alive wholl double the man she marries i dont know another who wouldnt make the name of wife laugh the poor devil out of house and company shes firm as a rock and sweet as a flower on it will that touch you bah richie lets talk like men i feel for her because shes fond of you and i know what it is when a girl like that sets her heart on a fellow there he concluded id ask you to go down on your knees and pray before you decide against her heriot succeeded in raising a certain dull indistinct image in my mind of a wellmeaning girl to whom i was bound to feel thankful and felt so i thanked heriot too for his friendly intentions he had never seen the princess ottilia and at night i thanked my grandfather he bore himself on the whole like the good and kindly old gentleman janet loved to consider him he would not stand in my light he said recurring to that sheetanchor of a tolerant sentence whenever his forehead began to gather clouds he regretted that janet was no better than her sex in her preference for rakes and wished me to the deuce for bringing heriot into the house and not knowing when i was lucky german grandchildren eh he muttered no beltham had ever married a foreigner what was the time fixed between us for the marriage he wanted to see his line safe before he died how do i know this foreign womanll bear he asked expecting an answer his hand was on the back of a chair grasping and rocking it his eyes bent stormily on the carpet they were set blinking rapidly after a glance at me altogether his selfcommand was creditable to janets tuition janet met me next day saying with some insolence so it struck me from her liveliness well its all right harry now youll be happy i hope i did not shine in my reply her amiable part appeared to be to let me see how brilliant and gracious the commonplace could be made to look she kept heriot at the grange against the squires remonstrance and her mothers its to keep him out of harms way the women he knows are not of the best kind for him she said with astounding fatuity he submitted and seemed to like it she must be teaching temple to skate figures in the frost with a great display of goodhumoured patience and her voice at musical pitches but her principal affectation was to talk on matters of business with mr burgin and mr trewint the squires lawyer and bailiff on mines and interest on money and economical questions not shrinking from politics either until the squire cries out to the males assisting in the performance gad shes a head as good as our halfdozen put together and they servilely joined their fragmentary capitals in agreement she went so far as to retain peterborough to teach her latin he was idling in the expectation of a living in the squires gift the annoyance for me was that i could not detach myself from a contemplation of these various scenes by reverting to my life in germany the preposterous closing of my interview with ottilia blocked the way and i was unable to write to herunable to address her even in imagination without pangs of shame at the review of the petty conspiracy i had sanctioned to entrap her to plight her hand to me and without perpetually multiplying excuses for my conduct so to escape them i was reduced to study janet forming one of her satellites she could say to me impudently with all the air of a friendly comrade had your letter from germany yet harry she flewshe was always on the chase i saw her permit heriot to kiss her hand and then the squire appeared and heriot and she burst into laughter and the squire with a puzzled face would have the game explained to him but understood not a bit of it only growled at me upon which janet became serious and chid him i was told by my aunt dorothy to admire this behaviour of hers one day she certainly did me a service a paragraph in one of the newspapers spoke of my father not flatteringly richmond is in the field again it commenced the squire was waiting for her to hand the paper to him none of us could comprehend why she played him off and denied him his right to the first perusal of the news she was voluble almost witty full of sprightly roxalana petulance this paper she said deserves to be burnt and she was allowed to burn itmoney article mining column as wellon the pretext of an infamous antitory leader of which she herself composed the first sentence to shock the squire completely i had sight of that paper some time afterwards richmond was in the field again it stated with mock flourishes but that was not the worst my grandfathers name was down there and mine and princess ottilias my fathers connection with the court of eppenwelzensarkeld was alluded to as the latest and next to his winning the heiress of riversley the most successful of his ventures inasmuch as his son if rumour was to be trusted had obtained the promise of the hand of the princess the paragraph was an excerpt from a gossiping weekly journal perhaps less malevolent than i thought it there was some fun to be got out of a man who the journal in question was informed had joined the arms of england and a petty german principality stamped on his plate and furniture my gratitude to janet was fervent enough when i saw what she had saved me from i pressed her hand and held it i talked stupidly but i made my cruel position intelligible to her and she had the delicacy on this occasion to keep her sentiments regarding my father unuttered we sat hardly less than an hour side by sidei know not how long hand in hand the end was an extraordinary trembling in the limb abandoned to me it seized her frame i would have detained her but it was plain she suffered both in her heart and her pride her voice was under fair commandmore than mine was she counselled me to go to london at once i would be off to london if i were you harryfor the purpose of checking my fathers extravaganceswould have been the further wording which she spared me and i thanked her wishing at the same time that she would get the habit of using choicer phrases whenever there might by chance be a stress of emotion between us her trembling and her id be off came into unpleasant collision in the recollection i acknowledge to myself that she was a true and hearty friend she listened with interest to my discourse on the necessity of my being in parliament before i could venture to propose formally for the hand of the princess and undertook to bear the burden of all consequent negotiations with my grandfather if she would but have allowed me to speak of temple instead of saying dont harry i like him so much at the very mention of his name i should have sincerely felt my indebtedness to her and some admiration of her fine spirit and figure besides i could not even agree with my aunt dorothy that janet was handsome when i had to grant her a pardon i appreciated her better chapter xxxviii my bankers book the squire again did honour to janets eulogy and good management of him and where said she would you find a radical to behave so generously harry when it touches him so he accorded me his permission to select my side in politics merely insisting that i was never to change it and this he requested me to swear to for he called the ghost of old sewis to witness he abhorred a turncoat if youre to be a whig or a sneaking halfandhalf i cant help you much he remarked i can pop a young tory in for my borough maybe but i cant insult a number of independent englishmen by asking them to vote for the opposite crew thats reasonable eh and i cant promise you plumpers for the county neither you can date your address from riversley youll have your house in town tell me this princess of yours is ready with her hand and he threw in roughly is a respectable young woman ill commence building youll have a house fit for a prince in town and country both temple had produced an effect on him by informing him that this princess of mine was entitled to be considered a fit and proper person in rank and blood for an alliance with the proudest royal houses of europe and my grandfather was not quite destitute of consolation in the prospect i presented to him he was a curious study to me of the tory mind in its attachment to solidity fixity certainty its unmatched generosity within a limit its devotion to the family and its family eye for the country an immediate introduction to ottilia would have won him to enjoy the idea of his grandsons marriage but not having seen her he could not realize her dignity nor even the womanliness of a foreign woman thank god for one thing he said we shant have that fellow botheringshant have the other half of your family messing the business youll have to account for him to your wife as you best can ive nothing to do with him mind that he came to my house stole my daughter crazed her wits dragged us all the excuse to turn away from the hearing of abuse of my father was too good to be neglected though it was horribly humiliating that i should have to take advantage of itvexatious that i should seem chargeable with tacit lying in allowing the squire to suppose the man he hated to be a stranger to the princess not feeling sure whether it might be common prudence to delude him even passively i thought of asking janet for her opinion but refrained a stout deceiver has his merits but a feeble hypocrite applying to friends to fortify him in his shifts and tergiversations must provoke contempt i desired that janet might continue to think well of me i was beginning to drop in my own esteem which was the mirror of my conception of ottilias view of her lover now had i consulted janet i believe the course of my history would have been different for she would not then i may imagine have been guilty of her fatal slip of the tongue that threw us into heavy seas when we thought ourselves floating on canal waters a canal barge an image to me of the most perfect attainable peace suddenly on its passage through our long firwoods with their scented reeds and flowing rushes wild balsam and silky cottongrass beds sluiced out to sea and storm would be somewhat in my likeness soon after a single luckless observation had passed at our riversley breakfasttable one sunday morning my aunt dorothy and mr peterborough were conversing upon the varieties of christian sects and particularly such as approached nearest to anglicanism together with the strange saddening fact that the christian religion appeared to be more divided than peterborough regretted to say the forms of idolatry established by the buddha mahomet and other impostors he claimed the audacious merit for us that we did not discard the reason of man we admitted mans finite reason to our school of faith and it was found refractory hence our many divisions the roman catholics admit reason said janet who had too strong a turn for showing her keenness in little encounters with peterborough no said he the protestants and anxious to elude her he pressed on to enchain my aunt dorothys attention janet plagued him meanwhile and i helped her we ran him and his schoolboy the finite refractory up and down until peterborough was glad to abandon him and janet said did you preach to the germans much he had officiated in prince ernests private chapel not he added in his egregious modesty not that he personally wished to officiate it was harrys wish janet said smiling my post of tutor peterborough hastened to explain was almost entirely supernumerary the circumstances being so i the more readily acquiesced in the title of private chaplain prepared to fulfil such duties as devolved upon me in that capacity and acting thereon i proffered my occasional services lutheranism and anglicanism are not doubtless you are aware divided on the broader bases we are common protestants the papacy i can assure you finds as little favour with one as with the other yes i held forth as you would say from time to time my assumption of the title of private chaplain it was thought improved the family dignitythat is on our side thought by harry said janet and my aunt dorothy said you and harry had a consultation about it wanted to appear as grand as they could quoth the squire peterborough signified an assent designed to modify the implication not beyond due bounds i trust sir oh now i understand janet broke out in the falsetto notes of a puzzle solved in the mind it was his father harry proclaiming his private chaplain mr harrys father did first suggest said peterborough but her quicklyaltered features caused him to draw in his breath as she had done after one short laugh my grandfather turned a round sideeye on me hard as a cocks janet immediately started topics to fill peterboroughs mouth the weather the walk to church the probable preacher and grandada said she to the squire who was muttering ominously with a grim underjaw his private chaplain and for this once would not hear her grandada i shall drive you over to see papa this afternoon she talked as if nothing had gone wrong peterborough criminal red attacked a jampot for a diversion such sweets are rare indeed on the continent he observed to my aunt dorothy our homemade dainties are matchless private chaplain the squire growled again its you that preach this afternoon janet said to peterborough do you give us an extempore sermon you remind me miss ilchester i must look to it i have a little trimming to do peterborough thought he might escape but the squire arrested him youll give me five minutes before youre out of the house please dye smoke on sundays not on sundays sir said peterborough openly and cordially as to signify that they were of one mind regarding the perniciousness of sunday smoking see you dont set fire to my ricks with your foreign chaplains tricks i spied you puffing behind one t other day there the squire dispersed peterboroughs unnecessary air of abstruse recollection dont look as though you were trying to hit on a pins head in a bushel of oats dont set my ricks on firethats all mr peterborough my aunt dorothy interposed her voice to soften this rough treatment of him with the offer of some hothouse flowers for his sittingroom oh i thank you i heard the garlanded victim lowing as i left him to the squires mercy janet followed me out it was my fault harry you wont blame him i know but will he fib i dont think hes capable of it and im sure he cant run and double grandada will have him fast before a minute is over i told her to lose no time in going and extracting the squires promise that peterborough should have his livingso much it seemed possible to save she flew back and in peterboroughs momentary absence did her work nothing could save the unhappy gentleman from a distracting scene and much archaic english the squires power of vituperation was notorious he could be more than a match for roadside navvies and predatory tramps in cogency of epithet peterborough came to me drenched and wailing that he had never heard such languagenever dreamed of it and to find himself the object of itand worse to be unable to conscientiously defend himself the pain to him was in the consciencewhich is like the spleen a function whose uses are only to be understood in its derangement he had eased his conscience to every question right out and he rejoiced to me at the immense relief it gave him conscientiously he could not deny that he knew the squires objection to my being in my fathers society and he had connived at it for reasons my dearest harry i can justify to god and man but noti had to confess as muchnot i grieve to say to your grandfather i attempted to do justice to the amiable qualities of the absent in a moment i was assailed with epithets that and not a word is to be got in when he is so violent one has to make up ones mind to act andromeda and let him be the seamonster as somebody has said i forget the exact origin of the remark the squire certainly had a whole ocean at command i strung myself to pass through the same performance to my astonishment i went unchallenged janet vehemently asserted that she had mollified the angry old man who however was dark of visage though his tongue kept silence he was gruff over his wineglass the blandishments of his favourite did not brighten him from his point of view he had been treated vilely and he was apparently inclined to nurse his rancour and keep my fortunes trembling in the balance under these circumstances it was impossible for me to despatch a letter to ottilia though i found that i could write one now and i sat in my room writing all daymost eloquent stuff it was the shadow of misfortune restored the sense of my heroical situation which my father had extinguished and this unlocked the powers of speech i wrote so admirably that my wretchedness could enjoy the fine millinery i decorated it in then to tear the noble composition to pieces was a bitter gratification ottilias station repelled and attracted me mysteriously i could not separate her from it nor keep my love of her from the contentions into which it threw me in vain i raved what is rank there was a magnet in it that could at least set me quivering and twisting behaving like a man spellbound as madly as any hero of the ballads under a wizards charm at last the squire relieved us he fixed that sidecast cocks eye of his on me and said wheres your bankers book sir i presumed that it was with my bankers but did not suggest the possibility that my father might have it in his custody for he had a chequebook of his own and regulated our accounts why not i thought and flushed somewhat defiantly the money was mine any objection to my seeing that book said the squire none whatever sir he nodded i made it a point of honour to write for the book to be sent down to me immediately the book arrived and the squire handed it to me to break the cover insisting youre sure you wouldnt rather not have me look at it quite i replied the question of money was to me perfectly unimportant i did not see a glimpse of danger in his perusing the list of my expenses cause i give you my word i know nothing about it now he said i complimented him on his frank method of dealing and told him to look at the book if he pleased but with prudence sufficiently awake to check the declaration that i had not once looked at it myself he opened it we had just assembled in the hall where breakfast was laid during winter before a huge wood fire janet had her teeth on her lower lip watching the old mans face i did not condescend to be curious but when i turned my head to him he was puffing through thin lips and then his mouth crumpled in a knob he had seen sights by george i must have breakfast fore i go into this he exclaimed and stared as if he had come out of an oven dorothy beltham reminded him that prayers had not been read prayers he was about to objurgate but affirmatived her motion to ring the bell for the servants and addressed peterborough you read em abroad every morning peterboroughs conscience started off on its inevitable jogtrot at a touch of the whip ayes that isoh it was my office he had to recollect with exactitude i should specify exceptions there were intervals please open your bible the squire cut him short i dont want a damned fine edge on everything partly for an admonition to him or in pure nervousness peterborough blew his nose monstrously an unlucky note nothing went well after it a slight cold he murmured and resumed the note and threw himself maniacally into it the unexpected figure of captain bulsted on tiptoe wearing the ceremonial depressed air of intruders on these occasions distracted our attention for a moment fresh from ship william the squire called out the captain ejaculated a big word to judge of it from the aperture but it was mute as his footing on the carpet and he sat and gazed devoutly toward peterborough who had waited to see him take his seat and must now in his hurry to perform his duty sweep the peccant little redbound book to the floor here ill have that said the squire allow me sir said peterborough and they sprang into a collision would you jump out of your pulpit to pick up an old womans umbrella the squire asked him in wrath and muttered of requiring none of his clerical legerdemain with books of business tears were in peterboroughs eyes my aunt dorothys eyes dwelt kindly on him to encourage him but the mans irritable nose was again his enemy captain bulsted chanced to say in the musical voice of inquiry prayers are not yet over are they no nor never will be with a parson blowing his horn at this rate the squire rejoined and mind you he said to peterborough after dismissing the servants to whom my aunt dorothy read the morning lessons apart id not have had this happen sir for money in lumps ive always known i should hang the day when my house wasnt blessed in the morning by prayer so did my father and his before him fiddle sir you cant expect young people to wear decent faces when the parsons hopping over the floor like a flea and trumpeting as if the organpipe wouldnt have the sermon at any price you tried to juggle me out of this book here on myindeed sir no peterborough proclaimed his innocence and it was unlikely that the squire should have suspected him captain bulsted had come to us for his wife whom he had not found at home on his arrival last midnight god bless my soul said the squire you dont mean to tell me shes gone off william oh dear no sir said the captain shes only cruising the squire recommended a draught of old ale the captain accepted it his comportment was cheerful in a sober fashion notwithstanding the transparent perturbation of his spirit he answered my aunt dorothys questions relating to julia simply and manfully as became a gallant seaman cordially excusing his wife for not having been at home to welcome him with the singular plea based on his knowledge of the sex that the nearer she knew him to be the less able was she to sit on her chair waiting like patience he drank his ale from the hands of sillabin our impassive new butler who had succeeded sewis the squire told him like a whig ministry the tory proof that things were not improving i thought sir things were getting better said the captain the damnedest mistake ever made william how about the fall of man then eh you talk like a heathen radical its scripture says were going from better to worse and thats tory doctrine and stick to the good as long as you can why william you were a jolly bachelor once sir and maam the captain bowed to dorothy beltham i have thanks to you never known happiness but in marriage and all i want is my wife the squire fretted for janet to depart im going grandada she said youll oblige me by not attending to any matter of business today give me that book of harrys to keep for you how dye mean my dear its bad work done on a sunday you know so it is ill lock up the book i have your word for that grandada said janet the ladies retired taking peterborough with them goodbye to the frocks and now william out with your troubles said the squire the captains eyes were turned to the door my aunt dorothy had passed through you remember the old custom sir ay do i william sorry for you then infernally sorry for you now that i am but youve run your head into the halter i love her sir i love her to distraction let any man on earth say shes not an angel i flatten him dead as his lie by the way sir i am bound in duty to inform you i am speaking of my wife to be sure you are william and a trim schooneryacht she is shes off sir shes off i thought it time to throw in a word captain bulsted i should hold any man but you accountable to me for hinting such things of my friend harry your hand he cried sparkling hum his hand growled the squire his hands been pretty lively on the continent william here look at this book william and the bundle o cheques no i promised my girl well go into it tomorrow he and i early the fellow has shot away thousands and thousandsbeen gallivanting among his foreign duchesses and countesses theres a petticoat in that bankbook of his and more than one i wager now hes for marrying a foreign princessgot himself in a tangle there it seems mightily well done harry captain bulsted struck a terrific encomium on my shoulder groaning may she be true to you my lad the squire asked him if he was going to church that morning i go to my post sir by my fireside the captain replied nor could he be induced to leave his post vacant by the squires promise to him of a sermon that would pickle his temper for a whole weeks wear and tear he regretted extremely that he could not enjoy so excellent a trial of his patience but he felt himself bound to go to his post and wait i walked over to bulsted with him and heard on the way that it was heriot who had called for her and driven her off the man had been i supposed captain bulsted said deputed by some of you to fetch her over to riversley my servants mentioned his name i thought it adviseable not to trouble the ladies with it today he meditated i hoped i should find her at the grange in the morning harry i slept on it rather than startle the poor lamb in the night i offered him to accompany him at once to heriots quarters what and let my wife know i doubted her fidelity my girl shall never accuse me of that as it turned out julia had been taken by heriot on a visit to lady maria higginson the wife of the intrusive millionaire who particularly desired to know her more intimately thoughtless julia accepting the impudent invitation without scruple had allowed herself to be driven away without stating the place of her destination she and heriot were in the higginsons pew at church hearing from janet of her husbands arrival she rushed home and there instead of having to beg forgiveness was summoned to grant pardon captain bulsted had drawn largely on squire gregorys cellar to assist him in keeping his post the pair appeared before us fondling ineffably next day neither one of them capable of seeing that our domestic peace at the grange was unseated were the two wretchedest creatures alive havent any of ye to spare a bit of sympathy for us julia began were like on a pitchfork theres williams duty to his country and theres his affection for me and they wont go together because government which is that horrid admiralty fears pitching and tossing for postcaptains wives and william away im distracted and the admiraltys hairs on end if he stops and deed miss beltham im not more than married to just half a husband the captain echoed her half but happy enough for twenty whole ones if youll be satisfied my duck julia piteously entreated me for my future wifes sake not to take service under government as for the admiralty she said it had no characteristic but the abominable one that it hated a woman the squire laid two or three moderately coarse traps for the voluble frank creature which she evaded with surprising neatness showing herself more awake than one would have imagined her janet and i fancied she must have come with the intention to act uxorious husband and irish wife for the distinct purpose of diverting the squires wrath from me for he greatly delighted in the sight of merry wedded pairs but they were as simple as possible in their display of happiness it chanced that they came opportunely my bankers book had been the theme all the morning and an astonishing one to me equally with my grandfather since our arrival in england my father had drawn nine thousand pounds the sums expended during our absence on the continent reached the perplexing figures of fortyeight thousand i knew it too likely besides that all debts were not paid selfselfself drew for thousands at a time sometimes as the squires convulsive forefinger indicated for many thousands within a week it was incomprehensible to him until i driven at bay by questions and insults and perceiving that concealment could not long be practised made a virtue of the situation by telling him what he in fact must have seen that my father possessed a chequebook as well as i and likewise drew upon the account we had required the money it was mine and i had sold out bank stock and consolswhich gave very poor interest i remarked cursorilyand had kept the money at my bankers to draw upon according to our necessities i pitied the old man while speaking his face was livid language died from his lips he asked to have little things explained to himthe two chequebooks for instanceand what i thought of doing when this money was all gone for he supposed i did not expect the same amount to hand every two years unless he added i had given him no more than a couple of years lease of life when i started for my tour then the moneys gone he summed up and this was the signal for redemanding explanations had he not treated me fairly and frankly in handing over my own to me on the day of my majority yes and like a fool you thinkeh i have no such thought in my head sir you have been keeping that fellow in his profligacy and youre keeping him now why youre all but a beggar comes to my house talks of his birth carries off my daughter makes her mad lets her child grow up to lay hold of her money and then grips him fast and pecks him fleeces him youre beggareddye know that hes had the two years of you and sucked you dry what were you about what were you doing did you have your head on you shared chequebooks good the devil in hell never found such a fool as you you had your house full of your foreign bonyroberseh out with it how did you pass your time drunk and dancing by such degrees my grandfather worked himself up to the pitch for his style of eloquence i have given a faint specimen of it when i took the liberty to consider that i had heard enough he followed me out of the library into the hall where janet stood in her presence he charged the princess and her family with being a pack of greedy adventurers conspirators with that fellow to plunder me and for a proof of it he quoted my words that my fathers time had been spent in superintending the opening of a coalmine on prince ernests estate that fellow pretending to manage a coalmine could not a girl see it was a shuffle to hoodwink a greenhorn and now he remembered it was colonel goodwin and his daughter who had told him of having seen the fellow engaged in playing courtbuffoon to a petty german prince and performing his antics cutting capers like a clown at a fair shame said janet hear her the squire turned to me but she cried oh grandada hear yourself or dont be silent if harry has offended you speak like one gentleman to another dont rob me of my love for you i havent much besides that no because of a scoundrel and his young idiot janet frowned in earnest and said i dont permit you to change the meaning of the words i speak he muttered a proverb of the stables reduced to behave temperately he began the whole history of my bankers book anewthe same queries the same explosions and imprecations come for a walk with me dear harry said janet i declined to be protected in such a manner absurdly on my dignity and the refusal together possibly with some air of contemptuous independence in the tone of it brought the squire to a climax you wont go out and walk with her you shall go down on your knees to her and beg her to give you her arm for a walk by god you shall now here on the spot or off you go to your german princess with your butlers legacy and nothing more from me but goodbye and the door bolted now down with you he expected me to descend and if he did he would never have my arm janets eyes glittered hard on the squire before that rascal dies my dear he shall whine like a beggar out in the cold for the tips of your fingers not if he asks me first said janet this set him off again he realized her prospective generosity and contrasted it with my actual obtuseness janet changed her tactics she assumed indifference but she wanted experience and a heriot to help her in playing a part she did it badlyoverdid it so that the old man now imagining both of us to be against his scheme for uniting us counted my iniquity as twofold her phrase harry and i will always be friends roused the loudest of his denunciations upon me as though there never had been question of the princess so inveterate was his minds grasp of its original designs friends would our being friends give him heirs by law to his estate and name and so forth my aunt dorothy came to moderate his invectives in her room the heavilyburdened little book of figures was produced and the items read aloud and her task was to hear them without astonishment but with a businesslike desire to comprehend them accurately a method that softened the squires outbursts by degrees she threw out hasty running commentaries yes that was for a yacht and they were living at the court of a prince such and such a sum was large but harry knew his grandfather did not wish him to make a poor appearance why do you mean to swear to me on your oath dorothy beltham said the squire amazed at the small amazement he created you think these two fellows have been spending within the right margin whatll be womens ideas next no she answered demurely i think harry has been extravagant and has had his lesson and surely it is better now than later but you are not making allowances for his situation as the betrothed of a princess thats what turns your head said he and she allowed him to have the notion and sneer at herself and her sex how about this money drawn since he came home the squire persisted my aunt dorothy reddened he struck his finger on the line marking the sum repeating his demand and at this moment captain bulsted and julia arrived the ladies manoeuvred so that the captain and the squire were left alone together some time afterward the captain sent out word that he begged his wifes permission to stay to dinner at the grange and requested me to favour him by conducting his wife to bulsted proof as julia said that the two were engaged in a pretty hot tussle she was sure her william would not be the one to be beaten i led her away rather depressed by the automaton performance assigned to me from which condition i awoke with a touch of horror to find myself paying her very warm compliments for she had been coquettish and charming to cheer me and her voice was sweet we reached a point in our conversation i know not where but i must have spoken with some warmth then guess said she what william is suffering for your sake now harry that is suffering in remaining away from me on your account and thus in an instant with a skill so intuitive as to be almost unconscious she twirled me round to a right sense of my position and set me reflecting whether a love that clad me in such imperfect armour as to leave me penetrable to these feminine gracesa plump figure swinging skirts dewy dark eyelids laughing red lipscould indeed be absolute love and if it was not love of the immortal kind what was i i looked back on the thought like the ship on its furrow through the waters and saw every mortal perplexity and death under my love of ottilia delusion then life was delusion i contemplated julia in alarm somewhat in the light fair witches were looked on when the faggots were piled for them the sense of her unholy attractions abased and mortified me and it set me thinking on the strangeness of my disregard of mdlle jenny chassediane when in germany who was far sprightlier if not prettier and as i remembered had done me the favour to make discreet play with her eyelids in our encounters and long eyes in passing i caught myself regretting my coldness of that period for which regrets i could have swung the scourge upon my miserable flesh ottilias features seemed dying out of my mind poor darling harry julia sighed and dye know the sight of a young man far gone in love gives me the trembles i rallied her concerning the ladder scene in my old schooldays and the tender things she had uttered to heriot she answered oh i think i got them out of poets and chapters about lovemaking or i felt it very much and thats what i miss in william he cant talk soft nice nonsense i believe him he would if he could but hes like a lion of the desertits a roar i rejoiced when we heard the roar captain bulsted returned to take command of his ship not sooner than i wanted him and told us of a fierce tussle with the squire he had stuck to him all day and up to pm by george harry he had to make humble excuses to dodge out of eyeshot a minute conquered him over the fourth bottle and now alls right hell see your dad in a barn says the squire heres to your better health sir i bowed to him gentlemen dont meet in barns none but mice and traps make appointments there to shorten my story my lad i have arranged for the squire and your excellent progenitor to meet at bulsted we may end by bringing them over a bottle of old gregs best see the boys father i kept on insisting the point is that this confounded book must be off your shoulders my lad a dirty dog may wash in a duckpond you see harry the dear old squire may set up your account twenty times over but he has a right to know how you twirl the coin he says you dont supply the information i suggest to him that your father can and will so we get them into a room together ill be answerable for the rest and now top your boom and to bed here off in the morning and tug the big vessel into port here and harry three cheers and another bottle to crown the victory if youre the man for it julia interposed a decided negative to the proposal an ordinarily unlucky thing to do with bibulous husbands and the captain looked uncomfortably checked but when he seemed to be collecting to assert himself the humour of her remark now no bravado william disarmed him bravado my sweet chuck wont another bottle be like flashing your sword after youve won the day said she he slung his arm round her and sent a tremendous whisper into my eara perfect angel i started for london next day more troubled aesthetically regarding the effect produced on me by this order of perfect angels than practically anxious about material affairs though it is true that when i came into proximity with my father the thought of his all but purely mechanical power of making money spin fly and vanish like sparks from a fireengine awakened a serious disposition in me to bring our monetary partnership to some definite settlement he was living in splendour next door but one to the grand establishment he had driven me to from dipwell in the old days with mrs waddy for his housekeeper once more alphonse for his cook not living on the same scale however the troubled woman said she signified that it was now the whirlwind i could not help smiling to see how proud she was of him nevertheless as a godlike charioteerin pace at least opera tonight she answered my inquiries for him admonishing me by her tone that i ought not to be behindhand in knowing his regal rules and habits praising his generosity she informed me that he had spent one hundred pounds and offered a reward of five times the sum for the discovery of mabel sweetwinter your papa never does things by halves mr harry soon after she was whimpering oh will it last i was shown into the room called the princesss room a miracle of furniture not likely to be occupied by her i thought the very magnificence of the apartment striking down hope in my heart like cold on a nerve your papa says the whole house is to be for you mr harry when the happy day comes could it possibly be that he had talked of the princess i took a hasty meal and fortified myself with claret to have matters clear with him before the night was over chapter xxxix i see my father taking the tide and am carried on it myself my father stood in the lobby of the opera holding a sort of open court it appeared to me for a cluster of gentlemen hung round him and i had presently to bow to greetings which were rather of a kind to flatter me leading me to presume that he was respected as well as marvelled at the names of mr serjeant wedderburn mr jennings lord alton sir weeton slater mr monterez williams admiral loftus the earl of witlington were among those which struck my ear and struck me as good ones i could not perceive anything of the air of cynical satellites in these gentlemenon the contrary they were cordially deferential i felt that he was encompassed by undoubted gentlemen and my warmer feelings to my father returned when i became sensible of the pleasant sway he held over the circle both in speaking and listening his sympathetic smile and semidroop of attention his readiness when occasion demanded it to hit the key of the subject and help it on with the right word his air of unobtrusive appreciation his sensibility to the moment when the run of conversation depended upon himshowed inimitable art coming of natural genius and he did not lose a shade of his superior manner the while mr serjeant wedderburn professionally voluble a lively talker brimming with anecdote but too sparkling too prompt too full of personal relish of his point threw my fathers urbane supremacy into marked relief and so in another fashion did the earl of witlington a youth in the season of guffaws as jorian dewitt described him whom a jest would seize by the throat shaking his sapling frame jorian strolled up to us goutily no efforts of my fathers would induce him to illustrate his fame for repartee so it remained established very pretty waxwork he said to me of our english beauties swimming by now those women young richmond if they were inflammable to the fiftieth degree that is if they had the fiftieth part of a frenchwoman in them would have canvassed society on the great mans account long before this and sent him to the top like a bubble he wastes his time on them that fat woman hes bowing to is viscountess sedley a porcine empress widow of three with a soupon of bigamy to flavour them she mounted from a grocers shop i am told constitution has done everything for that woman so it will everywhereit beats the world now hes on allfours to lady rachel stokes our pure aristocracy she walks as if she were going through a doorway and couldnt risk an eyelid id like to see her tempting st anthony thats little wreckhams wife shes had as many adventures as gil blas before he entered the duke of lermas service he reviewed several ladies certainly not very witty when malignant as i remembered my father to have said of him the style of your englishwoman is to keep the nose exactly at one elevation to show youre born to it they darent run a gamut these women these englishwomen are a fiction the model of them is the nurserymiss but theyre like the names of true lovers cut on the bark of a treeawfully stiff and longitudinal with the advance of time weve our lady jezebels my boy theyre in the pay of the bishops or the police to make vice hideous the rest do the same for virtue and get their pay for it somewhere i dont doubt perhaps from the newspapers to keep up the fiction i tell you these englishwomen have either no life at all in them or theyre nothing but animal life gad how they dizen themselves theyve no other use for their fingers the wealth of this countrys frightful jorian seemed annoyed that he could not excite me to defend my countrywomen but i had begun to see that there was no necessity for the sanguine to encounter the bilious on their behalf and was myself inclined to be critical besides i was engaged in watching my father whose bearing toward the ladies he accosted did not dissatisfy my critical taste though i had repeated fears of seeing him overdo it he summoned me to an introduction to the countess szezedy a merry little hungarian dame so said she at once speaking german you are to marry the romantic head the princess ottilia of eppenwelzen i know her well i have met her in vienna schone seele and bas bleu its just those that are won with a duel i know prince otto too she prattled away and asked me whether the marriage was to take place in the summer i was too astounded to answer no date is yet fixed my father struck in its the talk of london she said before i could demand explanations of my father with regard to this terrible rumour involving ottilia i found myself in the box of the city widow lady sampleman a grievous person of the complexion of the autumnal brambleleaf whose first words were ah the young suitor and how is our german princess i had to reply that the theme was more of german princes than princesses in england oh but said she you are having ashall i call itnational revenge on them i will take one of your princesses says you and as soon as said done im dying for a sight of her portrait captain dewitt declares her heavenlyi mean he says she is fair and nice quite a ladythat of course and never mind her not being rich you can do the decoration to the match hm she perused my features pale lovelorn excuse an old friend of your fathers one of his very oldest id say if it didnt impugn as such proud of your alliance i am i speak of it everywhereeverywhere here she dramatized the circulation of the gossip have you heard the news no what fitzgeorges son marries a princess of the german realm indeed true as gospel and how soon in a month and now you will see the dear neglected man command the court i looked at my father i felt stifling with confusion and rage he leant over to her imparting some ecstatic news about a great lady having determined to call on her to regulate the affairs of an approaching grand ball and under cover of this we escaped if it were not said he for the chassedianeyou are aware richie poor jorian is lost to herhe has fallen at her quicksilver feet she is now in london half the poor fellows income expended in bouquets her portrait in the character of the widow lefourbe has become a part of his dressing apparatus he shaves fronting her playbill his first real affaire de coeur and he is fortyfive so he is taken in the stomach that is why love is such a dangerous malady for middle age as i said but for jenny chassediane our sampleman would be the fortune for jorian i have hinted it on both sides women richie are cleverer than the illustrious lord nelson in not seeing what their inclinations decline to see and jorian would do me any service in the world except that one you are restless my son i begged permission to quit the house and wait for him outside he in return begged me most urgently to allow myself to be introduced to lady edbury the stepmother of lord destrier now marquis of edbury and using conversational pressure he adjured me not to slight this lady adding with more significance than the words conveyed i am taking the tide richie the tide took me and i bowed to a lady of impressive languor pale and young with pleasant manners showing her character in outline like a glove on the hand but little of its quality she accused my father of coming direct from that persons box he replied that he never forsook old friends you should was her rejoinder it suggested to me an image of one of the sister fates cutting a thread my heart sank when from lady edbury too i heard the allusion to germany and its princess some one told me she was dark blonde my father corrected the report lady edbury thought it singular for a german woman of the blood to be a brunette they had not much dark mixture among them particularly in the north her name she had forgotten the name of the princess my father repeated the princess ottilia princess of eppenwelzensarkeld brunette you say the purest blonde a complexion a complexion to dazzle the righteous lady edbury threw a flying glance in a mirror the unrighteous you leave to us then they bandied the weariful shuttlecock of gallantry i bowed and fled my excuse was that i had seen anna penrhys in an upper tier of boxes and i made my way to her doubting how i should be welcomed the happy woman is a german princess we hear she set me shivering her welcome was perfectly unreserved and friendly she asked the name of the lady whose box i had quitted and after bending her operaglass on it for a moment said with a certain air of satisfaction she is young which led me to guess that lady edbury was reputed to be annas successor but why the latter should be flattered by the formers youth was one of the mysteries for me then her aunt was awakened from sleep by the mention of my name is the man here she exclaimed starting anna smiled and talked to me of my father saying that she was glad to see me at his right hand for he had a hard battle to fight she spoke of him with affectionate interest in his fortunes no better proof of his generosity as well as hers could have been given me i promised her heartily i would not be guilty of letting our intimacy drop and handed the ladies down to the crushroom where i saw my father leading lady edbury to her carriage much observed destrier the young marquis coming in to meet the procession from other haunts linked his arm to his friend witlingtons and said something in my hearing of old duke fitz which provoked i fancied signs of amusement equivalent to tittering in a small ring of the select assembly lady samplemans carriage was called another victim said a voice anna penrhys walked straight out to find her footman and carriage for herself i stood alone in the street wondering fretting filled with a variety of ugly sensations when my father joined me humming an air of the opera i was looking for jorian richie he had our sampleman under his charge he is off to the chassediane well and well richie you could not bear the absence from your dada you find me in full sail on the tide i am at home if our fortunes demand it in a little german principality but there is he threw out his chest a breadth in london nowhere else do i breathe with absolute freedomso largely and this is my battlefield by the way lady edbury accounts you complete which is no more to say than that she is a woman of taste the instance she positively would not notice that you wear a dresscoat of a foreign cut correct it tomorrow my tailor shall wait on you i meant to point out to you that when a london woman has not taken note of that the face and the man have made the right impression on her richie dear boy how shall i speak the delight i have in seeing you my arm in yours old richie strolling home from the fashion this seems to me what i dreamt of all in sound health at the grange she too the best of women i have come on very particular business i interposed briefly he replied i am alive to you richie speak the squire has seen my bankers book he thinks ive been drawing rather wildly no doubt hes right he wants some sort of explanation he consents to an interview with you i have come to ask you to go down to him sir tomorrow morning without an hours delay my dear boy very agreeable will be the sight of old riversley and in the daylight he prefers to meet you at bulsted captain bulsted offers his house for the purpose i have to warn you sir that we stand in a very exceptional position the squire insists upon having a full account of the money rendered to him i invite him to london richie i refer him to dettermain and newson i request him to compute the value of a princess you are aware that he will not come to your invitation tell me then how is he to understand what i have established by the expenditure my son i refer him to dettermain and newson but you must know that he sets his face against legal proceedings involving exposure but surely richie exposure is the very thing we court the innocent the unjustly treated court it we would be talked about you shall hear of us and into the bargain an hereditary princess upon my faith mr beltham i think you have mighty little to complain of my temper was beginning to chafe at the curb as regards any feeling about the money personally sir you know i have none but i must speak of one thing i have heard tonight i confess with as much astonishment as grief the name i could not have guessed that i should hear the princesss name associated with mine and quite openly as a matter of course he nodded and struck out a hand in wavy motion well sir if you cant feel for her or her family be good enough to think of me and remember that i object to it for you all said he buoyantly i feel for you all and i will act for you all i bring the princess to your arms my dear boy you have written me word that the squire gives her a royal dowryhave you not my combinations permit of no escape to any one of you nay tis done i think for youi feel for youi act for you by heaven you shall be happy sigh richie sigh your destiny is now entrusted to me i daresay im wasting my breath sir but i protest against false pretences you know well that you have made use of the princesss name for your own purposes most indubitably richie i have and are they not yours i must have social authority to succeed in our main enterprise possibly the princesss name serves for a temporary chandelier to cast light on us she belongs to us for her sake we are bringing the house she enters into order thus richie i could tell mr beltham you and he supply the money the princess the name and i the energy the skilfulness and the estimable cause i pay the princess for the use of her name with the dowry which is royal i pay you with the princess who is royal too and i richie am paid by your happiness most royally together it is past contest that we winhere my little one he said to a woman and dropped a piece of gold into her hand on condition that you go straight home the woman thanked him and promised as i was observing we are in the very tide of success curious i have a slight inclination to melancholy success quotha why hundreds before us have paced the identical way homeward at night under these lamps between the mansions and the park the bare thought makes them resemble a double line of undertakers the tomb is down there at the end of themcostly or not at the age of four on my birthday i was informed that my mother lay dead in her bed i remember to this day my astonishment at her not moving her heart is broken my old nurse said to me she appeared intact her sister took possession of me and of her papers and the weddingringnow in the custody of dettermain and newsontogether with the portraits of both my parents and she poor soul to sustain me as i verily believeshe had a great idea of my never asking unprofitably for anything in lifebartered the most corroborative of the testificatory documents which would now make the establishment of my case a comparatively light task have i never spoken to you of my boyhood my maternal uncle was a singingmaster and master of elocution i am indebted to him for the cultivation of my voice he taught me an effective delivery of my sentences the english of a book of his called the speaker is still to my mind a model of elegance remittances of money came to him from an unknown quarter and with a break or two have come ever since up to this period my old nurseheaven bless herresumed the occupation of washing i have stood by her tub richie blowing bubbles and listening to her prophecies of my exalted fortune for hours on my honour i doubt i seriously doubt if i have ever been happier i depend just nowi have to avow it to youslightly upon stimulants of a perfectly innocuous character mrs waddy will allow me a pint of champagne the truth is richieyou see these two or three poor pensioners of mine honi soit qui mal y pensemy mother has had hard names thrown at her the stones of these streets cry out to me to have her vindicated i am not tired but i want my wine he repeated several times before he reached his housedoor that he wanted his wine in a manner to be almost alarming his unwonted effort of memory the singular pictures of him which it had flashed before me and a sort of impatient compassion made me forget my wrath i saw him take his restorative at one draught he lay down on a sofa and his valet drew his boots off and threw a cloak over him lying there he wished me gaily goodnight mrs waddy told me that he had adopted this system of sleeping for the last month bless you as many people call on him at night now as in the day she said and i was induced to suppose he had some connection with the press she had implicit faith in his powers of constitution and would affirm that he had been the death of dozens whom the attraction had duped to imitate his habits he is now a fieldmarshal on his campaign she betrayed a twinkle of humour he must himself have favoured her with that remark the report of the housedoor frequently shutting in the night suggested the passage of his aidesdecamp early in the morning i found him pacing through the open doors of the diningroom and the library dictating to a secretary at a desk now and then tossing a word to dettermain and newsons chief clerk the floor was strewn with journals he wore hessian boots a voluminous black cloak hung loosely from his shoulders i am just settling the evening papers he said after greeting me with a show of formality in his warmth and immediately added that will do mr jopson put in a notemr harry lepel richmond of riversley and twnyglas my son takes no step to official distinction in his native land save through the ordinary parliamentary channels your pardon richie presently i am replying to a morning paper whats this why print my name i cried merely the correction of an error i have to insist my dear boy that you claim no privileges you are apart from them mr jopson i beseech you not a minutes delay in delivering that fetch me from the printers my pamphlet this afternoon mr jacobs my compliments to dettermain and newson i request them to open proceedings instanter and let the world know of it goodmorning gentlemen and now turning to me my father fenced me with the whole weight of his sententious volubility which was the force of a river why did my name appear in the papers because i was his son but he assured me that he carefully separated me from public companionship with his fortunes and placed me on the side of my grandfather as a plain gentleman of england the heir of the most colossal wealth possible in the country i dissociate you from me richie do you see i cause it to be declared that you need on no account lean on me jopson will bring you my pamphletmy declaration of rightsto peruse in the press in literature at law and on social ground i meet the enemy and i claim my own by heaven i do and i will down to the squire for a distraction if you esteem it necessary certainly halfadozen words to him why do you maintain him to be insensible to a title for you no no and ask my friends i refer him to any dozen of my friends to convince him i have the prize almost in my possession why dear boy i have witnesses living witnesses to the ceremony am i tell me to be deprived of money now once again for the eleventh time oh and put aside my duty to you i protest i am bound in duty to her who bore meyou have seen her miniature how lovely that dear woman was how gentlebound in duty to her to clear her good name this does not affect you oh but it does he allowed me to plead ay through your love for your dada he shook me by both hands i was touched with pity and at the same time in doubt whether it was not an actor that swayed me for i was discontented and could not speak my discontent i was overborne overflowed his evasion of the matter of my objections relating to the princess i felt to be a palpable piece of artfulness but i had to acknowledge to myself that i knew what his argument would be and how overwhelmingly his defence of it would spring forth my cowardice shrank from provoking a recurrence to the theme in fact i submitted consciously to his masterful fluency and emotional power and so i was carried on the tide with him remaining in london several days to witness that i was not the only one my father admitting that money served him in his conquest of society and defying any other man to do as much with it as he did replied to a desperate insinuation of mine this money i spend i am actually putting out to interest as much as or more than your grandad he murmured confidentially i have alarmed the government indeed i have warrant for saying i am in communication with its agents they are bribing me they are positively bribing me richie i receive my stipend annually they are mighty discreet so am i but i push them hard i take what they offer i renounce none of my claims janet wrote that it would be prudent for me to return i am prepared my father said i have only to meet mr beltham in a roomi stipulate that it shall be between square wallsto win him the squire to back us richie we have command of the entire world his wealth and my good cause and your illustrious unionby the way it is announced definitely in this mornings paper dismayed i asked what was announced read said he this will be something to hand to mr beltham at our meeting i might trace it to one of the embassies imperial or royal no matterthere it is i read a paragraph in which ottilias name and titles were set down then followed mine and my wealthy heirship andwoe was me in the perusing of ita roundabout vindication of me as one not likely to be ranked as the first of english commoners who had gained the hand of an hereditary foreign princess though it was undoubtedly in the light of a commoner that i was most open to the congratulations of my countrymen upon my unparalleled felicity a display of historical erudition cited the noble inferiors by birth who had caught princesses to their armscharles humphrey william john under this list a later harry the paragraph closed by fixing the nuptials to take place before the end of the season i looked at my father to try a struggle with him the whole man was efflorescent cant it be stopped i implored him he signified the impossibility in a burst of gesticulations motions of the mouth smiling frowns various patterns of an absolute negative beating down opposition things printed can never be stopped richie our jorian compares them to babies baptized they have a soul from that moment and go on for everan admirable word of jorians and a word to you richie will you swear to me by the veracity of your lovers heart that paragraph affords you no satisfaction he cannot swear it my father exclaimed seeing me swing my shoulder round and he made me feel that it would have been a false oath if i had sworn it but i could have sworn that i had rather we two were at the bottom of the sea than that it should come under the princesss eyes i read it again it was in print it looked like reality it was at least the realization of my dream but this played traitor and accused me of being crowned with no more than a dream the sole practical thing i could do was to insist on our starting for riversley immediately to make sure of my own position name your hour richie my father said confidently and we waited a rather plainer view of my fathers position as i inclined to think was afforded to me one morning at his breakfasttable by a conversation between him and jorian dewitt who brought me a twisted pink note from mdlle chassediane the which he delivered with the air of a dog made to disgorge a bone and he was very cool to me indeed the cutlets of alphonse were subject to snappish criticism i assume he said the fellow knew i was coming he saw it in my handwriting of yesterday replied my father but be just to him acknowledge that he is one of the few that perform their daily duties with a tender conscience this english climate has bedevilled the fellow he peppers his dishes like a mongrel indian reared on mangoes ring him up ring him up jorian all i beg of you is not to disgust him with life for he quits any service in the world to come to me and in fact he suits me exactly so you spoil him my father shrugged the state of the case is that your stomach is growing delicate friend jorian the actual state of the case being that my palate was never keener and consequently my stomach knows its business you should have tried the cold turbot with oil and capers your man had better stick to buttered eggs in my opinion say porridge no ill be hanged if i think hes equal to a bowl of porridge careme might have confessed to the same with this difference cried jorian in a heat that he would never have allowed the thought of any of your barbarous messes to occur to a man at table let me tell you roy you astonish me up till now i have never known you guilty of the bad taste of defending a bad dish on your own board then you will the more readily pardon me jorian oh i pardon you jorian sneered tripped to the carpet by such ignoble mildness a breakfast is no great loss my father assured him he would have a serious conversation with alphonse for whom he apologized by saying that alphonse had not to his knowledge served as hospital cook anywhere and was therefore quite possibly not sufficiently solicitous for appetites and digestions of invalids jorian threw back his head as though to discharge a spiteful sarcasm with good aim but turning to me said harry the thing must be done your father must marry notoriety is the season for a pick and choice of the wealthiest and the loveliest i refuse to act the part of warmingpan any longer i refuse point blank its not a personal feeling on my part my advice is that of a disinterested friend and i tell you candidly roy set aside the absurd exhibition of my dancing attendance on that last rose of guildhallegad the alderman went like summer and left us the very picture of a fruity autumni say you cant keep her hanging on the tree of fond expectation for ever shell drop catch her jorian you are on guard upwards of three hundred thousand if a penny roy richmond who i i am not a fortunehunter nor am i friend jorian no its because youre not thorough yous fall between the stools my father remarked that he should visit this upon mr alphonse you shook off that fine welsh girl and she was in your handthe act of a madman jorian continued youre getting older the day will come when youre a flat excitement you know the first lady edbury spoilt one of your best chances when you had the market now youre trifling with the second shes the head of the light brigade but you might fix her down if shes not too much in debt youre not at the end of your run i dare say only my good roy let me tell you in life you mustnt wait for the prize of the race till you touch the goalif you prefer metaphor you generally come forward about every seven years or so add on another seven and womenll begin to think you cant beat time mon roy so said my father i touch the goal and women begin to think and i cant beat time to them jorian your mind is in a state of confusion i do not marry then roy richmond hear what a friend says i do not marry jorian and you know my reasons sentiments they are a part of my life just as i remarked you are not thorough you have genius and courage out of proportion and you are a dead failure roy because no sooner have you got all covent garden before you for the fourth or fifth time than in go your hands into your pockets and you sayno theres an apple i cant have so ill none of these and by the way the apple must be tolerably withered by this time and you know perfectly well for you dont lack common sense at a shaking roy richmond that youre guilty of simple madness in refusing to make the best of your situation you havent to be taught what money means with moneyand a wife to take care of it mind youyou are preeminently the man for which you want to be recognized without itharry ll excuse me i must speak plainlyyoure a sort of a spectacle of a bobcherry down on your luck up on your luck and getting dead stale and never bitten a familiar curiosity jorian added oh by jove its not nice to think of my father said harry i am sure will excuse you for talking in your extreme friendliness of matters that he and i have notand they interest us deeplyyet thought fit to discuss and you may take my word for it jorian that i will give alphonse his medical dose i am quite of your opinion that the kings of cooks require it occasionally harry will inform us of mdlle chassedianes commands the contents of the letter permitted me to read it aloud she desired to know how she could be amused on the sunday we will undertake it said my father i depute the arrangements to you jorian respect the prejudices and avoid collisions that is all captain dewitt became by convenient stages cheerful after the pink slip of paper had been made common property and from a seriouslyadvising friend in his state of spite relapsed to the idle and shadowlike associate when pleased i had to thank him for the gift of fresh perceptions surely it would be as well if my father could get a woman of fortune to take care of him we had at my request a consultation with dettermain and newson on the eve of the journey to riversley temple and jorian dewitt assisting strange documentary evidence was unfolded and compared with the date of a royal decree affidavits of persons now dead a ring the ring fans and lace and handkerchiefs with notable initials jewelry stamped to the divine anastasia from an adoring christian name old brown letters that shrieked wife when charmer seemed to have palled oaths of fidelity ran through them like bass notes jorian held up the discoloured sheets of ancient paper saying here you behold the mummy of the villain love such love as it wasthe love of the privileged butcher for the lamb the burden of the letters put in epigram was rattlesnake and bird a narrative of anastasias sister elizabeth signed and sealed with names of witnesses appended related in brief bald english the history of the events which had killed her it warmed pathetically when dwelling on the writers necessity to part with letters and papers of greater moment that she might be enabled to sustain and educate her sisters child she named the certificate she swore to the tampering with witnesses the number and exact indication of the house where the ceremony took place was stateda house in sohothe date was given and the incident on that night of the rape of the beautiful miss armett by mad lord beaumaris at the theatre doors aided by masked ruffians after anastasias performance of zamira there are witnesses i know to be still living mr temple my father said seeing the young studentatlaw silent and observant one of them i have under my hand i feed him listen to this he read two or three insufferable sentences from one of the loveepistles and broke down i was ushered aside by a member of the firm to inspect an instrument prepared to bind me as surety for the costs of the appeal i signed it we quitted the attorneys office convinced i speak of temple and myself that we had seen the shadow of something chapter xl my fathers meeting with my grandfather my fathers pleasure on the day of our journey to bulsted was to drive me out of london on a lofty open chariot with which he made the circuit of the fashionable districts and caused innumerable heads to turn i would have preferred to go the way of other men to be unnoticed but i was subject to an occasional glowing of undefined satisfaction in the observance of the universally acknowledged harmony existing between his pretensions his tastes and habits and his person he contrived by i know not what persuasiveness and simplicity of manner and speech to banish from me the idea that he was engaged in playing a high stake and though i knew it and he more than once admitted it there was an ease and mastery about him that afforded me some degree of positive comfort still i was still most securely attached to his fortunes supposing the ghost of dead hector to have hung over his body when the inflamed son of peleus whirled him at his chariot wheels round troy he would with his natural passions sobered by erebus have had some of my reflections upon force and fate and my partial sense of exhilaration in the tremendous speed of the course during the whole of the period my father termed his grand parade i showed just such acquiescence or resistance as were superinduced by the variations of the ground otherwise i was spellbound and beyond interdicting any further public mention of my name or the princesss i did nothing to thwart him it would have been no light matter we struck a station at a point halfway down to bulsted and found little kiomi there thunder in her brows carrying a bundle and purchasing a railwayticket not to travel in our direction she gave me the singular answer that she could not tell me where her people were nor would she tell me whither she was going alone and by rail i chanced to speak of heriot one of her sheetlightning flashes shot out he wont be at bulsted she said as if that had a significance i let her know we were invited to bulsted oh shes at home kiomi blinked and her features twitched like whipcord i saw that she was possessed by one of her furies that girls face had the art of making me forget beautiful women and what beauty was by comparison it happened that the squire came across us as we were rounding the slope of larch and fir plantation near a part of the riversley hollows leading to the upper heathland where behind a semicircle of birches bulsted lay he was on horseback and called hoarsely to the captains coachman who was driving us to pull up here harry he sang out to me in the same rough voice i dont see why we should bother captain william its a bit of business not pleasure ive got the book in my pocket you askis it convenient to step into my bailiffs cottage hard by and run through it ten minutes ll tell me all i want to know i want it done with ask my father stood up and bowed bareheaded my grandfather struck his hat and bobbed mr beltham i trust i see you well better sir when ive got rid of a damned unpleasant bit o business i offer you my hearty assistance do you then step down and come into my bailiffs i come sir my father alighted from the carriage the squire cast his gouty leg to be quit of his horse but not in time to check my fathers advances and ejaculations of condolence gout mr beltham is a little too much a proof to us of a long line of ancestry his hand and arm were raised in the form of a splint to support the squire who glared back over his cheekbone horrified that he could not escape the contact and in too great pain from arthritic throes to protest he resembled a burglar surprised by justice what infernal nonsense fellow talking now i heard him mutter between his hoppings and dancings with one foot in the stirrup and a toe to earth the enemy at his heel and his inclination half bent upon swinging to the saddle again i went to relieve him damn oh its you said he the squire directed uberly acting as his groom to walk his horse up and down the turf fronting young tom eckerthys cottage and me to remain where i was then hobbled up to the door followed at a leisurely march by my father the door opened my father swept the old man in before him with a bow and flourish that admitted of no contradiction and the door closed on them i caught a glimpse of uberly screwing his wrinkles in a queer grimace while he worked his left eye and thumb expressively at the cottage by way of communicating his mind to samuel captain bulsteds coachman and i became quite of his opinion as to the nature of the meeting that it was comical and not likely to lead to much i thought of the princess and of my hope of her depending upon such an interview as this from that hour when i stepped on the sands of the continent to the day of my quitting them i had been folded in a dream i had stretched my hands to the highest things of earth and here now was the retributive material moneyquestion like a keen scytheblade the cottagedoor continued shut the heaths were darkening i heard a noise of wheels and presently the unmistakable voice of janet saying that must be harry she was driving my aunt dorothy both of them hushed at hearing that the momentous duel was in progress janets first thought was of the squire i wont have him ride home in the dark she said and ordered uberly to walk the horse home the ladies had a ladies altercation before janet would permit my aunt to yield her place and proceed on foot accompanied by me naturally the best driver of the two kept the whip i told samuel to go on to bulsted with word that we were coming and janet nodding bluntly agreed to direct my father as to where he might expect to find me on the riversley road my aunt dorothy and i went ahead slowly at her request i struck a pathway to avoid the ponycarriage which was soon audible and when janet chattering to the squire had gone by we turned back to intercept my father he was speechless at the sight of dorothy beltham at his solicitation she consented to meet him next day his account of the result of the interview was unintelligible to her as well as to me even after leaving her at the parkgates i could get nothing definite from him save that all was well and that the squire was eminently practical but he believed he had done an excellent evenings work yes said he rubbing his hands excellent making due allowances for the emphatically commoners mind we have to deal with and then to change the subject he dilated on that strange story of the man who an enormous number of years back in the date of the worlds history carried his little son on his shoulders one night when the winds were not so boisterous though we were deeper in winter along the identical road we traversed between the gorsemounds across the heaths with yonder remembered firtree clump in sight and the wastewater visible to footfarers rounding under the firs at nighttime he vowed that as far as nature permitted it he had satisfied the squirecompletely satisfied him i mean he said to give me sound sleep no doubt of it no doubt of it richie he won julias heart straight off and captain bulsteds profound admiration now i know the man ive always been adoring since you were so high harry said she captain bulsted sighed your husband bows to your high good taste my dear they relished him sincerely and between them and him i suffered myself to be dandled once more into a state of credulity until i saw my aunt dorothy in the afternoon subsequent to the appointed meeting his deep respect and esteem for her had stayed him from answering any of her questions falsely to that extent he had been veracious it appeared that driven hard by the squire who would have no waving of flags and lighting of fireworks in a matter of business and whose commoners mind chafed sturdily at a hint of the necessity for lavish outlays where there was a princess to win he had rallied on the fiction that many of the cheques standing for the bulk of the sums expended were moneys borrowed by him of me which he designed to repay and was prepared to repay instantlycould in fact the squire demanding it repay as it were on the spot for behold these borrowed moneys were not spent they were moneys invested in undertakings put out to high rates of interest moneys that perhaps it would not be adviseable to call in without a season of delay still if mr beltham acting for his grandson and heir insisted it should be done the moneys had been borrowed purely to invest them with profit on my behalf a gentlemans word of honour was pledged to it the squire grimly gave him a couple of months to make it good dorothy beltham and my father were together for about an hour at eckerthys farm she let my father kiss her hand when he was bending to take his farewell of her but held her face away he was in manifest distress hardly master of his voice begged me to come to him soon and bowing with god bless you madam my friend on earth turned his heel bearing his elastic frame lamentably a sad or a culprit air did not befit him one reckoned up his foibles and errors when seeing him under a partly beaten aspect at least i did not my dear aunt who was compassionate of him however thoroughly she condemned his ruinous extravagance and the shifts and evasions it put him to she feared that instead of mending the difficulty he had postponed merely to exaggerate it in the squires mind and she was now of opinion that the bringing him down to meet the squire was very bad policy likely to result in danger to my happiness for if the money should not be forthcoming on the date named all my fathers faults would be transferred to me as his accomplice both in the original wastefulness and the subterfuges invented to conceal it i recollected that a sum of money had really been sunk in prince ernests coalmine my aunt said she hoped for the best mounting the heaths we looked back on the long yellow road where the carriage conveying my father to the railwaystation was visible and talked of him and of the elements of antique tragedy in his history which were at that period let me say precisely what my incessant mental efforts were strained to expel from the idea of our human life the individuals freedom was my tenet of faith but pity pleaded for him that he was wellnigh irresponsible was shamefully sinned against at his birth one who could charge the gods with vindictiveness and complain of the persecution of natal furies my aunt dorothy advised me to take him under my charge and sell his house and furniture make him live in bachelor chambers with his faithful waitingwoman and a single manservant he will want money even to do that i remarked she murmured is there not some annual income paid to him her quick delicacy made her redden in alluding so closely to his personal affairs and i loved her for the nice feeling it was not much i said the miserable attempt to repair the wrongs done to him with this small annuity angered meand i remembered little pleased the foolish expectations he founded on this secret acknowledgement of the justice of his claims we wont talk of it i pursued i wish he had never touched it i shall interdict him you would let him pay his debts with it harry i am not sure aunty that he does not incur a greater debt by accepting it ones wish would be that he might not ever be in need of it ay or never be caring to find the key of it that must be waste of time she said i meant something else but it was useless to tell her so chapter xli commencement of the splendours and perplexities of my fathers grand parade janet in reply to our inquiries as to the condition of the squires temper pointed out in the newspaper a notification of a grand public ball to be given by my father the first of a series of three and said that the squire had seen it and shrugged she thought there was no positive cause for alarm even though my father should fail of his word but expressed her view decidedly that it was an unfortunate move to bring him between the squire and me and so she blamed captain bulsted this was partly for the reason that the captain and his wife charmed by my father were for advocating his merits at the squires table our ingenuity was ludicrously taxed to mystify him on the subject of their extravagant eulogies they told him they had been invited and were going to the great london balls subscription balls asked the squire no sir rejoined the captain tradesmens balls dye call em then no sir they are balls given by a distinguished gentleman take care its not another name for tradesmens balls william i do not attend tradesmens balls sir take care o that william the captain was very angry what said he turning to us what does the squire mean by telling an officer of the royal navy that he is conducting his wife to a tradesmens ball julia threatened malicious doings for the insult she and the squire had a controversy upon the explication of the word gentleman she describing my fathers appearance and manners to the life now listen to me squire a gentleman i say is one youd say if he wasnt born a duke he ought to have been and more shame to the title he turns the key of a ladys heart with a twinkle of his eye hes never meanwhat he has is yours hes a true friend and if he doesnt keep his word you know in a jiffy its the fault of affairs and stands about five feet eleven hes a fullblown man and so forth the squire listened and perspired at finding the object of his abhorrence crowned thus in the unassailable realms of the abstract julia might have done it more elegantly but her husband was rapturous over her skill in portraiture and he added thats a gentleman squire and thats a man pretty sure to be abused by half the world threequarters william said the squire theres about the computation for your gentlemans creditors i suspect ay sir well returned the captain to whom this kind of fencing in the dark was an affliction we make it up in qualityin quality ill be bound you do said the squire and so you will so long as youre only asked to dance to the other poor devils fiddling captain bulsted bowed the last word to you squire the squire nodded ill hand it to your wife william julia took it graciously a perfect gentleman perfect confound his enemies why maam you might keep from swearing the squire bawled la squire said she why dont you know the national anthem national anthem maam and a fellow a velvettonguedconfound him if you like and wheres my last word if you please julia jumped up and dropped a provoking curtsey you silly old grandada said janet going round to him dont you see the cunning woman wants to dress you in our garments and means to boast of it to us while youre finishing your wine the old man fondled her i could have done the same she bent over him with such homely sweetness one comfort you wont go to these gingerbread balls he said im not invited she moaned comically no nor shant be while i can keep you out of bad company but grandada i do like dancing dance away my dear ive no objection but wheres the music oh you can always have music but where are my partners the squire pointed at me you dont want more than one at a time eh he corrected his error no the fellows engaged in another quadrille mind you miss janet he shall dance to your tune yet dye hear sir the irritation excited by captain bulsted and julia broke out in fury whos that fellow danced when rome was burning the emperor nero said janet he killed harrys friend seneca in the eightysomethingth year of his age an old man andhush grandada she could not check him hark you mr harry dance your hardest up in town with your rips and reps and the lot of ye all very fine while the burning goes on you wont see the fun of dancing on the ashes a nice king of rome nero was next morning by the lord if i couldnt swear youll be down on your knees to an innocent freshhearted girls worth five hundred of the crew youre for partnering now while youve a penny for the piper janet shut his mouth kissed him and held his wine up he drank and thumped the table wes have parties here too the girl shall have her choice of partners she shant be kept in the background by a young donkey take any six of your own age and six sensible men to try you by your chances by george the whole dozen d bring you in noncompos youve only got the women on your side because of a smart face and figure janet exclaimed indignantly grandada im offended with you and walked out on a high step come if he has the women on his side said captain bulsted mildly hell be able to go partnering and gallopading as long as his banker ll let him williamlike your gentleman thats true we shall soon see i leave my character in your hands sir said i rising if you would scold me in private i should prefer it on behalf of your guests but i am bound to submit to your pleasure and under any circumstances i remember what you appear to forget that you are my grandfather so saying i followed the ladies it was not the wisest of speeches and happened captain bulsted informed me to be delivered in my fathers manner for the squire pronounced emphatically that he saw very little beltham in me the right course would have been for me to ask him then and there whether i had his consent to start for germany but i was the sport of resentments and apprehensions and indeed i should not have gone i could not go without some title beyond that of the heir of great riches janet kept out of my sight i found myself strangely anxious to console her less sympathetic perhaps than desirous to pour out my sympathy in her ear which was of a very pretty shape with a soft unpierced lobe we danced together at the riversley ball given by the squire on the night of my fathers ball in london janet complimented me upon having attained wisdom now we get on well she said grandada only wants to see us friendly and feel that i am not neglected the old man a martyr to what he considered due to his favourite endured the horror of the ball until suppertime and kept his eyes on us two he forgot or pretended to forget my foreign engagement altogether though the announcement in the newspapers was spoken of by sir roderick and lady echester and others how do you like that he remarked to me seeing her twirled away by one of the young rubreys she seems to like it sir i replied like it said he in my day you wouldnt have caught me letting the bloom be taken off the girl i cared for by a parcel o scampish young dogs right in their arms look at her build shes strong shes healthy she goes round like a tower if you want a girl to look like a princess his eulogies were not undeserved but she danced as lightly and happily with mr fred rubrey as with harry richmond i congratulated myself on her lack of sentiment later when in london where mlle jenny chassediane challenged me to perilous sarabandes i wished that janet had ever so small a grain of sentiment for a preservative to me ottilia glowed high and distant she sent me no message her image did not step between me and disorder the whole structure of my idea of my superior nature seemed to be crumbling to fragments and beginning to feel in despair that i was wretchedly like other men i lost by degrees the sense of my hold on her it struck me that my worst fears of the effect produced on the princesss mind by that last scene in the lakepalace must be true and i abandoned hope temple thought she tried me too cruelly under these circumstances i became less and less resolutely disposed to renew the forlorn conflict with my father concerning his prodigal way of living let it last as long as i have a penny to support him i exclaimed he said that dettermain and newson were now urging on his case with the utmost despatch in order to keep pace with him but that the case relied for its life on his preserving a great appearance he handed me his division of our twin chequebooks telling me he preferred to depend on his son for supplies and i was in the mood to think this a partial security but you can take what there is i said on the contrary i will accept nothing but minor sumsso to speak the fractional shillings though i confess i am always bewildered by silver said he i questioned him upon his means of carrying on his expenditure his answer was to refer to the pavement of the city of london by paving here and there he had he informed me made a concrete for the wheels to roll on he calculated that he now had credit for the space of three new yearsample time for him to fight his fight and win his victory my tradesmen are not like the tradesmen of other persons he broke out with a curious neigh of supreme satisfaction in that retinue they believe in me i have de facto harnessed them to my fortunes and if you doubt me on the point of success i refer you to dettermain and newson all i stipulate for is to maintain my position in society to throw a lustre on my case so much i must do my failures hitherto have been entirely owing to the fact that i had not my son to stand by me then you must have money sir yes money then what can you mean by refusing mine i admit the necessity for it my son say you hand me a cheque for a temporary thousand your credit and mine in conjunction can replace it before the expiration of the two months or he meditated it might be better to give a bond or so to a professional lender and preserve the account at your bankers intact the truth is i have in my interview with the squire drawn in advance upon the material success i have a perfect justification to anticipate and i cannot allow the old gentleman to suppose that i retrench for the purpose of giving a large array of figures to your bankers book it would be sheer madness i cannot do it i cannot afford to do it when you are on a runaway horse i prefer to say a racehorserichie you must ride him you dare not throw up the reins only last night wedderburn appealing to loftus a practical sailor was approved when he offeredi forget the subjectmatterthe illustration of a ship on a leeshore you are lost if you do not spread every inch of canvas to the gale retrenchment at this particular moment is perdition count our gains richie we have won a princess i called to him not to name her he persisted half a minute she is won she is ours and let me in passingbear with me one secondcounsel you to write to prince ernest instanter proposing formally for his daughter and in your grandfathers name state her dowry at fifty thousand per annum oh you forget i interjected no richie i do not forget that you are off a leeshore you are mounted on a skittish racehorse with if you like a new forest fly operating within an inch of his bellygirths our situation is so far ticklish and prompts invention and audacity you must forget sir that in the present state of the squires mind i should be simply lying in writing to the prince that he offers a dowry no for your grandfather has yielded consent by implication you know he withdraws it but if i satisfy him that you have not been extravagant i must wait till he is satisfied the thing is done richie done i see it in advanceit is done whatever befalls me you my dear boy in the space of two months may graspyour fortune besides here is my hand i swear by it my son that i shall satisfy the squire i go farther i say i shall have the means to refund to youthe means the money the marriage is announced in our prints for the summersay early june and i undertake that you the husband of the princess shall be the first gentleman in englandthat is europe oh not ruling a coterie not dazzling the world with entertainments he thought himself in earnest when he said i attach no mighty importance to these things though there is no harm i can perceive in leading the fashionnone that i see in having a consummate style i know your taste and hers richie the noble ladys she shall govern the intellectual worldyour poets your painters your men of science they reflect a beautiful sovereign mistress more exquisitely than almost aristocracy does but you head our aristocracy also you are a centre of the political world so i scheme it between you i defy the court to rival you this i call distinction it is no mean aim by heaven i protest it is an aim with the mark in sight and not out of range he whipped himself up to one of his oratorical frenzies of which a cheque was the common fruit the power of his persuasiveness in speech backed by the spectacle of his social accomplishments continued to subdue me and i protested only inwardly even when i knew that he was gambling with fortune i wrote out many cheques and still it appeared to me that they were barely sufficient to meet the current expenses of his household temple and i calculated that his grand parade would try the income of a duke and could but be a matter of months mention of it reached riversley from various quarters from lady maria higginson from captain bulsted and his wife and from sir roderick ilchester who said to me with fine accentuation i have met your father sir roderick an englishman reputed of good breeding informed the son that he had actually met the father in lofty society at viscountess sedleys at lady dolchesters at bramham dewitts and heard of him as a frequenter of the prussian and austrian embassy entertainments and also that he was admitted to the exclusive dinnerparties of the countess de strode which are he observed in the moderated tone of an astonishment devoting itself to propagation the cream of society indubitably then my father was an impostor more society proved it the squire listened like one pelted by a storm sure of his day to come at the close of the two months i gained his commendation by shunning the metropolitan balls nor did my father press me to appear at them it was tacitly understood between us that i should now and then support him at his dinnertable and pass bowing among the most select of his great ladies and this i did and i felt at home with them though i had to bear with roughnesses from one or two of the more venerable dames which were not quite proper to good breeding old lady kane greataunt of the marquis of edbury was particularly my tormentor through her plainspoken comments on my fathers legal suit for i had to listen to her without wincing and agree in her general contempt of the georges and foil her queries coolly when i should have liked to perform jorian dewitts expressed wish to squeeze the acid out of her in one grip and toss her to the gods that collect exhausted lemons she took extraordinary liberties with me why not marry an englishwoman rich young men ought to choose wives from their own people out of their own sets foreign women never get on well in this country unless they join the hounds to hunt the husband she cited naturalized ladies famous for the pastime her world and its outskirts she knew thoroughly even to the fact of my grandfathers desire that i should marry janet ilchester she named a dukes daughter an earls of course i should have to stop the scandal otherwise the choice i had was unrestricted my father she evidently disliked but she just as much disliked an encounter with his invincible bonhomie and dexterous tongue she hinted at family reasons for being shy of him assuring me that i was not implicated in them the guelph pattern was never much to my taste she said and it consoled me with the thought that he was not ranked as an adventurer in the houses he entered i learned that he was supposed to depend chiefly on my vast resources edbury acted the part of informant to the inquisitive harridan her poor dear goodfornothing edbury whose only cure would be a nice wellconducted girl an heiress she had cast her eye on anna penrhys but considered her antecedents doubtful spotless innocence was the sole receipt for edburys malady my father in a fit of bold irony proposed lady kane for president of his tattle and scandal cluba club of ladies dotted with select gentlemen the idea of which jorian dewitt claimed the merit of starting and my father surrendered it to him with the reservation that jorian intended an association of backbiters pledged to reveal all they knew whereas the club in its present form was an engine of morality and decency and a social safeguard as well as an amusement it comprised a committee of investigation and a court of appeal its object was to arraign slander lady kane declined the honour i am not a washerwoman she said to me and spoke of where dirty linen should be washed and was distressingly broad in her innuendoes concerning edburys stepmother this club sat and became a terror for a month adding something to my fathers reputation his inexhaustible conversational art and humour gave it such vitality as it had ladies of any age might apply for admission when well seconded gentlemen under fortyfive years were rigidly excluded and the seniors must also have passed through the marriage ceremony outside tattle and scandal declared that the club was originated to serve as a club for lady edbury but i chose to have no opinion upon what i knew nothing of these matters were all ephemeral and freaks they produced however somewhat of the same effect on me as on my father in persuading me that he was born for the sphere he occupied and rendering me rather callous as to the sources of ways and means i put my name to a bond for several thousand pounds in conjunction with lord edbury thinking my father right in wishing to keep my chequebook unworried lest the squire should be seized with a spasm of curiosity before the two months were over i promise you i surprise him my father said repeatedly he did not say how i had the suspicion that he did not know his confidence and my growing recklessness acted in unison happily the newspapers were quiet i hoped consequently to find peace at riversley but there the rumours of the grand parade were fabulous thanks to captain bulsted and julia among others these two again provoked an outbreak of rage from the squire and i after hearing them was almost disposed to side with him they suggested an inexplicable magnificence and created an image of a man portentously endowed with the capacity to throw dust in the eyes no description of the balls could have furnished me with such an insight of their brilliancy as the consuming ardour they awakened in the captain and his wife he reviewed them princely entertainments arabian nights she built them up piecemeal the company the dresses the band the supper the host was a personage supernatural aladdins magician if you like said julia onlygood a perfect gentleman and ill say again confound his enemies she presumed as she was aware she might do upon the squires prepossession in her favour without reckoning that i was always the victim heard o that new story bout a dauphin he asked a dauphin quoth captain bulsted i dont know the fish youve been in a pretty kettle of em lately william i heard of it yesterday on the bench lord shale our new lordlieutenant brought it down a trick they played the fellow bout a dauphin serve him right you heard anything bout it harry i had not but i tell ye there is a dauphin mixed up with him a dauphin and mr ik dine mr ik dine exclaimed the captain perplexed ay thats german lingo william and you ought to know it if youre a loyal sailormeans i serve mr beltham said the captain seriously i give you my word of honour as a man and a british officer i dont understand one syllable of what youre saying but if it means any insinuation against the gentleman who condescends to extend his hospitalities to my wife and me i must with regret quit the place where i have had the misfortune to hear it you stop where you are william the squire motioned to him gad i shall have to padlock my mouth or i shant have a friend left soon confounded fellow i tell you they call him mr ik dine in town ik dine and a dauphin they made a regular clown and pantaloon o the pair im told couple o pretenders to thrones invited to dine together and talk over their chances and show their private marks oho byandby william you and i never a man made such a fool

committed as a common vagabond and would be anywhere but in london id jail him fore you cocked your eye twice fellow came here and talked me over to grant him a couple o months to prove he hasnt

of your inheritance from your poor brokenhearted mother with interest and treat you like a man and never played spy never made an inquiry till i heard the scamp had been fastening on you like a bloodsucker and singing hymns into the ears of that squeamish dolt of a pipesmoking parson peterboroughnever thought of doing it am i the man that dragged your grandmothers name through the streets and soiled yours i remarked that i was sensible of the debt of gratitude i owed to him but would rather submit to the scourge or to destitution than listen to these attacks on my father cut yourself loose harry he cried a trifle mollified dont season his stewdye hear stick to decent people why you dont expect hell be locked up in the tower for a finish eh itll be newgate or the bench he and his dauphinha ha a rascal crow and a jack dauphin captain bulsted reached me his hand you have a great deal to bear harry i commend you my boy for taking it manfully i say no more quoth the squire but what i said was true the fellow gives his little dinners and suppers to his marchionesses countesses duchesses and plays clown and pantaloon among the men he thinks a parcel o broidered petticoats ll float him so they may till a tradesman sent stark mad pops a pin into him harry id as lief hang on to a fireship heres ilchester tells me and ilchester speaks of him under his breath now as if he were sitting in a pew funking the parson confound the fellow i say hes guilty of treason pooh who cares he cuts out the dandies of his day does he hes past sixty if hes a month its all damned harlequinade let him twirl off one columbine or another or a dozen and thenthe last of him fellow makes the world look like a farce hes got about eight feet by five to caper on and all london gaping at himgeese are you a gentleman and a man of sense harry richmond to let yourself be lugged about in publicby the lord like a pair of streettumblers in spangled haunchbags father and boy on a patch of carpet and a drum banging and tossed and turned inside out and my god the ass of a fellow strutting the ring with you on his shoulder thats the spectacle and you harry now ill ask you do you mean your wifeegad itd be a pretty scene with your princess in hipup petticoats stiff as bottlefunnel top downards airing a whole leg and knuckling a tambourine not crying my dear lad captain bulsted put his arm round me kindly and tried to catch a glimpse of my face i let him see i was not going through that process whew said he and enough to make any christian sweat youre in a bath harry i wouldnt expect the man who murdered his godmother for one shilling and fivepence threefarthings the other day to take such a slinging and think he deserved it my power of endurance had reached its limit you tell me sir you had this brutal story from the lordlieutenant of the county ay from lord shale but i wont have you going to him and betraying our connection with a halloo captain bulsted sang out to his wife on the lawn and now squire i have had my dose and you will permit me to observe that i find it emphatically what we used to call at school blackjack and you were all the better for it afterwards william we did not arrive at that opinion sir harry your arm an hour with the ladies will do us both good the squire he murmured wiping his forehead as he went out has a knack of bringing us into close proximity with hellfire when he pleases julia screamed on beholding us arent you two men as pale as death janet came and looked merely a dose said the captain we are anxious to play battledore and shuttlecock madly so he shall the dear julia caressed him well all have a tournament in the wetweather shed janet whispered to me was itthe returning thanks the what said i with the dread at my heart of something worse than i had heard she hailed julia to run and fetch the battledores and then told me she had been obliged to confiscate the newspapers that morning and cast the burden on postoffice negligence they reach grandadas hands by afternoon post harry and he finds objectionable passages blotted or cut out and as long as the scissors dont touch the business columns and the debates he never asks me what i have been doing he thinks i keep a scrapbook i havent often time in the morning to run an eye all over the paper this morning it was the first thing i saw what had she seen she led me out of view of the windows and showed me my father was accused of having stood up at a public dinner and returned thanks on behalf of an estate of the realm it read monstrously i ceased to think of the suffering inflicted on me by my grandfather janet and i side by side with the captain and julia carried on the game of battledore and shuttlecock in a match to see whether the unmarried could keep the shuttle flying as long as the married with varying fortunes she gazed on me to give me the comfort of her sympathy too much and i was too intent on the vision of my father either persecuted by lies or guilty of hideous follies to allow the match to be a fair one so julia could inform the squire that she and william had given the unmarried pair a handsome beating when he appeared peeping round one of the shedpillars of course you beat em said the squire its not my girls fault he said more to the old tune which drove janet away i remembered when back in the london vortex the curious soft beauty she won from casting up her eyes to watch the descending feathers and the brilliant direct beam of those thickbrowed firm clear eyes with her frown and her set lips and brave figure when she was in the act of striking to keep up a regular quick fusilade i had need of calm memories the town was astir and humming with one name chapter xlii the marquis of edbury and his puppet i passed from man to man hearing hints and hesitations alarming halfremarks presumed to be addressed to one who could supply the remainder and deduce consequences there was a clearer atmosphere in the street of clubs jennings was the first of my fathers more intimate acquaintances to meet me frankly he spoke though not with great seriousness of the rumour of a possible prosecution sir weeton slater tripped up to us with a mixed air of solicitude and restraint asked whether i was well and whether i had seen the newspapers that morning and on my informing him that i had just come up from riversley on account of certain rumours advised me to remain in town strictly for the present he also hinted at rumours of prosecutions the fact is he began several times rendered discreet i suppose by my juvenility fiert and reputed wealth we were joined by admiral loftus and lord alton they queried and counterqueried as to passages between my father and the newspapers my father and the committee of his club preserving sufficient consideration for me to avoid the serious matter in all but distant allusions a point upon which the breeding of mr serjeant wedderburn was not so accurate a guide to him an exciting public scandal soon gathers knots of gossips in clubland we saw wedderburn break from a group some way down the pavement and pick up a fresh crumb of amusement at one of the doorsteps roy richmond is having his benefit today he said and repeated this and that half audible to me for the rest he poohpoohed the idea of the law intervening his how dye do mr richmond how dye do was almost congratulatory i think we meet at your fathers table tonight it wont be in the tower take my word for it oh the papers theres no act to compel a man to deny what appears in the papers no such luck as the towerthough littlepitt mr wedderburns nickname for our premier would be fool enough for that he would if he could turn attention from his bill hed do it we should have to dine off boleyns blockcoquite horum obsonia hed say eh jennings espied my fathers carriage and stepped to speak a word to the footman he returned saying with a puff of his cheeks the grand monarque has been sending his state equipage to give the old backbiting cripple brisby an airing he is for horse exercise today theyve dropped him in courtenay square there goes brisby hed take the good samaritans shilling to buy a flask of poison for him hes use roys carriage to fetch and carry for that venomous old woman kane ill swear shes a male in scripture said wedderburn and this reminded me of an anecdote that reminded him of another and after telling them he handed round his hat for the laugh as my father would have phrased it has her ladyship declared war sir weeton slater inquired no thats not her preliminary to wageing it wedderburn replied these highpressure smart talkers had a moment of dulness and he bethought him that he must run into the club for letters and was busy at westminster where if anything fresh occurred between meridian and six oclock he should be glad he said to have word of it by messenger that he might not be behind his age the form of humour to express the speed of the world was common but it struck me as a terrible illustration of my fathers i had still a sense of pleasure in the thought that these intimates of his were gentlemen who relished and perhaps really liked him they were not parasites not the kind of men found hanging about vulgar profligates i quitted them sir weeton slater walked halfadozen steps beside me may i presume on a friendly acquaintance with your father mr richmond he said the fact isyou will not be offendedhe is apt to lose his head unless the committee of supply limits him very precisely i am aware that there is no material necessity for any restriction he nodded to me as to one of the marvellously endowed as who should say the gods presided at your birth the worthy baronet struggled to impart his meaning which was that he would have me define something like an allowance to my father not so much for the purpose of curtailing his expenditurehe did not venture upon private groundas to bridle my fathers ideas of things possible for a private gentleman in this country in that character none were like him as to his suit or appeal he could assure me that serjeant wedderburn and all who would or could speak on the subject saw no prospect of success not any the worst of it was that it caused my father to commit himself in sundry ways it gave a handle to his enemies ithe glanced at me indicatively i thanked the wellmeaning gentleman without encouraging him to continue it led him to perform once more as a statue of bronze before the whole of gaping london i could have added that scene on the pinepromontory arose in my vision followed by other scenes of the happy german days i had no power to conjure up the princess jorian dewitt was the man i wanted to see after applications at his club and lodgings i found him dragging his burgundy leg in the park on his road to pay a morning visit to his fair french enchantress i impeached him and he pleaded guilty clearly not wishing to take me with him nor would he give me mlle jennys address which i had by virtue of the threat that i would accompany him if he did not satisfy me i managed to extract the story of the dauphin aghast at the discovery of its being true the fatal afterdinner speech he believed to have been actually spoken and he touched on that first a trap was laid for him harry richmond and a deuced clever trap it was they smuggled in special reporters there wasnt a bit of necessity for the toast but the old vixen has shown her hand so now he must fight he can beat her singlehanded on settees hell find her a tartar at long bowls she sticks at nothing she blazes out that he scandalizes her family she has a dozen indictments against him you must stop in town and keep watch theres fire in my leg to explode a powdermagazine a mile off is it the margravine of rippau i inquired i could think of no other waspish old woman lady kane said jorian she set edbury on to face him with the dauphin you dont fancy it came of the young dog all of himself do you why it was clever he trots about a briefless little barrister a scribbler devilish clever and impudent who does his farces for him tenbys the fellows name and its the only thing i havent heard him pun on puns are the smallpox of the languagewere cursed with an epidemic by gad the next time i meet him ill roar out for vaccine matter he described the dinner given by edbury at a celebrated city tavern where my father and this socalled dauphin were brought together dinner tonight he nodded as he limped away on his blissful visit of ceremony to sprightly chassediane a bouquet had gone in advance he left me stupefied the sense of ridicule enveloped me in suffocating folds howling sentences of the squires boeotian burlesque by fits i felt that i could not but take the worlds part against the man who allowed himself to be made preposterous externally when i knew him to be staking his frail chances and my fortune with such rashness it was unpardonable for one in his position to incur ridicule nothing but a sense of duty kept me from rushing out of london and i might have indulged the impulse advantageously delay threw me into the clutches of lady kane herself on whom i looked with as composed a visage as i could command while she leaned out of her carriage chattering at me and sometimes over my head to passing gentlemen she wanted me to take a seat beside her she had so much to say was there not some funny story abroad of a pretender to the throne of france she asked wrinkling her crowsfeet eyelids to peer at me and wished to have the particulars i had none to offer ah well said she you stay in london come and see me im sure youre sensible you and i can put our heads together hes too often in courtenay square and hes ten years too young for that still he ought to have good advice tell me how can a woman who cant guide herself help a manand the most difficult man alive im sure you understand me i cant drive out in the afternoon for them they make a crush here and a clatter of tongues thats my private grievance but hes now keeping persons away who have the first social claim i know they cant appear dont look confused no one accuses you only i do say its getting terribly hot in london for somebody call on me will you she named her hours i bowed as soon as i perceived my opportunity her allusions were to lady edbury and to imputed usurpations of my fathers i walked down to the chambers where temple was reading law for a refuge from these annoyances i was in love with the modest shadowed life temple lived diligently reading and glancing on the world as through a dusky window happy to let it run its course while he sharpened his weapons a look at temples face told me he had heard quite as much as was known in the west dininghalls of lawyers are not cistercian he was able to give me three distinct versions of the story of the dauphin no one could be friendlier indeed temple now urged me forcibly to prevent my father from spending money and wearing his heart out in vain by stopping the case in dettermain and newsons hands they were respectable lawyers he said in a lawyers ordinary tone when including such of his species as are not black sheep he thought it possible that my fathers personal influence overbore their judgment in fact nothing bound them to refuse to work for him and he believed that they had submitted their views for his consideration i do wish hed throw it up temple exclaimed it makes him enemies and just examining it you see he could get no earthly good out of it he might as well try to scale a perpendicular rock but when im with him im ready to fancy what he pleasesi acknowledge that he has excess of phosphorus or hes ultraelectrical doctors could tell us better than lawyers temple spoke of the clever young barrister tenby as the man whom his father had heard laughing over the trick played upon roy richmond i conceived that i might furnish mr tenby a livelier kind of amusement and the thought that i had once been sur le terrain and had bitterly regretted it by no means deterred me from the idea of a second expedition so black was my mood a review of the circumstances aided by what reached my ears before the night went over convinced me that edbury was my man his subordinate helped him to the instrument and possibly to the plot but edbury was the capital offender the scene of the prank was not in itself so bad as the stuff which a cunning anecdotist could make out of it edbury invited my father to a dinner at a celebrated city tavern he kept his guests jennings jorian dewitt alton wedderburn were among the few i was acquainted with who were present awaiting the arrival of a person for whom he professed extraordinary respect the dauphin of france was announced a mild flabby amiablelooking old person with shelving forehead and grey locksexcellently built for the object jorian saidentered the capet head and embonpoint were there as far as a personal resemblance might go his pretensions to be the longlost dauphin were grotesquely convincing for notwithstanding the accurate picture of the family presented by him the man was a pattern bourgeoisa sturdy impostor one would have thought and i thought so when i heard of him but i have been assured that he had actually grown old in the delusion that he carrying on his business in the city of london was the identical dauphin edbury played his part by leading his poor old victim half way to meet his other most honoured guest hesitating then and craving counsel whether he was right in etiquette to advance the dauphin so far the dauphin left him mildly to decide the point he was eminently mild throughout and seems to have thought himself in good faith surrounded by believers and adherents edburys task soon grew too delicate for that coarse boy in my fathers dexterous hands he at once lost his assumption of the gallantry of manner which could alone help him to retain his advantage when the wine was in him he began to bawl i could imagine the sort of dialogue he raised bets on the dauphin bets on roy they were matched as on a racecourse the dauphin remembered incidents of his residence in the temple with a beautiful juvenile faintness a conscientious angling for recollection wedderburn said roy was requested to remember something to drink and refresh his memory infantine incidents were suggested he fenced the treacherous host during dinner with superb complacency the dauphin was of an immoveable composure he stated simple facts he was the dauphin of france providentially rescued from the temple in the days of the terror for this deliverance somewhat to the consternation of the others he offered up a short prayer of thanksgiving over his plate he had he said encountered incredulity he had his proofs he who had never been on the soil of france since early boyhood spoke french with a pure accent he had the physical and moral constitution of the family owing to events attending his infant days he was timid jorian imitated himi start at the opening of a door i see dark faces in my sleep it is a dungeon i am at the knees of my unfortunate royal father with my beautiful mother his french was quaint but not absurd he became loquacious apostrophizing vacancy with uplifted hand and eye the unwonted invitation to the society of noblemen made him conceive his dauphinship to be on the high road to a recognition in england and he was persuaded to drink and exhibit proofs which were that he had the constitution of the family as aforesaid in every particular that he was peculiarly marked with testificatory spots and that his mere aspect inspired all members and branch members of the family with awe and stupefaction one of the latter hearing of him had appointed to meet him in a pastrycooks shop he met him and left the place with a cloud on his brow showing tokens of respectful sympathy conceive a monomaniacal obese old english citizen given to lift hand and eye and address the cornices claiming to be an illustrious boy and calling on a beautiful historic mother and unfortunate royal sire to attest it no wonder the table was shaken with laughter he appealed to tenby constantly as to the one man he knew in the room tenby it was who made the discovery of him somewhere in the city where he earned his livelihood either as a cornmerchant or a stockbroker or a chronometermaker or a drysalter and was always willing to gratify a customer with the sight of his proofs of identity mr tenby made it his business to push his clamorous waggishness for the exhibition i could readily believe that my father was more than his match in disposable sallies and weight of humour and that he shielded the old creature successfully so long as he had a tractable being to protect but the dauphin was plied with wine and the marquis had his fun proof upon proof in verification of his claims was proffered by the nowtremulous son of st louisso he called himself with jorian admitted a real courtly dignity he stood up and proposed to lead the way to any neighbouring cabinet to show the spots on his person living witnesses to the truth of his allegations he declared them to be the squire had authority for his broad farce except in so far as he mixed up my father in the swinery of it i grew more and more convinced that my father never could have lost his presence of mind when he found himself in the net of a plot to cover him with ridicule he was the only one who did not retire to the dauphins chamber of testification to return convulsed with vinous laughter after gravely inspecting the evidence for which abstention the dauphin reproached him violently in round terms of abuse challengeing him to go through a similar process this was the signal for edbury tenby and some of the rest they formed a circle onehalf for the dauphin one for roy how long the boorish fun lasted and what exactly came of it i did not hear jorian dewitt said my father lost his temper a point contested by wedderburn and jennings for it was unknown of him anyhow he thundered to some effect inasmuch as he detached those that had gentlemanly feelings from the wanton roysterers and next day the latter pleaded wine but they told the story not without embellishments the world followed their example i dined and slept at temples house not caring to meet my incarnate humiliation i sent to hear that he was safe a quiet evening with a scholarly man and a man of strong practical ability and shrewdness like mr temple did me good i wished my father and i were on the same footing as he and his son and i may add his daughters they all talked sensibly they were at feud with nobody they reflected their condition it was a simple orderly english household of which the father was the pillar the girls the ornaments the son the hope growing to take his fathers place my envy of such a home was acute and i thought of janet and how well she was fashioned to build one resembling it if only the mate allotted to her should not be a fantastical dreamer temples character seemed to me to demand a wife like janet on its merits an idea that depressed me exceedingly i had introduced temple to anna penrhys who was very kind to him but these two were not framed to be other than friends janet on the contrary might some day perceive the sterling fellow temple was notwithstanding his moderate height she might i thought i remembered that i had once wished that she would and i was amazed at myself but why she was a girl sure to marry i brushed these meditations away they recurred all the time i was in temples house mr temple waited for my invitation to touch on my fathers case when he distinctly pronounced his opinion that it could end but in failure though a strict constitutionalist he had words of disgust for princes acknowledging however that we were not practical in our use of them and kept them for political purposes often to the perversion of our social laws and their natural dispositions he spoke of his sons freak in joining the navy that was the princesss doing said temple she talked of our naval heroes till she made me feel i had only to wear the anchor buttons to be one myself dont tell her i was invalided from the service richie for the truth is i believe i halfshammed and the time wont be lost youll see i shall extract guineas from old ocean like salt precious few barristers understand maritime cases the other day i was in court and prompted a great qc in a case of collision didnt i sir i think there was a hoarse whisper audible up to the judges seat at intervals said mr temple the bar cannot confess to obligations from those who dont wear the robe temple rejoined his father advised me to read for the bar as a piece of very good training i appealed to temple whether he thought it possible to read lawbooks in a cockboat in a gale of wind temple grimaced and his father nodded still it struck me that i might one day have the felicity of quiet hours to sit down with temple and read lawfar behind him in the race and he envied me in his friendly manner i knew my ambition had been blown to tatters a new day dawned the household rose and met at the breakfasttable devoid of any dread of the morning newspapers their talk was like the chirrup of birds temple and his father walked away together to chambers bent upon actual businessupon doing something i reflected emphatically and compared them to ships with rudders while i was at the mercy of wind tide and wave i called at dettermain and newsons and heard there of a discovery of a witness essential to the case either in north wales or in new south i did not as i had intended put a veto on their proceedings the thing to do was to see my father and cut the case at the fountain head for this purpose it was imperative that i should go to him and prepare myself for the interview by looking at the newspapers first i bought one hastily running my eyes down the columns in the shop his name was printed but merely in a fashionable notification that carriages took up and set down for his costume ball according to certain regulations the relief of comparative obscurity helped me to breathe freely not to be laughed at was a gain i was rather inclined to laud his courage in entering assemblyrooms where he must be aware that he would see the dauphin on every face perhaps he was guilty of some new extravagance last night too late for scandal to reinforce the reporters mrs waddy had a woeful visage when informing me that he was out gone to courtenay square she ventured a murmur of bills coming in like everybody else she fancied he drew his supplies from my inexhaustible purse she hoped the bills would be paid off immediately the servants wages were overdue never can i get him to attend to small accounts she whimpered and was so ready to cry outright that i said tusk and with the one word gave her comfort of course you mr harry can settle them i know that we were drawing near to poor old sewiss legacy even for the settling of the small accounts london is a narrow place to one not caring to be seen i could not remain in this creditorriddled house i shunned the parks the clubs and the broad brighter streets of the west musing on the refreshing change it would be to me to find myself suddenly on board captain jasper welshs barque priscilla borne away to strange climes and tongues the world before me i put on the striding pace which does not invite interruption and no one but edbury would have taken the liberty i heard his shout halloa richmond he was driving his friend witlington in his cabriolet richmond my hearty where the deuce have you been i wanted you to dine with me the other night i replied looking at him steadily that i wished i had been there compendious larks cried he in the slang of his dogs day i say youre one at duke fitzs masquerade tonight tell us your toggery hang it you might go for the black prince im prince hal got a headache come to my club and try my mixture yoicks itd make methuselah and melchisedec jump up and have a twirl and a fandango i say youre thick with that little french actress chastedian jolly little woman too much to say for herself to suit me he described the style of woman that delighted himan ideal english shepherdess of the printshops it appeared and of extremely remote interest to me i thought at the time eventually i appointed to walk round to his club and he touched his horse gently and bobbed his diminutive henchman behind his smart cabriolet the admiration of the street i found him waiting for me on the steps of his club puffing a cigar with all his vigour in the classic attitude of a trumpeter my first words were i think i have to accuse you of insulting me insulting you richmond he cried much surprised holding his cigar in transit if you insult my father i make you responsible to me insult old duke fitz i give you my word of honour richmondwhy i like him i like the old boy wouldnt hurt him for the world and all havannah what the deuce have you got into your head come in and smoke the mention of his dinner and the dauphin crazed him with laughter he begged me as a man to imagine the scene the old bloated bourbon of london wall and camberwell an illustrious boydrank like a fishready to show himself to the waiters and then with gee and gaw the marquis spouted out reminiscences of scene the best ever witnessed up starts the dauphin damn you sir and damn me sir if believe you have a spot on your whole body and snuffles and puffsyou should have been there richmond i wrote to ask you did upon my life wanted you there lord why you wont get such fun in a century and old roy he behaved uncommonly finely said capital things by jove never saw him shine so old trump says dauphin my beautiful mother had a longing for strawberries out of season i am marked with a strawberry here says roy it is an admirable and roomy site but as i am not your enemy sir i doubt if i shall often have the opportunity to behold it ha hagee richmond youve missed the deucedest good scene ever acted how could i after having had an adversary like prince otto call upon a fellow such as edbury to give me reason for his conduct he rollicked and laughed until my ungovernable impatience brought him to his senses dash it youre a fireeater i know richmond we cant fight in this country aint allowed and fightings infernal folly by jove if youre going to tumble down every man who enjoys old roy youve your work cut out for you hes long chalks the best joke out twixt you and me he did return thanks what does it matter what old duke fitz does i give him a lift on his ladder with all my heart he keeps a capital table and ill be hanged if he hasnt got the secret of the women how he does it old roy if the lords were ladies theyd vote him premier peer double quick and ill tell you what richmond im thought a devil of a goodtempered fellow for not keeping watch over courtenay square i dont call it my business to be house dog for a pretty stepmother but theres talking and nodding and oh leave all that come in and smoke and let me set you up and ill shake your hand halloa im hailed a lady grasping the veil across her face beckoned her hand from a closed carriage below edbury ran down to her i caught sight of ravishing golden locks reminding me of mabel sweetwinters hair and pricking me with a sensation of spite at the sex for their deplorable madness in the choice of favourites edbury called me to come to the carriage window i moved slowly but the carriage wheeled about and rolled away i could just see the outline of a head muffled in furs and lace queer fish women he delivered himself of the philosophical ejaculation cloudily i was not on terms with him to offer any remark upon the one in question his imperturbable good humour foiled me and i left him merely giving him a warning to which his answer was oh come in and have a bottle of claret claret or brandy had done its work on him by the time i encountered him some hours later in the park bramham dewitt whom i met in the same neighbourhood offered me a mount after lunch advising me to keep near my father as much as i conveniently could and he being sure to appear in the park i went and heard his name to the right and left of me he was now as he said to me once that he should become the tongue of london i could hardly expect to escape from curious scrutiny myself i was looked at here and there i had to lift my hat and bow the stultification of ones feelings and ideas in circumstances which divide and set them at variance is worse than positive pain the looks shed on me were rather flattering but i knew that in the background i was felt to be the son of the notorious edbury came trotting up to us like a shaken sack calling neigh any of you seen old roy bramham dewitt a stiff fashionable man of fifty proud of his blood and quick as his cousin jorian to resent an impertinence replied are you the marquis of edbury or a drunken groom sir gad old gentleman ive half a mind to ride you down said edbury and espying me challenged me to a race to run down the fogies a cavalcade of six abreast came cantering along i saw my father listen to a word from lady edbury and push his horse to intercept the marquis they spoke presently presently my father said ride to the rear and keep at half a stones throwsay a grooms distance groom be hanged edbury retorted i made a bet id drive you out of the park old roy ride behind then said my father and to my astonishment edbury obeyed him with laughter lady edbury smiled to herself and i experienced the esteem i perceived in her for a masterful manner a few minutes later my father beckoned me to pay my respects to graf kesensky an ambassador with strong english predilections and some influence among us he asked me if he was right in supposing i wished to enter parliament i said he was wondering at the interest a foreigner could find in it the count stopped a quietpacing gentleman bramham dewitt joined them and a group of friends i was introduced to mr beauchamp hill the government whip who begged me to call on him with reference to the candidature of a sussex borough that is said he turning to graf kesensky if youre sure the place is open ive heard nothing of falmouths accident the count replied that falmouth was his intimate friend he had received a special report that falmouth was dying just as he was on the point of mounting his horse we shant have lost time said mr hill the government wanted votes i went down to the house of commons at midnight to see him he had then heard of falmouths hopeless condition and after extracting my political views which were for the nonce those of a happy subserviency he expressed his belief that the new writ for the borough of chippenden might be out and myself seated on the government benches within a very short period nor would it be necessary he thought for the government nominee to spend money though that does not affect you mr richmond my supposed wealth gave me currency even in political circles chapter xliii i become one of the chosen of the nation an entire revulsion in my feelings and my way of thinking was caused by this sudden change of prospect a member of our parliament i could then write to ottilia and tell her that i had not wasted time and it was due to my father i confessed when he returned from his ball at dawn that i should thank him for speaking to graf kesensky oh said he that was our luck richie i have been speaking about you to hundreds for the last six months and now we owe it to a foreigner i thanked him again he looked eminently handsome in his henry iii costume and was disposed to be as luxurious as his original he had brought count lika secretary of legation to the austrian embassy dressed as an albanian with him the two were stretched on couches and discoursing of my fathers reintroduction of the sedan chair to society my father explained that he had ordered a couple of dozen of these chairs to be built on a pattern of his own and he added by the way richie there will be sedaniersporters to pay today poor men should be paid immediately i agreed with the monarch contemplating him i became insensible to the sting of ridicule which had been shooting through me agonizing me for the last eightandforty hours still i thought can i never escape from the fascinationlet me only get into parliament the idea in me was that parliament lifted me nearer to ottilia and would prompt me to resolute action out of his tangle of glittering cobwebs i told him of my interview with beauchamp hill i have never known kesensky wrong yet said he except in his backing of falmouths horses count lika murmured that he hoped his chief would be wrong in something else he spoke significantly my father raised his eyebrows in his opinion lika accepted the invitation to pursue prince ernest will not let that announcement stand uncontradicted my fathers eyes dwelt on him are we accused of it lika slipped from the question who is accused of a newspapers doings it is but the denial of a statement i dare them to deny itand lika my dear fellow light me a cigarette said my father then said lika touching the flame delicately you take the view that kesensky is wrong in another thing besides horses i believe he struck on the subject casually there was nothing for him to gain or lose in it and he had a liking for my father after puffing the cigarette twice or thrice my father threw it down resuming his conversation upon the sedan the appropriate dresses of certain of the great masquerading ladies and an incident that appeared to charge jorian dewitt with having misconducted himself the moment lika had gone upstairs for two or three hours sleep he said to me richie you and i have no time for that we must have a man at falmouths house by eight oclock if the scrubbingmaid on all foursnot an inelegant position i have remarkeddeclares him dead we are at bartletts moneylender by ten and in chippenden borough before two post meridian as i am a tactician there is mischief but i will turn it to my uses as i did our poor jorian tonight he smuggled in the chassediane i led her out on my arm of that by and by the point is that from your oath in parliament you fly to sarkeld i implore you now by your love for me and the princess not to lose precious minutes richie we will press things so that you shall be in sarkeld by the end of the month my son my dear boy how you loved me onceyou do still then follow my directions i have a head ay you think it wild tis true my mother was a poetess but i will convince my son as i am convincing the worldtut tut to avoid swelling talk i tell you richie i have my hand on the worlds wheel and now is the time for you to spring from it and gain your altitude if you fail my success is emptiness will you avoid edbury and his like and protect yourself was my form of stipulation spoken to counteract his urgency he gave no answer beyond a wave of the hand suitable to his princely onecoloured costume of ruffled lavender silk and the magnificent leg he turned to front me my senses even up to that period were so impressionable as to be swayed by a rich dress and a grand manner when circumstances were not too unfavourable now they seemed very favourable for they offered me an upward path to tread his appearance propitiated me less after he had passed through the hands of his man tollingby but i had again surrendered the lead to him as to the risk of proceedings being taken against him he laughed scornfully at the suggestion they dare not the more i dare the less dare they again i listened to his curious roundabout reasoning which dragged humour at its heels like a comical cur proclaiming itself imposingly in spite of the mongrels barking to be prudence and common sense could i deny that i owed him gratitude for the things i cherished mostfor my acquaintance with ottiliafor his services in germanyfor the prospect of my elevation in england i could not and i tried hard to be recklessly grateful as to money he reiterated that he could put his hand on it to satisfy the squire on the day of accounts for the present we must borrow his argument upon borrowingwhich i knew well and wondered that i did not at the outset disperse with a breath of contemptgained on me singularly when reviewed under the light of my immediate interests it ran thuswe have a rich or a barren future just as we conceive it the art of generalship in life consists in gathering your scattered supplies to suit a momentous occasion and it is the future which is chiefly in debt to us and adjures us for its sake to fight the fight and conquer that man is vile and fit to be trampled on who cannot count his future in gold and victory if as we find we are always in debt to the past we should determine that the future is in our debt and draw on it why let our future lie idle while we need succour for instance tomorrow i am to have what saves my reputation in the battle today shall i not take it at once the military commander who acts on that principle overcomes his adversary to a certainty you richie the member for this borough of chippenden have won solid ground i guarantee it to you and you go straight from the hustings or the first taste of parliamentary benches to sarkeld you take your grandads proposition to prince ernest you bring back the princes acceptance to the squire can you hope to have a princess without a battle for her more and much more in this strain untilfor he could read me and most human beings swiftly on the surface notwithstanding the pressure of his fancifulnesshe perceived that talking influenced me far less than activity and so after a hurried breakfast and an innocuous glance at the damp morning papers we started to the moneylenders with jennings to lend his name we were in chippenden close upon the hour my father had named bringing to the startled electors the first news of their members death during the heat of the canvass for votes i received a kind letter from the squire in reply to one of mine wherein he congratulated me on my prospects of success and wound up glad to see it announced you are off with that princess of yours show them we are as proud as they are harry and a fig for the whole foreign lot come to riversley soon and be happy what did that mean heriot likewise said in a letter so its over the proud prince kicks you will not thank me for telling you now what you know i think about it i appealed to my father canvass canvass cried he and he persistently baffled me it was from temple i learnt that on the day of our starting for chippenden the newspapers contained a paragraph in large print flatly denying upon authority that there was any foundation for the report of an intended marriage between the princess of eppenwelzensarkeld and an english gentleman then i remembered how that morning my father had flung the papers down complaining of their dampness would such denial have appeared without ottilias sanction my father proved that i was harnessed to him there was no stopping no time for grieving pace was his specific he dragged me the round of the voters he gave dinners at the inn of true liberals and ate of them contentedly he delivered speeches incessantly the whole force of his seriocomic genius was alive in its element at chippenden from balls and dinners and a sharp contest to maintain his position in town he was down among us by the first morning train bright as apollo and quite the sun of the place dazzling the independent electors and their wives and even me somewhat amazing me certainly dettermain his lawyer who had never seen him in action and supposed he would treat an election as he did his case with fits and starts of energy was not less astonished and tried to curb him mr dettermain my dear sir i apprehend it is the electoral maxim to woo the widowed borough with the tear in its eye and i shall do so hotly in a right masculine manner my father said we have the start and if we beat the enemy by nothing else we will beat him by constitution we are the first in the field and not to reap it is to acknowledge oneself deficient in the very first instrument with which grass was cut our difficulty all through the election was to contend with his humour the many triumphs it won for him both in speech and in action turned at least the dialectics of the argument against us and amusing flattering or bewildering contributed to silence and hold us passive political convictions of his own i think i may say with truth he had none he would have been just as powerful after his fashion on the tory side pleading for mr normanton hipperdon more perhaps he would have been more in earnest his store of political axioms was tory but he did remarkably well and with no great difficulty in confuting them to the wives of voters to the voters themselves and at public assemblies our adversary was redoubtable a promising opposition member ousted from his seat in the northa handsome man too which my father admitted and wealthy being junior partner in a city banking firm anna penrhys knew him and treacherously revealed some of the enemys secrets notably concerning what he termed our incorrigible turn for bribery and that means my father said that mr hipperdon does not possess the art of talking to the ladies i shall try him in repartee on the hustings i must contrive to have our jorian at my elbow the task of getting jorian to descend upon such a place as chippenden worried my father more than electoral anxieties jorian wrote my best wishes to you be careful of your heads the habit of the anglosaxon is to conclude his burlesques with a play of cudgels it is his notion of freedom and at once the exordium and peroration of his eloquence spare me the sussex accent on your return my father read out the sentences of this letter with admiring bursts of indignation at the sarcasms and an evident idea that i inclined to jealousy of the force displayed but we must have him he said i do not feel myself complete without jorian so he made dispositions for a concert to be given in chippenden town jenny chassediane was invited down to sing and jorian came in her wake of course he came to suffer tortures she was obliging enough to transform me into her weapon of chastisement upon the poor fellow for his behaviour to her at the ballatrocious i was bound to confess on this point she hesitated just long enough to imply a doubt whether under any circumstances the dues of men should be considered before those of her sex and then struck her hands together with enthusiasm for my father who was she observedcritical in millinery in the height of her ecstasythe most majestic charming handsome henri iii imaginable the pride and glory of the assembly only one degree too rosy at night for the tone of the lavender needing a touch of french hands and the merest trifle in want of compression about the waistband she related that a certain prince henri dangleterre had buzzed at his ear annoyingly et gascoigne ou estil called the king and the judge stepped forth to correct the obstreperous youth the judge was jennings clearly prepared by my father to foil the princeno other than edbury it was incomprehensible to me that my father should tolerate the latters pranks unless indeed he borrowed his name to bonds of which i heard nothing mademoiselle chassediane vowed that her own dress was ravishing she went attired as a boudoirshepherdess or demurelycoquettish svreschina ninette such of whom louis quinze would chuck the chin down the deadly introductory walks of versailles the reason of her desiring to go was the fatal sin of curiosity and therefore her sexs burden not hers jorian was a mousquetaire with plumes and ruffles prodigious and a hens heart beneath his cocks feathers pourtant jy allai i saw your great ladies how they carry themselves when they would amuse themselves and mon dieu paris has done its utmost to grace their persons and the length of their robes did the part of providence in bestowing height upon them parceque vous savez monsieur cest extraordinaire comme ils ont les jambes courtes ces anglaises our aristocracy however was not so bad in that respect as our bourgeoisie yet it was easy to perceive that our female aristocracy though they could ride had never been drilled to walk de belles femmes oui seulement tenez je nadmire ni les yeux de vache ni de souris ni mme ceux de verre comme ornement feminin avec de lembonpoint elles font de leffet mais maigre il ny a aucune illusion possible this vindictive critic smarted with cause at the recollection of her walk out of her rooms jorians audacity or infatuation quitted him immediately after he had gratified her whim the stout mousquetaire placed her in a corner and enveloped her there declaring that her petition had been that she might come to see not to be seenas if she cried out tearfully the two wishes must not necessarily exist together like the masculine and the feminine in this world prince hal acting the most profligate period of his career espied her behind the mousquetaires moustache and did not fail to make much of his discovery in a perilous moment for the reputation of the ball my father handed him over to gascoigne and conducted jenny in a leisurely walk on his arm out of the rooms il est comme les romains she said he never despairs of himself it is a jupiter if he must punish you he confers a dignity in doing it now i comprehend that with such women as these grandes dames anglaises i should have done him harm but for his greatness of soul some harm i fancied must have been done in spite of his boast to the contrary he had to be in london every other night and there were tales current of intrigues against him which had their sources from very lofty regions but in chippenden he threw off london just as lightly as in london he discarded chippenden no symptom of personal discouragement or of fatigue was betrayed in his face i spoke once of that paragraph purporting to emanate from prince ernest it may he said business richie he set to counting the promises of votes disdaining fears and reflections concerts cricketmatches balls dinnerparties and the round of the canvass and speechmaking at our gatherings occupied every minute of my time except on saturday evenings when i rode over to riversley with temple to spend the sunday temple always willing to play second to me and a trifle melancholy under his partial eclipsewhich perhaps suggested the loss of janet to himwould have it that this election was one of the realizations of our boyish dreams of greatness the ladies were working rosettes for me my aunt dorothy talked very anxiously about the day appointed by my father to repay the large sum expended all hung upon that day she said speaking from her knowledge of the squire she was moved to an extreme distress by the subject he is confident harry but where can he obtain the money if your grandfather sees it invested in your name in government securities he will be satisfied not otherwise nothing less will satisfy him and if that is not done he will join you and your father together in his mind and as he has hitherto treated one he will treat both i know him he is just to the extent of his vision but he will not be able to separate you he is aware that your father has not restricted his expenses since they met he will say you should have used your influence she insisted on this until the tears streamed from her eyes telling me that my grandfather was the most upright and unsuspicious of men and precisely on that account the severest when he thought he had been deceived the fair chances of my election did not console her as it did me by dazzling me she affirmed strongly that she was sure my father expected success at the election to be equivalent to the promised restitution of the money and begged me to warn him that nothing short of the sum squandered would be deemed sufficient at riversley my dear aunt good woman though she was seemed to me to be waxing miserly the squire had given her the name of parsimony she had vexed him janet told me by subscribing a miserable sum to a sailors asylum that he patronizeda sum he was ashamed to see standing as the gift of a beltham and she had stopped the building of a wing of her village schoolhouse designed upon his plan altogether she was fretful and distressful she appeared to think that i could have kept my father in better order riversley was hearing new and strange reports of him but how could i at chippenden thwart his proceedings in london besides he was serving me indefatigably it can easily be imagined what description of banter he had to meet and foil this gentleman is obliging enough to ask me how about the royal arms if in his extreme consideration he means to indicate my arms i will inform him that they are open to him he shall find entertainment for man and beast so he is doubly assured of a welcome questioned whether he did not think he was entitled to be rated at the value of halfacrown he protested that whatever might be the sum of his worth he was pure coin of which neither party in chippenden could accuse the silver of rubbing off and he offered forthwith an impromptu apologue of a copper penny that passed itself off for a crownpiece and deceived a portion of the country that was why with a wave of the arm over the hipperdon faction it had a certain number of backers for everybody on whom the counterfeit had been foisted praised it to keep it in the currency now gentlemen i apprehend that chippenden is not the pocketborough for hipperdon coin back with him to the mint and with your permission we will confiscate the first syllable of his name while we consign him to oblivion with a hip hip hip hurrah for richmond the cheers responded thunderingly and were as loud when he answered a how bout the dauphin by saying that it was the tory hotel of which he knew nothing a cheer for old roy edbury sang out my father checked the roar and turned to him marquis of edbury come to the front edbury declined to budge but the fellows round him edged aside to show him a mark for my fathers finger gentlemen this is the young marquis of edbury a member of the house of lords by right of his birth born to legislate for you and me he gentlemen makes our laws examine him hear him meditate on him he paused cruelly for edbury to open his mouth the young lord looked confounded and from that moment behaved becomingly he might have been doing mischief tomorrow my father said to me and by letting me conceive his adroitness a matter of design comforted me with proofs of intelligent power and made me feel less the melancholy conjunction of a piece of mechanism and a piece of criticism which i was fast growing to be in the contemplation of the agencies leading to honour in our land edbury whipped his fourinhand to conduct our voters to the poll we had to pull hard against tory interest it was a sharp dubious hot daya day of outcries against undue influence and against briberya day of beer and cheers and the insanest of tricks to cheat the pollingbooth old john thresher of dipwell and farmer eckerthy drove over to chippenden to afford me aid and countenance disconcerting me by the sight of them for i associated them with janet rather than with ottilia and it was to ottilia that i should have felt myself rising when the figures increased their pace in my favour and the yeasty mob surrounding my fathers superb fourhorsed chariot responded to his orations by proclaiming me victor i congratulate you mr richmond dettermain said up to this day i have had my fears that we should haul more moonshine than fish in our net your father has accomplished prodigies my father with the bloom of success on his face led me aside soon after a safe majority of upwards of seventy had been officially announced now richie said he you are a member now to the squire away thank the multitude and off and as quick to sarkeld as you well can and tell the squire from me that i pardon his suspicions i have landed you a memberthat will satisfy him i am willing tell him you know me competent to direct mines bailiff of his estateswhatever he pleases to effect a reconciliation i must be in london tonighti am in the thick of the fray there no matter go my son he embraced me it was not a moment for me to catechize him though i could see that he was utterly deluded between moonlight and morning riding with temple and captain bulsted on either side of me i drew rein under the red grange windows tired and in love with its air of sleepy grandeur janets window was open i hailed her has he won she sang out in the dark of her room as though the cry of delight came upon the leap from bed she was dressed she had commissioned farmer eckerthy to bring her the news at any hour of the night seeing me she clapped hands harry i congratulate you a thousand times she had wit to guess that i should never have thought of coming had i not been the winner i could just discern the curve and roll of her famed thick brown hair in the happy shrug of her shoulder and imagined the full stream of it as she leaned out of window to talk to us janet herself unfastened the halldoor bolts she caressed the horses feverishly exulting with charming subdued laughter of victory and welcome and amused us by leading my horse round to stables and whistling for one of the lads playing what may now and then be a pretty feature in a young woman of characterthe fair tomboy girl she and her maid prepared coffee and toast for us and entered the hall one after the other laden with dishes of cold meat and not until the captain had eaten well did she tell him slyly that somebody whom she had brought to riversley yesterday was abed and asleep upstairs the slyness and its sisterly innocence lit up our eyes and our hearts laughed her cheeks were deliciously overcoloured we stole i know not what from the night and the day and conventional circumstances and rallied captain bulsted and behaved as decorous people who treat the night properly and live by rule do not quite do never since janet was a girl had i seen her so spirited and responsive the womanly armour of halfreserve was put away we chatted with a freshhearted natural young creature who forfeited not a particle of her ladyship while she made herself our comrade in talk and frolic janet and i walked part of the way to the station with temple who had to catch an early train and returningthe song of skylarks covering usjoined hands having our choice between nothing to say and the excess perilous both chapter xliv my father is miraculously relieved by fortune my grandfather had a gratification in my success mingled with a transparent jealousy of the chief agent in procuring it he warned me when i left him that he was not to be hoodwinked he must see the money standing in my name on the day appointed his doubts were evident but he affected to be expectant not a word of sarkeld could be spoken my success appeared to be on a more visionary foundation the higher i climbed now jorian dewitt had affirmed that the wealthy widow lady sampleman was to be had by my father for the asking placed as we were i regarded the objections to his alliance with her in a mild light she might lend me the money to appease the squire that done i would speedily repay it i admitted in a letter to my aunt dorothy the existing objections but the lady had long been enamoured of him i pleaded and he was past the age for passionate affection and would infallibly be courteous and kind she was rich we might count on her to watch over him carefully of course with such a wife he would sink to a secondary social sphere was it to be regretted if he did the letter was a plea for my own interests barely veiled at the moment of writing it and moreover when i treated my father with especial coldness my heart was far less warm in the contemplation of its preeminent aim than when i was suffering him to endanger it almost without a protest janet and a peaceful riversley and a life of quiet english distinction beckoned to me visibly and not hatefully the image of ottilia conjured up pictures of a sea of shipwrecks a scene of immeasurable hopelessness still i strove toward that my strivings were against my leanings and imagining the latter which involved no sacrifice of the finer sense of honour to be in the direction of my lower nature i repelled them to preserve a lofty aim that led me through questionable ways can it be you harry my aunt dorothys reply ran i had anticipated her line of reasoning though not her warmth who advise him to this marriage from a motive so inexplicably unworthy that you will repay her the money i do not require your promise to assure me the money is nothing it is the prospect of her life and fortune which you are consenting if not urging him to imperil for your own purposes are you really prepared to imitate in him with less excuse for doing it the things you most condemn let it be checked at the outset it cannot be a marriage of inclination on both sides prudent in a worldly sense we might wish for him perhaps if he could feel quite sure of himself his wife might persuade him not to proceed in his lawcase there i have long seen his ruin he builds such expectations on it you speak of something worse than a mercenary marriage i see this in your handwritingyour approval of it i have to check the whisper that tells me it reads like a conspiracy is she not a simpleton can you withhold your pity and pitying can you possibly allow her to be entrapped forgive my seeming harshness i do not often speak to my harry so i do now because i must appeal to you as the one chiefly responsible on whose head the whole weight of a dreadful error will fall oh my dearest be guided by the purity of your feelings to shun doubtful means i have hopes that after the first few weeks your grandfather willi know he does not expect to find the engagement fulfilledbe the same to you that he was before he discovered the extravagance you are in parliament and i am certain that by keeping as much as possible to yourself and living soberly your career there will persuade him to meet your wishes the letter was of great length in conclusion she entreated me to despatch an answer by one of the early morning trains entreating me once more to cause any actual deed to be at least postponed the letter revealed what i had often conceived might be my rejoinder to my aunt dorothy laid stress on my fathers pledge of his word of honour as a gentleman to satisfy the squire on a stated day i shrank from the idea of the riversley crow over him as to the lady i said we would see that her money was fastened to her securely before she committed herself to the deeps the money to be advanced to me would lie at my bankers in my nameuntouched it would be repaid in the bulk after a season this i dwelt on particularly both to satisfy her and to appease my sense of the obligation an airy pleasantry in the tone of this epistle amused me while writing it and vexed me when it had gone but a letter sent upon special request by railway should not i thought be couched in the ordinary strain besides one could not write seriously of a person like lady sampleman i consulted my aunt dorothys scruples by stopping my father on his way to the lady his carriage was at the door i suggested moneylenders he had tried them all he begged me to permit him to start but it was too ignominious to think of its being done under my very eyes and i refused he had tried the moneylenders yesterday they required a mortgage solider than expectations for the sum we wanted dettermain and newson had declined to undertake the hypothecation of his annuity providence pointed to sampleman you change in a couple of nights richie said he now i am always the identical man i shall give happiness to one sincerely good soul i have only to offer myselflet me say in becoming modesty i believe so let me go to her and have it over for with me a step taken is a thing sanctified i have in fact held her in reserve not that i think fortune has abandoned us but a sagacious schemer will not leave everything to the worthy dame i should have driven to her yesterday if i had not heard from dettermain and newson that there was a hint of a negotiation for a compromise government is fairly frightened he mused however i slept on it and arrived at the conclusion this morning that my old richie stood in imminent jeopardy of losing the fruit of all my toil the good woman will advance the money to her husband when i pledged my word to the squire i had reason to imagine the two months a sufficient time we have still a couple of days i have heard of men who lost heart at the eleventh hour and if they had only hung on with gallant faith in themselves they would have been justified by the result faith works miracles at least it allows time for them his fertile ingenuity spared mine the task of persuading him to postpone the drive to lady sampleman but that he would have been prompt to go at a word from me and was actually about to go when i entered his house i could not question he drove in manifest relief of mind to dettermain and newsons i had an appointment with mr temple at a great political club to meet the gentlemen who were good enough to undertake the introduction of the infant member to the house of commons my incessantly twisting circumstances foiled the pleasure and pride due to me from the club i bent my steps to temples district and met in the street young eckart vom hof my champion and second on a memorable occasion fresh upon london and looking very germanic in this drab forest of our city people he could hardly speak of deutschland for enthusiasm at the sight of the moving masses his object in coming to england he assured me honestly was to study certain editions of tibullus in the british museum when he deigned to speak of sarkeld it was to say that prince hermann was frequently there i gave him no chance to be sly though he pushed for it at a question of the princess ottilias health the funeral pace of the block of cabs and omnibuses engrossed his attention suddenly the englishman afforded him an example of the reserve of impetuosity we may contain i had seen my aunt dorothy in a middle line of cabs coming from the city and was darting in a twinkling among wheels and shafts and nodding cabhorse noses to take her hand and know the meaning of her presence in london she had family business to do she said no more i mentioned that i had checked my father for a day or two she appeared grateful her anxiety was extreme that she might not miss the return train so i relinquished her hand commanded the cabman to hasten and turned to rescue eckarttoo young and faithful a collegian not to follow his friend though it were into the lions denfrom a terrific entanglement of horseflesh and vehicles brawled over by a splendid collision of tongues secure on the pavement again eckart humbly acknowledged that the english tongue could come out upon occasions i did my best to amuse him whether it amused him to see me take my seat in the house of commons and hear a debate in a foreign language i cannot say but the only pleasure of which i was conscious at that period lay in the thought that he or his father baron vom hof might some day relate the circumstance at prince ernests table and fix in ottilias mind the recognition of my having tried to perform my part of the contract beggared myself and knowing prince hermann to be in sarkeld all i hoped for was to show her i had followed the path she traced my state was lower besides misfortune i now found myself exalted only to feel my profound insignificance the standard for the house is a mans ability to do things said charles etherell my friendly introductor by whom i was passingly perhaps ironically advised to preserve silence for two or three sessions he counselled the study of foreign affairs for a present theme i talked of our management of them in the strain of dr julius von karsteg thats journalism or clippings from a bilious essay it wont do for the house he said revile the house to the country if you like but not the country to the house when i begged him to excuse my absurdity he replied its full of promise so long as youre silent but to be silent was to be merely an obedient hound of the whip and if the standard for the house was a mans ability to do things i was in the seat of a better man external sarcasms upon the house flavoured with justness came to my mind but if these were my masters surrounding me how indefinitely small must i be leaving the house on that first night of my sitting i received temples congratulations outside and as though the sitting had exhausted every personal sentiment i became filled with his under totally new sensations i enjoyed my distinction through the perception of my old comrades friendly jealousy ill be there too some day he said moaning at the prospect of an extreme age before such honours would befall him the society of eckart prevented me from urging him to puff me up with his talk as i should have wished and after i had sent the german to be taken care of by mrs waddy i had grown so accustomed to the worldly view of my position that i was fearing for its stability threats of a petition against me were abroad supposing the squire disinherited me could i stand an extraordinary appetite for wealth a novel appreciation of itwhich was in truth a voluntary enlistment into the army of mankind and the adoption of its passionspricked me with an intensity of hope and dread concerning my dependence on my grandfather i lay sleepless all night tossing from riversley to sarkeld condemned it seemed to marry janet and gain riches and power by renouncing my hope of the princess and the glory belonging to her unless i should within a few hours obtain a show of figures at my bankers i had promised etherell to breakfast with him a notea faint screamdespatched by mrs waddy to mr temples house informed me that the men were upon them if so they were the forerunners of a horde and my father was as good as extinguished he staked everything on success consequently he forfeited pity goodbye to ambition i thought and ate heartily considering robustly the while how far lower than the general level i might avoid falling the report of the debates in morning papersdoubtless more flowing and perhaps more grammatical than such as i gave ear to overnighthad the odd effect on me of relieving me from the fit of subserviency into which the speakers had sunk me a conceit of towering superiority took its place and as etherell was kind enough to draw me out and compliment me i was attacked by a tragic sense of contrast between my capacities and my probable fortunes it was open to me to marry janet but this meant the loosening of myself with my own hand for ever from her who was my mentor and my glory to gain whom i was in the very tideway i could not submit to it though the view was like that of a green field of the springs passed by a climber up the crags i went to anna penrhys to hear a womans voice and partly told her of my troubles she had heard mr hipperdon express his confident opinion that he should oust me from my seat her indignation was at my service as a loan it sprang up fiercely and spontaneously in allusions to something relating to my father of which the marquis of edbury had been guilty how you can bear it she exclaimed for i was not wordy the exclamation however stung me to put pen to paperthe woman was not so remote in me as not to be roused by the woman i wrote to edbury and to heriot bidding him call on the young nobleman late at night i was at my fathers door to perform the act of duty of seeing him and hearing how he had entertained eckart if he was still master of his liberty i should have known him better i expected silence and gloom the windows were lighted brilliantly as the halldoor opened a band of stringed and wood instruments commenced an overture mrs waddy came to me in the hall she was unintelligible one thing had happened to him at one hour of the morning and another at another hour he was at one moment suffering the hands of the officers on his shoulder and behold you mr harry a knock a letter from a messenger and he conquers government it struck me that the epitome of his life had been played in a day i was quite incredulous of downright good fortune he had been giving a dinner followed by a concert and the deafening strains of the music clashed with my acerb spirit irritating me excessively where are those men you spoke of i asked her gone she replied gone long ago paid said i she was afraid to be precise but repeated that they were long since gone i singled jorian dewitt from among the crowd of loungers on the stairs and landing between the drawingrooms oh yes government has struck its flag to him jorian said why werent you here to dine alphonse will never beat his achievement of today jenny and carigny gave us a quarterofanhour before dinnera capital ideaveuve et bachelier as if by inspiration no preparation for it no formal taking of seats it seized amazinglyfloated small talk over the soup beautifully i questioned him again oh dear yes there cant be a doubt about it he answered airily roy richmond has won his game two or three urgent men round a great gentleman were extracting his affable approbation of the admirable nature of the experiment of the chassediane before dinner i saw that eckart was comfortably seated and telling jorian to provide for him in the matter of tobacco i went to my room confused beyond power of thought by the sensible command of fortune my father fortunes sport at times seemed really to have his statement of the circumstances bewildered me even more he was in no hurry to explain them when we met next morning he waited for me to question him and said yes i think we have beaten them so far his mind was preoccupied he informed me concerning the defence of a lady much intrigued against and resuming the subject yes we have beaten them up to a point richie and that reminds me would you have me go down to riversley and show the squire the transfer paper at any rate you can now start for sarkeld and you do do you not today tomorrow at latest i insisted but how and in what manner has this money been paid the idea struck me that he had succeeded in borrowing it transferred to me in the bank and intelligence of the fact sent to dettermain and newson my lawyers he replied beyond that i know as little as you richie though indubitably i hoped to intimidate them if he added with a countenance perfectly simple and frank they expect me to take money for a sop i am not responsible as i by no means provoked it for their mistake i proceed the money is useful to you so i rejoice at it five and twenty thousand pounds was the amount no stipulation was attached to it none of course a stipulation was implied but of that i am not bound to be cognizant absurd i cried it cant have come from the quarter you suspect where else he asked i thought of the squire lady edbury my aunt lady sampleman anna penrhys some one or other of his frantic female admirers but the largeness of the amount and the channel selected for the payment precluded the notion that any single person had come to succour him in his imminent need and as it chanced mine observing that my speculations wavered he cited numerous instances in his life of the special action of providence in his favour and was bold enough to speak of a star which his natural acuteness would have checked his doing before me if his imagination had not been seriously struck you hand the money over to me sir i said without a moment of hesitation my dear boy he melted me by answering you believe you have received a bribe that is my entire beliefthe sole conclusion i can arrive at i will tell you richie the old marquis of edbury once placed five thousand pounds to my account on a proviso that i shouldneglect is the better word my case i inherited from him at his death of course his demise cancelled the engagement he had been the friend of personages implicated he knew i suspect he apprehended the unpleasant position of a witness but what was the stipulation you presume was implied said i something that passed between lawyers i am not bound to be cognizant of it abandon my claims for a few thousands not for ten not for ten hundred times the sum to be free from his boisterous influence which made my judgement as unsteady as the weatherglass in a hurricane i left my house and went straight to dettermain and newson who astonished me quite as much by assuring me that the payment of the money was a fact there was no mystery about it the intelligence and transfer papers they said had not been communicated to them by the firm they were opposed to but by a solicitor largely connected with the aristocracy and his letter had briefly declared the unknown donators request that legal proceedings should forthwith be stopped they offered no opinion of their own suggestions of any kind they seemed to think had weight and all of them an equal weight to conclude from the value they assigned to every idea of mine the name of the solicitor in question was charles adolphus bannerbridge it was indeed my old one of my oldest friends the same by whom i had been led to a feast and an evening of fun when a little fellow starting in the london streets sure of learning the whole truth from old mr bannerbridge i walked to his office and heard that he had suddenly been taken ill i strode on to his house and entered a house of mourning the kind old man remembered by me so vividly had died overnight miss bannerbridge perceived that i had come on an errand and with her gentle good breeding led me to speak of it she knew nothing whatever of the sum of money she was however aware that an annuity had been regularly paid through the intervention of her father i was referred by her to a mr richards his recentlyestablished partner this gentleman was ignorant of the whole transaction throughout the day i strove to combat the pressure of evidence in favour of the idea that an acknowledgement of special claims had been wrested from the enemy temple hardly helped me though his solid sense was dead against the notions entertained by my father and jorian dewitt and others besides our elders the payment of the sum through the same channel which supplied the annuity pointed distinctly to an admission of a claim he inclined to think and should be supposed to come from a personage having cause either to fear him or to assist him he set my speculations astray by hinting that the request for the stopping of the case might be a blind a gift of money he said shrewdly was a singularly weak method of inducing a man to stop the suit of a lifetime i thought of lady edbury but her income was limited and her expenditure was not of lady sampleman but it was notorious that she loved her purse as well as my aunt dorothy and was even more in the squires phrase a petticoated parsimony anna penrhys appeared the likelier except for the fact that the commencement of the annuity was long before our acquaintance with her i tried her on the subject her amazement was without a shadow of reserve its welsh its not english she remarked i knew no welshwoman save anna do you know the whole of his history said she possibly one of the dozen unknown episodes in it might have furnished the clue i agreed with her the sight of twentyone thousand pounds placed to my credit in the funds assuaged my restless spirit of investigation letters from the squire and my aunt dorothy urged me to betake myself to riversley there finally to decide upon what my course should be now that you have the money pray st parsimony wrotepray be careful of it do not let it be encroached on remember it is to serve one purpose it should be guarded strictly against every appeal for aid etc with much underlining my grandfather returned the papers his letter said i shall not break my word please to come and see me before you take steps right or left so here was the dawn again i could in a day or two start for sarkeld meanwhile to give my father a lesson i discharged a number of bills and paid off the bond to which edburys name was attached my grandfather i knew was too sincerely and punctiliously a gentleman in practical conduct to demand a further inspection of my accounts these things accomplished i took the train for riversley and proceeded from the station to durstan where i knew heriot to be staying had i gone straight to my grandfather there would have been another story to tell chapter xlv within an inch of my life a single tent stood in a gully running from one of the gravelpits of the heath near an ironred rillet and a girl of kiomis tribe leaned over the lazy water at half length striking it with her handkerchief at a distance of about twice a stonesthrow from the new carriageroad between durstan and bulsted i fancied from old recollections she might be kiomi herself this was not the time for her people to be camping on durstan besides i feared it improbable that one would find her in any of the tracks of her people the noise of the wheels brought the girls face round to me she was one of those who were babies in the tents when i was a boy we were too far apart for me to read her features i lay back in the carriage thinking that it would have been better for my poor little wild friend if i had never crossed the shadow of her tents a life caught out of its natural circle is as much in danger of being lost as a limb given to a wheel in spinning machinery so it occurred to me until i reflected that prince ernest might make the same remark and deplore the damage done to the superior machinery likewise my movements appeared to interest the girl she was up on a mound of the fastpurpling heath shading her eyes to watch me when i called at bulsted lodgegates to ask for a bed under julias roof that night her bare legs twinkled in a nimble pace on the way to durstan hall as if she was determined to keep me in sight i waved my hand to her she stopped a gipsy girls figure is often as good an index to her mind as her face and i perceived that she had not taken my greeting favourably nor would she advance a step to my repeated beckonings i tried hat handkerchief purse in vain my driver observed that she was taken with a fit of the obstinacy of her lot he shouted silver and then fortune she stood looking the fellow discoursed on the nature of gipsies foxes were kept for hunting he said there was reason in that why we kept gipsies none could tell he once backed a gipsy prizefighter who failed to keep his appointment heart sunk too low below his belt sir you cant reckon on them for performances and that same man afterwards fought the gamest fight in the chronicles o the ring i knew he had it in him but theyre like nothing better than the weather you cant put money on em and feel safe consequently he saw no good in them she sticks to her post he said as we turned into the durstan grounds the girl was like a flagstaff on the upper line of heathland heriot was strolling cigar in mouth down one of the diminutive alleys of young fir in this upstart estate he affected to be prepossessed by the case between me and edbury and would say nothing of his own affairs save that he meant to try for service in one of the continental armies he whose susceptible love for his country was almost a malady but he had given himself to women it was cissy this trichy that and the wiles of a florence the spites of an agatha duperies innocentseemings witcheries reptiletricks of the fairest of women all through his conversation he had so saturated himself with the resources evasions and desperate cruising of these light creatures of wind tide and tempest that like one who has been gazing on the whirligoround he saw the whole of women running or only waiting for a suitable partner to run the giddy ring to perdition and an atoning pathos i cut short one of heriots narratives by telling him that this picking bones of the dish was not to my taste he twitted me with turning parson i spoke of kiomi heriot flushed muttering the little devil with his usual contemplative relish of devilry we parted feeling that severe tension of the old links keeping us together which indicates the lack of new ones a point where simple affection must bear the strain of friendship if it can heriot had promised to walk halfway with me to bulsted in spite of lady marias childish fears of some attack on him he was now satisfied with a goodbye at the halldoors and he talked ostentatiously of a method that he had to bring edbury up to the mark i knew that same loud decreeing talk to be a method on his own behalf of concealing his sensitive resentment at the tone i had adopted lady marias carriage had gone to fetch her husband from a political dinner my portmanteau advised me to wait for its return durstan and riversley were at feud however owing to some powerful rude english used toward the proprietor of the former place by the squire so i thought it better to let one of the grooms shoulder my luggage and follow him the night was dark he chose the roadway and i crossed the heath meeting an exhilarating high wind that made my blood race egoism is not peculiar to any period of life it is only especially curious in a young man beginning to match himself against his elders for in him it suffuses the imagination he is not merely selfishly sentient or selfishly scheming his very conceptions are selfish i remember walking at my swiftest pace blaming everybody i knew for insufficiency for want of subordination to my interests for poverty of nature grossness blindness to the fine lights shining in me i blamed the fates for harassing me circumstances for not surrounding me with friends worthy of me the central i resembled the sun of this universe with the difference that it shrieked for nourishment instead of dispensing it my monstrous conceit of elevation will not suffer condensation into sentences what i can testify to is that for making you bless the legs you stand on a knockdown blow is a specific i had it before i knew that a hand was up i should have fancied that i had run athwart a tree but for the recollection as i was reeling to the ground of a hulk of a fellow suddenly fronting me and he did not hesitate with his fist i went over and over into a heathery hollow the wind sang shrill through the furzes nothing was visible but black clumps black cloud astonished though i was and shaken it flashed through me that this was not the attack of a highwayman he calls upon you to stand and deliver it is a foe that hits without warning the blow took me on the forehead and might have been worse not seeing the enemy curiosity was almost as strong in me as anger but reflecting that i had injured no one i knew of my nerves were quickly at the right pitch brushing some spikes of furze off my hands i prepared for it a cry rose my impression seemed to be all backward travelling up to me a moment or two behind time i recognised a strange tongue in the cry but too late that it was romany to answer it instantly a voice was audible above the noisy wind i spot him then began some good and fair fighting i got my footing on grass and liked the work the fellow facing me was unmistakably gipsybuild i too had length of arm and a disposition to use it by hitting straight out with footing firm instead of dodging and capering which told in my favour and is decidedly the best display of the noble art on a dark night my dancer went over as neatly as i had preceded him and therewith i considered enough was done for vengeance the thrill of a salmon on the gut is known to give a savage satisfaction to our original nature it is but an extension and attenuation of the hearty contentment springing from a thorough delivery of the fist upon the prominent features of an assailant that yields to it perforce even when you receive such perfect blows you are half satisfied feeling conqueror my wrath was soothed i bent to have a look at my ruffian and ask him what cause of complaint gipsies camping on durstan could find against riversley a sharp stroke on the side of my neck sent me across his body he bit viciously in pain and desperation i flew at another of the tawny devils they multiplied i took to my heels but this was the vainest of stratagems they beat me in nimbleness four of them were round me when i wheeled breathless to take my chance at fighting the odds fiery men have not much notion of chivalry gipsies the least of all they yelled disdain of my summons to them to come on one by one now they had caught me now they would pay me now they would pound me and standing at four corners they commended me to think of becoming a jelly four though they were they kept their positions they left it to me to rush in for a close the hinder ones held out of arms reach so long as i was disengaged i had perpetually to shift my front thinkingoh for a stick any stout bit of timber my fists ached and a repetition of nasty dull knocks on back and neck slogging thumps dealt by men getting to make sure of me shattered my breathing i cried out for a pause offered to take a couple of them at a time i challenged threethe fourth to bide i was now the dancer left right and roundabout i had to swing halfstunned halfstrangled with gorge those terrible blows in the back did the mischief sickness threatened to undermine me boxers have breathingtime i had none stiff and sick i tried to run i tottered i stood to be knocked down i dropped like a logcareless of life but i smelt earth keenly and the damp grass and the devils play of their feet on my chin chest and thighs revived a fit of wrath enough to set me staggering on my legs again they permitted it for the purpose of battering me further i passed from down to up mechanically and enjoyed the chestful of air given me in the interval of rising thought of germany and my father and janet at her window complacently raised a childs voice in my throat for mercy quite inaudible and accepted my punishment one idea i had was that i could not possibly fail as a speaker after thisi wanted but a minutes grace to fetch breath for an oration beginning you fools for i guessed that they had fallen upon the wrong man not a second was allowed soon the shrewd physical bracing acting momentarily on my brain relaxed the fitful illumination ceased all ideas faded outclung about my beaten bodyfled the body might have been tossed into its grave for aught i knew chapter xlvi among gipsy women i cannot say how long it was after my senses had gone when i began to grope for them on the warmest of heaving soft pillows and lost the slight hold i had on them with the effort then came a series of climbings and fallings risings to the surface and sinkings fathoms below any attempt to speculate pitched me back into darkness gifted with a pair of enormous eyes which threw surrounding objects to a distance of a mile away i could not induce the diminutive things to approach and shutting eyes led to such a rolling of mountains in my brain that terrified by the gigantic revolution i lay determinedly staring clothed it seemed positive in a tightfitting suit of sheetlead but why i wondered why and immediately received an extinguishing blow my pillow was heavenly i was constantly being cooled on it and grew used to hear a croon no more musical than the unstopped reed above my head a sound as of a breeze about a caverns mouth more soothing than a melody conjecture of my state after hovering timidly in dread of relapses settled and assured me i was lying baked halfburied in an old riverbed moss at my cheek my body inextricable water now and then feebly striving to float me out with horrid pain with infinite refreshingness a shady light like the light through leafage i could see the water i felt why did it keep trying to move me i questioned and sank to the depths again the excruciated patient was having his wet bandages folded across his bruises and could not bear a motion of the mind the minds total apathy was the sign of recovering health kind nature put that district to sleep while she operated on the disquieted lower functions i looked on my later self as one observes the mossy bearded substances travelling blind along the undercurrent of the stream clinging to this and that twirling absurdly where was i not in a house but for my condition of absolute calm owing to skilful treatment open air and physical robustness the scene would have been of a kind to scatter the busy little workmen setting up the fabric of my wits a lighted oilcup stood on a tripod in the middle of a tentroof and over it the creased neck and chin of a tall old woman splendid in age reddened vividly her black eyes and grey brows and greyishblack hair fell away in a dusk of their own i thought her marvellous something she held in her hands that sent a thin steam between her and the light outside in the a cutting of the tents threshold a heavycoloured sunset hung upon dark land my pillow meantime lifted me gently at a regular measure and it was with untroubled wonder that i came to the knowledge of a human heart beating within it so soft could only be feminine so firm still young the bosom was kiomis a girl sidled at the opening of the tent peeping in and from a muffled rattle of subpectoral thunder discharged at her in quick heated snaps i knew kiomis voice after an altercation of their monotonous gipsy undertones the girl dropped and crouched outside it was morning when i woke next stronger and aching worse i was lying in the air and she who served for nurse pillow parasol and bank of herbage had her arms round beneath mine cherishingly all the fingers outspread and flat on me just as they had been when i went to sleep kiomi now you be quiet can i stand up a minute or two no and you wont talk i submitted this was our duel all day she slipped from me only twice and when she did the girl took her place i began to think of bulsted and riversley kiomi how long have i been here yous be twice as long as youve been a couple of days more like a dozen just tell me what happened ghmmm she growled admonishingly reflecting on it i felt sure there must have been searching parties over the heath kiomi i say how was it they missed me she struck at once on my thought theyre fools how did you cheat them i didnt tie a handkercher across their eyes you half smothered me once in the combe you go to sleep have you been doctor the growling tigerish ghmmm constrained me to take it for a lullaby kiomi why the deuce did your people attack me she repeated the sound resembling that which sometimes issues from the vent of a mine but i insisted upon her answering ill put you down and be off she threatened brute of a girl i hate you hate away tell me who found me i shant you shut your peepers the other and younger girl sung out i found you kiomi sent a volley at her i did said the girl yes and i nursed you first i did and mother doctored you kiomi hasnt been here a day the old mother came out of the tent she felt my pulse and forthwith squatted in front of me youre hard to kill and oily as a bean said she youve only to lie quiet in the sun like a handsome gentleman im sure you couldnt wish for more air and waters the doctor for such as you youve got the bound in you to jump the ditch dont you fret at it or youll lose your spring my good gentleman leave off talking to me as a stranger i bawled out with it why have you kept me here why did your men pitch into me our men my good gentleman the old woman ejaculated there was innocence indeed sufficient to pass the whole tribe before a bench of magistrates she wheedled what have they against a handsome gentleman like you theyd run for you fifty mile a day and show you all their tricks and secrets for nothing my despot kiomi fired invectives at her mother the old mother retorted the girl joined in all three were scowling flashing showing teeth driving the wordy javelin upon one another indiscriminately or two to one without a pause all to a sound like the slack silver string of the fiddle i sang out truce to them they racked me with laughter and such laughterthe shaking of husks in a halfempty sack ultimately on a sudden cessation of the storm of tongues they agreed that i must have my broth sheer weariness seasoned with some hope that the broth would give me strength to mount on my legs and walk persuaded me to drink it still the old mother declared that none of her men would ever have laid hands on me why should they she asked what had i done to them was it their way kiomis arms tightened over my breast the involuntary pressure was like an illumination to me no longer asking for the grounds of the attack on a mistaken person and bowing to the fiction that none of the tribe had been among my assailants i obtained information the girl eveleen had spied me entering durstan quite by chance she was concealed near bulsted park gates when the groom arrived and told the lodgekeeper that mr harry richmond was coming up over the heath and might have lost his way richmond the girl threw a world of meaning into the unexpected name kiomi clutched me to her bosom but no one breathed the name we had in our thoughts eveleen and the old mother had searched for me upon the heath and having haled me head and foot to their tent despatched a message to bring kiomi down from london to aid them in their desperate shift they knew squire belthams temper he would have scattered the tribe to the shores of the kingdom at a rumour of foul play to his grandson kiomi came in time to smuggle me through an inspection of the tent and crossexamination of its ostensible denizens by captain bulsted who had no suspicions though he was in a state of wonderment hearing all this i was the first to say it would be better i should get out of the neighbourhood as soon as my legs should support me the grin that goes for a laugh among gipsies followed my question of how kiomi had managed to smuggle me eveleen was my informant when the dreaded kiomi happened to be off duty for a minute by a hasty transformation due to a nightcap on the bandages about the head and an old petticoat over my feet captain williams insensible friend was introduced to him as the sore sick greatgrandmother of the tribe mother of kiomis mother aged ninetyone the captain paid like a man for doctor and burial fees he undertook also to send the old lady a pound of snuff to assist her to a last sneeze or two on the right side of the grave and he kept his word for deeming it necessary to paint her in a characteristic these prodigious serpents told him gravely that she delighted in snuff it was almost the only thing that kept her alive barring a sip of broth captain williams comment on the interesting piece of longevity whose wellcovered length and framework lay exposed to his respectful contemplation was that she must have been a devilish fine old lady in her day six foot was given as her measurement one pound of snuff a bottle of rum and five sovereigns were the fruits of the captains sensibility i shattered my ribs with laughter over the story eveleen dwelt on the triumph twinkling kiomi despised laughter or triumph resulting from the natural exercise of craft in an emergency but my handsome gentleman he wont tell on us will he when weve nursed him and doctored him and made him one of us and as good a stick o timber as grows in the forest whined the old mother i had to swear i would not he cried kiomi he may forget us when hes gone the mother said she would have liked me to kiss a book to seal the oath anxiety about the safety of their homes that is the assurance of an untroubled reception upon their customary campingground is a peculiarity of the gipsies distinguishing them equally with their cleanliness and thriftiness from mumpers and the common wanderers it is their tribute to civilization which generally keeps them within the laws who that does not know them will believe that under their domestic system i had the best broth and the best tea i have ever tasted they are very cunning brewers and sagacious buyers too their maxims show them to direct all their acuteness upon obtaining quality for their money a compliment not backed by silver is hardly intelligible to the pretty ones money is a really credible thing to them and when they have it they know how to use it apparently because they know so well so perfectly appreciating it they have only vague ideas of a corresponding sentiment on the opposite side to the bargain and imagine that they fool people much more often than they succeed in doing once duped themselves they are the wariest of the dogburnt the place is notched where it occurred and for ever avoided on the other hand they repose implicit faith in a reputation vouched for by their experience i was amused by the girl eveleens dotting of houses over the breadth of five counties where for this and that article of apparel she designed to expend portions of a golden guinea confident that she would get the very best and a shilling besides the unwonted coin gave her the joy of supposing she cheated the mint of that sum this guinea was a present to the girl to whom i owed my thrashing by the way that excused itself under cover of being a bribe for sight of a mirror interdicted by the implacable kiomi i wanted to have a look at my face now that the familiar scenes were beginning to wear their original features to me my dread of personal hideousness was distressing though eveleen declared the bad blood in my cheeks and eyes had been sucked by pounds of red meat i wondered whether if i stood up and walked to either one of the three great halls lying in an obtuse triangle within view i should easily be recognized when i did see myself i groaned verily with the silence of profound resignation i handed back to eveleen the curious fragment of her boudoir which would have grimaced at helen of troy youre feeling your noseyouve been looking at a glass kiomi said with supernatural swiftness of deduction on her return she added for my comfort that nothing was broken but confessed me to be still a sight and thereupon drove knotty language at eveleen the girl retorted and though these two would never acknowledge to me that any of their men had been in this neighbourhood recently the fact was treated as a matter of course in their spiteful altercation and each saddled the other with the mistake they had committed eveleen snatched the last word what she said i did not comprehend she must have hit hard kiomis eyes lightened and her lips twitched she coloured like the roofing smoke of the tent fire twice she showed her teeth as in a spasm struck to the heart unable to speak breathing in and out of a bitterly disjoined mouth eveleen ran i guessed at the illword spoken kiomi sat eyeing the woodashes a devouring gaze that shot straight and read but one thing they who have seen wild creatures die will have her before them saving the fiery eyes she became an ashencolour i took her little hand unconscious of me her brown fingers clutching at mine she flung up her nostrils craving air this was the picture of the woman who could not weep in her misery kiomi old friend i called to her i could have cursed that other friend the son of mischief for she i could have sworn had been fiercely and wantonly hunted chastity of nature intense personal pride were as proper to her as the free winds are to the heaths they were as visible to dull divination as the milky blue about the iris of her eyeballs she had actually no animal vileness animal though she might be termed and would have appeared if compared with heriots admirable cissies and gwennies and other ladies of the graces that run to fall and spend their pains more in kindling the scent of the huntsman than in effectively flying there was no consolation for her the girl eveleen came in sight loitering and looking kicking her idle heels kiomi turned sharp round to me im going your fathers here up at bulsted ill see him he wont tell hell come soon youll be fit to walk in a day youre sound as a nail goodbyei shant say goodbye twice she answered my attempt to keep her and passed into the tent out of which she brought a small bundle tied in a yellow handkerchief and walked away without nodding or speaking what was that you said to kiomi i questioned eveleen who was quickly beside me she replied accurately or not i told her our mend give her as good as she gave me let her wait and see therewith she pouted or to sketch her with precision snouted would better convey the vivacity of her ugly flash of features it was an error in me to think her heartless she talked of her aunt kiomi affectionately for a gipsy girl whose modulated tones are all addressed to the soft public eveleen spoke with the pride of bated breath of the ferocious unforgivingness of their men perhaps if she had known that i traced the good repute of the tribes for purity to the sweeter instincts of the women she would have eulogized her sex to amuse me gipsy girls like other people are fond of showing off but it would have been a victory of education to have helped her to feel the distinction of the feminine sense of shame half as awfully and warmly as she did the inscrutable iron despotism of the males she hinted that the mistake of which i had been the victim would be rectified tell your men ill hunt them down like rats if i hear of it said i while we were conversing my father arrived eveleen not knowing him would have had me accept the friendly covering of a mat heres a big one hes a clergyman she muttered to herself and ran to him and set up a gipsy whine fronting me up to the last step while she advanced she only yielded ground to my outcry my father bent over me kiomi had prepared him for what he saw i quieted his alarm by talking currently and easily julia bulsted had despatched a messenger to inform him of my mysterious disappearance but he as his way was revelling in large conjectures had half imagined me seized by a gust of passion and bound for germany without my luggage i laughed ay without your luggage richie he answered seriously his conceit of a better knowledge of me than others possessed had buoyed him up for i knew he said we two do nothing like the herd of men i thought you were off to her my boy now he looked at me and this look of dismay was a perfect mirror i was not a presentable object he stretched his limbs on the heather and kept hold of my hand looking and talking watchfully doctorlike doubting me to be as sound in body as i assured him i was despite aches and pains eveleen hung near these people have been kind to you he said no the biggest brutes on the earth said i oh you say that when i spotted you out in the dark where you might have lied to be eaten and carried you and washed your bloody face and watched you and never slept i didnt to mother you and wet your head cried the girl my father beckoned to her and thanked her appreciably in the yellow tongue so these scoundrels of the high road fell upon you and robbed you richie i nodded you let him think they robbed you and you had your purse to give me a gold guinea out of it eveleen cried and finding herself in the wrong track volubly resumed that they didnt for they hadnt time whether they meant to and the night black as a coal whoever they were the mystery of my not having sent word to bulsted or to riversley perplexed my father comfortable here he echoed me disconsolately and glanced at the heath the tent the black circle of the brothpot and the wild girl chapter xlvii my father acts the charmer again kiomis mother was seen in a turn of the gravelcutting bearing purchases from durstan village she took the new circumstances in with a single cast up of her wary eyelids and her and her skill in surgery and art in medicine i praised to lull her fears which procured me the denomination of old friend as well as handsome gentleman she went so far as to add in a fit of natural warmth nice fellow and it is the truth that this term effected wonders in flattering me it seemed to reveal to me how simple it was for harry richmond one whom gipsies could think a nice fellow to be the lord of janets affectionsto be her husband my heart throbbed yet she was within range of a mile and a half and i did not wish to be taken to her i did wish to smell the piney air about the lakepalace but the thought of ottilia caused me no quick pulsations my father remained an hour he could not perceive the drift of my objection to go either to bulsted or to riversley and desire that my misadventure should be unknown at those places however he obeyed me as i could always trust him to do scrupulously and told a tale at bulsted in the afternoon he returned in a carriage to convey me to the seaside when i was raised i fainted and saw the last of the camp on durstan much as i had come to it first sickness and swimming of the head continued for several days i was persecuted with the sensation of the carriage journey and an iteration of my fathers that ran my sons inanimate body in my arms or clasping the lifeless body of my sole son harry richmond and other variations i said nothing about it he told me aghast that i had spat blood a battery of eight fists having it in the end all its own way leaves a deeper indentation on its target than a pistolshot that passes free of the vital chords my convalescence in germany was a melody compared with this i ought to have stopped in the tent according to the wise old mothers advice given sincerely for prudence counselled her to strike her canvas and be gone there i should have lain interested in the progress of a bee the course of a beetle or a cloud a spiders business and the shaking of the gorse and the heather until good health had grown out of thoughtlessness the very sight of my father was as a hive of humming troubles his intense anxiety about me reflected in my mind the endless worry i had concerning him it was the intellect which condemned him when he wore a joyful air and the sensations when he waxed oversolicitous whether or not the sentences were just the judges should have sometimes shifted places i was unable to divine why he fevered me so much must i say ithe had ceased to entertain me instead of a comic i found him a tragic spectacle and his exuberant anticipations his bursting hopes that fed their forcingbed with the blight and decay of their predecessors his transient fits of despair after a touch at my pulses and exclamation of oh richie richie if only i had my boy up and wellassuming that nothing but my tardy recovery stood in the way of our contentmentwere examples of downright unreason such as contemplation through the comic glass would have excused the tragic could not i knew nevertheless that to the rest of the world he was a progressive comedy and the knowledge made him seem more tragic still he clearly could not learn from misfortune he was not to be contained money i gave him freely holding the money at my disposal his own i chafed at his unteachable spirit surely one of the most tragical things in life and the proof of my love for him was that i thought it so though i should have been kinder had he amused me as in the old days conceive to yourself the keeping watch over a fountain choked in its spouting incessantly labouring to spin a jet into the air now for a moment glittering and towering in a column and once more straining to mount my father appeared to me in that and other images he would have had me believe him shooting to his zenith victorious at last i likewise was to reap a victory of the highest kind from the attack of the mysterious ruffians so much he said he thought he could assure me of he chattered of an intimidated government and dettermain and newson duchesses dukes most friendly innumerable invitations to country castles and among other things one which really showed him to be capable of conceiving ideas and working from an initiative but this too though it accomplished a temporary service he rendered illusory to me by his unhappy manner of regarding it as an instance of his now permanent social authority he had instituted what he called his jury of honour court composed of the select gentlemen of the realm ostensibly to weigh the causes of disputes between members of their class and decree the method of settlement but actually my father admitted to put a stop to the affair between edbury and me that was the origin of the notion richie i carried it on i dined some of the best men of our day i seized the opportunity when our choicest emperor was rolling on wheels to propound my system i mention the names of bramham dewitt colonel hibbert segrave lord alonzo carr admiral loftus the earl of luton the marquis of hatchford jack hippony monterez williamsi think you know himand little dick phillimore son of a bigwig a fellow of a capital wit and discretion i mention them as present to convince you we are not triflers dear boy my argument ran it is absurd to fight also it is intolerable to be compelled to submit to insult as the case stands we are under a summary edict of the citizens to whom chivalry is unknown well well i delivered a short speech fighting i said resembled buttinga performance proper to creatures that grow horns instead of brains not to allude to a multitude of telling remarks and the question is man a fighting animal my answer being that he is not born with spurs on his heels or horns to his head and that those who insisted on fighting should be examined by competent anatomists ologists of some sort to decide whether they have the excrescences and proclaim them touching on these lighter parts of my theme with extreme delicacy butand here i dwelt on my point man if not a fighting animal in his gloriousi forgot whatis a sensitive one and has the idea of honour hear from colonel segrave and sir weeton slaterhe was one of the party in fine richie i found myself wafted into a breathing oration i cannot i confess it humbly hear your hear hear without going up and off inflated like a balloon shall the arbitration of the magistracy indemnifications in money awarded by the lawcourts succeed in satisfyingbut i declare to you richie it was no platform speech i know your termthe chaincable sentence nothing of the kind i assure you plain sense as from gentlemen to gentlemen we require i said a protection that the polite world of great britain does not now afford us against the aggressions of the knave the fool and the brute we establish a court we do herebyno no not the hereby quite simply richiepledge ourselvesi said some other word not pledge to use our utmost authority and influence to exclude from our circles persons refusing to make the reparation of an apology for wanton common insults we renounce intercourse with men declining when guilty of provoking the sentiment of hostility to submit to the jurisdiction of our court all i want you to see is the notion we raise the shield against the cowardly bully which the laws have raised against the bloody one and gentlemen my father resumed his oration forgetting my sober eye for a minutegentlemen we are the ultimate court of appeal for men who cherish their honour yet abstain from fastening it like a millstone round the neck of their commonsense credit me richie the proposition kindled we cited lord edbury to appear before us and i tell you we extracted an ample apology to you from that young nobleman and let me add one that i that we must impose it upon an old son to accept he does come come and you shall see richie society shall never repose an inert mass under my leadership i cure it i shake it and cure it he promenaded the room repeating i do not say i am possessed of a panacea and bending to my chin as he passed i maintain that i can and do fulfil the duties of my station which is my element attained in the teeth of considerable difficulties as no other man could be he prince or prime minister not one he flourished stepping onward and mind you richie this he swung round conscious as ever of the critic in me though witless to correct his pomp of style this is not selfglorification i point you facts i have a thousand schemesprojects i recognize the value of early misfortune the particular misfortune of princes born is that they know nothing of the worldbabies i grant you babies now i do i have it on my thumbnail i know its wants and just as i succeeded in making you a member of our parliament in assembly and the husband of an hereditary princesshear meso will i make good my original determination to be in myself the fountain of our social laws and leader i have never i believeto speak conscientiouslyfailed in a thing i have once determined on the single wish that i might be a boy again to find pleasure in his talk was all that remained to combat the distaste i had for such oppressive deliveries of a mind apparently as little capable of being seated as a bladder charged with gas i thanked him for getting rid of edbury and a touch of remorse pricked me it is true on his turning abruptly and saying you see me in my nakedness richie to you and my valet the heart the body he was too sympathetic not to have a keen apprehension of a state of hostility in one whom he loved if i had inclined to melt however his next remark would have been enough to harden me i have fought as many battles and gained as startling victories as napoleon buonaparte he was an upstart the word gave me a jerk sometimes he would indulge me transparently in a political controversy confessing that my dialectical dexterity went far to make a radical of him i had no other amusement or i should have held my peace i tried every argument i could think of to prove to him that there was neither honour nor dignity nor profit in aiming at titular distinctions not forced upon us by the circumstances of our birth he kept his position with much sly fencing approaching shrewdness and whatever i might say i could not deny that a vile old knockkneed world tugging its forelock to the look of rank and chink of wealth backed him if he chose to be insensible to radical dignity in my time said he all young gentlemen were born tories the doctor no more expected to see a radical come into the world from a good family than a radish but i discern you my dear boy our reigning families must now be active they require the discipline i have undergone and i also dine at aldermens tables and lay a foundationstoneas jorian sayswith the facility of a henmother that should not suffice them tis not sufficient for me i lay my stone eat my dinner make my complimentary speechand that is all that is expected of us but i am fully aware we should do more we must lead or we are lost ay andto quote you a lord mayors barge is a pretty piece of gilt for the festive and luxurious to run up the river thames in and mark their swans i am convinced there is something deep in that but what am i to do would you have me frown upon the people richie it is prudenti maintain it righteous nay it is i affirm positively sovereign wisdomto cultivate every flower in the british bosom riposte mehave you too many say yes and you pass my guard you cannot i fence you there this british loyalty is in my estimation absolutely beautiful we grow to a head in our old england the people have an eye i need no introduction to them we reciprocate a highly cordial feeling when they line the streets and roads with respectful salutations and i acknowledge their demonstrative goodwill these things make us a nation by heaven richie you are on this occasion if your dad may tell you so wrong i ask pardon for my bluntness but i put it to you could we not travelling as personages in our wellbeloved country count on civility to greet us everywhere assuredly not my position is that by consenting to their honest enthusiasm wethe identical effect you are perpetually crying out forwe civilize them we civilize them goodnessa great britain without royalty he launched on a series of desolate images in the end he at least persuaded himself that he had an idea in his anxiety to cultivate the primary british sentiment we moved from town to town along the south coast but it was vain to hope we might be taken for simple people nor was he altogether to blame except in allowing the national instinct for worship and reverence to air itself unrebuked i fled to the island temple ran down to meet me there and i heard that janet had written to him for news of me he entered our hotel a private person when he passed out hats flew off before him the modest little fellow went along a double line of attentive observers on the pier and came back asking me in astonishment who he was supposed to be i petitioned for privacy here exclaimed my father it accounted for the mystery temple knew my feelings and did but glance at me close upon temples arrival we had a strange couple of visitors mistress dolly disher and her husband my father introduced them she called him by one of his christian names inadvertently at times the husband was a confectioner a satisfied shade of a man who reserved the exercise of his will for his business we learnt she a bustling freshfaced woman of fortyfive with still expressive dark eyes and i guessed the ideal remainder of a passion in her bosom the guess was no great hazard she was soon sitting beside me telling me of the years she had known my father and of the most affectionate friend and perfect gentleman he was of the ladies who had been in love with him no wonder and of his sorrows and struggles and his beautiful voice and hearts that bled for him and of one at least who prayed and trusted he would be successful at last temple and the pallid confectioner spent the day on board a yacht with my father mrs dolly stayed to nurse me and persuade me to swallow medicine she talked of her youth when as a fashionable bootmakers daughter she permitted no bills to be sent in to mr richmond alleging as a sufficient reason for it to her father that their family came from richmond in yorkshire eventually the bills were always paid she had not been able to manage her husband so well and the consequence was that she breathed low an execution was out though i tell him she said tremulously hes sure to be paid in the long run if only hell wait but no he is you cannot think how obstinate in his business and my girl augusta waiting for mr roy richmond the wish of our hearts to assist at her wedding and can we ask it and have an execution hanging over him and for all my husbands a guest here hes as likely as not to set the officers at work do what i will tomorrow or any day your father invited us mr harry i forced my husband to come hoping against hope for your papa gave the orders relying on me as he believed he might and my husband undertook them all through me there it stops he hears reports and he takes fright in goes the bill then its law and last oh im ashamed mr dishers bill was for supplying suppers to the balls he received my cheque for the amount in full observing that he had been confident his wife was correct when she said it would be paid but a tradesmans business was to hasten the day of payment and for a penance he himself would pacify the lawyers on hearing of the settlement of mr dishers claim my father ahemd speechless which was a sign of his swallowing vexation he remarked that i had no doubt with the best intentions encroached on his liberty i do not like to have my debts disturbed he put it to me whether a man carrying out a lifelong plan would not be disconcerted by the friendliest intervention this payment to disher he pronounced fatal in policy you have struck a heavy blow to my credit richie good little mistress dolly brought the man down hereno select addition to our societyand we were doing our utmost to endure him as the ladies say for the very purpose but the error stands committed for the future friend disher will infallibly expect payments within the year credit for suppers is the guarantee of unlimited entertainments and i was inspiring him with absolute confidence for next years campaign money you are aware is no longer a question to terrify me i hold proofs that i have conclusively frightened government and you know it but this regards the manipulation of the man disher he will now dictate to me a refresher of a few hundreds would have been impolitic to this kind of man but the entire sum and to a creditor in arms you reverse the proper situations of gentleman and tradesman my supperman in particular should be taught to understand that he is bound up in my success something frightened him he proceeded at law and now we have shown him that he has frightened us an execution my dear boy i have danced an execution five years running and ordered consecutively at the same house like other matters an execution depends upon how you treat it the odds are that we have mortally offended mistress dolly he apologized for dwelling on the subject with the plea that it was an essential part of his machinery of action and the usual comparison of the sagacious general whose forethought omitted no minutiae i had to listen the lady professed to be hurt the payment however put an end to the visit of this couple politic or not it was a large sum to disburse and once more my attention became fixed on the probable display of figures in my bankers book bonds and bills were falling due the current expenses were exhausting i tried to face the evil and take a line of conduct staggering as i did on my feet had i been well enough i believe i should have gone to my grandfather to throw myself on his goodnature such was the brains wise counsel but i was all nerves and alarms insomuch that i interdicted temples writing to janet lest it should bring on me letters from my aunt dorothy full of advice that could no longer be followed wellmeant cautions that might as well be addressed to the mileposts behind me moreover janet would be flying on the wind to me and i had a craving for soft arms and the look of her eyebrows that warned me to keep her off if i intended to act as became a man of good faith fair weather sunny green seawater speckled with yachts shooting and bounding and sending me the sharp sense of life there is in dashedup fountains of silvery saltspray would have quickened my blood sooner but for this hotbed of fruitless adventure tricksy precepts and wisdom turned imp in which my father had again planted me to pity him seemed a childish affectation his praise of my good looks pleased me for on that point he was fitted to be a judge and i was still fancying i had lost them on the heath troops of the satellites of his grand parade surrounded him i saw him walk down the pier like one breaking up a levee at times he appeared to me a commanding phantasm in the midst of phantasm figures of great ladies and their lords whose names he told off on his return like a drover counting his herd but within range of his eye and voice the reality of him grew overpowering it seduced me and despite reason i began to feel warm under his compliments he was like wine gaiety sprang under his feet sitting at my window i thirsted to see him when he was out of sight and had touches of the passion of my boyhood i listened credulously too as in the old days when he repeated you will find i am a magician and very soon richie mark me his manner hinted that there was a surprise in store you have not been on the brink of the grave for nothing he resembled wine in the other conditions attached to its rare qualities oh for the choice of having only a little of him instead of having him on my heart the unfilial wish attacked me frequently he could be and was so ravishing to strangers and light acquaintances did by chance a likeness exist between us my sick fancy rushed to the belthams for a denial there did of some sort i knew and the thought partitioned my dreamy ideas of which the noblest taking advantage of my physical weakness compelled me to confess that it was a vain delusion for one such as i to hope for ottilia this looking at the roots of yourself if you are possessed of a nobler half that will do it is a sound corrective of an excessive ambition unfortunately it would seem that young men can do it only in sickness with the use of my legs and openair breathing i became compact and as hungry and zealous on behalf of my individuality as proud of it as i had ever been prouder and hungrier my first day of outing when looking at every face i could reflect on the miraculous issue of mine almost clear from its pummelling and above all that my nose was safenot stamped with the pugilists brandinspired a lyrical ebullition of gratitude who so intoxicated as the convalescent catching at health i met charles etherell on the pier and heard that my parliamentary seat was considered in peril together with a deal of gossip about my disappearance my father who was growing markedly restless on the watch for letters and new arrivals started to pay chippenden a flying visit he begged me urgently to remain for another few days while he gathered information saying my presence at his chief quarters did him infinite service and i always thought that possible i should find he was a magician he repeated with a sort of hesitating fervour i had just waved my hand to him as the boat was bearing him away from the pierhead when a feminine voice murmured in my ear is not this our third meeting mr harry richmondvenice elbestadt and the isle of wight she ran on allowing me time to recognize clara goodwin what was your last adventure you have been ill very ill has it been serious i made light of it no a tumble you look pale she said quickly thats from grieving at the loss of my beauty miss goodwin have you really not been seriously ill she asked with an astonishing eagerness i told her mockloftily that i did not believe in serious illnesses coming to godlike youth and plied her in turn with inquiries you have not been laid up in bed she persisted no on my honour not in bed then said she i would give much to be able to stop that boat she amazed me why because its going on a bad errand she replied miss goodwin you perplex me my father has started in that boat yes i saw him she glanced hastily at the foam in a way to show indifference what i am saying concerns others who have heard you were dangerously ill i have sent for them to hasten across my aunt and miss ilchester no who are they miss goodwin ill answer any question ive been queerish thats true now let me hear who they are when you arrived when you expect them where are they now as to me she responded with what stretched on my ears like an insufferable drawl i came over last night to hire a furnished house or lodgings papa has an appointment attached to the fortifications yonder well leave the pier if you please you draw too much attention on ladies who venture to claim acquaintance with so important a gentleman we walked the whole length of the pier chatting of our former meetings not here she said as soon as i began to question i was led farther on half expecting that the accessories of time and place would have to do with the revelation the bitter creature drew me at her heels into a linendrapers shop there she took a seat pitched her voice to the key of a ladys at a dinnertable when speaking to her cavalier of the history or attire of some one present and said you are sure the illness was not at all feigned she had me as completely at her mercy in this detestable shop as if i had been in a witnessbox feigned i exclaimed that is no answer and pray remember where you are no the illness was not feigned and you have not made the most of it what an extraordinary thing to say that is no answer and please do not imagine yourself under the necessity of acting every sentiment of your heart before these people she favoured a shopman with halfadozen directions my answer is then that i have not made the most of it i said not even by proxy once more im adrift you are certainly energetic i must address you as a brother or it will be supposed we are quarrelling harry do you like that pattern yes whats the meaning of proxy with the accent you give it heaven only knows what it means i would rather you did not talk here like a frenchman relating his last loveaffair in company must your voice escape control exactly at the indicatory words do you think your father made the most of it of my illness oh yes the utmost i should undoubtedly think so thats his way why did you permit it i was what they call wandering half the time besides who could keep him in check i rarely know what he is doing you dont know what he wrote wrote that you were dying of me to whom she scrutinized me and rose from her chair i must try some other shop how is it that if these english people cannot make a berthe fit to wear they do not conceive the idea of importing such things from paris i will take your arm harry you have bought nothing i remarked i have as much as i went for she replied and gravely thanked the assistant leaning on his thumbs across the counter after which dropping the graceless play of an enigma she inquired whether i had forgotten the frau von dittmarsch i had utterly but not her maiden name of sibley miss goodwin is she one of those who are coming to the island frau von dittmarsch yes she takes an interest in you she and i have been in correspondence ever since my visit to sarkeld it reminds me you may vary my maiden name with the christian if you like harry i believe you are truthful as ever in spite dont be unjust said i i wish i could think i was she rejoined frau von dittmarsch was at sarkeld and received terrible news of you she called on me at my fathers residence over the water yonder yesterday afternoon desiring greatly to knowshe is as cautious as one with a jewel in her custodyhow it fared with you whether you were actually in a dying state i came here to learn i have friends here you were not alone or i should have called on you the rumour was that you were very ill so i hired a furnished place for frau von dittmarsch at once but when i saw you and him together and the parting between you i began to have fears i should have countermanded the despatch i sent by the boat had it been possible it has gone and tell me the name of the other frau von dittmarsch has a husband not with her now oh cruel speak her name her name harry her title is countess von delzenburg not princess not in england then ottilia was here my father was indeed a magician chapter xlviii the princess entrapped not princess in england could betoken but one thingan incredible act of devotion so great that it stunned my senses and i thought of it and of all it involved before the vision of ottilia crossing seas took possession of me the princess ottilia miss goodwin the countess of delzenburg harry to see me she has come harry you talk like the boy you were when we met before you knew her yes and yes to everything you have to say but i think you should spare her name she comes thinking me ill dying im as strong as ever i was i should imagine you are only rather pale have you tell me clara seen her yourself is she well pale not unwell anxious about me it may be about the political affairs of the continent they are disturbed she spoke of me yes she is coming by the next boat its my fear that she is why do you fear shall i answer you harry it is useless now well because she has been deceived that is why you will soon find it out prince ernest is at sarkeld in paris i hear how will your despatch reach these ladies in time for them to come over by the next boat i have sent my fathers servant the generalhe is promoted at last harryattends the ladies in person and is now waiting for the boats arrival over there to follow my directions you wont leave me miss goodwin had promised to meet the foreign ladies on the pier we quarrelled and made it up a dozen times like girl and boy i calling her aunt clara as in the old days and she calling me occasionally son richie an imitation of my fathers manner of speech to me when we formed acquaintance first in venice but i was very little aware of what i was saying or doing the forces of my life were yoked to the heart and tumbled as confusedly as the world under phaethon charioteer we walked on the heights above the town i looked over the water to the white line of shore and batteries where this wonder stood who was what poets dream of deephearted men hope for none quite believe in hardly could i and though my relenting spinster friend at my elbow kept assuring me it was true that she was there my sceptical sight fixed on the stale prominences visible in the same features which they had worn day after empty day of late this deed of hers was an act of devotion great as death i knew it from experience consonant to ottilias character but could a princess hereditary and bound in the league of governing princes dare so to brave her condition complex of mind simplest in character the uncontrollable nobility of her spirit was no sooner recognized by me than i was shocked throughout by a sudden light contrasting me appallingly with this supreme of women who swept the earth aside for truth i had never before received a distinct intimation of my littleness of nature and my first impulse was to fly from thought and then as if to prove myself justly accused i caught myself regrettingno not regretting gazing as it were on a picture of regretsthat ottilia was not a romantic little lady of semicelestial rank exquisitely rash wilful desperately enamoured bearing as many flying hues and peeps of fancy as a loveballad and not more roughly brushing the rootemotions if she had but been such an one what sprightly colours delicious sadness magical transformations tenderest intermixture of earth and heaven what tears and sunbeams divinest pathos what descents from radiance to consolatory twilight would have surrounded me for poetry and pride to dwell on what captivating melody in the minor key would have been mine though i lost herthe legacy of it all for ever say a petulant princess a star of beauty mad for me and the whisper of our passion and sorrows traversing the flushed world was she coming not she but a touchstone a relentless mirror a piercing eye a mind severe as the goddess of the gods head a princess indeed but essentially a princess above women a remorseless intellect an actual soul visible in the flesh she was truth was i true not so very false yet how far from truth the stains on me a modern man writing his history is fugitive and crepuscular in alluding to them as a woman kneeling at the earguichet burnt like the bloodspots on the criminal compelled to touch his victim by savage ordinance which knew the savage and how to search him and these were faults of weakness rather than the sins of strength i might as fairly hope for absolution of them from ottilia as from offended laws of my natural being gentle though she was and charitable was i not guilty of letting her come on to me hoodwinked at this moment i had a faint memory of miss goodwins saying that she had been deceived and i suggested a plan of holding aloof until she had warned the princess of my perfect recovery to leave it at her option to see me yes miss goodwin assented if you like harry her compassion for me only tentatively encouraged the idea it would perhaps be right you are the judge if you can do it you are acting bravely she must have laughed at me in her heart the hours wore on my curse of introspection left me and descending through the town to the pier amid the breezy blue skirts and bonnetstrings we watched the packetboat approaching there was in advance one of the famous swift island wherries something went wrong with it for it was overtaken and the steamer came in first i jumped on board much bawled at out of a crowd of unknown visages janet appeared my aunt dorothy was near her the pair began chattering of my paleness and wickedness in keeping my illness unknown to them they had seen temple on an excursion to london he had betrayed me as he would have betrayed an archangel to janet will you not look at us harry they both said the passengers were quitting the boat strangers every one harry have we really offended you in coming said janet my aunt dorothy took the blame on herself i scarcely noticed them beyond leading them on to the piersteps and leaving them under charge of miss goodwin who had in matters of luggage and porterage the practical mind and aplomb of an englishwoman that has passed much of her time on the continent i fancied myself vilely duped by this lady the boat was empty of its passengers a grumbling pierman wounded in his dignity notified to me that there were fines for disregard of the companys rules and regulations his tone altered he touched his hat didnt know who you was my lord janet overheard him and her face was humorous we may break the rules you see i said to her we saw him landing on the other side of the water she replied so spontaneously did the circumstance turn her thoughts on my father did you speak to him no you avoided him aunty and i thought it best he landed there was a crowd miss goodwin interposed you go to harrys hotel grandada is coming down tomorrow or next day janet prompted my aunt dorothy if we could seek for a furnished house uberly would watch the luggage dorothy murmured in distress furnished houses even rooms at hotels are doubtful in the height of the season miss goodwin remarked last night i engaged the only decent set of rooms i could get for friends of harrys who are coming no wonder he was disappointed at seeing ushe was expecting them said janet smiling a little they are sure to come said miss goodwin near us a couple of yachtsmen were conversing oh hell be back in a day or two one said when youve once tasted that old boy you cant do without him i remember when i was a youngsterit was in lady betty boltons day she married old edbury you know first wifethe magnificent was then in his prime he spent his money in a week so he hired an eightyton schooner he laid violent hands on a jew bagged him lugged him on board and sailed away what the deuce did he want with a jew cried the other oh the jew supplied cheques for a three months cruise in the mediterranean and came home i heard very good friends with his pirate thats only one of dozens the unconscious slaughterers laughed on another occasioni heard it said by the first speaker as they swung round to parade the pier and passed on narrating not an hotel if it is possible to avoid it my aunt dorothy with heightened colour urged miss goodwin they talked together grandada is coming to you harry janet said he has business in london or he would have been here now our horses and carriages follow us everything you would like he does love you he is very anxious im afraid his health is worse than he thinks temple did not say your father was here but grandada must have suspected it when he consented to our coming and said he would follow us so that looks well perhaps he has been much quieter since your money was paid back to you if they should meet no i hope they will not grandada hates noise and harry let me tell you it may be nothing if he questions you do not take fire just answer plainly im sure you understand one in a temper at a time im sure s enough you have only to be patient with him he has been going to london to the city seeing lawyers bankers brokers and coming back muttering ah dear old man and when he ought to have peace harry the poor will regret him in a thousand places i write a great deal for him now and i know how they will what are you looking at i was looking at a man of huge stature of the stiffest build whose shoulders showed me their full breadth while he stood displaying frontwards the open of his hand in a salute schwartz i called janet started imagining some fierce interjection the giant did not stir but others had heard a lady stepped forward dear mr harry richmond then you are better we had most alarming news of you i bowed to the frau von dittmarsch anciently miss sibley the princess she is here frau von dittmarsch clasped miss goodwins hand i was touching ottilias a veil partly swathed her face she trembled the breeze robbed me of her voice our walk down the pier was almost in silence miss goodwin assumed the guardianship of the foreign ladies i had to break from them and provide for my aunt dorothy and janet they went over in a little boat they were so impatient who is she dorothy beltham asked the princess ottilia said janet are you certain is it really harry i confirmed it and my aunt said i should have guessed it could be no other she has a foreign grace general goodwin was with them when the boat came in from the island said janet he walked up to harrys father and you noticed aunty that the ladies stood away as if they wished to be unobserved as we did and pulled down their veils they would not wait for our boat we passed them crossing people joked about the big servant overweighing the wherry dorothy beltham thought the water too rough for little boats she knows what a sea is i said janet gazed steadily after the retreating figures and then commended me to the search for rooms the end of it was that i abandoned my fathers suite to them an accommodating linendraper possessed of a seaview and rooms which hurled the tenant to the windows in desire for it gave me harbourage till dusk i scoured the town to find miss goodwin without whom there was no clue to the habitation i was seeking and i must have passed her blindly again and again my aunt dorothy and janet thanked me for my consideration in sitting down to dine with them they excused my haste to retire i heard no reproaches except on account of my not sending them word of my illness janet was not warm she changed in colour and voice when i related what i had heard from miss goodwin namely that some one had informed the princess i was in a dying state i was obliged to offer up my father as a shield for ottilia lest false ideas should tarnish the image of her in their minds janet did not speak of him the thought stood in her eyes and there lies the evil of a sore subject among persons of one household they have not to speak to exhibit their minds after a night of suspense i fell upon old schwartz and aennchen out in the earliest dawn according to their german habits to have a gaze at sea and strange country and people aennchen was all wonder at the solitary place schwartz at the big ships but when they tried to direct me to the habitation of their mistress it was discovered by them that they had lost their bearings aennchen told me the margravine had been summoned to rippau just before they left sarkeld her mistress had informed baroness turckems of her intention to visit england prince ernest was travelling in france the hour which brought me to ottilia was noon the arrangements of the ladies could only grant me thirty minutes for janet was to drive the princess out into the country to view the island she and my aunt dorothy had been already introduced miss goodwin after presenting them insisted upon ceremoniously accompanying me to the house quite taking the vulgar view of a proceeding such as the princess had been guilty of and perhaps fearing summary audacity and interestedness in the son of a father like mine she ventured on lecturing me as though it lay with me to restrain the fair romantic head forbear from calling up my special advantages advise and stand to the wisdom of this world and be the man of honour the princess had said not see him when i have come to him i reassured my undiscerning friend partly not wholly would it be commonly sensible or civil to refuse to see me having come miss goodwin doubted i could indicate forcibly because i felt the clearjudging brain and tempered selfcommand whereby ottilia had gained her decision miss goodwin nodded and gave me the stillborn affirmative of politeness her english mind expressed itself willing to have exonerated the rash great lady for visiting a dying lover but he was not the same person now that he was on his feet consequently her expedition wore a different aspectmy not dying condemned her she entreated me to keep the fact of the princesss arrival unknown to my father on which point we were one intensely enthusiastic for the men of her race she would have me above all things by a form of adjuration designed to be a masterpiece of persuasive rhetoric prove myself an englishman i was to show that the honour interests reputation and position of any lady demented or not she added were as precious to me as to the owner that no woman was ever in peril of a shadow of loss in the hands of an english gentleman and so forth rather surprisingly to me remembering her offhand manner of the foregoing day but the sense of responsibility thrown upon her ideas of our superior national dignity had awakened her fervider naturalnessmade her a different person as we say when accounting in our fashion for what a little added heat may do the half hour allotted to me fled i went from the room and the house feeling that i had seen and heard her who was barely of the world of humankind for me so strongly did imagination fly with her i kissed her fingers i gazed in her eyes i heard the beloved voice all passed too swift for happiness recollections set me throbbing but recollection brought longing she said now i have come i must see you harry did it signify that to see me was a piece of kindness at war with her judgement she rejoiced at my perfect recovery though it robbed her of the plea in extenuation of this step she had taken she praised me for abstaining to write to her when i was stammering a set of hastilyimpressed reasons to excuse myself for the omission she praised my step into parliament it did not seem to involve a nearer approach to her she said you have not wasted your time in england it was for my solitary interests that she cared then i brooded desperately i could conceive an overlooking height that made her utterance simple and consecutive i could not reach it topics which to me were palpitating had no terror for her she said i have offended my father i have written to him he will take me away in speaking of the letter which had caused her to offend she did not blame the writer i was suffered to run my eyes over it and was ashamed it read to me too palpably as an outcry to delude and draw her hitherpathos and pathos the father holding his dying son in his arms his sole son harry richmond the son set upon by enemies in the night the lover never daring to beg for a sight of his beloved ere he passed awaynot an illworded letter read uncritically it may have been touching it must have been though it was the reverse for me i frowned broke down in regrets under sharp humiliation she said you knew nothing of it a little transgression is the real offender when we are once out of the way traced for us we are in danger of offending at every step we are as lawless as the outcasts that meant my turning aside to you originally was the blameable thing it might mean my love of you sets my ideas of duty at variance with my fathers she smiled nothing was uttered in a tone of despondency her high courage and breeding gave her even in this pitfall the smoothness which most women keep for society why she had not sent me any message or tidings of herself to riversley was not a matter that she could imagine to perplex me she could not imagine my losing faith in her the least we could do i construed it the religious bond between us was a faith in one another that should sanctify to our souls the external injuries it caused us to commit but she talked in no such strain her delight in treading english ground was her happy theme she said it is as young as when we met in the forest namely the feeling revived for england how far off we were from the green devonshire coast was one of her questions suggestive of our old yachtvoyage lying among her dreams excepting an extreme and terrorizing paleness there was little to fever me with the thought that she suffered mortally of reproach not a word nor of regret at the first touch of hands when we stood together alone she said would hearing of your recovery have given me peace my privileges were the touch of hands the touch of her fingers to my lips a painless hearing and seeing and passionate recollection she said impatience is not for us harry i was not to see her again before the evening these were the last words she said and seemed the lightest until my hot brain made a harvest of them transcending thricetold vows of love did they not mean we two wait therefore the years are bondmen to our stedfastness could sweeter have been said they might mean nothing she was veiled when janet drove her out janet sitting upright in her masterly way smoothing her pet ponies with the curl of her whip chatting and smiling the princess slightly leaning back i strode up to the country roads proud of our lands beauty under a complacent sky by happy chance which in a generous mood i ascribed to janets good nature i came across them at a seven miles distance they were talking spiritedly what was wonderful they gave not much heed to me they seemed on edge for one anothers conversation each face was turned to the others and after nodding an adieu they resumed the animated discourse i had been rather in alarm lest ottilia should think little of janet they passed out of sight without recurring to a thought of me behind them in the evening i was one among a group of ladies i had the opportunity of hearing the running interchange between ottilia and janet which appeared to be upon equal terms indeed janet led the subjects were not very deep plain wits candour and an unpretending tongue it seemed could make common subjects attractive as fair weather does our english woods and fields the princess was attracted by something in janet i myself felt the sway of something while observing ottilias rapt pleasure in her talk and her laughter with those funny familiar frowns and current dimples twisting and melting away like a play of shadows on the eddies of the brook im glad to be with her janet said of ottilia it was just in that manner she spoke in ottilias presence why it should sound elsewhere unsatisfactorily blunt and there possess a finished charm i could not understand i mentioned to janet that i feared my father would be returning she contained herself with a bridled oh we were of one mind as to the necessity for keeping him absent if possible harry youll pardon me i cant talk of him said she i proposed halfearnestly to foil his return by going to london at once thats manly thats nice of you janet said this was on our walk from the house at night my aunt dorothy listened pressing my arm the next morning janet urged me to go at once keep him away bring down grandada harry she cannot quit the island because she has given prince ernest immediate rendezvous here you must not delay to go yes the countess of delzenburg shall have your excuses and no i promise you i will run nobody down besides if i do aunty will be at hand to plead for the defence and she can she has a way that binds one to accept everything she says and temple ought to study with her for a year or two before he wears his gown bring him back with you and grandada he is esteemed here at his true worth i love him for making her in love with english boys i leave the men for those who know them but english boys are unrivalled i declare honesty bravery modesty and nice looks they are so nice in their style and their way of talking i tell her our men may be shy and sneeringawkward i daresay but our boys beat the world do bring down temple i should so like her to see a cricketmatch between two good elevens of our boys harry while she is in england we could have arranged for one at riversley i went and i repressed the idea on my way that janet had manoeuvred by sending me off to get rid of me but i felt myself a living testimony to her heartlessness for no girl of any heart acting the part of friend would have allowed me to go without a leavetaking of her i loved few would have been so cruel as to declare it a duty to go at all especially when the chances were that i might return to find the princess wafted away ottilias condescension had done her no good turn to the right thats your path on she seemed to speak in this style much as she made her touch of the reins understood by her ponies ill take every care of the princess she said her conceit was unbounded i revelled in contemptuous laughter at her assumption of the post of leader with ottilia however it was as well that i should go there was no trusting my father chapter xlix which foreshadows a general gathering at our riversley station i observed the squire in company with captain bulsted jump into a neighbouring carriage i joined them and was called upon to answer various inquiries the squire gave me one of his short tight grasps of the hand in which there was warmth and shyness our english mixture the captain whispered in my ear he oughtnt to be alone hows the greatgrandmother of the tribe said i captain bulsted nodded as if he understood but was at sea until i mentioned the bottle of rum and the remarkable length of that old ladys measurement ay to be sure a grand old soul he said you know that scum of old harry i laughed and so did he at which i laughed the louder he laughs i suppose because his partys got a majority in the house said the squire we gave you a handsome surplus this year sir sweated out of the countrys skin and bone ay you were complimented by the chancellor of the exchequer yes that fellows compliments are like a cabmans and cry foolhe never thanks you but when hes overpaid captain bulsted applauded the sarcasm why did you keep out of knowledge all this time hal my grandfather asked i referred him to the captain hang it cried captain bulsted do you think id have been doing duty for you if id known where to lay hold of you well if you didnt shake hands with me you touched my toes said i and thanked him with all my heart for his kindness to an old woman on the point of the grave i had some fun to flavour melancholy with my grandfather resumed his complaint you might have gone clean off and we none the wiser are we quite sure that his heads clean on said the mystified captain of course we should run to him wherever he was if he was down on his back the squire muttered ay ay sir of course quoth captain william frowning to me to reciprocate this relenting mood but harry where did you turn off that night we sat up expecting you my poor julia was in a terrible fright my lad eh speak up i raised the little finger oh oh went he happily reassured but reflecting added a bout of it i dropped him a penitent nod thats bad though said he then why did you tip me a bottle of rum captain william by george harry youve had a crack o the sconce he exclaimed more sagaciously than he was aware of my grandfather wanted to keep me by his side in london until we two should start for the island next day but his business was in the city mine toward the west we appointed to meet two hours after reaching the terminus he turned to me while giving directions to his man youve got him down there i suppose my fathers in town sir he shall keep away i said humph i maynt object to see him this set me thinking captain bulstedpreviously asking me in a very earnest manner whether i was really all right and soundfavoured me with a hint the squire has plunged into speculations of his own or else he is peeping at somebody elses no danger of the dad being mixed up with companies lets hope not julia pledged her word to janet that i would look after the old squire i suppose i can go home this evening my girl hates to be alone by all means said i and the captain proposed to leave the squire at his hotel in the event of my failing to join him in the city but dont fail if you can help it he urged me for things somehow my dear harry appear to me to look like the compass when the needle gives signs of atmospheric disturbance my only reason for saying so is common observation you can judge for yourself that he is glad to have you with him i told the captain i was equally glad for in fact my grandfathers quietness and apparently friendly disposition tempted me to petition for a dower for the princess at once so that i might be in the position to offer prince ernest on his arrival a distinct alternative supposingit was still but a suppositionottilia should empower me incessant dialogues of perpetually shifting tendencies passed between ottilia and me in my brainnow dark now mildly fair now very wild on one side at least never except by downright force of will could i draw from the phantom of her one purely irrational outcry so deeplyrooted was the knowledge of her nature and mind and when i did force it i was no gainer a puppet stood in her placethe vision of ottilia melted out in threads of vapour and yet she has come to me she has braved everything to come i might say that to liken her to the women who break rules and read duties by their own light but i could not cheat my knowledge of her mrs waddy met me in the hall of my fathers house as usual pressing i regretted to see one hand to her side her heart she said was easily set pittypat now she had been by her masters orders examined by two of the chief physicians of the kingdom baronets both they advised total rest as far as i could apprehend their baronetcies and doings in high regions had been of more comfort than their prescriptions what i am i must be she said meekly and i cannot quit his service till hes abroad again or i drop he has promised me a monument i dont want it but it shows his kindness a letter from heriot informed me that the affair between edbury and me was settled he could not comprehend how what is this new jury of honour who are the jurymen he asked and affected wit i thanked him for a thrashing in a curt reply my father had left the house early in the morning mrs waddy believed that he meant to dine that evening at the seasons farewell dinner of the trumptrick club leastways tollingby has orders to lay out his gentlemensdinners eveningsuit yesterday afternoon he flew down to chippenden and was home late today hes in the city or one of the squares lady edburysah detained in town with the jaundice or toothache he said he was sending to france for a dentist or was it germany for some ladys eyes i am sure i dont know well or ill so long as youre anything to him he will abound pocket and purse you know him by this time mr harry oh my heart a loud knock at the door had brought on the poor creatures palpitations this visitor was no other than prince ernest the name on his card was graf von delzenburg and it set my heart leaping to as swift a measure as mrs waddys hearing that i was in the house he desired to see me we met with a formal bow i congratulate you right heartily upon being out of the list of the nekron he said civilly i am on my way to one of your wateringplaces whither my family should have preceded me do you publish the names and addresses of visitors daily as it is the custom with us i relieved his apprehensions on that head here and there rarely and only at the hotels i believe the excuse was furnished for offering the princesss address possibly in a year or two we may have the pleasure of welcoming you at sarkeld said the prince extending his hand then you have seen the countess of delzenburg on the day of her arrival your highness ladies of my family are staying on the island ah he paused and invited me to bow to him we bowed thus in the room in the hall and at the streetdoor for what purpose could he have called on my father to hear the worst at once that seemed likely supposing him to have lost his peculiar confidence in the princess of which the courtly paces he had put me through precluded me from judging but i guessed acutely that it was not his intention to permit of my meeting ottilia a second time the blow was hard i felt it as if it had been struck already and thought i had gained resignation until like a man reprieved on his road to execution the narrowed circle of my heart opened out to the breadth of the world in a minute returning from the city i hurried to my fathers house late in the afternoon and heard that he had started to overtake the prince leaving word that the prince was to be found at his address in the island no doubt could exist regarding the course i was bound to take i drove to my grandfather stated my case to him and by sheer vehemence took the wind out of his sails so that when i said i am the only one alive who can control my father he answered mildly seems t other way and chose a small snort for the indulgence of his private opinion what this princess came over alone and is down driving out with my girl under an alias he said showing sour aversion at the prospect of a collision with the foreign species as expressive as the ridge of a cats back temple came to dine with us so i did not leave him quite to himself and temple promised to accompany him down to the island oh go if you like the fretted old man dismissed me ive got enough to think over hold him fast to stand up to me within fortyeight hours present time you know who i mean ive got a question or two for him how he treats his foreign princes and princesses dont concern me id say like the preventioncrueltyanimals man to the keeper of the menagerie lecture em wound their dignity hurt their feelings only dont wop em i dont wish any harm to them but what the deuce they do here nosing after my grandson there go we shall be having it out ha done with tomorrow or next day ive run the badger to earth else im not fit to follow a scent he grumbled at having to consume other than his riversley bread butter beef and ale for probably another fortnight one of the boasts of riversley was that while the rest of the world ate and drank poison the grange lived on its own solid substance defying malefactory radical tricksters temple was left to hear the rest he had the sweetest of modest wishes for a reintroduction to ottilia chapter l we are all in my fathers net journeying down by the mailtrain in the face of a great sunken sunset broken with cloud i chanced to ask myself what it was that i seriously desired to have my purpose to curb my father was sincere and good but concerning my hearts desires whitherward did they point i thought of janetshe made me gasp for air of ottilia and she made me long for earth sharp as i write it the distinction smote me i might have been divided by an electrical shot into two halves with such an equal force was i drawn this way and that pointing nowhither to strangle the thought of either one of them was like the pang of death yet it did not strike me that i loved the two they were apart in my mind actually as if i had been divided i passed the riversley station under sombre sunset fires saddened by the fancy that my old home and vivacious janet were ashes past hope i came on the smell of salt air and had that other spirit of woman around me of whom the controlled seadeeps were an image who spoke to my soul like starlight much wise counsel and impatience of the wisdom went on within me i walked like a man with a yawning wound and had to whip the sense of passion for a drug toward which one it strove i know not it was blind and stormy as the night not a boatman would take me across the lights of the island lay like a crown on the water i paced the ramparts eyeing them breathing the keen salt of thundering waves until they were robbed of their magic by the coloured fast it is i have learnt out of the conflict of sensations such as i then underwent that a young mans brain and morality supposing him not to lean overmuch to sickly sentiment becomes gradually enriched and strengthened and himself shaped for capable manhood i was partly conscious of a better condition in the morning and a sober morning it was to me after my long sentinels step to and fro i found myself possessed of one keywhether the right one or notwherewith to read the princess which was never possible to me when i was under stress of passion or of hope or despair my perplexities over what she said how she looked ceased to trouble me i read her by this strange light that she was a woman who could only love intelligentlylove that is in the sense of giving herself she had the power of passion and it could be stirred but he who kindled it wrecked his chance if he could not stand clear in her intellects unsparing gaze twice already she must have felt herself disillusioned by me this third time possibly she blamed her own fatally credulous tenderness not me but it was her third awakening and could affection and warmth of heart combat it her childs enthusiasm for my country had prepared her for the impression which the waxen mind of the dreamy invalid received deeply and so aided by the emotional blood of youth she gave me place in her imagination probing me still curiously as i remembered at a season when her sedate mind was attaining to joint deliberations with the impulsive overgenerous heart then ensued for her the successive shocks of discernment she knew me to have some of the vices many follies all the intemperateness of men who carve a way for themselves in the common roads if barely they do that and resembling common men men in a judgement elective as hers common however able i was not assuredly to be separated by her from my associations from the thought of my father for example her look at him in the lakepalace library and her manner in unfolding and folding his recent letter to her and in one or two necessitated allusions embraced a kind of grave pitiful humour beyond smiles or any outward expression as if the acknowledgement that it was so quite obliterated the wonder that it should be sothat one such as he could exercise influence upon her destiny or she may have made her reckoning generally not personally upon our human destinies it is the more likely if as i divine the calm oval of her lifted eyelids contemplated him in the fulness of the recognition that this world of which we hope unuttered things can be shifted and swayed by an ignisfatuus the father of one now seen through could hardly fail of being transfixed himself it was horrible to think of i would rather have added a vice to my faults than that she should have penetrated him nearing the island i was reminded of the early morning when i landed on the flemish flats i did not expect a similar surprise but before my rowers had pulled in the tall beaconhead of old schwartz notified that his mistress might be abroad janet walked with her i ran up the steps to salute them and had ottilias hand in mine prince ernest has arrived my father came yesterday evening do you leave today i cannot tell he will decide it seemed a good omen until i scanned janets sombre face you will not see us out for the rest of the day harry said she that is your arrangement it is your own mine if you like there was something hard in her way of speaking as though she blamed me and the princess were under her protection against me she vouchsafed no friendly significance of look and tone in spite of my readiness to criticize her which in our language means condemn for always assuming leadership with whomsoever she might be i was impressed by the air of highbred friendliness existing between her and the princess their interchange was pleasant to hear ottilia had caught the spirit of her frank manner of speech and she though in a less degree the princesss fine ease and sweetness they conversed apparently like equal minds on material points janet unhesitatingly led it was she who brought the walk to a close now harry you had better go and have a little sleep i should like to speak to you early ottilia immediately put her hand out to me i begged permission to see her to her door janet replied for her indicating old schwartz we have a protector you see six feet and a half an hour later schwartz was following her to the steps of her hotel she saw me and waited for a wonder she displayed reluctance in disburdening herself of what she had to say harry you know that he has come he and prince ernest came together get him to leave the island at once he can return tomorrow grandada writes of wishing to see him get him away today is the prince going to stay here i asked no i daresay i am only guessing i hope so he has threatened the prince what with oh harry cant you understand im no reader of etiquette but even i can see that the story of a young princess travelling over to england alone to visit and you and her father fetching her away the prince is almost at his mercy unless you make the man behave like a gentleman this is exactly the thing miss goodwin feared but whos to hear of the story said i janet gave an impatient sigh do you mean that my father has threatened to publish it janet i wont say he has he has made the prince afraid to move that i think is true did the princess herself mention it to you she understands her situation i am sure did she speak of the man as you call him yes not as i do you must try byandby to forgive me whether he set a trap or not he has decoyed herdont frown at wordsand it remains for you to act as i dont doubt you will but lose no time determine oh if i were a man you would muzzle us muzzle or anything you please i would make any one related to me behave honourably i would give him the alternative you foolish girl suppose he took it i would make him feel my will he should not take it keep to the circumstances harry if you have no control over himi should think i was not fit to live in such a position no control over him at a moment like this and the princess in danger of having her reputation hurt surely harry but why should i speak to you as if you were undecided where is he at the house where you sleep he surrendered his rooms here very kindly aunty has seen him janet blushed i thought i knew why it was for subtler reasons than i should have credited her with conceiving she sent for him at my request late last night she believed her influence would be decisive so do i she could not even make the man perceive that he was actingto use her poor dear oldfashioned wordreprehensibly in frightening the prince to further your interests from what i gathered he went off in a song about them she said he talked so well and aunty dorothy too i should nearly as soon have expected grandada to come in for his turn of the delusion how i wish he was here uberly goes by the first boat to bring him down i feel with miss goodwin that it will be a disgrace for all of usthe countrys disgrace as for our family harry and your name goodbye do your best i was in the mood to ask on behalf of the country she had however a glow and a ringing articulation in her excitement that forbade trifling a minutes reflection set me weighing my power of will against my fathers i nodded to her come to us when you are at liberty she called i have said that i weighed my power of will against my fathers contemplation of the state of the scales did not send me striding to meet him let it be rememberedi had it strongly in memory that he habitually deluded himself under the supposition that the turn of all events having an aspect of good fortune had been planned by him of old and were offered to him as the legitimatelywon fruits of a politic life while others deemed him mad or merely reckless wild a creature living for the day he enjoyed the conceit of being a profound schemer in which he was fortified by a really extraordinary adroitness to take advantage of occurrences and because he was prompt in an emergency and quick to profit of a crisis he was deluded to imagine that he had created it such a man would be with difficulty brought to surrender his prize again there was his love for me pater est pamphiledifficile est how was this vast conceit of a not unreal paternal love to be encountered the sense of honour and of decency might appeal to him personally would either of them get a hearing if he fancied them to be standing in opposition to my dearest interests i unhappily as the case would be sure to present itself to him appeared the living example of his eminently politic career after establishing me the heir of one of the wealthiest of english commoners would he be likely to forego any desperate chance of ennobling me by the brilliant marriage his dreadful devotion to me extinguished the hope that he would unless i should happen to be particularly masterful in dealing with him i heard his nimble and overwhelming volubility like a flood advancing that could be withstood and his arguments and persuasions but by what steps could i restrain the man himself i said the man as janet did he figured in my apprehensive imagination as an engine more than as an individual lassitude oppressed me i felt that i required every access of strength possible physical besides moral in anticipation of our encounter and took a swim in seawater which displaced my drowsy fit and some alarming intimations of cowardice menacing a paralysis of the will i had not altogether recovered from my gipsy drubbing and now i wanted to have the contest over instantly it seemed presumable that my father had slept at my lodgings there however the report of him was that he had inspected the rooms highly complimented the owner of them and vanished returning to the pier i learnt that he had set sail in his hired yacht for the sister town on the solent at an early hourfor what purpose i knew of it too late to intercept it one of the squires horses trotted me over i came upon colonel hibbert segrave near the clubhouse and heard that my father was off again but your german prince and papainlaw shall be free of the club for the next fortnight said he and cordially asked to have the date of the marriage my face astonished him he excused himself for speaking of this happy event so abruptly a sting of downright anger drove me back at a rapid canter it flashed on me that this prince ernest whose suave fashion of depressing me and philosophical skill in managing his daughter had induced me to regard him as a pattern of astuteness was really both credulous and feeble or else supremely unsuspecting and i was confirmed in the latter idea on hearing that he had sailed to visit the opposite harbour and docks on board my fathers yacht janet shared my secret opinion the prince is a gentleman she said her wrath and disgust were unspeakable my aunt dorothy blamed her for overdue severity the prince i suppose goes of his own free will where he pleases janet burst out oh cant you see through it aunty the prince goes about without at all knowing that the person who takes himharry sees itis making him compromise himself and byandby the prince will discover that he has no will of his own whatever he may wish to resolve upon doing is he quite against harry asked my aunt dorothy dear aunty hes a prince and a proud man he will never in his lifetime consent to to what you mean without being hounded into it i havent the slightest idea whether anything will force him i know that the princess would have too much pride to submit even to save her name but its her name thats in danger think of the scandal to a sovereign princess i know the signification of that now i used to laugh at harrys sovereign princess she is one and thorough there is no one like her dont you understand aunty that the intrigue ploti dont choose to be nice upon termsmay be perfectly successful and do good to nobody the prince may be tricked the princess i am sure will not janets affectation of an intimate and peculiar knowledge of the princess was a show of her character that i was accustomed to still it was evident they had conversed much and perhaps intimately i led her to tell me that the princess had expressed no views upon my father he does not come within her scope harry scope was one of janets new words wherewith she would now and then fall to seasoning a serviceable but savourless outworn vocabulary of the common table in spite of that and other offences rendered prominent to me by the lifting of her lip and her frown when she had to speak of my father i was on her side not on his her estimation of the princess was soundly based she discerned exactly the nature of ottilias entanglement and her peril she and my aunt dorothy passed the afternoon with ottilia while i crossed the head of the street looking down at the one house where the princess was virtually imprisoned either by her fathers express injunction or her own discretion and it was as well that she should not be out the yachting season had brought many london men to the island i met several who had not forgotten the newspaperparagraph assertions and contradictions lord alton admiral loftus and others were on the pier and in the outfitters shops eager for gossip as the languid stretch of indolence inclines men to be the admiral asked me for the whereabout of prince ernests territory he too said that the prince would be free of the club during his residence adding where is henot a question demanding an answer the men might have let the princess go by but there would have been questions urgently demanding answers had she been seen by their women late in the evening my fathers yacht was sighted from the pier just as he reached his moorings and his boat was hauled round the last steamer came in sharpeyed janet saw the squire on board among a crowd and temple next to him supporting his arm has grandada been ill she exclaimed my chief concern was to see my fathers head rising in the midst of the crowd uncovering repeatedly prince ernest and general goodwin were behind him stepping off the lower pierplatform the general did not look pleased my grandfather with janet holding his arm in the place of temple stood waiting to see that his man had done his duty by the luggage my father advancing perceived me and almost taking the squire into his affectionate salutation said nothing could be more opportune than your arrival mr beltham the squire rejoined i wanted to see you mr richmond and not in public i grant the private interview sir at your convenience janet went up to general goodwin my father talked to me and lost a moment in shaking temples hand and saying kind things name any hour you please mr beltham he resumed meantime i shall be glad to effect the introduction between harrys grandfather and his highness prince ernest of eppenwelzensarkeld he turned general goodwin was hurrying the prince up the steps the squire at the same time retreating hastily i witnessed the spectacle of both parties to the projected introduction swinging round to make their escape my father glanced to right and left he covered in the airiest fashion what would have been confusion to another by carrying on a jocose remark that he had left half spoken to temple and involved janet in it and soonthrough sheer amiable volubility and his taking mannerthe squire himself for a minute or so harry i have to tell you she is not unhappy janet whispered rapidly she is reading of one of our great men alive now she is glad to be on our ground janet named a famous admiral kindling as a fiery beacon to our blood she would have said more she looked the remainder but she could have said nothing better fitted to spur me to the work she wanted done mournfulness dropped on me like a cloud in thinking of the bright little princess of my boyhood and the ottilia of today faithful to her early passion for our seaheroes and my country though it had grievously entrapped her and into what hands not into hands which could cast one ray of honour on a devoted head the contrast between the sane servicegiving men she admired and the hopping skipping social meteor weaver of webs thrower of nets who offered her his history for a nuptial acquisition was ghastly most discomforting he seemed to have entangled us all he said that he had he treated me now confessedly as a cipher the prince the princess my grandfather and mehe had gathered us together he said i heard from him that the prince assisted by him in the part of an adviser saw no way of cutting the knot but by a marriage all were at hand for a settlement of the termsprovidence and destiny were dragged in lets have no theatrical talk i interposed certainly richie the plainest english he assented this was on the pier while he bowed and greeted passing figures i dared not unlink my arm for fear of further mischief i got him to my rooms and insisted on his dining there dry bread will do he said my anticipations of the nature of our wrestle were correct but i had not expected him to venture on the assertion that the prince was for the marriage he met me at every turn with this downright iteration the prince consents he knows his only chance is to yield i have him fast how i inquired how richie where is your perspicuity i have him here i loosen a thousand tongues on him i no not on him on the princess you mean on him the princess is the willing party she and you are one on him i say tis but a threat i hold it in terrorem and by heaven son richie it assures me i have not lived and fought for nothing now is the day and now is the hour on your first birthday my boy i swore to marry you to one of the highest ladies upon earth she was as it turns out then unborn no matter i keep my oath abandon it pooh you areforgive mesilly pardon me for remarking it you have not that dashing couragenever mind the point is i have my prince in his trap we are perfectly polite but i have him and he acknowledges it he shrugs love has beaten him very well and observe i permit no squireoflowdegree insinuations none of that the ladyall earthly blessings on herdoes not stoop to harry richmond i have the announcement in the newspapers i maintain it the fruit of a life of long and earnest endeavour legitimately won by heaven it is and with the constituted authorities of my native land against me your grandad proposes formally for the princess tomorrow morning he maddened me merely to keep him silent i burst out in a flux of reproaches as torrentlike as his own could be and all the time i was wondering whether it was true that a man who talked as he did in his strain of florid flimsy had actually done a practical thing the effect of my vehemence was to brace him and make him sedately emphatic he declared himself to have gained entire possession of the princes mind he repeated his positive intention to employ his power for my benefit never did power of earth or of hell seem darker to me than he at that moment when solemnly declaiming that he was prepared to forfeit my respect and love die sooner than yield his prince he wore a new aspect spoke briefly and pointedly using the phrases of a determined man and in voice and gesture signified that he had us all in a grasp of iron the charge of his having plotted to bring it about he accepted with exultation i admit he said i did not arrange to have germany present for a witness besides england but since he is here i take advantage of the fact and tomorrow you will see young eckart down i cried out as much enraged at my feebleness to resist him as in disgust of his unscrupulous tricks ay you have not known me richie said he i pilot you into harbour and all you can do is just the creaking of the vessel to me you are in my hands i pilot you i have you the husband of the princess within the month no other course is open to her and i have the assurance that she loses nothing by it she is yours my son she will not be you have wrecked my last chance you cover me with dishonour you are a youngster richie tis the wish of her heart probably while you and i are talking it over the prince is confessing that he has no escape he has not a loophole she came to you you take her i am far from withholding my admiration of her behaviour but there it isshe came not consent she is a ruined woman if she refuses through you through youthrough my father have you both gone mad try to see this i implored him she will not be subjected by any threats the very whisper of one will make her turn from me he interrupted totally the contrary the prince acknowledges that you are master of her affections consistently with her sense of honour and respect for us tell me of her reputation richie you pretend that you can damage it pretend i pretend in the teeth of all concerned to establish her happiness and yours and nothing human shall stop me i have you grateful to me before your old dad lays his head on his last pillow and that reminds me i surrender my town house and furniture to you waddy has received the word by the way should you hear of a good doctor for heartdisease tell me i have my fears for the poor soul he stood up saying richie i am not like jorian to whom a lodginghouse dinner is no dinner and an irreparable loss but i must have air i go forth on a stroll it was impossible for me to allow it i stopped him we were in the midst of a debate as to his right of personal freedom upon the singularity of which he commented with sundry ejaculations when temple arrived and general goodwin sent up his card temple and i left the general closeted with my father and stood at the streetdoor he had seen the princess having at her request been taken to present his respects to her by janet how she looked what she said he was dull in describing he thought her lively though she was pale she had mentioned my name kindly he observed and he knew or suspected the general to be an emissary from the prince but he could not understand the exact nature of the complication and plagued me with a mixture of blunt inquiries and the delicate reserve proper to him so much that i had to look elsewhere for counsel and sympathy janet had told him everything still he was plunged in wonder tempting me to think the lawyers mind of necessity bourgeois for the value of a sentiment seemed to have no weight in his estimation of the case nor did he appear disinclined to excuse my father some of his remarks partly swayed me in spite of my seeing that they were based on the supposition of an all for love adventure of a mad princess they whispered a little hope when i was adoring her passionately for being the reverse of whatever might have given hope a breath general goodwin followed by my father came down and led me aside after i had warned temple not to let my father elude him the general was greatly ruffled clara tells me she can rely on you he said i am at the end of my arguments with that man short of sending him to the lockup you will pardon me mr harry i foresaw the scrapes in store for you and advised you you did general i confessed will you tell me what it is prince ernest is in dread of a pitiable scandal sir and if he took my recommendation he would find instant means of punishing the man who dares to threaten him you know it i explained that i was aware of the threat not of the degree of the princes susceptibility and asked him if he had seen the princess i have had the honour he replied stiffly you gain nothing with her by this infamous proceeding i swallowed my anger and said do you accuse me general i do not accuse you he returned unbendingly you chose your path some ten or twelve years ago and you must take the consequences i foresaw it but this i will say i did not credit the man with his infernal cleverness if i speak to you at all i must speak my mind i thought him a mere buffoon and spendthrift flying his barsinister story for the sake of distinction he has schemed up to this point successfully he has the prince in his toils i would cut through them as i have informed prince ernest i daresay different positions lead to different reasonings the fellow appears to have a fascination over him your father mr harry is guilty nowhe is guilty i reiterate now of a piece of iniquity that makes me ashamed to own him for a countryman the general shook himself erect are you unable to keep him in he asked my nerves were pricking and stinging with the insults i had to listen to and consciences justification of them he repeated the question i will do what i can i said unsatisfactorily to myself and to him for he transposed our situations telling me the things he would say and do in my place things not dissimilar to those i had already said and done only more toweringly enunciated and for that reason they struck me as all the more hopelessly ineffectual and made me despair my dumbness excited his ire come said he the lady is a spoilt child she behaved foolishly but from your point of view you should feel bound to protect her on that very account do your duty young gentleman he is i believe fond of you and if so you have him by a chain i tell you frankly i hold you responsible his way of speaking of the princess opened an idea of the worlds in the event of her name falling into its clutches i said again i will do what i can and sang out for temple he was alone my father had slipped from him to leave a card at the squires hotel general goodwin touched temple on the shoulder kindly in marked contrast to his treatment of me and wished us goodnight nothing had been heard of my father by janet but while i was sitting with her at a late hour his card was brought up and a pencilled entreaty for an interview the next morning that will suit grandada janet said he commissioned me before going to bed to write the same for him she related that the prince was in a state of undisguised distraction from what i could comprehendit appeared incrediblehe regarded his daughters marriage as the solution of the difficulty the sole way out of the meshes is not that her wish said temple perhaps with a wish of his own oh if you think a lady like the princess ottilia is led by her wishes said janet her radiant perception of an ideal in her sex the first she ever had made her utterly contemptuous toward the less enlightened we appointed the next morning at halfpast eleven for my fathers visit not a minute later janet said in my ear urgently dontdont let him move out of your sight harry the princess is convinced you are not to blame i asked her whether she had any knowledge of the squires designs i have not on my honour she answered but i hope it is so miserable to think of this disgraceful thing she is too firm to give way she does not blame you i am sure i do not only harry one always feels that if one were in anothers place in a case like this i could and would command him i would have him obey me one is not born to accept disgrace even from a father i should say you shall not stir if you mean to act dishonourably one is justified i am sure in breaking a tie of relationship that involves you in dishonour grandada has not spoken a word to me on the subject i catch at straws this thing burns me oh goodnight harry i cant sleep goodnight she called softly to temple on the stairs below i heard the poor fellow murmuring goodnight to himself in the street and thought him happier than i he slept at a room close to the hotel a note from clara goodwin adjured me by her memory of the sweet brave gracious fellow she loved in other days to be worthy of what i had been the general had unnerved her reliance on me i sat up for my father until long past midnight when he came his appearance reminded me of the time of his altercation with baroness turckems under the light of the blazing curtains he had supped and drunk deeply and he very soon proclaimed that i should find him invincible which as far as insensibility to the strongest appeals to him went he was deny you love her deny she loves you deny you are onei knot you fast he had again seen prince ernest so he said declaring that the prince positively desired the marriage would have it and i he dramatized their relative situations consented after my experience of that night i forgive men who are unmoved by displays of humour commonly we think it should be irresistible his description of the thinskinned sensitive prince striving to run and dodge for shelter from him like a feverpatient pursued by a northeaster accompanied by dozens of quaint similes full of his mental laughter made my loathing all the more acute but i had not been an equal match for him previous to his taking wine it was waste of breath and heart to contend with him i folded my arms tight sitting rigidly silent and he dropped on the sofa luxuriously bed richie he waved to me you drink no wine you cannot stand dissipation as i do bed my dear boy i am a god sir inaccessible to mortal ailments seriously dear boy i have never known an illness in my life i have killed my hundreds of poor devils who were for imitating me this i boasti boast constitution and i fear richie you have none of my superhuman strength added to that i know i am watched over i aski have i schemethe tricks are in my hand it may be the doing of my mother in heaven there is the fact for you to reflect on stand not in my way nor follow me too far would serve me for a motto admirably and you can put it in latin richie bed you shall turn your scholarship to account as i do my genius in your interest on my soul that motto in latin will requite me now to bed no said i you have got away from me once i shall keep you in sight and hearing if i have to lie at your door for it you will go with me to london tomorrow i shall treat you as a man i have to guard and i shall not let you loose before i am quite sure of you loose he exclaimed throwing up an arm and a leg i mean sir that you shall be in my presence wherever you are and i will take care you dont go far and wide its useless to pretend astonishment i dont argue and i dont beseech any further i just sit on guard as i would over a powdercask my father raised himself on an elbow the explosion he said examining his watch occurred at about five minutes to elevenwe are advancing into the morninglast night i received on your behalf the congratulations of friends loftus alton segrave and the rest at that hour so my dear richie you are sitting on guard over the empty magazine i listened with a throbbing forehead and controlled the choking in my throat to ask him whether he had touched the newspapers ay dear lad i have sprung my mine in them he replied you have sent word i have despatched a paragraph to the effect that the prince and princess have arrived to ratify the nuptial preliminaries you expect it to appear this day or else my name and influence are curiously at variance with the confidence i repose in them richie then i leave you to yourself i said prince ernest knows he has to expect this statement in the papers we trumped him with that identical courtcard richie very well tomorrow after we have been to my grandfather you and i part company for good sir it costs me too much dear old richie he laughed gently and now to byebye my blessing on you now and always he shut his eyes chapter li an encounter showing my fathers genius in a strong light the morning was sultry with the first rising of the sun i knew that ottilia and janet would be out for myself i dared not leave the house i sat in my room harried by the most penetrating snore which can ever have afflicted wakeful ears it proclaimed so deepseated a peacefulness in the bosom of the disturber and was so arrogant so ludicrous and inaccessible to remonstrance that it sounded like a renewal of our midnight altercation on the sleepers part prolonged now and then beyond all bounds it ended in the crashing blare whereof utter wakefulness cannot imagine honest sleep to be capable but a playful melody twirled back to the regular note he was fast asleep on the sittingroom sofa while i walked fretting and panting to this twinship i seemed condemned in my heart nevertheless there was a reserve of wonderment at his apparent astuteness and resolution and my old love for him whispered disbelief in his having disgraced me perhaps it was wilful selfdeception it helped me to meet him with a better face we both avoided the subject of our difference for some time he would evidently have done so altogether and used his best and sweetest manner to divert me but when i struck on it asking him if he had indeed told me the truth last night his features clouded as though with an effort of patience to my consternation he suddenly broke away with his arms up puffing and stammering stamping his feet he would have a trucehe insisted on a truce i understood him to exclaim and that i was like a woman who would and would not and wanted a master he raved of the gallant downrightedness of the young bloods of his day and how splendidly this one and that had compassed their ends by winning great ladies lawfully or otherwise for several minutes he was in a state of frenzy appealing to his pattern youths of a bygone generation as to moral principlesstuttering and of a dark red hue from the neck to the temples i refrained from a scuffle of tongues nor did he excuse himself after he had cooled his hand touched instinctively for his pulse and with a glance at the ceiling he exclaimed good lord and brought me to his side these wigwam houses check my circulation said he let us go outlet us breakfast on board the open air restored him and he told me that he had been merely oppressed by the architect of the inferior classes whose ceiling sat on his head my nerves he remarked to me were very exciteable you should take your wine richieyou require it your dear mother had a lowtoned nervous system i was silent and followed him at once a captive and a keeper this day of slackened sails and a bright sleeping water kept the yachtsmen on land there was a crowd to meet the morning boat foremost among those who stepped out of it was the yellowhaired eckart little suspecting what the sight of him signalled to me i could scarcely greet him at all for in him i perceived that my father had fully committed himself to his plot and left me nothing to hope eckart said something of prince hermann as we were walking off the pier i saw janet conversing with prince ernest and the next minute hermann himself was one of the group i turned to eckart for an explanation didnt i tell you he called at your house in london and travelled down with me this morning said eckart my father looked in the direction of the princes but his face was for the moment no index they bowed to janet and began talking hurriedly in the triangle of road between her hotel the pier and the way to the villas passing on and coming to a full halt like men who are not reserving their minds my father stept out toward them he was met by prince ernest hermann turned his back it being the hour of the appointment i delivered eckart over to temples safekeeping and went up to janet dont be late harry she said i asked her if she knew the object of the meeting appointed by my grandfather she answered impatiently do get him away from the prince and then i ought to tell you the princess is well and so onpardon me just now grandada is kept waiting and i dont like it her actual dislike was to see prince ernest in dialogue with my father it seemed to me and the manner of both which was one would have said intimate anything but the manner of adversaries prince ernest appeared to affect a pleasant humour he twice after shaking my fathers hand stepped back to him as if to renew some impression their attitude declared them to be on the best of terms janet withdrew her attentive eyes from observing them and threw a world of meaning into her abstracted gaze at me my fathers advance put her to flight yet she gave him the welcome of a highbred young woman when he entered the drawingroom of my grandfathers hotelsuite she was alone and she obliged herself to accept conversation graciously he recommended her to try the german baths for the squires gout and evidently amused her with his specific probations for english persons designing to travel in company that they should previously live together in a house with a collection of undisciplined chambermaids a musical footman and a mad cook to learn to accommodate their tempers i would add a touch of earthquake miss ilchester just to make sure that all the party know one anothers edges before starting this was too far a shot of nonsense for janet whose native disposition was to refer to lunacy or stupidity or trickery whatsoever was novel to her understanding i for my part said he stipulate to have for comrade no man who fancies himself a born and stamped chieftain no inveterate student of maps and no dog with a turn for feeling himself pulled by the collar and that reminds me you are amateur of dogs have you a pomeranian boarhound no said janet i have never even seen one that high my father raised his hand flat bigger than our newfoundlands without exaggeration big as a pony you will permit me to send you one warranted to have passed his distemper which can rarely be done for our human species though here and there i venture to guarantee my man as well as my dog janet interposed her thanks declining to take the dog but he dwelt on the dogs charms his youth stature appearance fitness and grandeur earnestly i had to relieve her apprehensions by questioning where the dog was in germany he said it was not improbable nor less so that the dog was in pomerania likewise the entry of my aunt dorothy followed by my grandfather was silent be seated the old man addressed us in a body to cut short particular salutations my father overshadowed him with drooping shoulders janet wished to know whether she was to remain i like you by me always he answered bluff and sharp we have some shopping to do my aunt dorothy murmured showing she was there against her will do you shop out of london said my father and for some time he succeeded in making us sit for the delusive picture of a comfortable family meeting my grandfather sat quite still janet next to him when youve finished mr richmond he remarked mr beltham i was telling miss beltham that i join in the abuse of london exactly because i love it a paradox she says but we seem to be effecting a kind of insurance on the life of the things we love best by crying them down violently you have observed it denounce themthey endure for ever so i join any soul on earth in decrying our dear london the naughty old city can bear it there was a clearing of throats my aunt dorothys foot tapped the floor but i presume you have done me the honour to invite me to this conference on a point of business mr beltham said my father admonished by the hint i have sir the squire replied and i also have a point and in fact it is urgent and with your permission mr beltham i will lead the way no sir if you please im a short speaker and go to it at once and i wont detain you a second after youve answered me my father nodded to this with the conciliatory comment that it was businesslike the old man drew out his pocketbook you paid a debt he said deliberately amounting to twentyone thousand pounds to my grandsons account oh a debt i did sir between father and boy dad and lad debts but use your own terms i pray you i dont ask you where that money is now i ask you to tell me where you got it from you speak bluntly my dear sir you wont answer then you ask the question as a family matter i reply with alacrity to the best of my ability and with my hand on my heart mr beltham let me assure you i very heartily desire the information to be furnished to me or ratherwhy should i conceal it the sources are irregular but a child could toddle its way to themyou take my indication say that i obtained it from my friends my friends mr beltham are of the kind requiring squeezing government as my chum and good comrade jorian dewitt is fond of saying is a spongea thing that when you dive deep enough to catch it gives liberal supplies but will assuredly otherwise reverse the process by acting the part of an absorbent i get what i get by force of arms or i might have perished long since then you dont know where you got it from sir technically you are correct sir a bird didnt bring it and you didnt find it in the belly of a fish neither of these prodigies they have occurred in books i am bound to believe they did not happen to me you swear to me you dont know the man woman or committee who gave you that sum i do not know mr beltham in an extraordinary history extraordinary circumstances i have experienced so many that i am surprised at nothing you suppose you got it from some fool oh if you choose to indict government collectively you pretend you got it from government i am termed a pretender by some mr beltham the facts are these i promised to refund the money and i fulfilled the promise there you have the only answer i can make to you now to my own affair i come to request you to demand the hand of the princess of eppenwelzensarkeld on behalf of my son harry your grandson and i possess the assurance of the prince her father that it will be granted doubtless you sir are of as old a blood as the prince himself you will acknowledge that the honour brought to the family by an hereditary princess is considerable it is something i am prepared to accompany you to his highness or not as you please it is but a question of dotation and a selection from one or two monosyllables janet shook her dress the squire replied wes take that up presently i havent quite done will you tell me what agent paid you the sum of money the usual agenta solicitor mr beltham a gentleman whose business lay amongst the aristocracy he is defunct and a very worthy old gentleman he was with a remarkable store of anecdotes of his patrons very discreetly told for you never heard a name from him you took him for an agent of government did you why to condense a long story sir the kernel of the matter is that almost from the hour i began to stir for the purpose of claiming my rightswhich are transparent enough this old gentlemancertainly from no sinister motive i may presumecommenced the payment of an annuity not sufficient for my necessities possibly but warrant of an agreeable sort for encouraging my expectations although oddly this excellent old mr bannerbridge invariably served up the dish in a sauce that did not agree with it by advising me of the wish of the donator that i should abandon my case i consequently in common with my friends performed a little early lesson in arithmetic and we came to the one conclusion open to reflective mindsnamely that i was feared my aunt dorothy looked up for the first time janet and i have some purchases to make she said the squire signified sharply that she must remain where she was i think aunty wants fresh air she had a headache last night said janet i suggested that as my presence did not seem to be required i could take her on my arm for a walk to the pierhead her face was burning she would gladly have gone out but the squire refused to permit it and she nodded over her crossed hands saying that she was in no hurry ha i am quoth he dear miss beltham my father ejaculated solicitously here sir oblige me by attending to me cried the squire fuming and blinking i sent for you on a piece of business you got this money through a gentleman a solicitor named bannerbridge did you his name was bannerbridge mr beltham dorothy you knew a mr bannerbridge she faltered i knew him harry was lost in the streets of london when he was a little fellow and the mr bannerbridge i knew found him and took him to his house and was very kind to him what was his christian name i gave them charles adolphus the identical person exclaimed my father oh you admit it said the squire ever seen him since the time harry was lost dorothy yes she answered i have heard he is dead did you see him shortly before his death i happened to see him a short time before he was your man of business was he for such little business as i had to do you were sure you could trust him eh yes my aunt dorothy breathed deeply by god maam youre a truthful woman the old man gave her a glare of admiration it was now my turn to undergo examination and summoned by his apostrophe to meet his eyes i could appreciate the hardness of the head i had to deal with harry i beg your pardon beforehand i want to get at facts i must ask you what you know about where the money came from i spoke of my attempts to discover the whence and wherefore of it government eh he sneered i really cant judge whether it came from that quarter said i what do you thinkthink it likely i thought it unlikely and yet likelier than that it should have come from an individual then you dont suspect any particular person of having sent it in the nick of time harry richmond i replied no sir unless you force me to suspect you he jumped in his chair astounded and wrathful confounded me for insinuating that he was a bedlamite and demanded the impudent reason of my suspecting him to have been guilty of the infernal folly i had but the reason to instance that he was rich and kind at heart rich kind he bellowed just excuse mei must ask for the purpose of my inquirythere tell me how much do you believe youve got of that money remaining none o that peterborough style of counting in the back of your pate say there was a dreadful silence my father leaned persuasively forward mr beltham i crave permission to take up the word allow me to remind you of the prize harry has won the prince awaits you to bestow on him the hand of his daughter out with it harry shouted the squire not to mention harrys seat in parliament my father resumed he has a princess to wife indubitably one of the most enviable positions in the country it is unnecessary to count on future honours they may be alluded to in truth sir we make him the first man in the country not necessarily premier you take my meaning he possesses the combination of social influence and standing with political achievements and rank and riches in addition im speaking to my grandson sir the squire rejoined shaking himself like a man rained on im waiting for a plain answer and no lie youve already confessed as much as that the money you told me on your honour you put out to interest pshfor my grandson was smoke now lets hear him my father called out i claim a hearing the money you speak of was put out to the very highest interest you have your grandson in parliament largely acquainted with the principal members of society husband of an hereditary princess you have only at this moment to propose for her hand i guarantee it to you with that money i have won him everything not that i would intimate to you that princesses are purchaseable the point is i knew how to employ it in two months time the money in the funds in the boys nameyou told me that you had it in the funds in harry richmonds name sir well sir im asking him whether its in the funds now oh mr beltham what answers that the squire was really confused by my fathers interruption and lost sight of me i ask where it came from i ask whether its squandered he continued mr beltham i reply that you have only to ask for it to have it do so immediately whats he saying cried the baffled old man i give you a thousand times the equivalent of the money mr beltham is the money there the lady is here i said money sir a priceless honour and treasure i say emphatically my grandfathers brows and mouth were gathering for storm janet touched his knee where the devil your understanding truckles if you have any i dont know he muttered what the deucelady got to do with money oh my father laughed lightly customarily the alliance is they say as close as matrimony pardon me to speak with becoming seriousness mr beltham it was duly imperative that our son should be known in society should be you will apprehend me advanced in station which i had to do through the ordinary political channel there could not but be a considerable expenditure for such a purpose in balls and dinners in everything that builds a young gentlemans repute you swear to me you gave your balls and dinners and the lot for harry richmonds sake on my veracity i did sir please dont talk like a mountebank i dont want any of your roundabout words for truth were not writing a bible essay i try my best to be civil my father beamed on him i guarantee you succeed sir nothing on earth can a man be so absolutely sure of as to succeed in civility if he honestly tries at it jorian dewittby the way you may not know himan esteemed old friend of mine saysthat is he said onceto a tolerably impudent fellow whom he had disconcerted with a capital retort you may try to be a gentleman and blunder at it but if you will only try to be his humble servant we are certain to establish a common footing jorian let me tell you is a wit worthy of our glorious old days my grandfather eased his heart with a plunging breath well sir i didnt ask you here for your opinion or your friends and i dont care for modern wit nor i mr beltham nor i it has the reek of stable straw we are of one mind on that subject the thing slouches it sprawls itto quote jorian once moreis like a dirty idle little stupid boy who cannot learn his lesson and plays the fool with the alphabet you smile miss ilchester you would appreciate jorian modern wit is emphatically degenerate it has no scintillation neither thrust nor parry i compare it to boxing as opposed to the more beautiful science of fencing well sir i dont want to hear your comparisons growled the squire much oppressed stop a minute half a minute to me sir said my father with a glowing reminiscence of jorian dewitt which was almost too much for the combustible old man even under janets admonition my aunt dorothy moved her head slightly toward my father looking on the floor and he at once drew in mr beltham i attend to you submissively you do then tell me what brought this princess to england the conviction that harry had accomplished his oath to mount to an eminence in his country and had made the step she is about to take less i will say precipitous though i personally decline to admit a pointed inferiority you wrote her a letter that containing the news of the attack on him and his desperate illness was the finishing touch to the noble ladys passion attack i know nothing about an attack you wrote her a letter and wrote her a lie you said he was dying i had the boy inanimate on my breast when i despatched the epistle you said he had only a few days to live so in my affliction i feared will you swear you didnt write that letter with the intention of drawing her over here to have her in your power so that you might threaten youd blow on her reputation if she or her father held out against you and all didnt go as you fished for it my father raised his head proudly i divide your query into two parts i wrote sir to bring her to his side i did not write with any intention to threaten youve done it though i have done this said my father toweringly i have used the power placed in my hands by providence to overcome the hesitations of a gentleman whose illustrious rank predisposes him to sacrifice his daughters happiness to his pride of birth and station can any one confute me when i assert that the princess loves harry richmond i walked abruptly to one of the windows hearing a pitiable wrangling on the theme my grandfather vowed she had grown wiser my father protested that she was willing and anxious janet was appealed to in a strangelysounding underbreath she said the princess does not wish it you hear that mr richmond cried the squire he returned can miss ilchester say that the princess ottilia does not passionately love my son harry richmond the circumstances warrant me in beseeching a direct answer she uttered no i looked at her she at me you can conduct a case richmond the squire remarked my father rose to his feet i can conduct my son to happiness and greatness my dear sir but to some extent i require your grandfatherly assistance and i urge you now to present your respects to the prince and princess and judge yourself of his highnesss disposition for the match i assure you in advance that he welcomes the proposal i do not believe it said janet rising my aunt dorothy followed her example saying in justice to harry the proposal should be made at least it will settle this dispute janet stared at her and the squire threw his head back with an amazed interjection what youre for it now why at breakfast you were all t other way you didnt want this meeting because you poohpoohed the match i do think you should go she answered you have given harry your promise and if he empowers you it is right to make the proposal and immediately i think she spoke feverishly with an unsweet expression of face that seemed to me to indicate vexedness at the squires treatment of my father harry she asked me in a very earnest fashion is it your desire tell your grandfather that it is and that you want to know your fate why should there be any dispute on a fact that can be ascertained by crossing a street surely it is trifling janet stooped to whisper in the squires ear he caught the shock of unexpected intelligence apparently faced about gazed up and cried you too but i havent done here ive got to crossexamine pretend do you mean pretend im ready to go i can release this prince just as well here as there janet laughed faintly i should advise your going grandada you a weathercock woman he reproached her quite mystified and fell to rubbing his head suppose i go to be snubbed the prince is a gentleman grandada come with me we will go alone you can relieve the prince and protect him my father nodded i approve and grandadabut it will not so much matter if we are alone though janet said speak out see the princess as well she must be present i leave it to you he said crestfallen janet pressed my aunt dorothys hand aunty you were right you are always right this state of suspense is bad all round and it is infinitely worse for the prince and princess my aunt dorothy accepted the eulogy with a singular trembling wrinkle of the forehead she evidently understood that janet had seen her wish to get released for my part i shared my grandfathers stupefaction at their unaccountable changes it appeared almost as if my father had won them over to baffle him the old man tried to insist on their sitting down again but janet perseveringly smiled and smiled until he stood up she spoke to him softly he was one black frown displeased with her obedient however too soon after i had the key to the enigmatical scene at the moment i was contemptuous of riddles and heard with idle ears janets promptings to him and his replies it would be so much better to settle it here he said she urged that it could not be settled here without the whole burden and responsibility falling upon him exactly interposed my father triumphing dorothy beltham came to my side and said as if speaking to herself while she gazed out of window if a refusal it should come from the prince she dropped her voice the money has not been spent has it has any part of it been spent are you sure you have more than three parts of it now that she should be possessed by the spirit of parsimony on my behalf at such a time as this was to my conception insanely comical and her manner of expressing it was too much for me i kept my laughter under to hear her continue what numbers are flocking on the pier and there is no music yet tell me harry that the money is all safe nearly all it is important to know you promised economy music did you speak of miss beltham my father bowed to her gallantly i chanced to overhear you my private band performs to the public at midday she was obliged to smile to excuse his interruption whats that whose band said the squire bursting out of janets hand a private band janet had a difficulty in resuming her command of him the mention of the private band made him very restive im not acting on my own judgement at all in going to these foreign people he said to janet why go i can have it out here and an end to it without bothering them and their interpreters he sang out to me harry do you want me to go through this form for you mnd unpleasant my aunt dorothy whispered in my ear yes yes i feel tricked he muttered and did not wait for me to reply before he was again questioning my aunt dorothy concerning mr bannerbridge and my father as to that sum of money but his method of interrogation was confused and pointless the drift of it was totally obscure im off my head today he said to janet with a sideshot of his eye at my father you waste time and trouble grandada said she he vowed that he was being bewildered bothered by us all and i thought i had never seen him so far below his level of energy but i had not seen him condescend to put himself upon a moderately fair footing with my father the truth was that janet had rigorously schooled him to bridle his temper and he was no match for the voluble easy man without the freest play of his tongue this prince he kept ejaculating wont you understand grandada that you relieve him and make things clear by going janet said he begged her fretfully not to be impatient and hinted that she and he might be acting the part of dupes and was for pursuing his inauspicious crossexamination in spite of his blundering and the where am i now which pulled him up my father either talking to my aunt dorothy to janet or to me on ephemeral topics scarcely noticed him except when he was questioned and looked secure of success in the highest degree consistent with perfect calmness so you say you tell me to go do you the squire called to me be good enough to stay here and wait i dont see that anythings gained by my going its damned hard on me having to go to a man whose language i dont know and he dont know mine on a business were all of us in a muddle about ill do it if its right youre sure he glanced at janet she nodded i was looking for this quaint and to me incomprehensible interlude to commence with the departure of the squire and janet when a card was handed in by one of the hotelwaiters another prince cried the squire these germans seem to grow princes like potatoesdozens to a root whos the card for ask him to walk up show him into a quiet room does he speak english does prince hermann ofi cant pronounce the name of the placespeak english harry janet asked me as well as you or i said i losing my inattention all at once with a mad leap of the heart hermanns presence gave light fire and colour to the scene in which my destiny had been wavering from hand to hand without much more than amusedly interesting me for i was sure that i had lost ottilia i knew that too well and worse could not happen i had besides lost other things that used to sustain me and being reckless i was contemptuous and listened to the talk about money with sublime indifference to the subject with an attitude too i daresay but hermanns name revived my torment why had he come to persuade the squire to control my father nothing but that would suffer itself to be suggested though conjectures lying in shadow underneath pressed ominously on my mind my father had no doubts a word to you mr beltham before you go to prince hermann he is an emissary we treat him with courtesy and if he comes to diplomatize we of course give a patient hearing i have only to observe in the most emphatic manner possible that i do not retract one step i will have this marriage i have spoken it rests with prince ernest the squire threw a hasty glare of his eyes back as he was hobbling on janets arm she stopped short and replied for him mr beltham will speak for himself in his own name we are not concerned in any unworthy treatment of prince ernest we protest against it dear young lady said my father graciously i meet you frankly now tell me i know you a gallant horsewoman if you had lassoed the noble horse of the desert would you let him run loose because of his remonstrating side with me i entreat you my son is my first thought the pride of princes and wild horses you will find wonderfully similar especially in the way they take their taming when once they feel they are positively caught we show him we have him fasthe falls into our paces on the spot for harrys sakefor the princesss i beg you exert your universallydeservedly acknowledged influence even nowand you frown on mei cannot find it in my heart to wish you the sweet and admirable woman of the world you are destined to be though you would comprehend me and applaud me for i could notno not to win your favourable opinionconsent that you should be robbed of a single ray of your fresh maidenly youth if you must misjudge me i submit it is the price i pay for seeing you young and lovely prince ernest is credit me not unworthily treated by me if life is a battle and the prize of it to the generals head i implore youhe lured her with the dimple of a lurking smiledo not seriously blame your afflicted senior if we are to differ i am vastly your elder you instil the doubt whether i am by as much the wiser of the two but the father of harry richmond claims to know best what will ensure his boys felicity is he rash pronounce me guilty of an excessive anxiety for my sons welfare say that i am too old to read the world with the accuracy of a youthful intelligence call me indiscreet stigmatize me unlucky the severest sentence a judgehe bowed to her deferentiallycan utter only do not cast a gaze of rebuke on me because my labour is for my sonmy utmost devotion and we know miss ilchester that the princess honours him with her love i protest in all candour i treat love as love not as a weight in the scale it is the heavenly power which dispenses with weighing its ascendancy the squire could endure no more and happily so for my father was losing his remarkably moderated tone and threatening polysyllables he had followed janet step for step at a measured distance drooping toward her with his winningest air while the old man pulled at her arm to get her out of hearing of the obnoxious flatterer she kept her long head in profile trying creditably not to appear discourteous to one who addressed her by showing an open ear until the final bolt made by the frenzied old man dragged her through the doorway his neck was shortened behind his collar as though he shrugged from the blast of a bad wind i believe that on the whole janet was pleased i will wager that left to herself she would have been drawn into an answer if not an argument nothing would have made her resolution swerve i admit they had not been out of the room three seconds when my aunt dorothy was called to join them she had found time to say that she hoped the money was intact chapter lii strange revelations and my grandfather has his last outburst my father and i stood at different windows observing the unconcerned people below did you scheme to bring prince hermann over here as well i asked him he replied laughing i really am not the wonderful wizard you think me richie i left prince ernests address as mine with waddy in case the frau feldmarschall should take it into her head to come further than that you must question providence which i humbly thank for its unfailing support down to unexpected trifles only thisto you and to all of them nothing bends me i will not be robbed of the fruit of a lifetime supposing i refuse you refuse richie to restore the princess her character and the prince his serenity of mind at their urgent supplication i am utterly unable to suppose it you are married in the papers this morning i grieve to say that the position of prince hermann is supremely ridiculous i am bound to add he is a bold boy it requires courage in one of the pretenders to the hand of the princess to undertake the office of intercessor for he must knowthe man must know in his heart that he is doing her no kindness he does not appeal to me you see i have shown that my arrangements are unalterable what he will make of your grandad why on earth he should have been sent toof all men in the worldyour grandad richie i was invited to sympathetic smiles of shrewd amusement he caught sight of friends and threw up the window saluting them the squire returned with my aunt dorothy and janet to behold the detested man communicating with the outer world from his own rooms he shouted unceremoniously shut that window and it was easy to see that he had come back heavily armed for the offensive here mr richmond i dont want all men to know youre in my apartments i forgot sir temporarily said my father i had vacated the rooms for your conveniencebe assured an explanation on the subject of the rooms ensued between the old man and the ladiesit did not improve his temper his sense of breeding nevertheless forced him to remark i cant thank you sir for putting me under an obligation i should never have incurred myself oh i was happy to be of use to the ladies mr beltham and require no small coin of exchange my father responded with the flourish of a pacifying hand i have just heard from a posse of friends that the marriage is signalled in this mornings papersnumberless congratulations i need not observe no dont said the squire nobodyll understand them here and i neednt ask you to sit down because i dont want you to stop ill soon have done now the games played here harry quick has all that money been spentno offence to you but as a matter of business not all sir i was able to say half yes i think so three parts it may be and liabilities besides there are some youre not a liar thatll do for you he turned to my aunt her eyes had shut dorothy youve sold out twentyfive thousand pounds worth of stock youre a truthful woman as i said and so i wont treat you like a witness in a box you gave it to harry to help him out of his scrape why short of staring lunacy did you pass it through the hands of this man he sweated his thousands out of it at the start why did you make a secret of it to make the man think his nonsensemaam behave like a lady and my daughter he cried fronting her for the sudden and blunt attack had slackened her nerves she moved as though to escape and was bewildered i stood overwhelmed no wonder she had attempted to break up the scene tell me your object dorothy beltham in passing the money through the hands of this man were you for helping him to be a man of his word help the boythat i understand however you were mistress of your money ive no right to complain if you will go spending a fortune to whitewash the blackamoor well its your own youll say so it is sos your character the egregious mildness of these interjections could not long be preserved you deceived me maam you wouldnt build schoolhouses you couldnt subscribe to charities you acted parsimony to pamper a scamp and his young scholar you went to londonyou did it in cool blood you went to your stockbroker and from the stockbroker to the bank and you sold out stock to fling away this big sum i went to the bank on business and the books were turned over for my name and there at beltham i saw quite by chance the cross of the pen and i saw your folly maam i saw it all in a shot i went to the bank on my own business mind that ha you know me by this time i loathe spying the thing jumped out of the book i couldnt help seeing now i dont reckon how many positive fools go to make one superlative humbug youre one of the lot and ive learnt it my father airily begged leave to say as to positive and superlative mr beltham the three degrees of comparison are no longer of service except to the trader i do not consider them to exist for ladies your positive is always particularly open to dispute and i venture to assert i cap you your superlative ten times over he talked the stuff for a diversion presenting in the midst of us an incongruous image of smiles that filled me with i knew not what feelings of angry alienation until i was somewhat appeased by the idea that he had not apprehended the nature of the words just spoken it seemed incredible yet it was true it was proved to be so to me by his pricking his ears and his attentive look at the mention of the word prepossessing him in relation to the money government the squire said something of government to my aunt dorothy with sarcastical emphasis as the observation was unnecessary and was wantonly thrown in by him she seized on it to escape from her compromising silence i know nothing of government or its ways she murmured further and looked at janet who came to her aid saying grandada weve had enough talk of money money all is done that you wanted done stocks shares banksweve gone through them all please finish please do you have only to state what you have heard from prince hermann janet gazed in the direction of my father carefully avoiding my eyes but evidently anxious to shield my persecuted aunty speaking of stocks and shares miss ilchester said my father i myself would as soon think of walking into a field of scytheblades in full activity as of dabbling in them one of the few instances i remember of our jorian stooping to a pun is upon the contango ingenious truly but objectionable because a pun i shall not be guilty of repeating it the stockmarket is the national snapdragon bowl he says and is very amusing upon the jews whether quite fairly mr beltham knows better than i on my honour he appealed lightly to the squire for thus he danced on the craters brink and had for answer youre a cool scoundrel richmond i choose to respect you rather in spite of yourself i fear sir said my father bracing up did you hear my conversation with my daughter i heard if i may say so the lion taking his share of it all roaring to you was it mr beltham we have our little peculiarities i am accustomed to think of a steamvent when i hear you indulging in a sentence of unusual length and i hope it is for our good as i thoroughly believe it is for yours that you should deliver yourself freely so you tell me like a stage lacquey muttered the old man with surprising art in caricaturing a weakness in my fathers bearing of which i was cruelly conscious though his enunciation was flowing he lost his naturalness through forcing for ease in the teeth of insult grandada aunty and i will leave you said janet waxing importunate when ive done said he facing his victim savagely the fellow pretends he didnt understand shes here to corroborate richmond there my daughter dorothy beltham theres the last of your fools and dupes shes a truthful woman ill own and shell contradict me if what i say is not the fact that twentyfive thousand from government came out of her estate out of out of be damned sir shes the person who paid it if the damns have set up you may as well let the ladies go said i he snapped at me like a rabid dog in career shes the personone of your petticoat governmentwho paiddo you hear me richmondthe money to help you to keep your word to help you to give your balls and dinners too shei wont say she told you and you knew itshe paid it she sent it through her mr bannerbridge do you understand now you had it from her my god look at the fellow a dreadful gape of stupefaction had usurped the smiles on my fathers countenance his eyes rolled over he tried to articulate and was indeed a spectacle for an enemy his convulsed frame rocked the syllables as with a groan unpleasant to hear he called on my aunt dorothy by successive stammering apostrophes to explain spreading his hands wide he called out her christian name her face was bloodless address my daughter respectfully sir will you i wont have your infernal familiarities roared the squire he is my brotherinlaw said dorothy reposing on the courage of her blood now that the worst had been spoken forgive me mr richmond for having secretly induced you to accept the loan from me loan interjected the squire they fell upon it like a pair of kites youll find the last ghost of a bone of your loan in a bill and well picked theyve been doing their bills ive heard that my father touched the points of his fingers on his forehead straining to think too theatrically but in hard earnest i believe he seemed to be rising on tiptoe oh madam dear lady my friend dorothy my sister better a thousand times that i had married though i shrank from a heartless union this moneyit is not the old man broke in are you going to be a damned low vulgar comedian and tale of a trumpet up to the end you richmond dont think youll gain anything by standing there as if you were jumping your trunk from a shark come sir youre in a gentlemans rooms dont pitch your voice like a young jackanapes blowing into a horn your gasps and your spasms and howl of a yawning brute keep your menagerie performances for your pantomime audiences what are you meaning do you pretend youre astonished shes not the first fool of a woman whose money youve devoured with your madam and my dear and mouthing and elbowing your comedy tricks your gabble of government protection and scandalous advertisements of the byblow of a starcoated rapscallion if youve a recollection of the man in you show your back and be off say youve fought against oddsi dont doubt you have counting the constablesand own youre a villain plead guilty and be off and be silent and do no more harm is it government still my aunt dorothy had come round to me she clutched my arm to restrain me from speaking whispering harry you cant save him think of your own head she made me irresolute and i was too late to check my father from falling into the trap oh mr beltham he said you are hard sir i put it to you had you been in receipt of a secret subsidy from government for a long course of years how long the squire interrupted prompt though he would have been to dismiss the hateful person he was not one could see displeased to use the whip upon so exciteable and responsive a frame he seemed to me to be basely guilty of leading his victim on to expose himself further theres no necessity for how long i said the old man kept the question on his face my father reflected i have to hit my memory i am shattered sir i say you would be justified amply justified how long was reiterated i can at least date it from the period of my marriage from the date when your scoundrelism first touches my family thats to say so government agreed to give you a stipend to support your wife mr beltham i breathe with difficulty it was at that period on the death of a nobleman interested in restraining mei was his debtor for kindnesses my head is whirling i say at that period upon the recommendation of friends of high standing i began to agitate for the restitution of my rights from infancy to the deuce your infancy i know too much about your age just hark you richmond none of your i was a child to provoke compassion from women i mean to knock you down and make you incapable of hurting these poor foreign people you trapped they defy you and ill do my best to draw your teeth now for the annuity you want one to believe you thought you frightened government eh annual proof was afforded me sir oh annual through mr charles adolphus bannerbridge deceased janet stepped up to my aunt dorothy to persuade her to leave the room but she declined and hung by me to keep me out of danger as she hoped and she prompted me with a guarding nervous squeeze of her hand on my arm to answer temperately when i was questioned harry do you suspect government paid that annuity not now certainly tell the man who tis you suspect my aunt dorothy said harry is not bound to mention his suspicions tell him yourself then does it matter yes it matters ill break every plank he walks on and strip him stark till he flops down shivering into his slougha convicted common swindler with his dinners and balls and his private bands richmond you killed one of my daughters t other fed you through her agent this mr charles adolphus bannerbridge from about the date of your snaring my poor girl and carrying her off behind your postillionsyour trotting undertakers and the hours of her life reckoned in milestones shes here to contradict me if she can dorothy beltham was your government that paid the annuity i took dorothy beltham into my arms she was trembling excessively yet found time to say bear up dearest keep still all i thought and felt foundered in tears for a while i heard little distinctly of the tremendous tirade which the vindictive old man rendered thrice venomous by the immobility of the petrified large figure opposed to him poured forth my poor father did not speak because he could not his arms dropped and such was the torrent of attack with its free play of thunder and lightning in the form of oaths epithets short and sharp comparisons bitter home thrusts and most vehement imprecatory denunciations that our protesting voices quailed janet plucked at my aunt dorothys dress to bear her away i cant leave my father i said nor i you dear said the tender woman and so we remained to be scourged by this tongue of incarnate rage you pensioner of a silly country spinster sounded like a return to mildness my fathers chest heaved up i took advantage of the lull to make myself heard i did but heap fuel on fire though the old mans splenetic impetus had partly abated you richmond do you hear him he swears hes your son and asks to be tied to the stake beside you disown him and ill pay you money and thank you ill thank my god for anything short of your foul blood in the family you married the boys mother to craze and kill her and guttle her property you waited for the boy to come of age to swallow what was settled on him you wait for me to lie in my coffin to pounce on the strongbox you think me the fool to toss to a young donkey ready to ruin all his belongings for you for nineandtwenty years youve sucked the veins of my family and struck through my house like a rottingdisease nineandtwenty years ago you gave a singinglesson in my house the pest has been in it ever since you breed vermin in the brain to think of you your wife your son your dupes every soul that touches you mildews from a blight you were born of ropery and you go at it straight like a webfoot to water whats your boastyour mothers disgrace you shame your mother your whole lifes a ballad o bastardy you cry up the womans infamy to hook at a father you swell and strut on her pickings youre a cock forced from the smoke of the dunghill you shame your mother damned adventurer you train your boy for a swindler after your own pattern you twirl him in your curst harlequinade to a damnation as sure as your own the day you crossed my threshold the devils danced on their flooring ive never seen the sun shine fair on me after it with your guitar under the windows of moonlight nights your spanish fopperies and trickeries your french phrases and toeings i was touched by a leper you set your traps for both my girls you caught the brown one first did you and flung her second for t other and drove a tandem of em to live the spangled hog you are and down went the mother of the boy to the place she liked better and my other girl herethe one you cheated for her salvationyou tried to cajole her from home and me to send her the same way down she stuck to decency good lord you threatened to hang yourself guitar and all but her purse served your turn for why youre a leech i speak before ladies or id rip your townlife to shreds your cause your romantic history your fine figure every inch of yous notched with villany you fasten on every moneyed woman that comes in your way youve outdone herod in murdering the innocents for he didnt feed on em and theyve made you fat one thing ill say of you you look the beastly thing you set yourself up for the kindest blow to yous to call you impostor he paused but his inordinate passion of speech was unsated his white lips hung loose for another eruption i broke from my aunt dorothy to cross over to my father saying on the way weve heard enough sir you forget the cardinal point of invective which is not to create sympathy for the person you assail oh you come in with your infernal fine language do you the old man thundered at me ill just tell you at once young fellow my aunt dorothy supplicated his attention one error i must correct her voice issued from a contracted throat and was painfully thin and straining as though the will to speak did violence to her weaker nature my sister loved mr richmond it was to save her life because i believed she loved him much and would have died that mr richmondin pityoffered her his hand at my wish she bent her head at my cost it was done for me i wished it he obeyed me no blame her dear mouth faltered i am to be accused if anybody she added more firmly my money would have been his i hoped to spare his feelings i beg his forgiveness now by devoting some of it unknown to him to assist him that was chiefly to please myself i see and i am punished well maam said the squire calm at white heat a fools confession ought to be heard out to the end what about the twentyfive thousand i hoped to help my harry why didnt you do it openly she breathed audible long breaths before she could summon courage to say his father was going to make an irreparable sacrifice i feared that if he knew this money came from me he would reject it and persist had she disliked the idea of my fathers marrying the old man pounced on the word sacrifice what sacrifice maam whats the sacrifice i perceived that she could not without anguish and perhaps peril of a further exposure bring herself to speak and explained it relates to my having tried to persuade my father to marry a very wealthy lady so that he might produce the money on the day appointed rail at me sir as much as you like if you cant understand the circumstances without a chapter of statements im sorry for you a great deal is due to you i know but i cant pay a jot of it while you go on rating my father like a madman harry either my aunt or janet breathed a warning i replied that i was past mincing phrases the folly of giving the tongue an airing was upon me i was in fact invited to continue and animated to do it thoroughly by the old mans expression of face which was that of one who says i give you rope and i dealt him a liberal amount of stock irony not worth repeating things that any cultivated man in anger can drill and sting the boeotian with under the delusion that he has not lost a particle of his selfcommand because of his coolness i spoke very deliberately and therefore supposed that the words of composure were those of prudent sense the error was manifest the women saw it one who has indulged his soul in invective will not if he has power in his hand be robbed of his climax with impunity by a cool response that seems to trifle and scourges i wound up by thanking my father for his devotion to me i deemed it i said excessive and mistaken in the recent instance but it was for me upon this he awoke from his dreamylooking stupefaction richie does me justice he is my dear boy he loves me i love him none can cheat us of that he loves his wreck of a father you have struck me to your feet mr beltham i dont want to see you there sir i want to see you go and not stand rapping your breastbone sounding like a burst drum as you are retorted the unappeasable old man i begged him in exasperation to keep his similes to himself janet and my aunt dorothy raised their voices my father said i am broken he put out a swimming hand that trembled when it rested like that of an aged man grasping a staff i feared for a moment he was acting he spoke so like himself miserable though he appeared but it was his wellknown native old style in a state of decrepitude i am broken he repeated i am like the ancient figure of mortality entering the mouth of the tomb on a sepulchral monument somewhere by a celebrated sculptor i have seen it i forget the city i shall presently forget names of men it is not your abuse mr beltham i should have bowed my head to it till the storm passed your facts oh miss beltham this last privilege to call you dearest of human beings my benefactress my blessing do not scorn me madam i never did i never will i pitied you she cried sobbing the squire stamped his foot madam my father bowed gently i was under heavens special protectioni thought so i feel i have been robbedi have not deserved it oh madam no it was your generosity that i did not deserve one of the angels of heaven persuaded me to trust in it i did not know adieu madam may i be worthy to meet youay mr beltham your facts have committed the deathwound you have taken the staff out of my hand you have extinguished the light i have existeday a pensioner unknowingly on this dear ladys charity to her i say no more to you sir by all that is most sacred to a manby the ashes of my mother by the prospects of my boy i swear the annuity was in my belief a tangible token that my claims to consideration were in the highest sources acknowledged to be just i cannot speak one word to you mr beltham put me aside i am nothingharry richmondhis fortunes are not lost he has a future i entreat youhe is your grandsongive him your support go this instant to the princeno you will not deny your countenance to harry richmond let him abjure my name let me be nameless in his house and i promise you i shall be unheard of both in christendom and heathendom i have no heart except for my boys nuptials with the princess this one thing to see him the husband of the fairest and noblest lady upon earth with all the life remaining in me i pray for i have won it for him i have a moderate ability immense devotion i declare to you sir i have lived actually subsisted on this hope and i have directed my efforts incessantly sleeplessly to fortify it i die to do it i implore you sir go to the prince if i he said this touchingly if i am any further in anybodys way it is only as a fallen tree but his inveterate fancifulness led him to add and that may bridge a cataract my grandfather had been clearing his throat two or three times im ready to finish and get rid of you richmond my father bowed i am gone sir i feel i am all but tonguetied think that it is harry who petitions you to ensure his happiness today i guarantee it the old man turned an inquiring eyebrow upon me janet laid her hand on him he dismissed the feline instinct to prolong our torture and delivered himself briskly richmond your last little bit of villanys broken in the egg i separate the boy from you hes not your accomplice there im glad to know you witched the lady over to pounce on her like a fowler you threatened her father with a scandal if he thought proper to force the trap swore youd toss her to be plucked by the gossips eh shes free of you you got your english and your germans here to point their bills and stretch their necks and hiss if this gentlemanand your newspapersif he didnt give up to you like a funky traveller to a highwayman i remember a tale of a clumsy turpin who shot himself when he was drawing the pistol out of his holsters to frighten the moneybag out of a market farmer youve done about the same you richmond and of all the damned poor speeches i ever heard from a convicted felon yours is the worsta sheared sheepd ha done it more respectably grant the beast a tongue the lady is free of you i tell you harry has to thank you for that kindness shewhat is it janet never mind ive got the storyshe didnt want to marry but this prince who called on me just now happened to be her fathers nominee and he heard of your scoundrelism and he behaved like a man and a gentleman and offered himself none too early nor too late as it turns out and the princess like a good girl has made amends to her father by accepting him ive the word of this prince hermann for it now you can look upon a game of stalemate if i had gone to the prince it wouldnt have been to back your play but if you hadnt been guilty of the tricks of a blackguard past praying for this princess would never have been obliged to marry a man to protect her father and herself they sent him here to stop any misunderstanding he speaks good english so thats certain your lies will be contradicted every one of em seriatim in tomorrows newspapers setting the real man in place of the wrong one and youll draw no profit from them in your fashionable world where youve been grinning lately like a blackamoors head on a conjurors platethe devil alone able to account for the body and joinings now you can be off i went up to my father his plight was more desperate than mine for i had resembled the condemned before the firingparty to whom the expected bullet brings a merely physical shock he poor man heard his sentence which is the hearts pang of death and how fondly and rootedly he had clung to the idea of my marriage with the princess was shown in his extinction after this blow my grandfather chose the moment as a fitting one to ask me for the last time to take my side i replied without offence in the tones of my voice that i thought my father need not lose me into the bargain after what he had suffered that day he just as quietly rejoined with a recommendation to me to divorce myself for good and all from a scoundrel i took my fathers arm he was not in a state to move away unsupported my aunt dorothy stood weeping janet was at the window no friend to either of us i said to her you have your wish she shook her head but did not look back my grandfather watched me step by step until i had reached the door youre going are you he said then i whistle you off my fingers an attempt to speak was made by my father in the doorway he bowed wide of the company like a blind man i led him out dimness of sight spared me from seeing certain figures which were at the tollbar of the pier on the way to quit our shores what i heard was not of a character to give me faith in the sanity of the companion i had chosen he murmured it at first to himself waddy shall have her monument my patience was not proof against the repetition of it aloud to me had i been gentler i might have known that his nature was compelled to look forward to something and he discerned nothing in the future save the task of raising a memorial to a faithful servant chapter liii the heiress proves that she inherits the feud and i go drifting my grandfather lived eight months after a scene that had afforded him high gratification at the heaviest cost a plain man can pay for his pleasures it killed him my fathers supple nature helped him to survive it in apparently unimpeded health so that the world might well suppose him unconquerable as he meant that it should but i who was with him knew though he never talked of his wounds they had been driven into his heart he collapsed in speech and became what he used to call one of the ordinary nodding men forsaken of his swamping initiative i merely observed him i did not invite his confidences being myself in no mood to give sympathy or to receive it i was about as tender in my care of him as a military escort bound to deliver up a captive alive i left him at bulsted on my way to london to face the creditors adversity had not lowered the admiration of the captain and his wife for the magnificent host of those select and lofty entertainments which i was led by my errand to examine in the skeleton and with a wonder as big as theirs but of another complexion they hung about him and perused and petted him quaintly it was grotesque they thought him deeply injured by what by whom they could not say but julia was disappointed in me for refraining to come out with a sally on his behalf he had quite intoxicated their imaginations julia told me of the things he did not do as marvellingly as of the things he did or had done the charm it seemed was to find herself familiar with him to the extent of all but nursing him and making him belong to her pilgrims coming upon the source of the mysteriouslyabounding river hardly revere it the less because they love it more when they behold the babbling channels it issues from and the sense of possession is the secret i suppose julia could inform me rapturously that her charge had slept eighteen hours at a spell his remarks upon the proposal to fetch a doctor feeble in themselves were delicious to her because they recalled his old humour to show his great spirit and from her and from captain william in turn i was condemned to hear how he had said this and that of the doctor which in my opinion might have been more concise really deuced good indeed captain william would exclaim dont you see it harry my boy he denies the doctor has a right to cast him out of the world on account of his having been the official to introduce him and hell only consent to be visited when he happens to be as incapable of resisting as upon their very first encounter the doctor and death and marriage i ventured to remind the captain had been riddled in this fashion by the whole army of humourists and their echoes he and julia fancied me cold to my fathers merits fond as they were of the squire they declared war against him in private they criticized janet they thought my aunt dorothy slightly wrong in making a secret of her good deed my father was the victim their unabated warmth consoled me in the bitterest of seasons he found a home with them at a time when there would have been a battle at every step the world soon knew that my grandfather had cast me off and with this foundation destroyed the entire fabric of the grand parade fell to the ground at once the crash was heavy jorian dewitt said truly that what a man hates in adversity is to see faces meaning that the humanity has gone out of them in their curious observation of you under misfortune you see neither friends nor enemies you are too sensitive for friends and are blunted against enemies you see but the mask of faces my father was sheltered from that julia consulted his wishes in everything she set traps to catch his whims and treated them as birds of paradise she could submit to have the toppling crumpled figure of a man bagenhope his pensioner and singular comforter in her house the little creature was fetched out of his haunts in london purposely to soothe my father with performances on his ancient clarionet a most querulous plaintive instrument in his discoursing almost the length of himself and she endured the nightly sound of it in the guests blue bedroom heroically patient a model to me bagenhope drank drams she allowanced him he had known my fathers mother and could talk of her in his cups his playing and his aged tunes my father said were a certification to him that he was at the bottom of the ladder why that should afford him peculiar comfort none of us could comprehend he was the humble lover of my mother richie i heard with some confusion and that he adored her memory the statement was part of an entreaty to me to provide liberally for bagenhopes pension before we quitted england i am not seriously anxious for much else said my father yet was he fully conscious of the defeat he had sustained and the catastrophe he had brought down upon me his touch of my hand told me that and his desire for darkness and sleep he had nothing to look to nothing to see twinkling its radiance for him in the dim distance now no propitiating government no special providence but he never once put on a sorrowful air to press for pathos and i thanked him he was a man endowed to excite it in the most effective manner to a degree fearful enough to win english sympathies despite his unenglish faults he could have drawn tears in floods infinite pathetic commiseration from our grangousier public whose taste is to have it as it may be had to the mixture of onethird of nature in twothirds of artifice i believe he was expected to go about with this beggars petition for compassion and it was a disappointment to the generous for which they punished him that he should have abstained and moreover his simple quietude was really touching to truehearted people the elements of pathos do not permit of their being dispensed from a stout smoking bowl i have to record no pathetic fieldday my father was never insincere in emotion i spared his friends chums associates excellent men of a kind the trial of their attachment by shunning them his servants i dismissed personally from m alphonse down to the coachman jeremy whose speech to me was that he should be happy to serve my father again or me if he should happen to be out of a situation when either of us wanted him which at least showed his preference for employment on the other hand alphonse embracing the grand extremes of his stereotyped national oratory where si jamais like the herald mercury newmounting takes its august flight to set in the splendour of ausqun la mort declared all other service than my fathers repugnant and vowed himself to a hermitage remote from condiments they both meant well and did but speak the diverse language of their blood mrs waddy withdrew a respited heart to dipwell it being according to her experiences the third time that my father had relinquished house and furniture to go into eclipse on the continent after blazing over london she strongly recommended the continent for a place of restoration citing his likeness to that animal the chameleon in the readiness with which he forgot himself among them that knew nothing of him we quitted bulsted previous to the return of the family to riversley my grandfather lay at the island hotel a month and was brought home desperately ill lady edbury happened to cross the channel with us she behaved badly i thought foolishly my father said she did as much as obliqueness of vision and sharpness of feature could help her to do to cut him in the presence of her party and he would not take nay it seemed in very bad taste on his part he explained to me offhandedly that he insisted upon the exchange of a word or two for the single purpose of protecting her from calumny by and by it grew more explicable to me how witless she had been to give gossip a handle in the effort to escape it she sent for him in paris but he did not pay the visit my grandfather and i never saw one another again he had news of me from various quarters and i of him from one i was leading a life in marked contrast from the homely riversley circle of days and this likewise was set in the count of charges against my father our continental pilgrimage ended in a course of riotousness that he did not participate in and was entirely innocent of but was held accountable for because he had been judged a sinner i am ordered to say janet wrote scrupulously obeying the order that if you will leave paris and come home and not delay in doing it your grandfather will receive you on the same footing as heretofore as heretofore in a letter from a young woman supposed to nourish a softness i could not leave my father in paris alone i dared not bring him to london in wrath at what i remembered i replied that i was willing to return to riversley if my father should find a welcome as well janet sent a few dry lines to summon me over in april a pleasant month on heathlands when the southwest sweeps them the squire was dead i dropped my father at bulsted i could have sworn to the terms of the will mr burgin had little to teach me janet was the heiress three thousand pounds per annum fell to the lot of harry lepel richmond to be paid out of the estate and pass in reversion to his children or to janets should the aforesaid harry die childless i was hard hit and chagrined but i was not at all angry for i knew what the will meant my aunt dorothy supplied the interlining eagerly to mollify the seeming cruelty you have only to ask to have it all harry the sturdy squire had done his utmost to forward his cherished wishes after death my aunt received fiveandtwenty thousand pounds the sum she had thrown away i promised that no money of mine should go where the other went she said the surprise in store for me was to find how much this roughworded old man had been liked by his tenantry his agents and servants i spoke of it to janet they loved him she said no one who ever met him fairly could help loving him they followed him to his grave in a body from what i chanced to hear among them their squire was the man of their hearts in short an englishman of the kind which is perpetually perishing out of the land janet expected me to be enthusiastic likewise or remorseful she expected sympathy she read me the long list of his charities i was reminded of julia bulsted commenting on my father with her this he did and that he had plenty i said and janet shut her lips her coldness was irritating what ground of accusation had she against me our situation had become so delicate that a cold breath sundered us as far as the poles i was at liberty to suspect that now she was the heiress her mind was simply obedient to her grandadas wish but as i told my aunt dorothy i would not do her that injustice no said dorothy it is the money that makes her position so difficult unless you break the ice i urged that having steadily refused her before i could hardly advance without some invitation now what invitation said my aunt not a corpselike consent said i harry she twitted me you have not forgiven her that was true sir roderick and lady ilchester did not conceal their elation at their daughters vast inheritance though the lady appealed to my feelings in stating that her son charles was not mentioned in the will sir roderick talked of the squire with personal pridenow as to his management of those unwieldy men his miners they sent him up the items of their complaints he took them one by one yielding here discussing there and holding to his point so the men gave way he sent them a months pay to reward them for their good sense he had the art of moulding the men who served him in his own likeness his capacity for business was extraordinary you never expected it of a country gentleman he more than quadrupled his inheritancemuch more i state it to the worthy baronets honour that although it would have been immensely to his satisfaction to see his daughter attracting the suitor proper to an heiress of such magnitude he did not attempt to impose restriction upon my interviews with janet riversley was mentioned as my home i tried to feel at home the heir of the place seemed foreign and so did janet i attributed it partly to her deep mourning dress that robed her in so sedate a womanliness partly in spite of myself to her wealth speak to her kindly of your grandfather said my aunt dorothy to do so however as she desired it would be to be guilty of a form of hypocrisy and i belied my better sentiments by keeping silent thus having ruined myself through anger i allowed silly sensitiveness to prevent the repair it became known that my father was at bulsted i saw trouble one morning on janets forehead we had a conversation that came near to tenderness at last she said will you be able to forgive me if i have ever the misfortune to offend you you wont offend me said i she hoped not i rallied her tut tut you talk like any twelveyearsold janet i offended you then every day its all that i care much to remember she looked pleased but i was so situated that i required passion and abandonment in return for a confession damaging to my pride besides the school i had been graduating in of late unfitted me for a young english gentlewomans shades and intervolved descents of emotion a glance up and a dimple in the cheek were pretty homely things enough not the blaze i wanted to unlock me and absolutely thought i had deserved sir roderick called her to the library on business which he was in the habit of doing ten times a day as well as of discussing matters of business at table ostentatiously consulting his daughter with a solemn countenance and a transparently reeling heart of parental exultation janet is supreme he would say my advice is simple advice i am her chief agent that is all her chief agent as director of three companies and chairman of one was perhaps competent to advise her he remarked her judgement upon ordinary matters he agreed with my grandfather in thinking consummate janet went to him and shortly after drove him to the station for london my aunt dorothy had warned me that she was preparing some deed in my favour and as i fancied her father to have gone to london for that purpose and supposed she would now venture to touch on it i walked away from the east gates of the park as soon as i heard the trot of her ponies and was led by an evil fate the stuff the fates are composed of in my instance i have not kept secret to walk westward thither my evil fate propelled me where accident was ready to espouse it and breed me mortifications innumerable my father chanced to have heard the particulars of squire belthams will that morning i believe captain williams coachman brushed the subject despondently in my interests it did not reach him through julia he stood outside the western gates and as i approached i could perceive a labour of excitement on his frame he pulled violently at the bars of the obstruction richie i am interdicted house and grounds he called and waved his hand toward the lodge they decline to open to me were you denied admission i asked him your name if you please sirmr richmond roywe are sorry we have orders not to admit you and they declined they would not admit me to see my son those must be the squires old orders i said and shouted to the lodgekeeper my father with the forethoughtfulness which never forsook him stopped me no richie no the good woman shall not have the responsibility of letting me in against orders she may be risking her place poor soul help me dear lad he climbed the bars to the spikes tottering and communicating a convulsion to me as i assisted him in the leap down no common feat for one of his age and weight he leaned on me quaking impossible richie impossible he cried and reviewed a series of interjections it was some time before i discovered that they related to the will he was frenzied and raved turning suddenly from red to pale under what i feared were redoubtable symptoms physical or mental he came for sight of the will he would contest it overthrow it harry ruined he would see miss beltham and fathom the plotangel he called her and was absurdly exclamatory but in dire earnest he must have had the appearance of a drunken man to persons observing him from the grange windows my father was refused admission at the halldoors the butler the brute sillabin withstood me impassively whose orders had he miss ilchesters they are afraid of me my father thundered i sent a message to janet she was not long in coming followed by a footman who handed a twist of notepaper from my aunt dorothy to my father he opened it and made believe to read it muttering all the while of the will janet dismissed the menservants she was quite colourless we have been stopped in the doorway i said she answered i wish it could have been prevented you take it on yourself then she was inaudible my dear janet you call riversley my home dont you it is yours do you intend to keep up this hateful feud now my grandfather is dead no harry not i did you give orders to stop my father from entering the house and grounds i did you wont have him here dear harry i hoped he would not come just yet but you gave the orders yes youre rather incomprehensible my dear janet i wish you could understand me harry you arm your servants against him in a few days she faltered you insult him and me now said i enraged at the half indication of her relenting which spoiled her look of modestlyresolute beauty and seemed to show that she meant to succumb without letting me break her you are mistress of the place i am i wish i were not you are mistress of riversley and you refuse to let my father come in while i am the mistress yes anywhere but here harry if he will see me or aunty if he will kindly appoint any other place we will meet him we shall be glad i request you to let him enter the house do you consent or not he was refused once at these doors do you refuse him a second time i do you mean that i am obliged to you wont yield a step to me i cannot the spirit of an armed champion was behind those mild features soft almost to supplication to me that i might know her to be under a constraint the nether lip dropped in breathing the eyes wavered such was her appearance in open war with me but her will was firm of course i was not so dense as to be unable to perceive her grounds for refusing she would not throw the burden on her grandada even to propitiate methe man she still loved but that she should have a reason and think it good in spite of me and cling to it defying me and that she should do hurt to a sentient human creature who was my father for the sake of blindly obeying to the letter the injunction of the dead were intolerable offences to me and common humanity i for my own part would have forgiven her as i congratulated myself upon reflecting it was on her accountto open her mind to enlighten her concerning right and wrong determination to bring her feelings to bear upon a crude judgementthat i condescended to argue the case smarting with admiration both of the depths and shallows of her character and of her fine figure i beganshe was to consider how young she was to pretend to decide on the balance of duties how little of the world she had seen an oath sworn at the bedside of the dead was a solemn thing but was it christian to keep it to do an unnecessary cruelty to the living if she had not studied philosophy she might at least discern the difference between just resolves and insanebetween those the soul sanctioned and those hateful to nature to bind oneself to carry on another persons vindictiveness was voluntarily to adopt slavery this was flatlyavowed insanity and so forth with an emphatic display of patience the truth of my words could not be controverted unhappily i confounded right speaking with right acting and conceived because i spoke so justly that i was specially approved in pressing her to yield she broke the first pause to say its useless harry i do what i think i am bound to do then i have spoken to no purpose if you will only be kind and wait two or three days be sensible i am as much as i can be hard as a flintyou always were the most grateful woman alive i admit i know not another i assure you janet who in return for millions of money would do such a piece of wanton cruelty what you think he was not punished enough when he was berated and torn to shreds in your presence they would be cruel perhapswe will suppose it of your sexbut not so fond of their consciences as to stamp a life out to keep an oath i forget the terms of the will were you enjoined in it to force him away my father had stationed himself in the background mention of the will caught his ears and he commenced shaking my aunt dorothys note blinking and muttering at a great rate and pressing his temples i do not read a word of this he saidupon my honour not a word and i know it is her handwriting that willonly for the love of heaven madamhe bowed vaguely to janet not a syllable of this to the princess or we are destroyed i have a great bell in my head or i would say more hearing is out of the question janet gazed piteously from him to me to kill the deer and be sorry for the suffering wretch is common i begged my father to walk along the carriagedrive he required that the direction should be pointed out accurately and promptly obeyed me saying i back you remember i should certainly be asleep now but for this extraordinary bell after going some steps he turned to shout gong and touched his ear he walked loosely utterly unlike the walk habitual to him even recently in paris has he been ill janet asked he wont see the doctor the symptoms threaten apoplexy or paralysis im told let us finish you were aware that you were to inherit riversley yes riversley harry i knew that i knew nothing else the old place was left to you that you might bar my father out i gave my word you pledged itswore no well youve done your worst my dear if the axe were to fall on your neck for it you would still refuse would you not janet answered softly i believe so then goodbye said i that feminine softness and its burden of unalterable firmness pulled me two ways angering me all the more that i should feel myself susceptible to a charm which came of spiritual rawness rather than sweetness for she needed not to have made the answer in such a manner there was pride in it she liked the soft sound of her voice while declaring herself invincible i could see her picturing herself meek but fixed will you go harry will you not take riversley she said i laughed to spare you the repetition of the dilemma no harry but this might be done butmy fullest thanks to you for your generosity really i speak in earnest it would be decidedly against your grandadas wishes seeing that he left the grange to you and not to me grandadas wishes i cannot carry out all his wishes she sighed are you anxious to we were on the delicate ground as her crimson face revealed to me that she knew as well as i i however had little delicacy in leading her on it she might well feel that she deserved some wooing i fancied she was going to be overcome going to tremble and show herself ready to fall on my bosom and i was uncertain of the amount of magnanimity in store there she replied calmly not immediately you are not immediately anxious to fulfil his wishes harry i find it hard to do those that are thrust on me but as a matter of serious obligation you would hold yourself bound by and by to perform them all i cannot speak any further of my willingness harry the sense of duty is evidently always sufficient to make you act upon the negativeto deny at least yes i daresay said janet we shook hands like a pair of commercial men i led my father to bulsted he was too feverish to remain there in the evening after having had a fruitless conversation with my aunt dorothy upon the event of the day i took him to london that he might visit his lawyers who kindly consented to treat him like doctors when i had arranged to make over to them three parts of my annuity and talked of his case encouragingly the effect of which should not have astonished me he closed a fit of reverie resembling his drowsiness by exclaiming richie will be indebted to his dad for his place in the world after all temporarily he admitted we must be fugitives from creditors and as to that eccentric tribe at once so human and so inhuman he imparted many curious characteristics gained of his experience jorian dewitt had indeed compared them to the female ivy that would ultimately kill its tree but inasmuch as they were parasites they loved their debtor he was life and support to them and there was this remarkable fact about them by slipping out of their clutches at critical moments when they would infallibly be pulling you down you were enabled to return to them fresh and they became inspired with another lease of lively faith in your future et caetera i knew the language it was a flash of himself and a bad one but i was not the person whom he meant to deceive with it he was soon giving me other than verbal proof out of england that he was not thoroughly beaten we had no home in england at an hotel in vienna upon the close of the aristocratic season there he renewed an acquaintance with a russian lady countess kornikoff and he and i parted she disliked the margravine of rippau who was in vienna and did not recognize us i heard that it was the margravine who had despatched prince hermann to england as soon as she discovered ottilias flight thither she commissioned him to go straightway to roy in london and my fathers having infatuatedly left his own address for prince ernests in the island brought hermann down he only met eckart in the morning train i mention it to show the strange working of events janet sent me a letter by the hands of temple in august it was moderately well written for so blunt a writer and might have touched me but for other news coming simultaneously that shook the earth under my feet she begged my forgiveness for her hardness adding characteristically that she could never have acted in any other manner the delusion that what she was she must always be because it was her nature had mastered her understanding or rather it was one of the doors of her understanding not yet opened she had to respect her grandadas wishes she made it likewise appear that she was ready for further sacrifices to carry out the same at least you will accept a division of the property harry it should be yours it is an excess and i feel it a snare to me i was a selfish child i may not become an estimable woman you have not pardoned my behaviour at the island last year and i cannot think i was wrong perhaps i might learn i want your friendship and counsel aunty will live with me she says that you would complete us at any rate i transfer riversley to you send me your consent papa will have it before the transfer is signed the letter ended with an adieu a petition for an answer and yours affectionately on the day of its date a viennese newspaper lying on the salzburg hotel table chronicled ottilias marriage with prince hermann i turned on temple to walk him off his legs if i could carry your fever to the alps you of minds diseased not to sit down in sight of them ruminating for bodily ease and comfort will trick the soul and set you measuring our lean humanity against yonder sublime and infinite but mount rack the limbs wrestle it out among the peaks taste danger sweat earn rest learn to discover ungrudgingly that haggard fatigue is the fair vision you have run to

thing you are and the thing you may become there the merry little hopes grow for the climber like flowers and food immediate prompt to prove their uses sufficient if just within the grasp as mortal

rhapsodists in the vales below may tell you of the joy and grandeur of the upper regions they cannot pluck you the medical herb he gets that for himself who wanders the marshy ledge at nightfall to behold the distant sennhiittchen twinkle who leaps the greeneyed crevasses and in the solitude of an emerald alp stretches a salt hand to the mountain kine chapter liv my return to england i passed from the alps to the desert and fell in love with the east until it began to consume me history like the air we breathe must be in motion to keep us uncorrupt otherwise its ancient homes are infectious my passion for the sun and his baked people lasted awhile the drudgery of the habit of voluntary exile some time longer and then quite unawares i was seized with a thirst for england so violent that i abandoned a correspondence of several months lying for me both at damascus and cairo to catch the boat for europe a dream of a rainy morning in the midst of the glowing furnace may have been the origin of the wild craving i had for my native land and janet the moist air of flying showers and drenched spring buds surrounded her i saw her plainly lifting a roses head was it possible i had ever refused to be her yokefellow could so noble a figure of a fair young woman have been offered and repudiated again and again by a man in his senses i spurned the intolerable idiot to stop reflection perhaps she did likewise now there was nothing to alarm me save my own eagerness the news of my father was perplexing leading me to suppose him reestablished in london awaiting the coming on of his case whence the money money and my father i knew met as they divided fortuitously in illustration of which i well remembered while passing in view of the key of the adige along the lombard plain a circumstance during my alpine tour with temple of more importance to him than to me when my emulous friend who would never be beaten sprained his ankle severely on the crags of a waterfall not far from innsbruck and was invited into a house by a young english lady daughter of a retired colonel of engineers of our army the colonel was an exile from his country for no grave crime but as he told us as much an exile as if he had committed a capital offence in being the father of nine healthy girls he had been against his judgement he averred persuaded to fix on his tyrolese spot of ground by the two elder ones five were now married to foreigners thus they repaid him by scattering good english blood on the race of counts and freiherrs i could understand the decrees of providence before i was a parent said this dear old colonel heddon i was looking up at the rainbow when i heard your steps asking myself whether it was seen in england at that instant and why on earth i should be out of england he lived abroad to be able to dower his girls his sonsinlaw were gentlemen so far he was condemned to be satisfied but supposing all his girls married foreigners his primitive frankness charmed us and it struck me that my susceptible temple would have liked to be in a position to reassure him with regard to the lucy of the four we were obliged to confess that she was catching a foreign accent the old colonel groaned he begged us to forgive him for not treating us as strangers his heart leapt out to young english gentlemen my name he said reminded him of a great character at home in the old days a certain royrichmond son of an actress and somebody so the story went and there was an old lord edbury who knew more about it than most now roy was an adventurer but he had a soul of true chivalry by gad he had plenty of foreign whiffmajigs are to be found but you wont come upon a fellow like that where he got his money from none knew all i can say is i dont believe he ever did a dirty action for it and one matter ill tell you of pardon me a moment mr richmond i havent talked english for half a century or at least a quarter old lord edbury put him down in his will for some thousands and he risked it to save a lady who hated him for his pains lady edbury was of the bolton blood none of the tamest they breed good cavalry men she ran away from her husband once the old lord took her back its at your peril mind says she well roy hears byandby of a fresh affair he mounted horse he was in the saddle ive been assured a night and a day and posted himself between my ladys parkgates and the house at dusk the rumour ran that he knew of the marquis playing spy on his wife however such was the fact she was going off again and the marquis did play the mean part she walked down the parkroad and seeing the cloaked figure of a man she imagined him to be her lothario and very naturally you will own fell into his arms the gentleman in question was an acquaintance of mine and the less you follow our example the better for you it was a damnable period in morals he told me that he saw the scene from the gates where he had his carriageandfour ready the old lord burst out of an ambush on his wife and her supposed paramour the lady was imprisoned in her rescuers arms and my friend retired on tiptoe which was i incline to think the best thing he could do our morals were abominable lady edbury would never see royrichmond after that nor the old lord neither he doubled the sum he had intended to leave him though i heard that he married a second young wife roy i believe ended by marrying a great heiress and reforming he was an eloquent fellow and stood like a general in full uniform cocked hat and feathers most amusing fellow at table beat a frenchman for anecdote i spared colonel heddon the revelation of my relationship to his hero thanking his garrulity for interrupting me how i pitied him when i drove past the gates of the main route to innsbruck for i was bound homeward i should soon see england green cloudy england the white cliffs the meadows the heaths and i thanked the colonel again in my heart for having done something to reconcile me to the idea of that strange father of mine a bannerlike stream of morningcoloured smoke rolled northeastward as i entered london and i drove to temples chambers he was in court engaged in a case as junior to his father temple had become that radiant human creature a working man then i walked slowly to the court and saw him there hardly recognising him in his wig all that he had to do was to prompt his father in a case of collision at sea the barque priscilla had run foul of a merchant brig near the mouth of the thames and though i did not expect it on hearing the vessels name it proved to be no other than the barque priscilla of captain jasper welsh soon after i had shaken temples hand i was going through the same ceremony with the captain himself not at all changed in appearance who blessed his heart for seeing me cried out that a beard and mustachios made a foreign face of a young englishman and was full of the providential circumstance of his having confided his case to temple and his father ay ay captain welsh said temple we have pulled you through only another time mind you keep an eye on that lookout man of yours some of your men i suspect see double with an easy conscience a close net makes slippery eels have you anything to say against my men the captain inquired temple replied that he would talk to him about it presently and laughed as he drew me away his men will get him into a deuce of a scrape some day richie i shall put him on his guard have you had all my letters you look made of iron im beginning capitally not afraid of the court a bit and i hope im not pert i wish your father had taken it better taken what said i havent you heard from him two or three times a mass of interjections you know he brought his case forward at last of course it went as we all knew it would where is he have you seen janet lately he is at miss ilchesters house in london write the address on a card temple wrote it rather hesitatingly i thought we talked of seeing one another in the evening and i sprang off to janets residence forgetting to grasp my old friends hand at parting i was madly anxious to thank her for the unexpected tenderness to my father and now nothing stood between us my aunt dorothy was the first to welcome me he must be prepared for the sight of you harry the doctors say that a shock may destroy him janet treats him so wonderfully i pressed her on my heart and cheered her praising janet she wept is there anything new the matter i said its not new to us harry im sure youre brave brave what am i asked to bear much if you love her harry speak it is better you should hear it from me harry i wrote you word of it we all imagined it would not be disagreeable to you who could foresee this change in you she least of all shes in love with some one i did not say in love tell me the worst she is engaged to be married janet came into the roomanother janet for me she had engaged herself to marry the marquis of edbury at the moment when she enslaved me with gratitude and admiration she was lost to me i knew her too well to see a chance of her breaking her pledged word my old grandfather said of janet shes a compassionate thing i felt now the tears under his speech and how late i was in getting wisdom compassion for edbury in janets bosom was the matchmakers chief engine of assault my aunt dorothy told me lady ilchester had been for this suitor sir roderick for the other up to the verge of a quarrel between the most united of wedding couples janet was persecuted she heard that edburys life was running to waste she liked him for his cricketing and hunting his frankness seeming manliness and general native english enthusiasm i permitted myself to comprehend the case as far as i could allow myself to excuse her dorothy beltham told me something of janet that struck me to the dust it is this dear harry bear to hear it janet and i and his good true woman of a housekeeper whose name is waddy we are i believe the only persons that know it he had a large company to dine at a city tavern she told us on the night after the decisionwhen the verdict went against him the following morning i received a note from this good mrs waddy addressed to sir rodericks london house where i was staying with janet it said that he was ill and janet put on her bonnet at once to go to him the lady didnt fear contagion any longer she went walking fast he was living in lodgings and the people of the house insisted on removing him mrs waddy told us she was cowering in the parlour i had not the courage to go upstairs janet went by herself my heart rose on a huge swell she was alone with him harry we could hear them dorothy beltham looked imploringly on me to waken my whole comprehension she subdued him when i saw him he was white as death but quiet not dangerous at all do you mean she found him raving i cried out on our makers name in grief and horror yes dear harry it was so she stepped between him and an asylum she quitted sir rodericks house to lodge your father safe in one that she hired and have him under her own care she watched him day and night for three weeks and governed him assisted only at intervals by the poor frightened woman mrs waddy and just as frightened me and i am still subject to the poor womans way of pressing her hand to her heart at a noise its over now harry janet wished that you should never hear of it she dreads any excitement for him i think she is right in fancying her own influence the best he is used to it you know how gentle she is though she is so firm oh dont torture me maam for gods sake i called aloud chapter lv i meet my first playfellow and take my punishment there came to me a little note on foreign paper unaddressed an enclosure forwarded by janet and containing merely one scrap from the playful xenien of ottilias favourite brotherly poets of untranslatable flavour who shuns true friends flies fortune in the concrete would he see what he aims at let him ask his heels it filled me with a breath of old german peace from this i learnt that ottilia and janet corresponded upon what topics to what degree of intimacy janet now confessed to me that their intimacy had never known reserve the princess had divined her attachment for harry richmond when their acquaintance was commenced in the island and knew at the present moment that i had travelled round to the recognition of janets worth thus encouraged by the princesss changeless friendship i wrote to her leaving little to be guessed of my state of mind withholding nothing of the circumstances surrounding me imagination dealt me all my sharpest misery and now that ottilia resumed her place there i became infinitely peacefuller and stronger to subdue my hungry nature it caused me no pang strangely though it read in my sight when written to send warm greetings and respects to the prince her husband is it any waste of time to write of love the trials of life are in it but in a narrow ring and a fierier you may learn to know yourself through love as you do after years of life whether you are fit to lift them that are about you or whether you are but a cheat and a load on the backs of your fellows the impure perishes the inefficient languishes the moderate comes to its autumn of decaythese are of the kinds which aim at satisfaction to die of it soon or late the love that survives has strangled craving it lives because it lives to nourish and succour like the heavens but to strangle craving is indeed to go through a death before you reach your immortality but again to write of a love perverted by all the elements contributing to foolishness and foredoomed to chastisement would be a graceless business janet and i went through our trial she you may believe the braver under the most to bear i was taken by temple down to the shipsmelling east of london for the double purpose of trying to convince captain welsh of the extravagance of a piece of chivalry he was about to commit and of seeing a lady with a history who had recently come under his guardianship temple thought i should know her but he made a mystery of it until the moment of our introduction arrived not being certain of her identity and not wishing to have me disappointed it appeared that captain welsh questioned his men closely after he had won his case and he arrived at the conclusion that two or three of them had been guilty of false swearing in his interests he did not dismiss them for as he said it was twice a bad thing to turn sinners loose it was to shove them out of the direct road of amendment and it was a wrong to the population he insisted however on paying the legal costs and an indemnity for the collision at sea and temple was in great distress about it he having originally suggested the suspicion of his men to captain welsh i wanted to put him on his guard against those rascals temple said and i suppose he sighed i wanted the old captain to think me enormously clever all round he shook himself and assumed a bearish aspect significant of disgust and recklessness the captain ll be ruined richie and hes not young you know to go on sailing his barque priscilla for ever if he pays why i ought to pay and then you ought to pay for i shouldnt have shown off before him alone and then the wind that fetched you ought to pay toss common sense overboard theres no end to your finedrawings thats why its always safest to swear by the judge we rolled down to the masts among the chimneys on the top of an omnibus the driver was eloquent on cricketmatches now cricket he said was fine manly sport it might kill a man but it never meant mischief foreigners themselves had a bit of an idea that it was the best game in the world though it was a nice joke to see a foreigner playing at it none of them could stand to be bowled at hadnt stomachs for it theyd have to train for soldiers first on one occasion he had seen a frenchman looking on at a match ball was hit a shooter twixt the slips off starts frenchman catches it heaves it up like his head halfway to wicket and all the field set to bawling at him and sending him we knew where he tripped off you no comprong politeness in dis country ha ha to prove the aforesaid frenchman wrong we nodded to the drivers laughter at his exquisite imitation he informed us that he had backed the surrey eleven last year owing to the report of a gentlemanbowler who had done things in the way of tumbling wickets to tickle the ears of cricketers gentlemenbatters were common gentlemenbowlers were quite another dish saddlebank was the gentlemans name old nandrew saddle temple called to me and we smiled at the supposition of saddlebanks fame neither of us from what we had known of his bowling doubting that he deserved it acquainted with him gentlemen the driver inquired touching his hat well and i ask why dont more gentlemen take to cricket stead of horses all round the year now theres my notion of happiness said the man condemned to inactivity in the perpetual act of motion cricket in cricket season it comprisescount lots o running and thats good just enough o taking it easy thats good a appetite for your dinner and your ale or your port as may be the case good number three add on a tired pipe after dark and a sound sleep to follow and you say good morning to the doctor and the parson for youre in health body and soul and neer a parson ll make a better christian of ye that ill swear as if anxious not to pervert us he concluded thats what i think gentlemen temple and i talked of the ancient raptures of a first of may cricketingday on a sunny green meadow with an ocean of a day before us and wellbraced spirits for the match i had the vision of a matronly but not much altered janet mounted on horseback to witness the performance of some favourite eleven of youngsters with her connoisseurs eye and then the model of an english lady wife and mother waving adieu to the field and cantering home to entertain her husbands guests her husband temple was aware of my grief but saw no remedy i knew that in his heart he thought me justly punished though he loved me we had a long sitting with captain welsh whom i found immoveable as i expected i should his men he said had confessed their sin similarly to the crab in a hole with one claw out as the way of sinners was he blamed himself mainly where you have accidents mr richmond you have faults and where you have faults aboard a ship you may trace a line to the captain i should have treated my ships crew like my conscience and gone through them nightly as it is sir here comes round one of your accidents to tell me i have lived blinded by conceit that is my affliction my young friend the payment of the money is no more so than to restore money held in trust temple and i argued the case with him as of old on our voyage on board the barque priscilla quite unavailingly is a verdict built on lies one that my maker approves of said he if i keep possession of that money my young friends will it clothe me ay with stings will it feed me ay with poison and they that should be having it shiver and want he was emphatic as he would not have been save to read us an example owing to our contention with him the money is satan in my very hands when he had dismissed the subject he never returned to it his topic of extreme happiness to which temple led him was the rescue of a beautiful sinner from a life of shame it appeared that captain welsh had the habit between his voyages of making one holiday expedition to the spot of all creation he thought the fairest richmond hill overlooking the thames and there one evening he espied a lady in grief and spoke to her and gave her consolation more he gave her a blameless home the ladys name was mabel bolton she was in distress of spirit rather than of circumstances for temptation was thick about one so beautiful to supply the vanities and luxuries of the father of sin he described her she was my first playfellow the millers daughter of dipwell mabel sweetwinter taken from her home by lord edbury during my german university career and now put away by him upon command of his family on the eve of his marriage she herself related her history to me after telling me that she had seen me once at the steps of edburys club our meeting was no great surprise to either of us she had heard my name as that of an expected visitor she had seen temple moreover and he had prompted me with her christian name and the praise of her really glorious hair to anticipate the person who was ushered into the little cabinlike parlour by captain welshs good old mother of edbury she could not speak for grief believing that he loved her still and was acting under compulsion her long and faithful attachment to the scapegrace seemed to preserve her from the particular regrets captain welsh supposed to occupy her sinners mind so that after some minutes of the hesitation and strangeness due to our common recollections she talked of him simply and wellas befitted her situation a worldling might say but she did not conceal her relief in escaping to this quaint little refuge she threw a kindlycomical look not overtoned at the miniature ships on the mantelpiece and the picture of joseph leading mary with her babe on the ass from the temptations i could imagine a face like hers would expose her to the face was splendid the figure already overblown i breathed some thanks to my father while she and i conversed apart the miller was dead her brother in america she had no other safe home than the one captain welsh had opened to her when i asked her i had no excuse for it whether she would consent to go to edbury again she reddened and burst into tears i cursed my brutality let her cry said captain welsh on parting with us at his street door tears are the way of women and their comfort to our astonishment he told us he intended to take her for a voyage in the priscilla why we asked i take her he said because not to do things wholly is worse than not to do things at all for its waste of time and cause for a chorus below down in hell my young friends the woman is beautiful as solomons bride she is weak as water and the man is wicked he has written to her a letter he would have her reserved for himself a wedded man such he is or is soon to be i am searching and she is not deceitful and i am a poor man again and must go the voyage i wrestled with her and by grace i conquered her to come with me of a free will and be out of his snares aboard i do not fear him and she shall know the mercy of the lord on high seas we grimaced a little on her behalf but had nothing to reply seeing janet after mabel was strange in the latter one could perceive the palpably suitable mate for edbury i felt that my darling was insultedno amends for it i had to keep silent and mark the remorseless preparations going forward not so heriot he had come over from the camp in ireland on leave at this juncture his talk of women still suggested the hawk with the downy feathers of the last little plucked bird sticking to his beak but his appreciation of janet and some kindness for me made him a vehement opponent of her resolve he took licence of his friendship to lay every incident before her to complete his persuasions she resisted his attacks as i knew she would obstinately and replied to his entreaties with countersupplications that he should urge me to accept old riversley the conflicts went on between those two daily and i heard of them from heriot at night he refused to comprehend her determination under the head of anything save madness varied by reproaches of me for my former inveterate blindness he raved upon janets madness incessantly swearing that he would not be beaten i told him his efforts were useless but thought them friendly and so they were only janets resistance had fired his vanity and he stalked up and down my room talking a mixture of egregious coxcombry and hearty good sense that might have shown one the cause he meant to win had become personal to him temple who was sometimes in consultation with him and was always amused by his quasifanfaronade assured me that heriot was actually scheming the next we heard of him was that he had been seen at a whitebait hotel down the river drunk with edbury janet also heard of that and declined to see heriot again our last days marched frightfully fast janet had learnt that any the most distant allusion to her marriage day was an anguish to the man who was not to marry her so it was through my aunt dorothy that i became aware of julia bulsteds kindness in offering to take charge of my father for a term lady sampleman undertook to be hostess to him for one night the eve of janets nuptials he was quiet unlikely to give annoyance to persons not strongly predisposed to hear sentences finished and exclamations fall into their right places adieu to my darling there have been women well won here was an adorable woman well lost after twenty years of slighting her did i fancy she would turn to me and throw a man over in reward of my ultimate recovery of my sensesor fancy that one so tenacious as she had proved would snap a tie depending on her pledged word she liked edbury she saw the best of him and liked him the improved young lord was her handiwork after the years of humiliation from me she had found herself courted by a young nobleman who clung to her for help showed improvement and brought her many compliments from a wondering world she really felt that she was strength and true life to him she resisted heriot she resisted a more powerful advocate and this was the princess ottilia my aunt dorothy told me that the princess had written janet either did or affected to weigh the princesss reasonings and she did not evade the task of furnishing a full reply her resolution was unchanged loss of colour loss of light in her eyes were the sole signs of what it cost her to maintain it our task was to transfer the idea of janet to that of julia in my fathers whirling brain which at first rebelled violently and cast it out like a stick thrust between rapidly revolving wheels the night before i was to take him away she gave me her hand with a goodbye dear harry my words were much the same she had a ghastly face but could not have known it for she smiled and tried to keep the shallow smile in play as friends do there was the end it came abruptly and was schoolingly cold and short it had the effect on me of freezing my blood and setting what seemed to be the nerves of my brain at work in a fury of calculation to reckon the minutes remaining of her maiden days i had expected nothing but now we had parted i thought that one last scene to break my heart on should not have been denied to me my aunt dorothy was a mute she wept when i spoke of janet whatever it was i said the minutes ran on from circumstance to circumstance of the destiny janet had marked for herself each one rounded in my mind of a blood colour like the edge about prismatic hues i lived through them a thousand times before they occurred as the wretch who fears death dies multitudinously some womanly fib preserved my father from a shock on leaving janets house she left it herself at the same time that she drove him to lady samplemans and i found him there soon after she had gone to her bridesmaids a letter was for me dear harry i shall not live at riversley never go there again do not let it be sold to a stranger it will happen unless you go there for the sake of the neighbourhood and poor people i cannot allow it to be shut up i was the cause of the chief misfortune you never blamed me let me think that the old place is not dead adieu your affectionate janet i tore the letter to pieces and kept them the aspect of the new intolerable world i was to live in after tomorrow paralyzed sensation my father chattered lady sampleman hushed him she said i might leave him to her and i went down to captain welsh to bid him goodbye and get such peace as contact with a man clad in armour proof against earthly calamity could give i was startled to see little kiomi in mabels company they had met accidentally at the head of the street and had been friends in childhood captain welsh said adding she hates men good reason when theyre beasts said kiomi amid much weeping of mabel and old mrs welsh kiomi showed as little trouble as the heath when the woods are swept captain welsh wanted mabel to be on board early owing he told me to information kiomi had offered to remain on board with her until the captain was able to come he had business to do in the city we saw them off from the waterside were i to leave that young woman behind me on shore i should be giving the devil warrant to seize upon his prey said captain welsh turning his gaze from the boat which conveyed kiomi and mabel to the barque priscilla he had information that the misleader of her youth was hunting her he and i parted and for ever at a corner of crossways in the central city there i saw the last of one who deemed it as simple a matter to renounce his savings for old age to rectify an error of justice as to plant his foot on the pavement a man whose only burden was the folly of men i thought to myself in despair under what protest can i also escape from england and my own intemperate mind it seemed a miraculous answerthere lay at my chambers a note written by count kesensky i went to the embassy and heard of an austrian ship of war being at one of our ports upon an expedition to the east and was introduced to the captain a gentlemanly fellow like most of the officers of his government finding in me a german scholar and a joyful willingness he engaged me to take the post of secretary to the expedition in the place of an invalided freiherr von redwitz the bargain was struck immediately i was to be ready to report myself to the captain on board not later than the following day count kesensky led me aside he regretted that he could do nothing better for me but i thought his friendliness extreme and astonishing and said so whereupon the count assured me that his intentions were good though he had not been of great use hithertoan allusion to the borough of chippenden he had only heard of von redwitzs illness that afternoon i thanked him cordially saying i was much in his debt and he bowed me out letting me fancy as my father had fancied before me and as though i had never observed and reflected in my life that the opportuneness of this intervention signified a special action of providence the flattery of the thought served for an elixir but with whom would my father abide during my absence captain bulsted and julia saved me from a fit of remorse they had come up to town on purpose to carry him home with them and had left a message on my table and an invitation to dinner at their hotel where the name of janet was the marino faliero of our review of riversley people and old times the captain and his wife were indignant at her conduct since however i chose to excuse it they said they would say nothing more about her and she was turned face to the wall i told them how janet had taken him for months but ill take him for years said julia the truth is harry my old dear william and i are never so unitedfor im ashamed to quarrel with himas when your fathers at bulsted he belongs to us and other people shall know youre not obliged to depend on your family for help and your aunt dorothy can come and see him whenever she likes that was settled captain bulsted went with me to lady samplemans to prepare my father for the change of nurse and residence we were informed that he had gone down with alderman duke saddlebank to dine at one of the great city companies halls i could hardly believe it ah my dear mr harry said lady sampleman old friends know one another best believe that now i treated him as if he was as well as ever he was gave him his turtle and madeira lunch and alderman saddlebank who lunched hereyour father used to say he looks like a robin hopping out of a larderquite jumped to dine him in the city like old times and he will see a great spread of plate she thought my father only moderately unwell wanting novelty captain bulsted agreed with me that it would be prudent to go and fetch him at the door of the city hall stood andrew saddlebank grown to be simply a larger edition of rippengers head boy and he imparted to us that my father was on his legs delivering a speech it alarmed me with saddlebanks assistance i pushed in a prince a treacherous lover an unfatherly man those were the words i caught a reproduction of many of my phrases employed in our arguments on this very subject he bade his audience to beware of princes beware of idle princes and letting his florid fancy loose on these eminent persons they were at one moment silver lamps at another poising hawks and again sprawling pumpkins anything except useful citizens how could they be they had the attraction of the lamp the appetite of the hawk the occupation of the pumpkin nothing was given them to do but to shine destroy and fatten their hands were kept empty a trifle in their heads would topple them over they were monuments of the english system of compromise happy for mankind if they were monuments only happy for them but they had the passions of men the adulation of the multitude was raised to inflate them whose selfrespect had not one prop to rest on unless it were contempt for the flatterers and prophetic foresight of their perfidy they were the monuments of a compromise between the past and terror of the future puppets as princes mannikins as men the snares of frail women stopgaps of the state feathered nonentities so far but not in epigram he marshalled the things he had heard to his sound of drum and trumpet like one repeating a lesson offhand steering on a sudden completely round he gave his audience an outline of the changes he would have effected had he but triumphed in his cause and now came the lashing of arms a flood of eloquence princes with brains princes leaders princes flowers of the land he had offered them princes that should sway assemblies and not stultify the precepts of a decent people by making you pay in the outrage of your morals for what you seem to gain in policy these or similar words the whole scene was too grotesque and afflicting but his command of his hearers was extraordinary partly a consolation i thought until having touched the arm of one of the gentlemen of the banquet and said i am his son i wish to remove him the reply enlightened me im afraid theres danger in interrupting him i really am they were listening obediently to one whom they dared not interrupt for fear of provoking an outburst of madness i had to risk it his dilated eyes looked ready to seize on me for an illustration i spoke peremptorily and he bowed his head low saying my son gentlemen and submitted himself to my hands the feasters showed immediately that they felt released by rising and chatting in groups alderman saddlebank expressed much gratitude to me for the service i had performed that first half of your fathers speech was the most pathetic thing i ever heard i had not shared his privilege and could not say the remark was current that a great deal was true of what had been said of the fitzs my father leaned heavily on my arm with the step and bent head of an ancient pensioner of the honourable city company he was julia bulsteds charge and i was on board the foreign vessel weighing anchor from england before dawn of janets marriageday chapter lvi conclusion the wind was high that morning the rain came in gray rings through which we worked on the fretted surface of crumbling seas heaving up and plunging without an outlook i remember having thought of the barque priscilla as i watched our lithe dalmatians slide along the drenched decks of the verona frigate at night it blew a gale i could imagine it to have been sent providentially to brush the torture of the land from my mind and make me feel that men are trifles what are their passions then the storm in the cloudseven more shortlived than the clouds i philosophized but my anguish was great janets goodbye harry ended everything i lived for and seemed to strike the day and bring out of it the remorseless rain a featureless day like those before the earth was built like night under an angry moon and each day the same until we touched the edge of a southern circle and saw light and i could use my brain the matter most present to me was my injustice regarding my poor fathers speech in the city hall he had caused me to suffer so much that i generally felt for myself when he appealed for sympathy or provoked some pity but i was past suffering and letting kindly recollection divest the speech of its verbiage i took it to my heart it was true that he had in his blind way struck the keynote of his position much as i myself had conceived it before harsh trials had made me think of my own fortunes more than of his this i felt and i thought there never had been so moving a speech it seemed to make the world in debt to us what else is so consolatory to a ruined man in reality the busy little creature within me whom we call self was digging pits for comfort to flow in of any kind in any form and it seized on every idea every circumstance to turn it to that purpose and with such success that when byandby i learnt how entirely inactive special providence had been in my affairs i had to collect myself before i could muster the conception of gratitude toward the noble woman who clothed me in the illusion it was to the princess ottilia acting through count kesensky that i owed both my wafting away from england at a wretched season and that chance of a career in parliament the captain of the verona hinted as much when after a year of voyaging we touched at an east indian seaport and von redwitz joined the vessel to resume the post i was occupying von redwitz the son of prince ernests chancellor i discovered could have told me more than he did but he handed me a letter from the princess calling me home urgently and even prescribing my route and bidding me come straight to germany and to sarkeld the summons was distasteful for i had settled into harness under my scientific superiors and had proved to my messmates that i was neither morose nor overconceited captain martinitz persuaded me to return and besides there lay between the lines of ottilias letter a signification of welcome things better guessed at than known was i not bound to do her bidding others had done it young von redwitz for instance in obeying the telegraph wires and feigning sickness to surrender his place to me when she wished to save me from misery by hurrying me to new scenes with a task for my hand and headno mean stretch of devotion on his part ottilia was still my princess she my providence she wrote come home my friend harry you have been absent too long he who intercepts you to displace you has his career before him in the vessel and you nearer home the home is always here where i am but it may now take root elsewhere and it is from ottilia you hear that delay is now really loss of life i tell you no more you know me that when i say come it is enough a simple adieu and her name ended the mysterious letter not a word of prince hermann what had happened i guessed at it curiously and incessantly and only knew the nature of my suspicion by ceasing to hope as soon as i seemed to have divined it i did not wrong my souls high mistress beyond the one flash of tentative apprehension which in perplexity struck at impossibilities ottilia would never have summoned me to herself but was janet free the hope which refused to live in that other atmosphere of purest calm sprang to full stature at the bare thought and would not be extinguished though all the winds beset it had my girls courage failed to spare her at the last moment i fancied it might be i was sure it was not so yet the doubt pressed on me with the force of a world of unimagined shifts and chances and just kept the little flame alive at times intoxicating me though commonly holding me back to watch its forlorn conflict with probabilities known too well it cost me a struggle to turn aside to germany from the italian highroad i chose the line of the brenner and stopped half a day at innsbruck to pay a visit to colonel heddon of whom i had the joyful tidings that two of his daughters were away to go through the german form of the betrothal of one of them to an englishman the turn of the tide had come to him and it comes to me too in a fresh spring tide whenever i have to speak of others instead of this everlastingly recurring i of the autobiographer of which the complacent penman has felt it to be his duty to expose the mechanism when out of action and which like so many of our sins of commission appears in the shape of a terrible offence when the occasion for continuing it draws to a close the pleasant narrator in the first person is the happy bubbling fool not the philosopher who has come to know himself and his relations toward the universe the words of this last are one to twenty his mind is bent upon the causes of events rather than their progress as you see me on the page now i stand somewhere between the two approximating to the former but with sufficient of the latter within me to tame the delightful expansiveness proper to that coming hour of marriagebells and bridalwreaths it is a sign that the end and the delivery of reader and writer alike should not be dallied with the princess had invited lucy heddon to sarkeld to meet temple and temple to meet me onward i flew i saw the old woods of the lakepalace and as it were the light of my past passion waning above them i was greeted by the lady of all nobility with her gracious warmth and in his usual abrupt manful fashion by prince hermann and i had no time to reflect on the strangeness of my stepping freely under the roof where a husband claimed ottilia before she led me into the library where sat my lost and recovered my darling and unlike herself for a moment she faltered in rising and breathing my name we were alone i knew she was no bondwoman the question how it had come to pass lurked behind everything i said and did speculation on the visible features and touching of the unfettered hand restrained me from uttering or caring to utter it but it was wonderful it thrust me back on providence again for the explanationhumbly this time it was wonderful and blessed as to loving eyes the firstdrawn breath of a drowned creature restored to life i kissed her hand wait till you have heard everything harry she said and her voice was deeper softer exquisitely strange in its known tones as her manner was and her eyes she was not the blooming straightshouldered highbreathing girl of other days but sister to the day of her goodbye harry pale and worn the eyes had wept this was janet haply widowed she wore no garb nor a shade of widowhood perhaps she had thrown it off not to offend an implacable temper in me i said i shall hear nothing that can make you other than my own janetif you will she smiled a little we expected temples arrival sooner than yours harry do you take to his lucy yes thoroughly the perfect ring of janet was there mention of riversley made her conversation lively and she gave me moderately good news of my father quaint out of julia bulsteds latest letter to her then how long i asked astonished how long have you been staying with the princess she answered colouring so long that i can speak fairish german and read it easily i have actually taken to reading harry her courage must have quailed and she must have been looking for me on that morning of miserable aspect when i beheld the last of england through wailful showers like the scene of a burial i did not speak of it fearing to hurt her pride but said have you been heremonths yes some months she replied many yes she said and dropped her eyelids and then with a quick look at me wait for temple harry he is a day behind his time we cant account for it i suggested half in play that perhaps he had decided for the sake of a sea voyage to come by our old route to germany on board the barque priscilla with captain welsh a faint shudder passed over her she shut her eyes and shook her head our interview satisfied my hearts hunger no further the veronas erratic voyage had cut me off from letters janet might be a widow for aught i knew she was always janet to me but why at liberty why many months at sarkeld the guest of the princess was she neither maid nor widowa wife flown from a brutal husband or separated and forcibly free under such conditions ottilia would not have commanded my return but what was i to imagine a boiling couple of hours divided me from the time for dressing when as i meditated i could put a chance question or two to the man commissioned to wait on me and hear whether the english lady was a frulein the margravine and prince ernest were absent hermann worked in his museum displaying his treasures to colonel heddon i sat with the ladies in the airy lookout tower of the lakepalace a prey to intense speculations which devoured themselves and changed from fire to smoke while i recounted the adventures of our ships voyage and they behaved as if there were nothing to tell me in turn each a sphinx holding the secret i thirsted for i should not certainly have thirsted much if janet had met me as far halfway as a delicate woman may advance the mystery lay in her evident affection her apparent freedom and unfathomable reserve and her desire that i should see temple before she threw off her feminine armour to which judging by the indications ottilia seemed to me to accede my old friend was spied first by his sweetheart lucy winding dilatorily over the hill away from sarkeld in one of the carriages sent to meet him he was guilty of wasting a prodigious number of minutes with his trumpery how dye dos and his glances and excuses and then i had him up in my room and the tale was told it was not temples fault if he did not begin straightforwardly i plucked him from his narrators vexatious and inevitable commencement temple tell me did she go to the altar he answered yes she did then shes a widow no she isnt said temple distracting me by submitting to the lead i distracted him by taking then her husbands alive temple denied it and a devil seized him to perceive some comicality in the dialogue was she married temple said no with a lurking drollery about his lips he added its nothing to laugh over richie am i laughing speak out did edbury come to grief overnight in any way again temple pronounced a negative this time wilfully enigmatical he confessed it and accused me of the provocation he dashed some laughter with gravity to prepare for my next assault was edbury the one to throw up the marriage did he decline it no was the answer once more temple stopped my wrath by catching at me and begging me to listen edbury was drowned richie overnight no not overnight i can tell it all in halfadozen words if youll be quiet and i know youre going to be as happy as i am or i shouldnt trifle an instant he went overnight on board the barque priscilla to see mabel sweetwinter the only woman he ever could have cared for and he went the voyage just as we did he was trapped caged and transported its a repetition except that the poor old priscilla never came to land she foundered in a storm in the north sea thats all we know every soul perished the captain and all i knew how it would be with that crew of his some day or other dont you remember my saying the priscilla was the kind of name of a vessel that would go down with all hands and leave a bottle to float to shore a ginbottle was found on our east coastthe old captain must have discovered in the last few moments that such things were on boardand in it there was a paper and the passengers and crews names in his handwriting written as if he had been sitting in his parlour at home over them a linethe lords will is about to be done and underneathwe go to his judgement resigned and cheerful you know the old captain richie temple had tears in his eyes we both stood blinking for a second or two i could not but be curious to hear the reason for edburys having determined to sail dont you understand how it was richie said temple edbury went to persuade her to stay or just to see her for once and he came to persuasions he seems to have been succeeding but the captain stepped on board and he treated edbury as he did us two he made him take the voyage for disciplines sake and his souls health how do you know all this temple you know your friend kiomi was one of the party the captain sent her back on shore because he had no room for her she told us edbury offered bribes of hundreds and thousands for the captain to let him and mabel go off in the boat with kiomi and then he took to begging to go alone he tried to rouse the crew the poor fellow cringed she says he threatened to swim off the captain locked him up my immediate reflections hit on the bible lessons edbury must have had to swallow and the gaping of the waters when its truths were suddenly and tremendously brought home to him an odd series of accidents i thought temple continued heriot held his tongue about it next morning he was one of the guests though he had sworn he wouldnt go he said something to janet that betrayed him for she had not seen him since how betrayed him said i why said temple of course it was heriot who put edbury in kiomis hands edbury wouldnt have known of mabels sailing or known the vessel she was in without her help she led him down to the water and posted him in sight before she went to captain welshs and when you and captain welsh walked away edbury rowed to the priscilla old heriot is not responsible for the consequences what he supposed was likely enough he thought that edbury and mabel were much of a pair and thought i suppose that if edbury saw her hed find he couldnt leave her and old lady kane who managed him would stand nodding her plumes for nothing at the altar and so she did and a pretty scene it was she snatched at the minutes as they slipped past twelve like fishes and snarled at the parson and would have kept him standing till one pm if janet had not turned on her heel the old woman got in front of her to block her way ah temple she said to me it would be hard if i could not think i had done all that was due to them i didnt see her again till she was starting for germany and richie she thinks you can never forgive her she wrote me word that the princess is of another mind but her own opinion she says is based upon knowing you good heaven how little cried i temple did me a further wrong by almost thanking me on janets behalf for my sustained love for her while he praised the very qualities of pride and a spirited sense of obligation which had reduced her to dread my unforgivingness yet he and janet had known me longest supposing that my idea of myself differed from theirs for the simple reason that i thought of what i had grown to be and they of what i had been through the previous years did i judge by the flower and they by root and stem but the flower is a thing of the season the flower drops off it may be a different development next year did they not therefore judge me soundly ottilia was the keenest reader ottilia had divined what could be wrought out of me i was still subject to the relapses of a not perfectly right nature as i perceived when glancing back at my thought of an odd series of accidents which was but a disguised fashion of attributing to providence the particular concern in my fortunes an impiety and a folly this is the temptation of those who are rescued and made happy by circumstances the wretched think themselves spited and are merely childish not egregious in egoism thither on leads to a chapteralready written by the wise doubtless it does not become an atom of humanity to dwell on it beyond a point where students of the human condition may see him passing through the experiences of the flesh and the brain meantime temple and i at two handbasins soaped and towelled and i was more discreet toward him than i have been to you for i reserved from him altogether the pronunciation of the council of senators in the secret chamber of my head whether indeed i have fairly painted the outer part of myself waxes dubious when i think of his spluttering laugh and shout richie you havent changed a bityoure just like a boy certain indications of external gravity and a sinking of the natural springs within characterized temples approach to the responsible position of a british husband and father we talked much of captain welsh and the sedate practical irony of his imprisoning one like edbury to discipline him on high seas as well as the singular situation of the couple of culprits under his admonishing regimen and the tragic end my next two minutes alone with janet were tempered by it only my eagerness for another term of privacy persuaded her that i was her lover instead of judge and then having made the discovery that a singleminded gladness animated me in the hope that she and i would travel together one in body and soul she surrendered with her last bit of pride broken except it may be a fragment of reserve traceable in the confession that came quaintly after supreme selfblame when she said she was bound to tell me that possiblyprobably were the trial to come over again she should again act as she had done happily for us both my wits had been sharpened enough to know that there is more in men and women than the stuff they utter and blessed privilege now if the lips were guilty of nonsense i might stop them besides i was soon to be master upon such questions she admitted it admitting with an unwonted emotional shiver that absolute freedom could be the worst of perils for women said i she preferred to say for girls and then yes for women as they are educated at present spice of the princesss conversation flavoured her speech the signs unfamiliar about her for me were marks of the fire she had come out of the struggle the torture the determined sacrifice through prides conception of duty she was iron once she had come out of the fire finest steel riversley harry she murmured and my smile and word and squeeze in reply brought back a whole gleam of the fresh english morning she had been in face and voice and person was it conceivable that we could go back to riversley single before that was answered she had to make a statement and in doing it she blushed because it involved edburys name and seemed to involve her attachment to him but she paid me the compliment of speaking it frankly it was that she had felt herself bound in honour to pay edburys debts even by such slight means as her saying riversley harry and my kiss of her fingers when a question of money was in debate did we burst aside the vestiges of mutual strangeness and recognize one another but with an added warmth of love when i pleaded for the marriage to be soon she said i wish it harry sentiment you do not obtain from a damascus blade she most cordially despised the ladies who parade and play on their sex and are for ever acting according to the feminine standarda dangerous stretch of contempt for one less strong than she riding behind her and temple one day with the princess i said what takes you most in janet she replied her courage and it is of a kind that may knot up every other virtue worth having i have impulses and am capable of desperation but i have no true courage so i envy and admire even if i have to blame her for i know that this possession of hers which identifies her and marks her from the rest of us would bear the ordeal of fire i can imagine the qualities i have most pride in withering and decaying under a prolonged trial i cannot conceive her courage failing perhaps because i have it not myself i think it the rarest of precious gifts it seems to me to imply one half and to dispense with the other i have lived to think that ottilia was right as nearly right too in the wording of her opinion as one may be in three or four sentences designed to be comprehensive my janets readiness to meet calamity was shown ere we reached home upon an evening of the late autumn and set eye on a scene for her the very saddest that could have been devised to test her spirit of endurance when driving up the higher heathland we saw the dark sky ominously reddened over riversley and mounting the ridge had the funeral flames of the old grange dashed in our faces the blow was evil sudden unaccountable villagers tenants farmlabourers groups of a deputation that had gone to the railway station to give us welcome and returned owing to a delay in our arrival stood gazing from all quarters the grange was burning in two great wings that soared in flametips and columns of crimson smoke leaving the central hall and chambers untouched as yet but alive inside with mysterious ranges of lights now curtained now made barea feeble contrast to the savage blaze to right and left save for the wonder aroused as to its significance these were soon cloaked dead sable reigned in them and at once a jet of flame gave the whole vast building to destruction my wife thrust her hand in mine fire at the heart fire at the wingsour old home stood in that majesty of horror which freezes the limbs of men bidding them look and no more what has riversley done to deserve this i heard janet murmur to herself his room she said when at the southeast wing where my old grandfather had slept there burst a glut of flame we dove down to the park and along the carriageroad to the first red line of gazers they told us that no living creatures were in the house my aunt dorothy was at bulsted i perceived my fathers man tollingby among the servants and called him to me others came and out of a clatter of tongues and all eyes fearfully askant at the wall of fire we gathered that a great reception had been prepared for us by my father lamps lights in all the rooms torches in the hall illuminations along the windows stores of fireworks such a display as only he could have dreamed of the fire had broken out at dusk from an explosion of fireworks at one wing and some inexplicable mismanagement at the other but the house must have been like a mine what with the powder the torches the devices in paper and muslin and the extraordinary decorations fitted up to celebrate our return in harmony with my fathers fancy gentlemen on horseback dashed up to us captain bulsted seized my hand he was hot from a ride to fetch engines and sang sharp in my ear have you got him it was my father he meant the cry rose for my father and the groups were agitated and split and the name of the missing man without an answer to it shouted captain bulsted had left him bravely attempting to quench the flames after the explosion of fireworks he rode about interrogating the frightened servants and grooms holding horses and dogs they could tell us that the cattle were safe not a word of my father and amid shrieks of women at fresh falls of timber and ceiling into the pit of fire and warnings from the men we ran the heated circle of the building to find a loophole and offer aid if a living soul should be left the night around us bright as day busier than day and a human now added to elemental horror janet would not quit her place she sent her carriagehorses to bulsted and sat in the carriage to see the last of burning riversley each time that i came to her she folded her arms on my neck and kissed me silently we gathered from the subsequent testimony of men and women of the household who had collected their wits that my father must have remained in the doomed old house to look to the safety of my aunt dorothy he was never seen again
