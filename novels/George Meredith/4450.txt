the adventures of harry richmond by george meredith book xlv within an inch of my life xlvi among gipsy women xlvii my father acts the charmer again xlviii the princess entrapped xlix which foreshadows a general gathering l we are all in my fathers net li an encounter showing my fathers genius in a strong light chapter xlv within an inch of my life a single tent stood in a gully running from one of the gravelpits of the heath near an ironred rillet and a girl of kiomis tribe leaned over the lazy water at half length striking it with her handkerchief at a distance of about twice a stonesthrow from the new carriageroad between durstan and bulsted i fancied from old recollections she might be kiomi herself this was not the time for her people to be camping on durstan besides i feared it improbable that one would find her in any of the tracks of her people the noise of the wheels brought the girls face round to me she was one of those who were babies in the tents when i was a boy we were too far apart for me to read her features i lay back in the carriage thinking that it would have been better for my poor little wild friend if i had never crossed the shadow of her tents a life caught out of its natural circle is as much in danger of being lost as a limb given to a wheel in spinning machinery so it occurred to me until i reflected that prince ernest might make the same remark and deplore the damage done to the superior machinery likewise my movements appeared to interest the girl she was up on a mound of the fastpurpling heath shading her eyes to watch me when i called at bulsted lodgegates to ask for a bed under julias roof that night her bare legs twinkled in a nimble pace on the way to durstan hall as if she was determined to keep me in sight i waved my hand to her she stopped a gipsys girls figure is often as good an index to her mind as her face and i perceived that she had not taken my greeting favourably nor would she advance a step to my repeated beckonings i tried hat handkerchief purse in vain my driver observed that she was taken with a fit of the obstinacy of her lot he shouted silver and then fortune she stood looking the fellow discoursed on the nature of gipsies foxes were kept for hunting he said there was reason in that why we kept gipsies none could tell he once backed a gipsy prizefighter who failed to keep his appointment heart sunk too low below his belt sir you cant reckon on them for performances and that same man afterwards fought the gamest fight in the chronicles o the ring i knew he had it in him but theyre like nothing better than the weather you cant put money on em and feel safe consequently he saw no good in them she sticks to her post he said as we turned into the durstan grounds the girl was like a flagstaff on the upper line of heathland heriot was strolling cigar in mouth down one of the diminutive alleys of young fir in this upstart estate he affected to be prepossessed by the case between me and edbury and would say nothing of his own affairs save that he meant to try for service in one of the continental armies he whose susceptible love for his country was almost a malady but he had given himself to women it was cissy this trichy that and the wiles of a florence the spites of an agatha duperies innocentseemings witcheries reptiletricks of the fairest of women all through his conversation he had so saturated himself with the resources evasions and desperate cruising of these light creatures of wind tide and tempest that like one who has been gazing on the whirligoround he saw the whole of women running or only waiting for a suitable partner to run the giddy ring to perdition and an atoning pathos i cut short one of heriots narratives by telling him that this picking bones of the dish was not to my taste he twitted me with turning parson i spoke of kiomi heriot flushed muttering the little devil with his usual contemplative relish of devilry we parted feeling that severe tension of the old links keeping us together which indicates the lack of new ones a point where simple affection must bear the strain of friendship if it can heriot had promised to walk halfway with me to bulsted in spite of lady marias childish fears of some attack on him he was now satisfied with a goodbye at the halldoors and he talked ostentatiously of a method that he had to bring edbury up to the mark i knew that same loud decreeing talk to be a method on his own behalf of concealing his sensitive resentment at the tone i had adopted lady marias carriage had gone to fetch her husband from a political dinner my portmanteau advised me to wait for its return durstan and riversley were at feud however owing to some powerful rude english used toward the proprietor of the former place by the squire so i thought it better to let one of the grooms shoulder my luggage and follow him the night was dark he chose the roadway and i crossed the heath meeting an exhilarating high wind that made my blood race egoism is not peculiar to any period of life it is only especially curious in a young man beginning to match himself against his elders for in him it suffuses the imagination he is not merely selfishly sentient or selfishly scheming his very conceptions are selfish i remember walking at my swiftest pace blaming everybody i knew for insufficiency for want of subordination to my interests for poverty of nature grossness blindness to the fine lights shining in me i blamed the fates for harassing me circumstances for not surrounding me with friends worthy of me the central i resembled the sun of this universe with the difference that it shrieked for nourishment instead of dispensing it my monstrous conceit of elevation will not suffer condensation into sentences what i can testify to is that for making you bless the legs you stand on a knockdown blow is a specific i had it before i knew that a hand was up i should have fancied that i had run athwart a tree but for the recollection as i was reeling to the ground of a hulk of a fellow suddenly fronting me and he did not hesitate with his fist i went over and over into a heathery hollow the wind sang shrill through the furzes nothing was visible but black clumps black cloud astonished though i was and shaken it flashed through me that this was not the attack of a highwayman he calls upon you to stand and deliver it is a foe that hits without warning the blow took me on the forehead and might have been worse not seeing the enemy curiosity was almost as strong in me as anger but reflecting that i had injured no one i knew of my nerves were quickly at the right pitch brushing some spikes of furze off my hands i prepared for it a cry rose my impression seemed to be all backward travelling up to me a moment or two behind time i recognised a strange tongue in the cry but too late that it was romany to answer it instantly a voice was audible above the noisy wind i spot him then began some good and fair fighting i got my footing on grass and liked the work the fellow facing me was unmistakably gipsy build i too had length of arm and a disposition to use it by hitting straight out with footing firm instead of dodging and capering which told in my favour and is decidedly the best display of the noble art on a dark night my dancer went over as neatly as i had preceded him and therewith i considered enough was done for vengeance the thrill of a salmon on the gut is known to give a savage satisfaction to our original nature it is but an extension and attenuation of the hearty contentment springing from a thorough delivery of the fist upon the prominent features of an assailant that yields to it perforce even when you receive such perfect blows you are half satisfied feeling conqueror my wrath was soothed i bent to have a look at my ruffian and ask him what cause of complaint gipsies camping on durstan could find against riversley a sharp stroke on the side of my neck sent me across his body he bit viciously in pain and desperation i flew at another of the tawny devils they multiplied i took to my heels but this was the vainest of stratagems they beat me in nimbleness four of them were round me when i wheeled breathless to take my chance at fighting the odds fiery men have not much notion of chivalry gipsies the least of all they yelled disdain of my summons to them to come on one by one now they had caught me now they would pay me now they would pound me and standing at four corners they commended me to think of becoming a jelly four though they were they kept their positions they left it to me to rush in for a close the hinder ones held out of arms reach so long as i was disengaged i had perpetually to shift my front thinkingoh for a stick any stout bit of timber my fists ached and a repetition of nasty dull knocks on back and neck slogging thumps dealt by men getting to make sure of me shattered my breathing i cried out for a pause offered to take a couple of them at a time i challenged threethe fourth to bide i was now the dancer left right and roundabout i had to swing halfstunned halfstrangled with gorge those terrible blows in the back did the mischief sickness threatened to undermine me boxers have breathingtime i had none stiff and sick i tried to run i tottered i stood to be knocked down i dropped like a logcareless of life but i smelt earth keenly and the damp grass and the devils play of their feet on my chin chest and thighs revived a fit of wrath enough to set me staggering on my legs again they permitted it for the purpose of battering me further i passed from down to up mechanically and enjoyed the chestful of air given me in the interval of rising thought of germany and my father and janet at her window complacently raised a childs voice in my throat for mercy quite inaudible and accepted my punishment one idea i had was that i could not possibly fail as a speaker after thisi wanted but a minutes grace to fetch breath for an oration beginning you fools for i guessed that they had fallen upon the wrong man not a second was allowed soon the shrewd physical bracing acting momentarily on my brain relaxed the fitful illumination ceased all ideas faded outclung about my beaten bodyfled the body might have been tossed into its grave for aught i knew chapter xlvi among gipsy women i cannot say how long it was after my senses had gone when i began to grope for them on the warmest of heaving soft pillows and lost the slight hold i had on them with the effort then came a series of climbings and fallings risings to the surface and sinkings fathoms below any attempt to speculate pitched me back into darkness gifted with a pair of enormous eyes which threw surrounding objects to a distance of a mile away i could not induce the diminutive things to approach and shutting eyes led to such a rolling of mountains in my brain that terrified by the gigantic revolution i lay determinedly staring clothed it seemed positive in a tightfitting suit of sheet lead but why i wondered why and immediately received an extinguishing blow my pillow was heavenly i was constantly being cooled on it and grew used to hear a croon no more musical than the unstopped reed above my head a sound as of a breeze about a caverns mouth more soothing than a melody conjecture of my state after hovering timidly in dread of relapses settled and assured me i was lying baked halfburied in an old riverbed moss at my cheek my body inextricable water now and then feebly striving to float me out with horrid pain with infinite refreshingness a shady light like the light through leafage i could see the water i felt why did it keep trying to move me i questioned and sank to the depths again the excruciated patient was having his wet bandages folded across his bruises and could not bear a motion of the mind the minds total apathy was the sign of recovering health kind nature put that district to sleep while she operated on the disquieted lower functions i looked on my later self as one observes the mossy bearded substances travelling blind along the undercurrent of the stream clinging to this and that twirling absurdly where was i not in a house but for my condition of absolute calm owing to skilful treatment open air and physical robustness the scene would have been of a kind to scatter the busy little workmen setting up the fabric of my wits a lighted oilcup stood on a tripod in the middle of a tentroof and over it the creased neck and chin of a tall old woman splendid in age reddened vividly her black eyes and grey brows and greyishblack hair fell away in a dusk of their own i thought her marvellous something she held in her hands that sent a thin steam between her and the light outside in the a cutting of the tents threshold a heavycoloured sunset hung upon dark land my pillow meantime lifted me gently at a regular measure and it was with untroubled wonder that i came to the knowledge of a human heart beating within it so soft could only be feminine so firm still young the bosom was kiomis a girl sidled at the opening of the tent peeping in and from a mufed rattle of subpectoral thunder discharged at her in quick heated snaps i knew kiomis voice after an altercation of their monotonous gipsy undertones the girl dropped and crouched outside it was morning when i woke next stronger and aching worse i was lying in the air and she who served for nurse pillow parasol and bank of herbage had her arms round beneath mine cherishingly all the fingers outspread and flat on me just as they had been when i went to sleep kiomi now you be quiet can i stand up a minute or two no and you wont talk i submitted this was our duel all day she slipped from me only twice and when she did the girl took her place i began to think of bulsted and riversley kiomi how long have i been here you ll be twice as long as youve been a couple of days more like a dozen just tell me what happened ghmmm she growled admonishingly reflecting on it i felt sure there must have been searching parties over the heath kiomi i say how was it they missed me she struck at once on my thought theyre fools how did you cheat them i didnt tie a handkercher across their eyes you half smothered me once in the combe you go to sleep have you been doctor the growling tigerish ghmmm constrained me to take it for a lullaby kiomi why the deuce did your people attack me she repeated the sound resembling that which sometimes issues from the vent of a mine but i insisted upon her answering i ll put you down and be off she threatened brute of a girl i hate you hate away tell me who found me i shant you shut your peepers the other and younger girl sung out i found you kiomi sent a volley at her i did said the girl yes and i nursed you first i did and mother doctored you kiomi hasnt been here a day the old mother came out of the tent she felt my pulse and forthwith squatted in front of me youre hard to kill and oily as a bean said she youve only to lie quiet in the sun like a handsome gentleman im sure you couldnt wish for more air and waters the doctor for such as you youve got the bound in you to jump the ditch dont you fret at it or youll lose your spring my good gentleman leave off talking to me as a stranger i bawled out with it why have you kept me here why did your men pitch into me our men my good gentleman the old woman ejaculated there was innocence indeed sufficient to pass the whole tribe before a bench of magistrates she wheedled what have they against a handsome gentleman like you theyd run for you fifty mile a day and show you all their tricks and secrets for nothing my despot kiomi fired invectives at her mother the old mother retorted the girl joined in all three were scowling flashing showing teeth driving the wordy javelin upon one another indiscriminately or two to one without a pause all to a sound like the slack silver string of the fiddle i sang out truce to them they racked me with laughter and such laughterthe shaking of husks in a halfempty sack ultimately on a sudden cessation of the storm of tongues they agreed that i must have my broth sheer weariness seasoned with some hope that the broth would give me strength to mount on my legs and walk persuaded me to drink it still the old mother declared that none of her men would ever have laid hands on me why should they she asked what had i done to them was it their way kiomis arms tightened over my breast the involuntary pressure was like an illumination to me no longer asking for the grounds of the attack on a mistaken person and bowing to the fiction that none of the tribe had been among my assailants i obtained information the girl eveleen had spied me entering durstan quite by chance she was concealed near bulsted park gates when the groom arrived and told the lodgekeeper that mr harry richmond was coming up over the heath and might have lost his way richmond the girl threw a world of meaning into the unexpected name kiomi clutched me to her bosom but no one breathed the name we had in our thoughts eveleen and the old mother had searched for me upon the heath and having haled me head and foot to their tent despatched a message to bring kiomi down from london to aid them in their desperate shift they knew squire belthams temper he would have scattered the tribe to the shores of the kingdom at a rumour of foul play to his grandson kiomi came in time to smuggle me through an inspection of the tent and crossexamination of its ostensible denizens by captain bulsted who had no suspicions though he was in a state of wonderment hearing all this i was the first to say it would be better i should get out of the neighbourhood as soon as my legs should support me the grin that goes for a laugh among gipsies followed my question of how kiomi had managed to smuggle me eveleen was my informant when the dreaded kiomi happened to be off duty for a minute by a hasty transformation due to a nightcap on the bandages about the head and an old petticoat over my feet captain williams insensible friend was introduced to him as the sore sick greatgrandmother of the tribe mother of kiomis mother aged ninetyone the captain paid like a man for doctor and burial fees he undertook also to send the old lady a pound of snuff to assist her to a last sneeze or two on the right side of the grave and he kept his word for deeming it necessary to paint her in a characteristic these prodigious serpents told him gravely that she delighted in snuff it was almost the only thing that kept her alive barring a sip of broth captain williams comment on the interesting piece of longevity whose wellcovered length and framework lay exposed to his respectful contemplation was that she must have been a devilish fine old lady in her day six foot was given as her measurement one pound of snuff a bottle of rum and five sovereigns were the fruits of the captains sensibility i shattered my ribs with laughter over the story eveleen dwelt on the triumph twinkling kiomi despised laughter or triumph resulting from the natural exercise of craft in an emergency but my handsome gentleman he wont tell on us will he when weve nursed him and doctored him and made him one of us and as good a stick o timber as grows in the forest whined the old mother i had to swear i would not he cried kiomi he may forget us when hes gone the mother said she would have liked me to kiss a book to seal the oath anxiety about the safety of their homes that is the assurance of an untroubled reception upon their customary campingground is a peculiarity of the gipsies distinguishing them equally with their cleanliness and thriftiness from mumpers and the common wanderers it is their tribute to civilization which generally keeps them within the laws who that does not know them will believe that under their domestic system i had the best broth and the best tea i have ever tasted they are very cunning brewers and sagacious buyers too their maxims show them to direct all their acuteness upon obtaining quality for their money a compliment not backed by silver is hardly intelligible to the pretty ones money is a really credible thing to them and when they have it they know how to use it apparently because they know so well so perfectly appreciating it they have only vague ideas of a corresponding sentiment on the opposite side to the bargain and imagine that they fool people much more often than they succeed in doing once duped themselves they are the wariest of the dogburnt the place is notched where it occurred and for ever avoided on the other hand they repose implicit faith in a reputation vouched for by their experience i was amused by the girl eveleens dotting of houses over the breadth of five counties where for this and that article of apparel she designed to expend portions of a golden guinea confident that she would get the very best and a shilling besides the unwonted coin gave her the joy of supposing she cheated the mint of that sum this guinea was a present to the girl to whom i owed my thrashing by the way that excused itself under cover of being a bribe for sight of a mirror interdicted by the implacable kiomi i wanted to have a look at my face now that the familiar scenes were beginning to wear their original features to me my dread of personal hideousness was distressing though eveleen declared the bad blood in my cheeks and eyes had been sucked by pounds of red meat i wondered whether if i stood up and walked to either one of the three great halls lying in an obtuse triangle within view i should easily be recognized when i did see myself i groaned verily with the silence of profound resignation i handed back to eveleen the curious fragment of her boudoir which would have grimaced at helen of troy youre feeling your noseyouve been looking at a glass kiomi said with supernatural swiftness of deduction on her return she added for my comfort that nothing was broken but confessed me to be still a sight and thereupon drove knotty language at eveleen the girl retorted and though these two would never acknowledge to me that any of their men had been in this neighbourhood recently the fact was treated as a matter of course in their spiteful altercation and each saddled the other with the mistake they had committed eveleen snatched the last word what she said i did not comprehend she must have hit hard kiomis eyes lightened and her lips twitched she coloured like the roofing smoke of the tent fire twice she showed her teeth as in a spasm struck to the heart unable to speak breathing in and out of a bitterly disjoined mouth eveleen ran i guessed at the illword spoken kiomi sat eyeing the woodashes a devouring gaze that shot straight and read but one thing they who have seen wild creatures die will have her before them saving the fiery eyes she became an ashen colour i took her little hand unconscious of me her brown fingers clutching at mine she flung up her nostrils craving air this was the picture of the woman who could not weep in her misery kiomi old friend i called to her i could have cursed that other friend the son of mischief for she i could have sworn had been fiercely and wantonly hunted chastity of nature intense personal pride were as proper to her as the free winds are to the heaths they were as visible to dull divination as the milky blue about the iris of her eyeballs she had actually no animal vileness animal though she might be termed and would have appeared if compared with heriots admirable cissies and gwennies and other ladies of the graces that run to fall and spend their pains more in kindling the scent of the huntsman than in effectively flying there was no consolation for her the girl eveleen came in sight loitering and looking kicking her idle heels kiomi turned sharp round to me im going your fathers here up at bulsted ill see him he wont tell hell come soon youll be fit to walk in a day youre sound as a nail goodbyei shant say goodbye twice she answered my attempt to keep her and passed into the tent out of which she brought a small bundle tied in a yellow handkerchief and walked away without nodding or speaking what was that you said to kiomi i questioned eveleen who was quickly beside me she replied accurately or not i told her our mend give her as good as she gave me let her wait and see therewith she pouted or to sketch her with precision snouted would better convey the vivacity of her ugly flash of features it was an error in me to think her heartless she talked of her aunt kiomi affectionately for a gipsy girl whose modulated tones are all addressed to the soft public eveleen spoke with the pride of bated breath of the ferocious unforgivingness of their men perhaps if she had known that i traced the good repute of the tribes for purity to the sweeter instincts of the women she would have eulogized her sex to amuse me gipsy girls like other people are fond of showing off but it would have been a victory of education to have helped her to feel the distinction of the feminine sense of shame half as awfully and warmly as she did the inscrutable iron despotism of the males she hinted that the mistake of which i had been the victim would be rectified tell your men ill hunt them down like rats if i hear of it said i while we were conversing my father arrived eveleen not knowing him would have had me accept the friendly covering of a mat here s a big one hes a clergyman she muttered to herself and ran to him and set up a gipsy whine fronting me up to the last step while she advanced she only yielded ground to my outcry my father bent over me kiomi had prepared him for what he saw i quieted his alarm by talking currently and easily julia bulsted had despatched a messenger to inform him of my mysterious disappearance but he as his way was revelling in large conjectures had half imagined me seized by a gust of passion and bound for germany without my luggage i laughed ay without your luggage richie he answered seriously his conceit of a better knowledge of me than others possessed had buoyed him up for i knew he said we two do nothing like the herd of men i thought you were off to her my boy now he looked at me and this look of dismay was a perfect mirror i was not a presentable object he stretched his limbs on the heather and kept hold of my hand looking and talking watchfully doctorlike doubting me to be as sound in body as i assured him i was despite aches and pains eveleen hung near these people have been kind to you he said no the biggest brutes on the earth said i oh you say that when i spotted you out in the dark where you might have lied to be eaten and carried you and washed your bloody face and watched you and never slept i didnt to mother you and wet your head cried the girl my father beckoned to her and thanked her appreciably in the yellow tongue so these scoundrels of the high road fell upon you and robbed you richie i nodded you let him think they robbed you and you had your purse to give me a gold guinea out of it eveleen cried and finding herself in the wrong track volubly resumed that they didnt for they hadnt time whether they meant to and the night black as a coal whoever they were the mystery of my not having sent word to bulsted or to riversley perplexed my father comfortable here he echoed me disconsolately and glanced at the heath the tent the black circle of the brothpot and the wild girl chapter xlvii my father acts the charmer again kiomis mother was seen in a turn of the gravelcutting bearing purchases from durstan village she took the new circumstances in with a single cast up of her wary eyelids and her and her skill in surgery and art in medicine i praised to lull her fears which procured me the denomination of old friend as well as handsome gentleman she went so far as to add in a fit of natural warmth nice fellow and it is the truth that this term effected wonders in flattering me it seemed to reveal to me how simple it was for harry richmond one whom gipsies could think a nice fellow to be the lord of janets affectionsto be her husband my heart throbbed yet she was within range of a mile and a half and i did not wish to be taken to her i did wish to smell the piney air about the lakepalace but the thought of ottilia caused me no quick pulsations my father remained an hour he could not perceive the drift of my objection to go either to bulsted or to riversley and desire that my misadventure should be unknown at those places however he obeyed me as i could always trust him to do scrupulously and told a tale at bulsted in the afternoon he returned in a carriage to convey me to the seaside when i was raised i fainted and saw the last of the camp on durstan much as i had come to it first sickness and swimming of the head continued for several days i was persecuted with the sensation of the carriage journey and an iteration of my fathers that ran my sons inanimate body in my arms or clasping the lifeless body of my sole son harry richmond and other variations i said nothing about it he told me aghast that i had spat blood a battery of eight fists having it in the end all its own way leaves a deeper indentation on its target than a pistolshot that passes free of the vital chords my convalescence in germany was a melody compared with this i ought to have stopped in the tent according to the wise old mothers advice given sincerely for prudence counselled her to strike her canvas and be gone there i should have lain interested in the progress of a bee the course of a beetle or a cloud a spiders business and the shaking of the gorse and the heather until good health had grown out of thoughtlessness the very sight of my father was as a hive of humming troubles his intense anxiety about me reflected in my mind the endless worry i had concerning him it was the intellect which condemned him when he wore a joyful air and the sensations when he waxed oversolicitous whether or not the sentences were just the judges should have sometimes shifted places i was unable to divine why he fevered me so much must i say ithe had ceased to entertain me instead of a comic i found him a tragic spectacle and his exuberant anticipations his bursting hopes that fed their forcingbed with the blight and decay of their predecessors his transient fits of despair after a touch at my pulses and exclamation of oh richie richie if only i had my boy up and wellassuming that nothing but my tardy recovery stood in the way of our contentmentwere examples of downright unreason such as contemplation through the comic glass would have excused the tragic could not i knew nevertheless that to the rest of the world he was a progressive comedy and the knowledge made him seem more tragic still he clearly could not learn from misfortune he was not to be contained money i gave him freely holding the money at my disposal his own i chafed at his unteachable spirit surely one of the most tragical things in life and the proof of my love for him was that i thought it so though i should have been kinder had he amused me as in the old days conceive to yourself the keeping watch over a fountain choked in its spouting incessantly labouring to spin a jet into the air now for a moment glittering and towering in a column and once more straining to mount my father appeared to me in that and other images he would have had me believe him shooting to his zenith victorious at last i likewise was to reap a victory of the highest kind from the attack of the mysterious ruffians so much he said he thought he could assure me of he chattered of an intimidated government and dettermain and newson duchesses dukes most friendly innumerable invitations to country castles and among other things one which really showed him to be capable of conceiving ideas and working from an initiative but this too though it accomplished a temporary service he rendered illusory to me by his unhappy manner of regarding it as an instance of his now permanent social authority he had instituted what he called his jury of honour court composed of the select gentlemen of the realm ostensibly to weigh the causes of disputes between members of their class and decree the method of settlement but actually my father admitted to put a stop to the affair between edbury and me that was the origin of the notion richie i carried it on i dined some of the best men of our day i seized the opportunity when our choicest emperor was rolling on wheels to propound my system i mention the names of bramham dewitt colonel hibbert segrave lord alonzo carr admiral loftus the earl of luton the marquis of hatchford jack hippony monterez williamsi think you know himand little dick phillimore son of a bigwig a fellow of a capital wit and discretion i mention them as present to convince you we are not triflers dear boy my argument ran it is absurd to fight also it is intolerable to be compelled to submit to insult as the case stands we are under a summary edict of the citizens to whom chivalry is unknown well well i delivered a short speech fighting i said resembled butting a performance proper to creatures that grow horns instead of brains not to allude to a multitude of telling remarks and the question is man a fighting animal my answer being that he is not born with spurs on his heels or horns to his head and that those who insisted on fighting should be examined by competent anatomists ologists of some sort to decide whether they have the excrescences and proclaim them touching on these lighter parts of my theme with extreme delicacy but and here i dwelt on my point man if not a fighting animal in his gloriousi forgot whatis a sensitive one and has the idea of honour hear from colonel segrave and sir weeton slaterhe was one of the party in fine richie i found myself wafted into a breathing oration i cannot i confess it humbly hear your hear hear without going up and off inflated like a balloon shall the arbitration of the magistracy indemnifications in money awarded by the lawcourts succeed in satisfyingbut i declare to you richie it was no platform speech i know your termthe chaincable sentence nothing of the kind i assure you plain sense as from gentlemen to gentlemen we require i said a protection that the polite world of great britain does not now afford us against the aggressions of the knave the fool and the brute we establish a court we do herebyno no not the hereby quite simply richiepledge ourselvesi said some other word not pledge to use our utmost authority and influence to exclude from our circles persons refusing to make the reparation of an apology for wanton common insults we renounce intercourse with men declining when guilty of provoking the sentiment of hostility to submit to the jurisdiction of our court all i want you to see is the notion we raise the shield against the cowardly bully which the laws have raised against the bloody one and gentlemen my father resumed his oration forgetting my sober eye for a minutegentlemen we are the ultimate court of appeal for men who cherish their honour yet abstain from fastening it like a millstone round the neck of their commonsense credit me richie the proposition kindled we cited lord edbury to appear before us and i tell you we extracted an ample apology to you from that young nobleman and let me add one that i that we must impose it upon an old son to accept he does come come and you shall see richie society shall never repose an inert mass under my leadership i cure it i shake it and cure it he promenaded the room repeating i do not say i am possessed of a panacea and bending to my chin as he passed i maintain that i can and do fulfil the duties of my station which is my element attained in the teeth of considerable difficulties as no other man could be he prince or prime minister not one he flourished stepping onward and mind you richie this he swung round conscious as ever of the critic in me though witless to correct his pomp of style this is not self glorification i point you facts i have a thousand schemesprojects i recognize the value of early misfortune the particular misfortune of princes born is that they know nothing of the worldbabies i grant you babies now i do i have it on my thumbnail i know its wants and just as i succeeded in making you a member of our parliament in assembly and the husband of an hereditary princesshear meso will i make good my original determination to be in myself the fountain of our social laws and leader i have never i believeto speak conscientiouslyfailed in a thing i have once determined on the single wish that i might be a boy again to find pleasure in his talk was all that remained to combat the distaste i had for such oppressive deliveries of a mind apparently as little capable of being seated as a bladder charged with gas i thanked him for getting rid of edbury and a touch of remorse pricked me it is true on his turning abruptly and saying you see me in my nakedness richie to you and my valet the heart the body he was too sympathetic not to have a keen apprehension of a state of hostility in one whom he loved if i had inclined to melt however his next remark would have been enough to harden me i have fought as many battles and gained as startling victories as napoleon buonaparte he was an upstart the word gave me a jerk sometimes he would indulge me transparently in a political controversy confessing that my dialectical dexterity went far to make a radical of him i had no other amusement or i should have held my peace i tried every argument i could think of to prove to him that there was neither honour nor dignity nor profit in aiming at titular distinctions not forced upon us by the circumstances of our birth he kept his position with much sly fencing approaching shrewdness and whatever i might say i could not deny that a vile old knockkneed world tugging its forelock to the look of rank and chink of wealth backed him if he chose to be insensible to radical dignity in my time said he all young gentlemen were born tories the doctor no more expected to see a radical come into the world from a good family than a radish but i discern you my dear boy our reigning families must now be active they require the discipline i have undergone and i also dine at aldermens tables and lay a foundationstoneas jorian sayswith the facility of a henmother that should not suffice them tis not sufficient for me i lay my stone eat my dinner make my complimentary speechand that is all that is expected of us but i am fully aware we should do more we must lead or we are lost ay and to quote you a lord mayors barge is a pretty piece of gilt for the festive and luxurious to run up the river thames in and mark their swans i am convinced there is something deep in that but what am i to do would you have me frown upon the people richie it is prudent i maintain it righteous nay it is i affirm positively sovereign wisdomto cultivate every flower in the british bosom riposte mehave you too many say yes and you pass my guard you cannot i fence you there this british loyalty is in my estimation absolutely beautiful we grow to a head in our old england the people have an eye i need no introduction to them we reciprocate a highly cordial feeling when they line the streets and roads with respectful salutations and i acknowledge their demonstrative goodwill these things make us a nation by heaven richie you are on this occasion if your dad may tell you so wrong i ask pardon for my bluntness but i put it to you could we not travelling as personages in our wellbeloved country count on civility to greet us everywhere assuredly not my position is that by consenting to their honest enthusiasm we the identical effect you are perpetually crying out forwe civilize them we civilize them goodnessa great britain without royalty he launched on a series of desolate images in the end he at least persuaded himself that he had an idea in his anxiety to cultivate the primary british sentiment we moved from town to town along the south coast but it was vain to hope we might be taken for simple people nor was he altogether to blame except in allowing the national instinct for worship and reverence to air itself unrebuked i fled to the island temple ran down to meet me there and i heard that janet had written to him for news of me he entered our hotel a private person when he passed out hats flew off before him the modest little fellow went along a double line of attentive observers on the pier and came back asking me in astonishment who he was supposed to be i petitioned for privacy here exclaimed my father it accounted for the mystery temple knew my feelings and did but glance at me close upon temples arrival we had a strange couple of visitors mistress dolly disher and her husband my father introduced them she called him by one of his christian names inadvertently at times the husband was a confectioner a satisfied shade of a man who reserved the exercise of his will for his business we learnt she a bustling fresh faced woman of fortyfive with still expressive dark eyes and i guessed the ideal remainder of a passion in her bosom the guess was no great hazard she was soon sitting beside me telling me of the years she had known my father and of the most affectionate friend and perfect gentleman he was of the ladies who had been in love with him no wonder and of his sorrows and struggles and his beautiful voice and hearts that bled for him and of one at least who prayed and trusted he would be successful at last temple and the pallid confectioner spent the day on board a yacht with my father mrs dolly stayed to nurse me and persuade me to swallow medicine she talked of her youth when as a fashionable bootmakers daughter she permitted no bills to be sent in to mr richmond alleging as a sufficient reason for it to her father that their family came from richmond in yorkshire eventually the bills were always paid she had not been able to manage her husband so well and the consequence was that she breathed low an execution was out though i tell him she said tremulously he s sure to be paid in the long run if only hell wait but no he is you cannot think how obstinate in his business and my girl augusta waiting for mr roy richmond the wish of our hearts to assist at her wedding and can we ask it and have an execution hanging over him and for all my husbands a guest here hes as likely as not to set the officers at work do what i will tomorrow or any day your father invited us mr harry i forced my husband to come hoping against hope for your papa gave the orders relying on me as he believed he might and my husband undertook them all through me there it stops he hears reports and he takes fright in goes the bill then its law and last oh im ashamed mr dishers bill was for supplying suppers to the balls he received my cheque for the amount in full observing that he had been confident his wife was correct when she said it would be paid but a tradesmans business was to hasten the day of payment and for a penance he himself would pacify the lawyers on hearing of the settlement of mr dishers claim my father ahemd speechless which was a sign of his swallowing vexation he remarked that i had no doubt with the best intentions encroached on his liberty i do not like to have my debts disturbed he put it to me whether a man carrying out a lifelong plan would not be disconcerted by the friendliest intervention this payment to disher he pronounced fatal in policy you have struck a heavy blow to my credit richie good little mistress dolly brought the man down hereno select addition to our societyand we were doing our utmost to endure him as the ladies say for the very purpose but the error stands committed for the future friend disher will infallibly expect payments within the year credit for suppers is the guarantee of unlimited entertainments and i was inspiring him with absolute confidence for next years campaign money you are aware is no longer a question to terrify me i hold proofs that i have conclusively frightened government and you know it but this regards the manipulation of the man disher he will now dictate to me a refresher of a few hundreds would have been impolitic to this kind of man but the entire sum and to a creditor in arms you reverse the proper situations of gentleman and tradesman my supperman in particular should be taught to understand that he is bound up in my success something frightened him he proceeded at law and now we have shown him that he has frightened us an execution my dear boy i have danced an execution five years running and ordered consecutively at the same house like other matters an execution depends upon how you treat it the odds are that we have mortally offended mistress dolly he apologized for dwelling on the subject with the plea that it was an essential part of his machinery of action and the usual comparison of the sagacious general whose forethought omitted no minutiae i had to listen the lady professed to be hurt the payment however put an end to the visit of this couple politic or not it was a large sum to disburse and once more my attention became fixed on the probable display of figures in my bankers book bonds and bills were falling due the current expenses were exhausting i tried to face the evil and take a line of conduct staggering as i did on my feet had i been well enough i believe i should have gone to my grandfather to throw myself on his goodnature such was the brains wise counsel but i was all nerves and alarms insomuch that i interdicted temples writing to janet lest it should bring on me letters from my aunt dorothy full of advice that could no longer be followed wellmeant cautions that might as well be addressed to the mileposts behind me moreover janet would be flying on the wind to me and i had a craving for soft arms and the look of her eyebrows that warned me to keep her off if i intended to act as became a man of good faith fair weather sunny green seawater speckled with yachts shooting and bounding and sending me the sharp sense of life there is in dashedup fountains of silvery saltspray would have quickened my blood sooner but for this hotbed of fruitless adventure tricksy precepts and wisdom turned imp in which my father had again planted me to pity him seemed a childish affectation his praise of my good looks pleased me for on that point he was fitted to be a judge and i was still fancying i had lost them on the heath troops of the satellites of his grand parade surrounded him i saw him walk down the pier like one breaking up a levee at times he appeared to me a commanding phantasm in the midst of phantasm figures of great ladies and their lords whose names he told off on his return like a drover counting his herd but within range of his eye and voice the reality of him grew overpowering it seduced me and despite reason i began to feel warm under his compliments he was like wine gaiety sprang under his feet sitting at my window i thirsted to see him when he was out of sight and had touches of the passion of my boyhood i listened credulously too as in the old days when he repeated you will find i am a magician and very soon richie mark me his manner hinted that there was a surprise in store you have not been on the brink of the grave for nothing he resembled wine in the other conditions attached to its rare qualities oh for the choice of having only a little of him instead of having him on my heart the unfilial wish attacked me frequently he could be and was so ravishing to strangers and light acquaintances did by chance a likeness exist between us my sick fancy rushed to the belthams for a denial there did of some sort i knew and the thought partitioned my dreamy ideas of which the noblest taking advantage of my physical weakness compelled me to confess that it was a vain delusion for one such as i to hope for ottilia this looking at the roots of yourself if you are possessed of a nobler half that will do it is a sound corrective of an excessive ambition unfortunately it would seem that young men can do it only in sickness with the use of my legs and openair breathing i became compact and as hungry and zealous on behalf of my individuality as proud of it as i had ever been prouder and hungrier my first day of outing when looking at every face i could reflect on the miraculous issue of mine almost clear from its pummelling and above all that my nose was safenot stamped with the pugilists brand inspired a lyrical ebullition of gratitude who so intoxicated as the convalescent catching at health i met charles etherell on the pier and heard that my parliamentary seat was considered in peril together with a deal of gossip about my disappearance my father who was growing markedly restless on the watch for letters and new arrivals started to pay chippenden a flying visit he begged me urgently to remain for another few days while he gathered information saying my presence at his chief quarters did him infinite service and i always thought that possible i should find he was a magician he repeated with a sort of hesitating fervour i had just waved my hand to him as the boat was bearing him away from the pierhead when a feminine voice murmured in my ear is not this our third meeting mr harry richmondvenice elbestadt and the isle of wight she ran on allowing me time to recognize clara goodwin what was your last adventure you have been ill very ill has it been serious i made light of it no a tumble you look pale she said quickly thats from grieving at the loss of my beauty miss goodwin have you really not been seriously ill she asked with an astonishing eagerness i told her mockloftily that i did not believe in serious illnesses coming to godlike youth and plied her in turn with inquiries you have not been laid up in bed she persisted no on my honour not in bed then said she i would give much to be able to stop that boat she amazed me why because its going on a bad errand she replied miss goodwin you perplex me my father has started in that boat yes i saw him she glanced hastily at the foam in a way to show indifference what i am saying concerns others who have heard you were dangerously ill i have sent for them to hasten across my aunt and miss ilchester no who are they miss goodwin ill answer any question ive been queerish thats true now let me hear who they are when you arrived when you expect them where are they now as to me she responded with what stretched on my ears like an insufferable drawl i came over last night to hire a furnished house or lodgings papa has an appointment attached to the fortifications yonder well leave the pier if you please you draw too much attention on ladies who venture to claim acquaintance with so important a gentleman we walked the whole length of the pier chatting of our former meetings not here she said as soon as i began to question i was led farther on half expecting that the accessories of time and place would have to do with the revelation the bitter creature drew me at her heels into a linendrapers shop there she took a seat pitched her voice to the key of a ladys at a dinnertable when speaking to her cavalier of the history or attire of some one present and said you are sure the illness was not at all feigned she had me as completely at her mercy in this detestable shop as if i had been in a witnessbox feigned i exclaimed that is no answer and pray remember where you are no the illness was not feigned and you have not made the most of it what an extraordinary thing to say that is no answer and please do not imagine yourself under the necessity of acting every sentiment of your heart before these people she favoured a shopman with halfadozen directions my answer is then that i have not made the most of it i said not even by proxy once more im adrift you are certainly energetic i must address you as a brother or it will be supposed we are quarrelling harry do you like that pattern yes whats the meaning of proxy with the accent you give it heaven only knows what it means i would rather you did not talk here like a frenchman relating his last love affair in company must your voice escape control exactly at the indicatory words do you think your father made the most of it of my illness oh yes the utmost i should undoubtedly think so thats his way why did you permit it i was what they call wandering half the time besides who could keep him in check i rarely know what he is doing you dont know what he wrote wrote that you were dying of me to whom she scrutinized me and rose from her chair i must try some other shop how is it that if these english people cannot make a berthe fit to wear they do not conceive the idea of importing such things from paris i will take your arm harry you have bought nothing i remarked i have as much as i went for she replied and gravely thanked the assistant leaning on his thumbs across the counter after which dropping the graceless play of an enigma she inquired whether i had forgotten the frau von dittmarsch i had utterly but not her maiden name of sibley miss goodwin is she one of those who are coming to the island frau von dittmarsch yes she takes an interest in you she and i have been in correspondence ever since my visit to sarkeld it reminds me you may vary my maiden name with the christian if you like harry i believe you are truthful as ever in spite dont be unjust said i i wish i could think i was she rejoined frau von dittmarsch was at sarkeld and received terrible news of you she called on me at my fathers residence over the water yonder yesterday afternoon desiring greatly to knowshe is as cautious as one with a jewel in her custody how it fared with you whether you were actually in a dying state i came here to learn i have friends here you were not alone or i should have called on you the rumour was that you were very ill so i hired a furnished place for frau von dittmarsch at once but when i saw you and him together and the parting between you i began to have fears i should have countermanded the despatch i sent by the boat had it been possible it has gone and tell me the name of the other frau von dittmarsch has a husband not with her now oh cruel speak her name her name harry her title is countess von delzenburg not princess not in england then ottilia was here my father was indeed a magician chapter xlviii the princess entrapped not princess in england could betoken but one thingan incredible act of devotion so great that it stunned my senses and i thought of it and of all it involved before the vision of ottilia crossing seas took possession of me the princess ottilia miss goodwin the countess of delzenburg harry to see me she has come harry you talk like the boy you were when we met before you knew her yes and yes to everything you have to say but i think you should spare her name she comes thinking me ill dying im as strong as ever i was i should imagine you are only rather pale have you tell me clara seen her yourself is she well pale not unwell anxious about me it may be about the political affairs of the continent they are disturbed she spoke of me yes she is coming by the next boat its my fear that she is why do you fear shall i answer you harry it is useless now well because she has been deceived that is why you will soon find it out prince ernest is at sarkeld in paris i hear how will your despatch reach these ladies in time for them to come over by the next boat i have sent my fathers servant the generalhe is promoted at last harryattends the ladies in person and is now waiting for the boats arrival over there to follow my directions you wont leave me miss goodwin had promised to meet the foreign ladies on the pier we quarrelled and made it up a dozen times like girl and boy i calling her aunt clara as in the old days and she calling me occasionally son richie an imitation of my fathers manner of speech to me when we formed acquaintance first in venice but i was very little aware of what i was saying or doing the forces of my life were yoked to the heart and tumbled as confusedly as the world under phaethon charioteer we walked on the heights above the town i looked over the water to the white line of shore and batteries where this wonder stood who was what poets dream of deephearted men hope for none quite believe in hardly could i and though my relenting spinster friend at my elbow kept assuring me it was true that she was there my sceptical sight fixed on the stale prominences visible in the same features which they had worn day after empty day of late this deed of hers was an act of devotion great as death i knew it from experience consonant to ottilias character but could a princess hereditary and bound in the league of governing princes dare so to brave her condition complex of mind simplest in character the uncontrollable nobility of her spirit was no sooner recognized by me than i was shocked throughout by a sudden light contrasting me appallingly with this supreme of women who swept the earth aside for truth i had never before received a distinct intimation of my littleness of nature and my first impulse was to fly from thought and then as if to prove myself justly accused i caught myself regrettingno not regretting gazing as it were on a picture of regretsthat ottilia was not a romantic little lady of semicelestial rank exquisitely rash wilful desperately enamoured bearing as many flying hues and peeps of fancy as a loveballad and not more roughly brushing the rootemotions if she had but been such an one what sprightly colours delicious sadness magical transformations tenderest intermixture of earth and heaven what tears and sunbeams divinest pathos what descents from radiance to consolatory twilight would have surrounded me for poetry and pride to dwell on what captivating melody in the minor key would have been mine though i lost herthe legacy of it all for ever say a petulant princess a star of beauty mad for me and the whisper of our passion and sorrows traversing the flushed world was she coming not she but a touchstone a relentless mirror a piercing eye a mind severe as the goddess of the gods head a princess indeed but essentially a princess above women a remorseless intellect an actual soul visible in the flesh she was truth was i true not so very false yet how far from truth the stains on me a modern man writing his history is fugitive and crepuscular in alluding to them as a woman kneeling at the earguichet burnt like the bloodspots on the criminal compelled to touch his victim by savage ordinance which knew the savage and how to search him and these were faults of weakness rather than the sins of strength i might as fairly hope for absolution of them from ottilia as from offended laws of my natural being gentle though she was and charitable was i not guilty of letting her come on to me hoodwinked at this moment i had a faint memory of miss goodwins saying that she had been deceived and i suggested a plan of holding aloof until she had warned the princess of my perfect recovery to leave it at her option to see me yes miss goodwin assented if you like harry her compassion for me only tentatively encouraged the idea it would perhaps be right you are the judge if you can do it you are acting bravely she must have laughed at me in her heart the hours wore on my curse of introspection left me and descending through the town to the pier amid the breezy blue skirts and bonnet strings we watched the packetboat approaching there was in advance one of the famous swift island wherries something went wrong with it for it was overtaken and the steamer came in first i jumped on board much bawled at out of a crowd of unknown visages janet appeared my aunt dorothy was near her the pair began chattering of my paleness and wickedness in keeping my illness unknown to them they had seen temple on an excursion to london he had betrayed me as he would have betrayed an archangel to janet will you not look at us harry they both said the passengers were quitting the boat strangers every one harry have we really offended you in coming said janet my aunt dorothy took the blame on herself i scarcely noticed them beyond leading them on to the piersteps and leaving them under charge of miss goodwin who had in matters of luggage and porterage the practical mind and aplomb of an englishwoman that has passed much of her time on the continent i fancied myself vilely duped by this lady the boat was empty of its passengers a grumbling pier man wounded in his dignity notified to me that there were fines for disregard of the companys rules and regulations his tone altered he touched his hat didnt know who you was my lord janet overheard him and her face was humorous we may break the rules you see i said to her we saw him landing on the other side of the water she replied so spontaneously did the circumstance turn her thoughts on my father did you speak to him no you avoided him aunty and i thought it best he landed there was a crowd miss goodwin interposed you go to harrys hotel grandada is coming down tomorrow or next day janet prompted my aunt dorothy if we could seek for a furnished house uberly would watch the luggage dorothy murmured in distress furnished houses even rooms at hotels are doubtful in the height of the season miss goodwin remarked last night i engaged the only decent set of rooms i could get for friends of harrys who are coming no wonder he was disappointed at seeing ushe was expecting them said janet smiling a little they are sure to come said miss goodwin near us a couple of yachtsmen were conversing oh hell be back in a day or two one said when you ve once tasted that old boy you cant do without him i remember when i was a youngsterit was in lady betty boltons day she married old edbury you know first wifethe magnificent was then in his prime he spent his money in a week so he hired an eightyton schooner he laid violent hands on a jew bagged him lugged him on board and sailed away what the deuce did he want with a jew cried the other oh the jew supplied cheques for a three months cruise in the mediterranean and came home i heard very good friends with his pirate thats only one of dozens the unconscious slaughterers laughed on another occasioni heard it said by the first speaker as they swung round to parade the pier and passed on narrating not an hotel if it is possible to avoid it my aunt dorothy with heightened colour urged miss goodwin they talked together grandada is coming to you harry janet said he has business in london or he would have been here now our horses and carriages follow us everything you would like he does love you he is very anxious im afraid his health is worse than he thinks temple did not say your father was here but grandada must have suspected it when he consented to our coming and said he would follow us so that looks well perhaps he has been much quieter since your money was paid back to you if they should meet no i hope they will not grandada hates noise and harry let me tell you it may be nothing if he questions you do not take fire just answer plainly im sure you understand one in a temper at a time im sure s enough you have only to be patient with him he has been going to london to the city seeing lawyers bankers brokers and coming back muttering ah dear old man and when he ought to have peace harry the poor will regret him in a thousand places i write a great deal for him now and i know how they will what are you looking at i was looking at a man of huge stature of the stiffest build whose shoulders showed me their full breadth while he stood displaying frontwards the open of his hand in a salute schwartz i called janet started imagining some fierce interjection the giant did not stir but others had heard a lady stepped forward dear mr harry richmond then you are better we had most alarming news of you i bowed to the frau von dittmarsch anciently miss sibley the princess she is here frau von dittmarsch clasped miss goodwins hand i was touching ottilias a veil partly swathed her face she trembled the breeze robbed me of her voice our walk down the pier was almost in silence miss goodwin assumed the guardianship of the foreign ladies i had to break from them and provide for my aunt dorothy and janet they went over in a little boat they were so impatient who is she dorothy beltham asked the princess ottilia said janet are you certain is it really harry i confirmed it and my aunt said i should have guessed it could be no other she has a foreign grace general goodwin was with them when the boat came in from the island said janet he walked up to harrys father and you noticed aunty that the ladies stood away as if they wished to be unobserved as we did and pulled down their veils they would not wait for our boat we passed them crossing people joked about the big servant overweighing the wherry dorothy beltham thought the water too rough for little boats she knows what a sea is i said janet gazed steadily after the retreating figures and then commended me to the search for rooms the end of it was that i abandoned my fathers suite to them an accommodating linendraper possessed of a seaview and rooms which hurled the tenant to the windows in desire for it gave me harbourage till dusk i scoured the town to find miss goodwin without whom there was no clue to the habitation i was seeking and i must have passed her blindly again and again my aunt dorothy and janet thanked me for my consideration in sitting down to dine with them they excused my haste to retire i heard no reproaches except on account of my not sending them word of my illness janet was not warm she changed in colour and voice when i related what i had heard from miss goodwin namely that some one had informed the princess i was in a dying state i was obliged to offer up my father as a shield for ottilia lest false ideas should tarnish the image of her in their minds janet did not speak of him the thought stood in her eyes and there lies the evil of a sore subject among persons of one household they have not to speak to exhibit their minds after a night of suspense i fell upon old schwartz and aennchen out in the earliest dawn according to their german habits to have a gaze at sea and strange country and people aennchen was all wonder at the solitary place schwartz at the big ships but when they tried to direct me to the habitation of their mistress it was discovered by them that they had lost their bearings aennchen told me the margravine had been summoned to rippau just before they left sarkeld her mistress had informed baroness turckems of her intention to visit england prince ernest was travelling in france the hour which brought me to ottilia was noon the arrangements of the ladies could only grant me thirty minutes for janet was to drive the princess out into the country to view the island she and my aunt dorothy had been already introduced miss goodwin after presenting them insisted upon ceremoniously accompanying me to the house quite taking the vulgar view of a proceeding such as the princess had been guilty of and perhaps fearing summary audacity and interestedness in the son of a father like mine she ventured on lecturing me as though it lay with me to restrain the fair romantic head forbear from calling up my special advantages advise and stand to the wisdom of this world and be the man of honour the princess had said not see him when i have come to him i reassured my undiscerning friend partly not wholly would it be commonly sensible or civil to refuse to see me having come miss goodwin doubted i could indicate forcibly because i felt the clearjudging brain and tempered selfcommand whereby ottilia had gained her decision miss goodwin nodded and gave me the stillborn affirmative of politeness her english mind expressed itself willing to have exonerated the rash great lady for visiting a dying lover but he was not the same person now that he was on his feet consequently her expedition wore a different aspectmy not dying condemned her she entreated me to keep the fact of the princesss arrival unknown to my father on which point we were one intensely enthusiastic for the men of her race she would have me above all things by a form of adjuration designed to be a masterpiece of persuasive rhetoric prove myself an englishman i was to show that the honour interests reputation and position of any lady demented or not she added were as precious to me as to the owner that no woman was ever in peril of a shadow of loss in the hands of an english gentleman and so forth rather surprisingly to me remembering her off hand manner of the foregoing day but the sense of responsibility thrown upon her ideas of our superior national dignity had awakened her fervider naturalnessmade her a different person as we say when accounting in our fashion for what a little added heat may do the half hour allotted to me fled i went from the room and the house feeling that i had seen and heard her who was barely of the world of humankind for me so strongly did imagination fly with her i kissed her fingers i gazed in her eyes i heard the beloved voice all passed too swift for happiness recollections set me throbbing but recollection brought longing she said now i have come i must see you harry did it signify that to see me was a piece of kindness at war with her judgement she rejoiced at my perfect recovery though it robbed her of the plea in extenuation of this step she had taken she praised me for abstaining to write to her when i was stammering a set of hastily impressed reasons to excuse myself for the omission she praised my step into parliament it did not seem to involve a nearer approach to her she said you have not wasted your time in england it was for my solitary interests that she cared then i brooded desperately i could conceive an overlooking height that made her utterance simple and consecutive i could not reach it topics which to me were palpitating had no terror for her she said i have offended my father i have written to him he will take me away in speaking of the letter which had caused her to offend she did not blame the writer i was suffered to run my eyes over it and was ashamed it read to me too palpably as an outcry to delude and draw her hitherpathos and pathos the father holding his dying son in his arms his sole son harry richmond the son set upon by enemies in the night the lover never daring to beg for a sight of his beloved ere he passed awaynot an illworded letter read uncritically it may have been touching it must have been though it was the reverse for me i frowned broke down in regrets under sharp humiliation she said you knew nothing of it a little transgression is the real offender when we are once out of the way traced for us we are in danger of offending at every step we are as lawless as the outcasts that meant my turning aside to you originally was the blameable thing it might mean my love of you sets my ideas of duty at variance with my fathers she smiled nothing was uttered in a tone of despondency her high courage and breeding gave her even in this pitfall the smoothness which most women keep for society why she had not sent me any message or tidings of herself to riversley was not a matter that she could imagine to perplex me she could not imagine my losing faith in her the least we could do i construed it the religious bond between us was a faith in one another that should sanctify to our souls the external injuries it caused us to commit but she talked in no such strain her delight in treading english ground was her happy theme she said it is as young as when we met in the forest namely the feeling revived for england how far off we were from the green devonshire coast was one of her questions suggestive of our old yachtvoyage lying among her dreams excepting an extreme and terrorizing paleness there was little to fever me with the thought that she suffered mortally of reproach not a word nor of regret at the first touch of hands when we stood together alone she said would hearing of your recovery have given me peace my privileges were the touch of hands the touch of her fingers to my lips a painless hearing and seeing and passionate recollection she said impatience is not for us harry i was not to see her again before the evening these were the last words she said and seemed the lightest until my hot brain made a harvest of them transcending thrice told vows of love did they not mean we two wait therefore the years are bondmen to our stedfastness could sweeter have been said they might mean nothing she was veiled when janet drove her out janet sitting upright in her masterly way smoothing her pet ponies with the curl of her whip chatting and smiling the princess slightly leaning back i strode up to the country roads proud of our lands beauty under a complacent sky by happy chance which in a generous mood i ascribed to janets good nature i came across them at a seven miles distance they were talking spiritedly what was wonderful they gave not much heed to me they seemed on edge for one anothers conversation each face was turned to the others and after nodding an adieu they resumed the animated discourse i had been rather in alarm lest ottilia should think little of janet they passed out of sight without recurring to a thought of me behind them in the evening i was one among a group of ladies i had the opportunity of hearing the running interchange between ottilia and janet which appeared to be upon equal terms indeed janet led the subjects were not very deep plain wits candour and an unpretending tongue it seemed could make common subjects attractive as fair weather does our english woods and fields the princess was attracted by something in janet i myself felt the sway of something while observing ottilias rapt pleasure in her talk and her laughter with those funny familiar frowns and current dimples twisting and melting away like a play of shadows on the eddies of the brook i m glad to be with her janet said of ottilia it was just in that manner she spoke in ottilias presence why it should sound elsewhere unsatisfactorily blunt and there possess a finished charm i could not understand i mentioned to janet that i feared my father would be returning she contained herself with a bridled oh we were of one mind as to the necessity for keeping him absent if possible harry youll pardon me i cant talk of him said she i proposed halfearnestly to foil his return by going to london at once thats manly thats nice of you janet said this was on our walk from the house at night my aunt dorothy listened pressing my arm the next morning janet urged me to go at once keep him away bring down grandada harry she cannot quit the island because she has given prince ernest immediate rendezvous here you must not delay to go yes the countess of delzenburg shall have your excuses and no i promise you i will run nobody down besides if i do aunty will be at hand to plead for the defence and she can she has a way that binds one to accept everything she says and temple ought to study with her for a year or two before he wears his gown bring him back with you and grandada he is esteemed here at his true worth i love him for making her in love with english boys i leave the men for those who know them but english boys are unrivalled i declare honesty bravery modesty and nice looks they are so nice in their style and their way of talking i tell her our men may be shy and sneeringawkward i daresay but our boys beat the world do bring down temple i should so like her to see a cricketmatch between two good elevens of our boys harry while she is in england we could have arranged for one at riversley i went and i repressed the idea on my way that janet had manoeuvred by sending me off to get rid of me but i felt myself a living testimony to her heartlessness for no girl of any heart acting the part of friend would have allowed me to go without a leavetaking of her i loved few would have been so cruel as to declare it a duty to go at all especially when the chances were that i might return to find the princess wafted away ottilias condescension had done her no good turn to the right thats your path on she seemed to speak in this style much as she made her touch of the reins understood by her ponies i ll take every care of the princess she said her conceit was unbounded i revelled in contemptuous laughter at her assumption of the post of leader with ottilia however it was as well that i should go there was no trusting my father chapter xlix which foreshadows a general gathering at our riversley station i observed the squire in company with captain bulsted jump into a neighbouring carriage i joined them and was called upon to answer various inquiries the squire gave me one of his short tight grasps of the hand in which there was warmth and shyness our english mixture the captain whispered in my ear he oughtnt to be alone hows the greatgrandmother of the tribe said i captain bulsted nodded as if he understood but was at sea until i mentioned the bottle of rum and the remarkable length of that old ladys measurement ay to be sure a grand old soul he said you know that scum of old harry i laughed and so did he at which i laughed the louder he laughs i suppose because his partys got a majority in the house said the squire we gave you a handsome surplus this year sir sweated out of the countrys skin and bone ay you were complimented by the chancellor of the exchequer yes that fellows compliments are like a cabmans and cry foolhe never thanks you but when hes overpaid captain bulsted applauded the sarcasm why did you keep out of knowledge all this time hal my grandfather asked i referred him to the captain hang it cried captain bulsted do you think id have been doing duty for you if id known where to lay hold of you well if you didnt shake hands with me you touched my toes said i and thanked him with all my heart for his kindness to an old woman on the point of the grave i had some fun to flavour melancholy with my grandfather resumed his complaint you might have gone clean off and we none the wiser are we quite sure that his heads clean on said the mystified captain of course we should run to him wherever he was if he was down on his back the squire muttered ay ay sir of course quoth captain william frowning to me to reciprocate this relenting mood but harry where did you turn off that night we sat up expecting you my poor julia was in a terrible fright my lad eh speak up i raised the little finger oh oh went he happily reassured but reflecting added a bout of it i dropped him a penitent nod thats bad though said he then why did you tip me a bottle of rum captain william by george harry youve had a crack o the sconce he exclaimed more sagaciously than he was aware of my grandfather wanted to keep me by his side in london until we two should start for the island next day but his business was in the city mine toward the west we appointed to meet two hours after reaching the terminus he turned to me while giving directions to his man you ve got him down there i suppose my fathers in town sir he shall keep away i said humph i maynt object to see him this set me thinking captain bulstedpreviously asking me in a very earnest manner whether i was really all right and soundfavoured me with a hint the squire has plunged into speculations of his own or else he is peeping at somebody elses no danger of the dad being mixed up with companies lets hope not julia pledged her word to janet that i would look after the old squire i suppose i can go home this evening my girl hates to be alone by all means said i and the captain proposed to leave the squire at his hotel in the event of my failing to join him in the city but dont fail if you can help it he urged me for things somehow my dear harry appear to me to look like the compass when the needle gives signs of atmospheric disturbance my only reason for saying so is common observation you can judge for yourself that he is glad to have you with him i told the captain i was equally glad for in fact my grandfathers quietness and apparently friendly disposition tempted me to petition for a dower for the princess at once so that i might be in the position to offer prince ernest on his arrival a distinct alternative supposing it was still but a suppositionottilia should empower me incessant dialogues of perpetually shifting tendencies passed between ottilia and me in my brainnow dark now mildly fair now very wild on one side at least never except by downright force of will could i draw from the phantom of her one purely irrational outcry so deeplyrooted was the knowledge of her nature and mind and when i did force it i was no gainer a puppet stood in her placethe vision of ottilia melted out in threads of vapour and yet she has come to me she has braved everything to come i might say that to liken her to the women who break rules and read duties by their own light but i could not cheat my knowledge of her mrs waddy met me in the hall of my fathers house as usual pressing i regretted to see one hand to her side her heart she said was easily set pittypat now she had been by her masters orders examined by two of the chief physicians of the kingdom baronets both they advised total rest as far as i could apprehend their baronetcies and doings in high regions had been of more comfort than their prescriptions what i am i must be she said meekly and i cannot quit his service till hes abroad again or i drop he has promised me a monument i dont want it but it shows his kindness a letter from heriot informed me that the affair between edbury and me was settled he could not comprehend how what is this new jury of honour who are the jurymen he asked and affected wit i thanked him for a thrashing in a curt reply my father had left the house early in the morning mrs waddy believed that he meant to dine that evening at the seasons farewell dinner of the trumptrick club leastways tollingby has orders to lay out his gentlemensdinners eveningsuit yesterday afternoon he flew down to chippenden and was home late today hes in the city or one of the squares lady edburysah detained in town with the jaundice or toothache he said he was sending to france for a dentist or was it germany for some ladys eyes i am sure i dont know well or ill so long as youre anything to him he will abound pocket and purse you know him by this time mr harry oh my heart a loud knock at the door had brought on the poor creatures palpitations this visitor was no other than prince ernest the name on his card was graf von delzenburg and it set my heart leaping to as swift a measure as mrs waddys hearing that i was in the house he desired to see me we met with a formal bow i congratulate you right heartily upon being out of the list of the nekron he said civilly i am on my way to one of your watering places whither my family should have preceded me do you publish the names and addresses of visitors daily as it is the custom with us i relieved his apprehensions on that head here and there rarely and only at the hotels i believe the excuse was furnished for offering the princesss address possibly in a year or two we may have the pleasure of welcoming you at sarkeld said the prince extending his hand then you have seen the countess of delzenburg on the day of her arrival your highness ladies of my family are staying on the island ah he paused and invited me to bow to him we bowed thus in the room in the hall and at the streetdoor for what purpose could he have called on my father to hear the worst at once that seemed likely supposing him to have lost his peculiar confidence in the princess of which the courtly paces he had put me through precluded me from judging but i guessed acutely that it was not his intention to permit of my meeting ottilia a second time the blow was hard i felt it as if it had been struck already and thought i had gained resignation until like a man reprieved on his road to execution the narrowed circle of my heart opened out to the breadth of the world in a minute returning from the city i hurried to my fathers house late in the afternoon and heard that he had started to overtake the prince leaving word that the prince was to be found at his address in the island no doubt could exist regarding the course i was bound to take i drove to my grandfather stated my case to him and by sheer vehemence took the wind out of his sails so that when i said i am the only one alive who can control my father he answered mildly seems t other way and chose a small snort for the indulgence of his private opinion what this princess came over alone and is down driving out with my girl under an alias he said showing sour aversion at the prospect of a collision with the foreign species as expressive as the ridge of a cats back temple came to dine with us so i did not leave him quite to himself and temple promised to accompany him down to the island oh go if you like the fretted old man dismissed me ive got enough to think over hold him fast to stand up to me within fortyeight hours present time you know who i mean ive got a question or two for him how he treats his foreign princes and princesses dont concern me id say like the preventioncrueltyanimals man to the keeper of the menagerie lecture em wound their dignity hurt their feelings only dont wop em i dont wish any harm to them but what the deuce they do here nosing after my grandson there go we shall be having it out ha done with tomorrow or next day ive run the badger to earth else im not fit to follow a scent he grumbled at having to consume other than his riversley bread butter beef and ale for probably another fortnight one of the boasts of riversley was that while the rest of the world ate and drank poison the grange lived on its own solid substance defying malefactory radical tricksters temple was left to hear the rest he had the sweetest of modest wishes for a reintroduction to ottilia chapter l we are all in my fathers net journeying down by the mailtrain in the face of a great sunken sunset broken with cloud i chanced to ask myself what it was that i seriously desired to have my purpose to curb my father was sincere and good but concerning my hearts desires whitherward did they point i thought of janetshe made me gasp for air of ottilia and she made me long for earth sharp as i write it the distinction smote me i might have been divided by an electrical shot into two halves with such an equal force was i drawn this way and that pointing nowhither to strangle the thought of either one of them was like the pang of death yet it did not strike me that i loved the two they were apart in my mind actually as if i had been divided i passed the riversley station under sombre sunset fires saddened by the fancy that my old home and vivacious janet were ashes past hope i came on the smell of salt air and had that other spirit of woman around me of whom the controlled seadeeps were an image who spoke to my soul like starlight much wise counsel and impatience of the wisdom went on within me i walked like a man with a yawning wound and had to whip the sense of passion for a drug toward which one it strove i know not it was blind and stormy as the night not a boatman would take me across the lights of the island lay like a crown on the water i paced the ramparts eyeing them breathing the keen salt of thundering waves until they were robbed of their magic by the coloured fast it is i have learnt out of the conflict of sensations such as i then underwent that a young mans brain and morality supposing him not to lean overmuch to sickly sentiment becomes gradually enriched and strengthened and himself shaped for capable manhood i was partly conscious of a better condition in the morning and a sober morning it was to me after my long sentinels step to and fro i found myself possessed of one keywhether the right one or notwherewith to read the princess which was never possible to me when i was under stress of passion or of hope or despair my perplexities over what she said how she looked ceased to trouble me i read her by this strange light that she was a woman who could only love intelligentlylove that is in the sense of giving herself she had the power of passion and it could be stirred but he who kindled it wrecked his chance if he could not stand clear in her intellects unsparing gaze twice already she must have felt herself disillusioned by me this third time possibly she blamed her own fatally credulous tenderness not me but it was her third awakening and could affection and warmth of heart combat it her childs enthusiasm for my country had prepared her for the impression which the waxen mind of the dreamy invalid received deeply and so aided by the emotional blood of youth she gave me place in her imagination probing me still curiously as i remembered at a season when her sedate mind was attaining to joint deliberations with the impulsive overgenerous heart then ensued for her the successive shocks of discernment she knew the to have some of the vices many follies all the intemperateness of men who carve a way for themselves in the common roads if barely they do that and resembling common men men in a judgement elective as hers common however able i was not assuredly to be separated by her from my associations from the thought of my father for example her look at him in the lakepalace library and her manner in unfolding and folding his recent letter to her and in one or two necessitated allusions embraced a kind of grave pitiful humour beyond smiles or any outward expression as if the acknowledgement that it was so quite obliterated the wonder that it should be sothat one such as he could exercise influence upon her destiny or she may have made her reckoning generally not personally upon our human destinies it is the more likely if as i divine the calm oval of her lifted eyelids contemplated him in the fulness of the recognition that this world of which we hope unuttered things can be shifted and swayed by an ignisfatuus the father of one now seen through could hardly fail of being transfixed himself it was horrible to think of i would rather have added a vice to my faults than that she should have penetrated him nearing the island i was reminded of the early morning when i landed on the flemish flats i did not expect a similar surprise but before my rowers had pulled in the tall beaconhead of old schwartz notified that his mistress might be abroad janet walked with her i ran up the steps to salute them and had ottilias hand in mine prince ernest has arrived my father came yesterday evening do you leave today i cannot tell he will decide it seemed a good omen until i scanned janets sombre face you will not see us out for the rest of the day harry said she that is your arrangement it is your own mine if you like there was something hard in her way of speaking as though she blamed me and the princess were under her protection against me she vouchsafed no friendly significance of look and tone in spite of my readiness to criticize her which in our language means condemn for always assuming leadership with whomsoever she might be i was impressed by the air of highbred friendliness existing between her and the princess their interchange was pleasant to hear ottilia had caught the spirit of her frank manner of speech and she though in a less degree the princesss fine ease and sweetness they conversed apparently like equal minds on material points janet unhesitatingly led it was she who brought the walk to a close now harry you had better go and have a little sleep i should like to speak to you early ottilia immediately put her hand out to me i begged permission to see her to her door janet replied for her indicating old schwartz we have a protector you see six feet and a half an hour later schwartz was following her to the steps of her hotel she saw me and waited for a wonder she displayed reluctance in disburdening herself of what she had to say harry you know that he has come he and prince ernest came together get him to leave the island at once he can return tomorrow grandada writes of wishing to see him get him away today is the prince going to stay here i asked no i daresay i am only guessing i hope so he has threatened the prince what with oh harry cant you understand im no reader of etiquette but even i can see that the story of a young princess travelling over to england alone to visit and you and her father fetching her away the prince is almost at his mercy unless you make the man behave like a gentleman this is exactly the thing miss goodwin feared but whos to hear of the story said i janet gave an impatient sigh do you mean that my father has threatened to publish it janet i wont say he has he has made the prince afraid to move that i think is true did the princess herself mention it to you she understands her situation i am sure did she speak of the man as you call him yes not as i do you must try byandby to forgive me whether he set a trap or not he has decoyed herdont frown at wordsand it remains for you to act as i dont doubt you will but lose no time determine oh if i were a man you would muzzle us muzzle or anything you please i would make any one related to me behave honourably i would give him the alternative you foolish girl suppose he took it i would make him feel my will he should not take it keep to the circumstances harry if you have no control over himi should think i was not fit to live in such a position no control over him at a moment like this and the princess in danger of having her reputation hurt surely harry but why should i speak to you as if you were undecided where is he at the house where you sleep he surrendered his rooms here very kindly aunty has seen him janet blushed i thought i knew why it was for subtler reasons than i should have credited her with conceiving she sent for him at my request late last night she believed her influence would be decisive so do i she could not even make the man perceive that he was actingto use her poor dear oldfashioned word reprehensibly in frightening the prince to further your interests from what i gathered he went off in a song about them she said he talked so well and aunty dorothy too i should nearly as soon have expected grandada to come in for his turn of the delusion how i wish he was here uberly goes by the first boat to bring him down i feel with miss goodwin that it will be a disgrace for all of usthe countrys disgrace as for our family harry and your name goodbye do your best i was in the mood to ask on behalf of the country she had however a glow and a ringing articulation in her excitement that forbade trifling a minutes reflection set me weighing my power of will against my fathers i nodded to her come to us when you are at liberty she called i have said that i weighed my power of will against my fathers contemplation of the state of the scales did not send me striding to meet him let it be rememberedi had it strongly in memory that he habitually deluded himself under the supposition that the turn of all events having an aspect of good fortune had been planned by him of old and were offered to him as the legitimatelywon fruits of a politic life while others deemed him mad or merely reckless wild a creature living for the day he enjoyed the conceit of being a profound schemer in which he was fortified by a really extraordinary adroitness to take advantage of occurrences and because he was prompt in an emergency and quick to profit of a crisis he was deluded to imagine that he had created it such a man would be with difficulty brought to surrender his prize again there was his love for me pater est pamphiledifficile est how was this vast conceit of a not unreal paternal love to be encountered the sense of honour and of decency might appeal to him personally would either of them get a hearing if he fancied them to be standing in opposition to my dearest interests i unhappily as the case would be sure to present itself to him appeared the living example of his eminently politic career after establishing me the heir of one of the wealthiest of english commoners would he be likely to forego any desperate chance of ennobling me by the brilliant marriage his dreadful devotion to me extinguished the hope that he would unless i should happen to be particularly masterful in dealing with him i heard his nimble and overwhelming volubility like a flood advancing that could be withstood and his arguments and persuasions but by what steps could i restrain the man himself i said the man as janet did he figured in my apprehensive imagination as an engine more than as an individual lassitude oppressed me i felt that i required every access of strength possible physical besides moral in anticipation of our encounter and took a swim in seawater which displaced my drowsy fit and some alarming intimations of cowardice menacing a paralysis of the will i had not altogether recovered from my gipsy drubbing and now i wanted to have the contest over instantly it seemed presumable that my father had slept at my lodgings there however the report of him was that he had inspected the rooms highly complimented the owner of them and vanished returning to the pier i learnt that he had set sail in his hired yacht for the sister town on the solent at an early hourfor what purpose i knew of it too late to intercept it one of the squires horses trotted me over i came upon colonel hibbert segrave near the clubhouse and heard that my father was off again but your german prince and papainlaw shall be free of the club for the next fortnight said he and cordially asked to have the date of the marriage my face astonished him he excused himself for speaking of this happy event so abruptly a sting of downright anger drove me back at a rapid canter it flashed on me that this prince ernest whose suave fashion of depressing me and philosophical skill in managing his daughter had induced me to regard him as a pattern of astuteness was really both credulous and feeble or else supremely unsuspecting and i was confirmed in the latter idea on hearing that he had sailed to visit the opposite harbour and docks on board my fathers yacht janet shared my secret opinion the prince is a gentleman she said her wrath and disgust were unspeakable my aunt dorothy blamed her for overdue severity the prince i suppose goes of his own free will where he pleases janet burst out oh cant you see through it aunty the prince goes about without at all knowing that the person who takes himharry sees itis making him compromise himself and byandby the prince will discover that he has no will of his own whatever he may wish to resolve upon doing is he quite against harry asked my aunt dorothy dear aunty he s a prince and a proud man he will never in his lifetime consent to to what you mean without being hounded into it i havent the slightest idea whether anything will force him i know that the princess would have too much pride to submit even to save her name but it s her name that s in danger think of the scandal to a sovereign princess i know the signification of that now i used to laugh at harrys sovereign princess she is one and thorough there is no one like her dont you understand aunty that the intrigue ploti dont choose to be nice upon termsmay be perfectly successful and do good to nobody the prince may be tricked the princess i am sure will not janets affectation of an intimate and peculiar knowledge of the princess was a show of her character that i was accustomed to still it was evident they had conversed much and perhaps intimately i led her to tell me that the princess had expressed no views upon my father he does not come within her scope harry scope was one of janets new words wherewith she would now and then fall to seasoning a serviceable but savourless outworn vocabulary of the common table in spite of that and other offences rendered prominent to me by the lifting of her lip and her frown when she had to speak of my father i was on her side not on his her estimation of the princess was soundly based she discerned exactly the nature of ottilias entanglement and her peril she and my aunt dorothy passed the afternoon with ottilia while i crossed the head of the street looking down at the one house where the princess was virtually imprisoned either by her fathers express injunction or her own discretion and it was as well that she should not be out the yachting season had brought many london men to the island i met several who had not forgotten the newspaperparagraph assertions and contradictions lord alton admiral loftus and others were on the pier and in the outfitters shops eager for gossip as the languid stretch of indolence inclines men to be the admiral asked me for the whereabout of prince ernests territory he too said that the prince would be free of the club during his residence adding where is henot a question demanding an answer the men might have let the princess go by but there would have been questions urgently demanding answers had she been seen by their women late in the evening my fathers yacht was sighted from the pier just as he reached his moorings and his boat was hauled round the last steamer came in sharpeyed janet saw the squire on board among a crowd and temple next to him supporting his arm has grandada been ill she exclaimed my chief concern was to see my fathers head rising in the midst of the crowd uncovering repeatedly prince ernest and general goodwin were behind him stepping off the lower pierplatform the general did not look pleased my grandfather with janet holding his arm in the place of temple stood waiting to see that his man had done his duty by the luggage my father advancing perceived me and almost taking the squire into his affectionate salutation said nothing could be more opportune than your arrival mr beltham the squire rejoined i wanted to see you mr richmond and not in public i grant the private interview sir at your convenience janet went up to general goodwin my father talked to me and lost a moment in shaking temples hand and saying kind things name any hour you please mr beltham he resumed meantime i shall be glad to effect the introduction between harrys grandfather and his highness prince ernest of eppenwelzensarkeld he turned general goodwin was hurrying the prince up the steps the squire at the same time retreating hastily i witnessed the spectacle of both parties to the projected introduction swinging round to make their escape my father glanced to right and left he covered in the airiest fashion what would have been confusion to another by carrying on a jocose remark that he had left half spoken to temple and involved janet in it and soonthrough sheer amiable volubility and his taking mannerthe squire himself for a minute or so harry i have to tell you she is not unhappy janet whispered rapidly she is reading of one of our great men alive now she is glad to be on our ground janet named a famous admiral kindling as a fiery beacon to our blood she would have said more she looked the remainder but she could have said nothing better fitted to spur me to the work she wanted done mournfulness dropped on me like a cloud in thinking of the bright little princess of my boyhood and the ottilia of today faithful to her early passion for our seaheroes and my country though it had grievously entrapped her and into what hands not into hands which could cast one ray of honour on a devoted head the contrast between the sane service giving men she admired and the hopping skipping social meteor weaver of webs thrower of nets who offered her his history for a nuptial acquisition was ghastly most discomforting he seemed to have entangled us all he said that he had he treated me now confessedly as a cipher the prince the princess my grandfather and mehe had gathered us together he said i heard from him that the prince assisted by him in the part of an adviser saw no way of cutting the knot but by a marriage all were at hand for a settlement of the termsprovidence and destiny were dragged in lets have no theatrical talk i interposed certainly richie the plainest english he assented this was on the pier while he bowed and greeted passing figures i dared not unlink my arm for fear of further mischief i got him to my rooms and insisted on his dining there dry bread will do he said my anticipations of the nature of our wrestle were correct but i had not expected him to venture on the assertion that the prince was for the marriage he met me at every turn with this downright iteration the prince consents he knows his only chance is to yield i have him fast how i inquired how richie where is your perspicuity i have him here i loosen a thousand tongues on him i no not on him on the princess you mean on him the princess is the willing party she and you are one on him i say tis but a threat i hold it in terrorem and by heaven son richie it assures me i have not lived and fought for nothing now is the day and now is the hour on your first birthday my boy i swore to marry you to one of the highest ladies upon earth she was as it turns out then unborn no matter i keep my oath abandon it pooh you areforgive mesilly pardon me for remarking it you have not that dashing couragenever mind the point is i have my prince in his trap we are perfectly polite but i have him and he acknowledges it he shrugs love has beaten him very well and observe i permit no squireoflowdegree insinuations none of that the ladyall earthly blessings on herdoes not stoop to harry richmond i have the announcement in the newspapers i maintain it the fruit of a life of long and earnest endeavour legitimately won by heaven it is and with the constituted authorities of my native land against me your grandad proposes formally for the princess tomorrow morning he maddened me merely to keep him silent i burst out in a flux of reproaches as torrentlike as his own could be and all the time i was wondering whether it was true that a man who talked as he did in his strain of florid flimsy had actually done a practical thing the effect of my vehemence was to brace him and make him sedately emphatic he declared himself to have gained entire possession of the princes mind he repeated his positive intention to employ his power for my benefit never did power of earth or of hell seem darker to me than he at that moment when solemnly declaiming that he was prepared to forfeit my respect and love die sooner than yield his prince he wore a new aspect spoke briefly and pointedly using the phrases of a determined man and in voice and gesture signified that he had us all in a grasp of iron the charge of his having plotted to bring it about he accepted with exultation i admit he said i did not arrange to have germany present for a witness besides england but since he is here i take advantage of the fact and tomorrow you will see young eckart down i cried out as much enraged at my feebleness to resist him as in disgust of his unscrupulous tricks ay you have not known me richie said he i pilot you into harbour and all you can do is just the creaking of the vessel to me you are in my hands i pilot you i have you the husband of the princess within the month no other course is open to her and i have the assurance that she loses nothing by it she is yours my son she will not be you have wrecked my last chance you cover me with dishonour you are a youngster richie tis the wish of her heart probably while you and i are talking it over the prince is confessing that he has no escape he has not a loophole she came to you you take her i am far from withholding my admiration of her behaviour but there it isshe came not consent she is a ruined woman if she refuses through you through youthrough my father have you both gone mad try to see this i implored him she will not be subjected by any threats the very whisper of one will make her turn from me he interrupted totally the contrary the prince acknowledges that you are master of her affections consistently with her sense of honour and respect for us tell me of her reputation richie you pretend that you can damage it pretend i pretend in the teeth of all concerned to establish her happiness and yours and nothing human shall stop me i have you grateful to me before your old dad lays his head on his last pillow and that reminds me i surrender my town house and furniture to you waddy has received the word by the way should you hear of a good doctor for heartdisease tell me i have my fears for the poor soul he stood up saying richie i am not like jorian to whom a lodging house dinner is no dinner and an irreparable loss but i must have air i go forth on a stroll it was impossible for me to allow it i stopped him we were in the midst of a debate as to his right of personal freedom upon the singularity of which he commented with sundry ejaculations when temple arrived and general goodwin sent up his card temple and i left the general closeted with my father and stood at the streetdoor he had seen the princess having at her request been taken to present his respects to her by janet how she looked what she said he was dull in describing he thought her lively though she was pale she had mentioned my name kindly he observed and he knew or suspected the general to be an emissary from the prince but he could not understand the exact nature of the complication and plagued me with a mixture of blunt inquiries and the delicate reserve proper to him so much that i had to look elsewhere for counsel and sympathy janet had told him everything still he was plunged in wonder tempting me to think the lawyers mind of necessity bourgeois for the value of a sentiment seemed to have no weight in his estimation of the case nor did he appear disinclined to excuse my father some of his remarks partly swayed me in spite of my seeing that they were based on the supposition of an all for love adventure of a mad princess they whispered a little hope when i was adoring her passionately for being the reverse of whatever might have given hope a breath general goodwin followed by my father came down and led me aside after i had warned temple not to let my father elude him the general was greatly ruffled clara tells me she can rely on you he said i am at the end of my arguments with that man short of sending him to the lockup you will pardon me mr harry i foresaw the scrapes in store for you and advised you you did general i confessed will you tell me what it is prince ernest is in dread of a pitiable scandal sir and if he took my recommendation he would find instant means of punishing the man who dares to threaten him you know it i explained that i was aware of the threat not of the degree of the princes susceptibility and asked him if he had seen the princess i have had the honour he replied stiffly you gain nothing with her by this infamous proceeding i swallowed my anger and said do you accuse me general i do not accuse you he returned unbendingly you chose your path some ten or twelve years ago and you must take the consequences i foresaw it but this i will say i did not credit the man with his infernal cleverness if i speak to you at all i must speak my mind i thought him a mere buffoon and spendthrift flying his barsinister story for the sake of distinction he has schemed up to this point successfully he has the prince in his toils i would cut through them as i have informed prince ernest i daresay different positions lead to different reasonings the fellow appears to have a fascination over him your father mr harry is guilty nowhe is guilty i reiterate now of a piece of iniquity that makes me ashamed to own him for a countryman the general shook himself erect are you unable to keep him in he asked my nerves were pricking and stinging with the insults i had to listen to and consciences justification of them he repeated the question i will do what i can i said unsatisfactorily to myself and to him for he transposed our situations telling me the things he would say and do in my place things not dissimilar to those i had already said and done only more toweringly enunciated and for that reason they struck me as all the more hopelessly ineffectual and made me despair my dumbness excited his ire come said he the lady is a spoilt child she behaved foolishly but from your point of view you should feel bound to protect her on that very account do your duty young gentleman he is i believe fond of you and if so you have him by a chain i tell you frankly i hold you responsible his way of speaking of the princess opened an idea of the worlds in the event of her name falling into its clutches i said again i will do what i can and sang out for temple he was alone my father had slipped from him to leave a card at the squires hotel general goodwin touched temple on the shoulder kindly in marked contrast to his treatment of me and wished us goodnight nothing had been heard of my father by janet but while i was sitting with her at a late hour his card was brought up and a pencilled entreaty for an interview the next morning that will suit grandada janet said he commissioned me before going to bed to write the same for him she related that the prince was in a state of undisguised distraction from what i could comprehendit appeared incrediblehe regarded his daughters marriage as the solution of the difficulty the sole way out of the meshes is not that her wish said temple perhaps with a wish of his own oh if you think a lady like the princess ottilia is led by her wishes said janet her radiant perception of an ideal in her sex the first she ever had made her utterly contemptuous toward the less enlightened we appointed the next morning at halfpast eleven for my fathers visit not a minute later janet said in my ear urgently dontdont let him move out of your sight harry the princess is convinced you are not to blame i asked her whether she had any knowledge of the squires designs i have not on my honour she answered but i hope it is so miserable to think of this disgraceful thing she is too firm to give way she does not blame you i am sure i do not only harry one always feels that if one were in anothers place in a case like this i could and would command him i would have him obey me one is not born to accept disgrace even from a father i should say you shall not stir if you mean to act dishonourably one is justified i am sure in breaking a tie of relationship that involves you in dishonour grandada has not spoken a word to me on the subject i catch at straws this thing burns me oh goodnight harry i cant sleep goodnight she called softly to temple on the stairs below i heard the poor fellow murmuring goodnight to himself in the street and thought him happier than i he slept at a room close to the hotel a note from clara goodwin adjured me by her memory of the sweet brave gracious fellow she loved in other days to be worthy of what i had been the general had unnerved her reliance on me i sat up for my father until long past midnight when he came his appearance reminded me of the time of his altercation with baroness turckems under the light of the blazing curtains he had supped and drunk deeply and he very soon proclaimed that i should find him invincible which as far as insensibility to the strongest appeals to him went he was deny you love her deny she loves you deny you are onei knot you fast he had again seen prince ernest so he said declaring that the prince positively desired the marriage would have it and i he dramatized their relative situations consented after my experience of that night i forgive men who are unmoved by displays of humour commonly we think it should be irresistible his description of the thinskinned sensitive prince striving to run and dodge for shelter from him like a feverpatient pursued by a north easter accompanied by dozens of quaint similes full of his mental laughter made my loathing all the more acute but i had not been an equal match for him previous to his taking wine it was waste of breath and heart to contend with him i folded my arms tight sitting rigidly silent and he dropped on the sofa luxuriously bed richie he waved to me you drink no wine you cannot stand dissipation as i do bed my dear boy i am a god sir inaccessible to mortal ailments seriously dear boy i have never known an illness in my life i have killed my hundreds of poor devils who were for imitating me this i boasti boast constitution and i fear richie you have none of my superhuman strength added to that i know i am watched over i aski have i scheme the tricks are in my hand it may be the doing of my mother in heaven there is the fact for you to reflect on stand not in my way nor follow me too far would serve me for a motto admirably and you can put it in latin richie bed you shall turn your scholarship to account as i do my genius in your interest on my soul that motto in latin will requite me now to bed no said i you have got away from me once i shall keep you in sight and hearing if i have to lie at your door for it you will go with me to london tomorrow i shall treat you as a man i have to guard and i shall not let you loose before i am quite sure of you loose he exclaimed throwing up an arm and a leg i mean sir that you shall be in my presence wherever you are and i will take care you dont go far and wide its useless to pretend astonishment i dont argue and i dont beseech any further i just sit on guard as i would over a powdercask my father raised himself on an elbow the explosion he said examining his watch occurred at about five minutes to elevenwe are advancing into the morninglast night i received on your behalf the congratulations of friends loftus alton segrave and the rest at that hour so my dear richie you are sitting on guard over the empty magazine i listened with a throbbing forehead and controlled the choking in my throat to ask him whether he had touched the newspapers ay dear lad i have sprung my mine in them he replied you have sent word i have despatched a paragraph to the effect that the prince and princess have arrived to ratify the nuptial preliminaries you expect it to appear this day or else my name and influence are curiously at variance with the confidence i repose in them richie then i leave you to yourself i said prince ernest knows he has to expect this statement in the papers we trumped him with that identical courtcard richie very well tomorrow after we have been to my grandfather you and i part company for good sir it costs me too much dear old richie he laughed gently and now to byebye my blessing on you now and always he shut his eyes chapter li an encounter showing my fathers genius in a strong light the morning was sultry with the first rising of the sun i knew that ottilia and janet would be out for myself i dared not leave the house i sat in my room harried by the most penetrating snore which can ever have afflicted wakeful ears it proclaimed so deepseated a peacefulness in the bosom of the disturber and was so arrogant so ludicrous and inaccessible to remonstrance that it sounded like a renewal of our midnight altercation on the sleepers part prolonged now and then beyond all bounds it ended in the crashing blare whereof utter wakefulness cannot imagine honest sleep to be capable but a playful melody twirled back to the regular note he was fast asleep on the sittingroom sofa while i walked fretting and panting to this twinship i seemed condemned in my heart nevertheless there was a reserve of wonderment at his apparent astuteness and resolution and my old love for him whispered disbelief in his having disgraced me perhaps it was wilful selfdeception it helped me to meet him with a better face we both avoided the subject of our difference for some time he would evidently have done so altogether and used his best and sweetest manner to divert me but when i struck on it asking him if he had indeed told me the truth last night his features clouded as though with an effort of patience to my consternation he suddenly broke away with his arms up puffing and stammering stamping his feet he would have a trucehe insisted on a truce i understood him to exclaim and that i was like a woman who would and would not and wanted a master he raved of the gallant downrightedness of the young bloods of his day and how splendidly this one and that had compassed their ends by winning great ladies lawfully or otherwise for several minutes he was in a state of frenzy appealing to his pattern youths of a bygone generation as to moral principlesstuttering and of a dark red hue from the neck to the temples i refrained from a scuffle of tongues nor did he excuse himself after he had cooled his hand touched instinctively for his pulse and with a glance at the ceiling he exclaimed good lord and brought me to his side these wigwam houses check my circulation said he let us go outlet us breakfast on board the open air restored him and he told me that he had been merely oppressed by the architect of the inferior classes whose ceiling sat on his head my nerves he remarked to me were very exciteable you should take your wine richieyou require it your dear mother had a lowtoned nervous system i was silent and followed him at once a captive and a keeper this day of slackened sails and a bright sleeping water kept the yachtsmen on land there was a crowd to meet the morning boat foremost among those who stepped out of it was the yellowhaired eckart little suspecting what the sight of him signalled to me i could scarcely greet him at all for in him i perceived that my father had fully committed himself to his plot and left me nothing to hope eckart said something of prince hermann as we were walking off the pier i saw janet conversing with prince ernest and the next minute hermann himself was one of the group i turned to eckart for an explanation didnt i tell you he called at your house in london and travelled down with me this morning said eckart my father looked in the direction of the princes but his face was for the moment no index they bowed to janet and began talking hurriedly in the triangle of road between her hotel the pier and the way to the villas passing on and coming to a full halt like men who are not reserving their minds my father stept out toward them he was met by prince ernest hermann turned his back it being the hour of the appointment i delivered eckart over to temples safekeeping and went up to janet dont be late harry she said i asked her if she knew the object of the meeting appointed by my grandfather she answered impatiently do get him away from the prince and then i ought to tell you the princess is well and so onpardon me just now grandada is kept waiting and i dont like it her actual dislike was to see prince ernest in dialogue with my father it seemed to me and the manner of both which was one would have said intimate anything but the manner of adversaries prince ernest appeared to affect a pleasant humour he twice after shaking my fathers hand stepped back to him as if to renew some impression their attitude declared them to be on the best of terms janet withdrew her attentive eyes from observing them and threw a world of meaning into her abstracted gaze at me my fathers advance put her to flight yet she gave him the welcome of a highbred young woman when he entered the drawingroom of my grandfathers hotelsuite she was alone and she obliged herself to accept conversation graciously he recommended her to try the german baths for the squires gout and evidently amused her with his specific probations for english persons designing to travel in company that they should previously live together in a house with a collection of undisciplined chambermaids a musical footman and a mad cook to learn to accommodate their tempers i would add a touch of earthquake miss ilchester just to make sure that all the party know one anothers edges before starting this was too far a shot of nonsense for janet whose native disposition was to refer to lunacy or stupidity or trickery whatsoever was novel to her understanding i for my part said he stipulate to have for comrade no man who fancies himself a born and stamped chieftain no inveterate student of maps and no dog with a turn for feeling himself pulled by the collar and that reminds me you are amateur of dogs have you a pomeranian boarhound no said janet i have never even seen one that high my father raised his hand flat bigger than our newfoundlands without exaggeration big as a pony you will permit me to send you one warranted to have passed his distemper which can rarely be done for our human species though here and there i venture to guarantee my man as well as my dog janet interposed her thanks declining to take the dog but he dwelt on the dogs charms his youth stature appearance fitness and grandeur earnestly i had to relieve her apprehensions by questioning where the dog was in germany he said it was not improbable nor less so that the dog was in pomerania likewise the entry of my aunt dorothy followed by my grandfather was silent be seated the old man addressed us in a body to cut short particular salutations my father overshadowed him with drooping shoulders janet wished to know whether she was to remain i like you by me always he answered bluff and sharp we have some shopping to do my aunt dorothy murmured showing she was there against her will do you shop out of london said my father and for some time he succeeded in making us sit for the delusive picture of a comfortable family meeting my grandfather sat quite still janet next to him when youve finished mr richmond he remarked mr beltham i was telling miss beltham that i join in the abuse of london exactly because i love it a paradox she says but we seem to be effecting a kind of insurance on the life of the things we love best by crying them down violently you have observed it denounce them they endure for ever so i join any soul on earth in decrying our dear london the naughty old city can bear it there was a clearing of throats my aunt dorothys foot tapped the floor but i presume you have done me the honour to invite me to this conference on a point of business mr beltham said my father admonished by the hint i have sir the squire replied and i also have a point and in fact it is urgent and with your permission mr beltham i will lead the way no sir if you please im a short speaker and go to it at once and i wont detain you a second after youve answered me my father nodded to this with the conciliatory comment that it was businesslike the old man drew out his pocketbook you paid a debt he said deliberately amounting to twentyone thousand pounds to my grandsons account oh a debt i did sir between father and boy dad and lad debts but use your own terms i pray you i dont ask you where that money is now i ask you to tell me where you got it from you speak bluntly my dear sir you wont answer then you ask the question as a family matter i reply with alacrity to the best of my ability and with my hand on my heart mr beltham let me assure you i very heartily desire the information to be furnished to me or ratherwhy should i conceal it the sources are irregular but a child could toddle its way to themyou take my indication say that i obtained it from my friends my friends mr beltham are of the kind requiring squeezing government as my chum and good comrade jorian dewitt is fond of saying is a spongea thing that when you dive deep enough to catch it gives liberal supplies but will assuredly otherwise reverse the process by acting the part of an absorbent i get what i get by force of arms or i might have perished long since then you dont know where you got it from sir technically you are correct sir a bird didnt bring it and you didnt find it in the belly of a fish neither of these prodigies they have occurred in books i am bound to believe they did not happen to me you swear to me you dont know the man woman or committee who gave you that sum i do not know mr beltham in an extraordinary history extraordinary circumstances i have experienced so many that i am surprised at nothing you suppose you got it from some fool oh if you choose to indict government collectively you pretend you got it from government i am termed a pretender by some mr beltham the facts are these i promised to refund the money and i fulfilled the promise there you have the only answer i can make to you now to my own affair i come to request you to demand the hand of the princess of eppenwelzensarkeld on behalf of my son harry your grandson and i possess the assurance of the prince her father that it will be granted doubtless you sir are of as old a blood as the prince himself you will acknowledge that the honour brought to the family by an hereditary princess is considerable it is something i am prepared to accompany you to his highness or not as you please it is but a question of dotation and a selection from one or two monosyllables janet shook her dress the squire replied we ll take that up presently i havent quite done will you tell me what agent paid you the sum of money the usual agenta solicitor mr beltham a gentleman whose business lay amongst the aristocracy he is defunct and a very worthy old gentleman he was with a remarkable store of anecdotes of his patrons very discreetly told for you never heard a name from him you took him for an agent of government did you why to condense a long story sir the kernel of the matter is that almost from the hour i began to stir for the purpose of claiming my rights which are transparent enough this old gentlemancertainly from no sinister motive i may presumecommenced the payment of an annuity not sufficient for my necessities possibly but warrant of an agreeable sort for encouraging my expectations although oddly this excellent old mr bannerbridge invariably served up the dish in a sauce that did not agree with it by advising me of the wish of the donator that i should abandon my case i consequently in common with my friends performed a little early lesson in arithmetic and we came to the one conclusion open to reflective mindsnamely that i was feared my aunt dorothy looked up for the first time janet and i have some purchases to make she said the squire signified sharply that she must remain where she was i think aunty wants fresh air she had a headache last night said janet i suggested that as my presence did not seem to be required i could take her on my arm for a walk to the pierhead her face was burning she would gladly have gone out but the squire refused to permit it and she nodded over her crossed hands saying that she was in no hurry ha i am quoth he dear miss beltham my father ejaculated solicitously here sir oblige me by attending to me cried the squire fuming and blinking i sent for you on a piece of business you got this money through a gentleman a solicitor named bannerbridge did you his name was bannerbridge mr beltham dorothy you knew a mr bannerbridge she faltered i knew him harry was lost in the streets of london when he was a little fellow and the mr bannerbridge i knew found him and took him to his house and was very kind to him what was his christian name i gave them charles adolphus the identical person exclaimed my father oh you admit it said the squire ever seen him since the time harry was lost dorothy yes she answered i have heard he is dead did you see him shortly before his death i happened to see him a short time before he was your man of business was he for such little business as i had to do you were sure you could trust him eh yes my aunt dorothy breathed deeply by god maam youre a truthful woman the old man gave her a glare of admiration it was now my turn to undergo examination and summoned by his apostrophe to meet his eyes i could appreciate the hardness of the head i had to deal with harry i beg your pardon beforehand i want to get at facts i must ask you what you know about where the money came from i spoke of my attempts to discover the whence and wherefore of it government eh he sneered i really cant judge whether it came from that quarter said i what do you thinkthink it likely i thought it unlikely and yet likelier than that it should have come from an individual then you dont suspect any particular person of having sent it in the nick of time harry richmond i replied no sir unless you force me to suspect you he jumped in his chair astounded and wrathful confounded me for insinuating that he was a bedlamite and demanded the impudent reason of my suspecting him to have been guilty of the infernal folly i had but the reason to instance that he was rich and kind at heart rich kind he bellowed just excuse mei must ask for the purpose of my inquirythere tell me how much do you believe you ve got of that money remaining none o that peterborough style of counting in the back of your pate say there was a dreadful silence my father leaned persuasively forward mr beltham i crave permission to take up the word allow me to remind you of the prize harry has won the prince awaits you to bestow on him the hand of his daughter out with it harry shouted the squire not to mention harrys seat in parliament my father resumed he has a princess to wife indubitably one of the most enviable positions in the country it is unnecessary to count on future honours they may be alluded to in truth sir we make him the first man in the country not necessarily premier you take my meaning he possesses the combination of social influence and standing with political achievements and rank and riches in addition i m speaking to my grandson sir the squire rejoined shaking himself like a man rained on i m waiting for a plain answer and no lie youve already confessed as much as that the money you told me on your honour you put out to interest pshfor my grandson was smoke now lets hear him my father called out i claim a hearing the money you speak of was put out to the very highest interest you have your grandson in parliament largely acquainted with the principal members of society husband of an hereditary princess you have only at this moment to propose for her hand i guarantee it to you with that money i have won him everything not that i would intimate to you that princesses are purchaseable the point is i knew how to employ it in two months time the money in the funds in the boys nameyou told me that you had it in the funds in harry richmonds name sir well sir im asking him whether its in the funds now oh mr beltham what answers that the squire was really confused by my fathers interruption and lost sight of me i ask where it came from i ask whether its squandered he continued mr beltham i reply that you have only to ask for it to have it do so immediately what s he saying cried the baffled old man i give you a thousand times the equivalent of the money mr beltham is the money there the lady is here i said money sir a priceless honour and treasure i say emphatically my grandfathers brows and mouth were gathering for storm janet touched his knee where the devil your understanding truckles if you have any i dont know he muttered what the deucelady got to do with money oh my father laughed lightly customarily the alliance is they say as close as matrimony pardon me to speak with becoming seriousness mr beltham it was duly imperative that our son should be known in society should be you will apprehend me advanced in station which i had to do through the ordinary political channel there could not but be a considerable expenditure for such a purpose in balls and dinners in everything that builds a young gentlemans repute you swear to me you gave your balls and dinners and the lot for harry richmonds sake on my veracity i did sir please dont talk like a mountebank i dont want any of your roundabout words for truth were not writing a bible essay i try my best to be civil my father beamed on him i guarantee you succeed sir nothing on earth can a man be so absolutely sure of as to succeed in civility if he honestly tries at it jorian dewittby the way you may not know himan esteemed old friend of mine saysthat is he said onceto a tolerably impudent fellow whom he had disconcerted with a capital retort you may try to be a gentleman and blunder at it but if you will only try to be his humble servant we are certain to establish a common footing jorian let me tell you is a wit worthy of our glorious old days my grandfather eased his heart with a plunging breath well sir i didnt ask you here for your opinion or your friends and i dont care for modern wit nor i mr beltham nor i it has the reek of stable straw we are of one mind on that subject the thing slouches it sprawls itto quote jorian once moreis like a dirty idle little stupid boy who cannot learn his lesson and plays the fool with the alphabet you smile miss ilchester you would appreciate jorian modern wit is emphatically degenerate it has no scintillation neither thrust nor parry i compare it to boxing as opposed to the more beautiful science of fencing well sir i dont want to hear your comparisons growled the squire much oppressed stop a minute half a minute to me sir said my father with a glowing reminiscence of jorian dewitt which was almost too much for the combustible old man even under janets admonition my aunt dorothy moved her head slightly toward my father looking on the floor and he at once drew in mr beltham i attend to you submissively you do then tell me what brought this princess to england the conviction that harry had accomplished his oath to mount to an eminence in his country and had made the step she is about to take less i will say precipitous though i personally decline to admit a pointed inferiority you wrote her a letter that containing the news of the attack on him and his desperate illness was the finishing touch to the noble ladys passion attack i know nothing about an attack you wrote her a letter and wrote her a lie you said he was dying i had the boy inanimate on my breast when i despatched the epistle you said he had only a few days to live so in my affliction i feared will you swear you didnt write that letter with the intention of drawing her over here to have her in your power so that you might threaten youd blow on her reputation if she or her father held out against you and all didnt go as you fished for it my father raised his head proudly i divide your query into two parts i wrote sir to bring her to his side i did not write with any intention to threaten youve done it though i have done this said my father toweringly i have used the power placed in my hands by providence to overcome the hesitations of a gentleman whose illustrious rank predisposes him to sacrifice his daughters happiness to his pride of birth and station can any one confute me when i assert that the princess loves harry richmond i walked abruptly to one of the windows hearing a pitiable wrangling on the theme my grandfather vowed she had grown wiser my father protested that she was willing and anxious janet was appealed to in a strangely sounding underbreath she said the princess does not wish it you hear that mr richmond cried the squire he returned can miss ilchester say that the princess ottilia does not passionately love my son harry richmond the circumstances warrant me in beseeching a direct answer she uttered no i looked at her she at me you can conduct a case richmond the squire remarked my father rose to his feet i can conduct my son to happiness and greatness my dear sir but to some extent i require your grandfatherly assistance and i urge you now to present your respects to the prince and princess and judge yourself of his highnesss disposition for the match i assure you in advance that he welcomes the proposal i do not believe it said janet rising my aunt dorothy followed her example saying in justice to harry the proposal should be made at least it will settle this dispute janet stared at her and the squire threw his head back with an amazed interjection what youre for it now why at breakfast you were all t other way you didnt want this meeting because you poohpoohed the match i do think you should go she answered you have given harry your promise and if he empowers you it is right to make the proposal and immediately i think she spoke feverishly with an unsweet expression of face that seemed to me to indicate vexedness at the squires treatment of my father harry she asked me in a very earnest fashion is it your desire tell your grandfather that it is and that you want to know your fate why should there be any dispute on a fact that can be ascertained by crossing a street surely it is trifling janet stooped to whisper in the squires ear he caught the shock of unexpected intelligence apparently faced about gazed up and cried you too but i havent done here i ve got to crossexamine pretend do you mean pretend im ready to go i can release this prince just as well here as there janet laughed faintly i should advise your going grandada you a weathercock woman he reproached her quite mystified and fell to rubbing his head suppose i go to be snubbed the prince is a gentleman grandada come with me we will go alone you can relieve the prince and protect him my father nodded i approve and grandadabut it will not so much matter if we are alone though janet said speak out see the princess as well she must be present i leave it to you he said crestfallen janet pressed my aunt dorothys hand aunty you were right you are always right this state of suspense is bad all round and it is infinitely worse for the prince and princess my aunt dorothy accepted the eulogy with a singular trembling wrinkle of the forehead she evidently understood that janet had seen her wish to get released for my part i shared my grandfathers stupefaction at their unaccountable changes it appeared almost as if my father had won them over to baffle him the old man tried to insist on their sitting down again but janet perseveringly smiled and smiled until he stood up she spoke to him softly he was one black frown displeased with her obedient however too soon after i had the key to the enigmatical scene at the moment i was contemptuous of riddles and heard with idle ears janets promptings to him and his replies it would be so much better to settle it here he said she urged that it could not be settled here without the whole burden and responsibility falling upon him exactly interposed my father triumphing dorothy beltham came to my side and said as if speaking to herself while she gazed out of window if a refusal it should come from the prince she dropped her voice the money has not been spent has it has any part of it been spent are you sure you have more than three parts of it now that she should be possessed by the spirit of parsimony on my behalf at such a time as this was to my conception insanely comical and her manner of expressing it was too much for me i kept my laughter under to hear her continue what numbers are flocking on the pier and there is no music yet tell me harry that the money is all safe nearly all it is important to know you promised economy music did you speak of miss beltham my father bowed to her gallantly i chanced to overhear you my private band performs to the public at midday she was obliged to smile to excuse his interruption whats that whose band said the squire bursting out of janets hand a private band janet had a difficulty in resuming her command of him the mention of the private band made him very restive i m not acting on my own judgement at all in going to these foreign people he said to janet why go i can have it out here and an end to it without bothering them and their interpreters he sang out to me harry do you want me to go through this form for youmnd unpleasant my aunt dorothy whispered in my ear yes yes i feel tricked he muttered and did not wait for me to reply before he was again questioning my aunt dorothy concerning mr bannerbridge and my father as to that sum of money but his method of interrogation was confused and pointless the drift of it was totally obscure im off my head today he said to janet with a sideshot of his eye at my father you waste time and trouble grandada said she he vowed that he was being bewildered bothered by us all and i thought i had never seen him so far below his level of energy but i had not seen him condescend to put himself upon a moderately fair footing with my father the truth was that janet had rigorously schooled him to bridle his temper and he was no match for the voluble easy man without the freest play of his tongue this prince he kept ejaculating wont you understand grandada that you relieve him and make things clear by going janet said he begged her fretfully not to be impatient and hinted that she and he might be acting the part of dupes and was for pursuing his inauspicious crossexamination in spite of his blundering and the where am i now which pulled him up my father either talking to my aunt dorothy to janet or to me on ephemeral topics scarcely noticed him except when he was questioned and looked secure of success in the highest degree consistent with perfect calmness so you say you tell me to go do you the squire called to me be good enough to stay here and wait i dont see that anythings gained by my going its damned hard on me having to go to a man whose language i dont know and he dont know mine on a business were all of us in a muddle about ill do it if its right youre sure he glanced at janet she nodded i was looking for this quaint and to me incomprehensible interlude to commence with the departure of the squire and janet when a card was handed in by one of the hotelwaiters another prince cried the squire these germans seem to grow princes like potatoesdozens to a root whos the card for ask him to walk up show him into a quiet room does he speak english does prince hermann ofi cant pronounce the name of the placespeak english harry janet asked me as well as you or i said i losing my inattention all at once with a mad leap of the heart hermanns presence gave light fire and colour to the scene in which my destiny had been wavering from hand to hand without much more than amusedly interesting me for i was sure that i had lost ottilia i knew that too well and worse could not happen i had besides lost other things that used to sustain me and being reckless i was contemptuous and listened to the talk about money with sublime indifference to the subject with an attitude too i daresay but hermanns name revived my torment why had he come to persuade the squire to control my father nothing but that would suffer itself to be suggested though conjectures lying in shadow underneath pressed ominously on my mind my father had no doubts a word to you mr beltham before you go to prince hermann he is an emissary we treat him with courtesy and if he comes to diplomatize we of course give a patient hearing i have only to observe in the most emphatic manner possible that i do not retract one step i will have this marriage i have spoken it rests with prince ernest the squire threw a hasty glare of his eyes back as he was hobbling on janets arm she stopped short and replied for him mr beltham will speak for himself in his own name we are not concerned in any unworthy treatment of prince ernest we protest against it dear young lady said my father graciously i meet you frankly now tell me i know you a gallant horsewoman if you had lassoed the noble horse of the desert would you let him run loose because of his remonstrating side with me i entreat you my son is my first thought the pride of princes and wild horses you will find wonderfully similar especially in the way they take their taming when once they feel they are positively caught we show him we have him fasthe falls into our paces on the spot for harrys sakefor the princesss i beg you exert your universallydeservedly acknowledged influence even nowand you frown on mei cannot find it in my heart to wish you the sweet and admirable woman of the world you are destined to be though you would comprehend me and applaud me for i could notno not to win your favourable opinion consent that you should be robbed of a single ray of your fresh maidenly youth if you must misjudge me i submit it is the price i pay for seeing you young and lovely prince ernest is credit me not unworthily treated by me if life is a battle and the prize of it to the generals head i implore youhe lured her with the dimple of a lurking smiledo not seriously blame your afflicted senior if we are to differ i am vastly your elder you instil the doubt whether i am by as much the wiser of the two but the father of harry richmond claims to know best what will ensure his boys felicity is he rash pronounce me guilty of an excessive anxiety for my sons welfare say that i am too old to read the world with the accuracy of a youthful intelligence call me indiscreet stigmatize me unlucky the severest sentence a judgehe bowed to her deferentiallycan utter only do not cast a gaze of rebuke on me because my labour is for my sonmy utmost devotion and we know miss ilchester that the princess honours him with her love i protest in all candour i treat love as love not as a weight in the scale it is the heavenly power which dispenses with weighing its ascendancy the squire could endure no more and happily so for my father was losing his remarkably moderated tone and threatening polysyllables he had followed janet step for step at a measured distance drooping toward her with his winningest air while the old man pulled at her arm to get her out of hearing of the obnoxious flatterer she kept her long head in profile trying creditably not to appear discourteous to one who addressed her by showing an open ear until the final bolt made by the frenzied old man dragged her through the doorway his neck was shortened behind his collar as though he shrugged from the blast of a bad wind i believe that on the whole janet was pleased i will wager that left to herself she would have been drawn into an answer if not an argument nothing would have made her resolution swerve i admit they had not been out of the room three seconds when my aunt dorothy was called to join them she had found time to say that she hoped the money was intact etext editors bookmarks all passed too swift for happiness he clearly could not learn from misfortune intimations of cowardice menacing a paralysis of the will like a woman who would and would not and wanted a master one in a temper at a time im sure s enough simple affection must bear the strain of friendship if it can stand not in my way nor follow me too far tension of the old links keeping us together the thought stood in her eyes they have not to speak to exhibit their minds tight grasps of the hand in which there was warmth and shyness to the rest of the world he was a progressive comedy was i true not so very false yet how far from truth who so intoxicated as the convalescent catching at health
