and david widger widgercecometnet rhoda fleming by george meredith book xii at the theatre xiii the farmer speaks xiv between rhoda and robert xv a visit to wrexby hall xvi at fairly park xvii a yeoman of the old breed xviii an assembly at the pilot inn xix robert smitten low xx mrs lovell shows a tame brute chapter xii edward's engagement at his club had been with his unfortunate cousin algernon who not only wanted a dinner but 'five pounds or so' the hazy margin which may extend illimitably or miserably contract at the lender's pleasure and the necessity for which shows the borrower to be dancing on fortune's tight rope above the old abyss over claret was to have been the time for the asking and algernon waited dinnerless until the healthy going minutes distended and swelled monstrous and horrible as viper bitten bodies and the venerable signior time became of unhealthy hue for this was the first dinner which during the whole course of the young man's career had ever been failing to him reflect upon the mournful gap he could scarcely believe in his ill luck he suggested it to himself with an inane grin as one of the far away freaks of circumstances that had struck him and was it not comical he waited from the hour of six till the hour of seven he compared clocks in the hall and the room he changed the posture of his legs fifty times for a while he wrestled right gallantly with the apparent menace of the fates that he was to get no dinner at all that day it seemed incredibly derisive for as i must repeat it had never happened to him by any accident before you are born you dine such appeared to him to be the positive regulation of affairs and a most proper one of the matters of course following the birth of a young being by what frightful mischance then does he miss his dinner by placing the smallest confidence in the gentlemanly feeling of another man algernon deduced this reply accurately from his own experience and whether it can be said by other undined mortals does not matter in the least but we have nothing to do with the constitutionally luckless the calamitous history of a simple empty stomach is enough here the tragedy is palpable indeed too sadly so and i dare apply but a flash of the microscope to the rageing dilemmas of this animalcule five and twenty minutes had signalled their departure from the hour of seven when algernon pronounced his final verdict upon edward's conduct by leaving the club he returned to it a quarter of an hour later and lingered on in desperate mood till eight he had neither watch in his pocket nor ring on his finger nor disposable stud in his shirt the sum of twenty one pence was in his possession and i ask you as he asked himself how is a gentleman to dine upon that he laughed at the notion the irony of providence sent him by a cook's shop where the mingled steam of meats and puddings rushed out upon the wayfarer like ambushed bandits and seized him and dragged him in or sent him qualmish and humbled on his way two little boys had flattened their noses to the whiteness of winkles against the jealously misty windows algernon knew himself to be accounted a generous fellow and remembering his reputation he as to hint at what fortune might do in his case tossed some coppers to the urchins who ducked to the pavement and slid before the counter in a flash with never a thank ye or the thought of it algernon was incapable of appreciating this childish faith in the beneficence of the unseen powers who feed us which i must say for him he had shared in a very similar manner only two hours ago he laughed scornfully the little beggars considering in his soul that of such is humanity composed as many a dinnerless man has said before and will again to point the speech of fools he continued strolling on comparing the cramped misty london aspect of things with his visionary free dream of the glorious prairies where his other life was the forests the mountains the endless expanses the horses the flocks the slipshod ease of language and attire and the grog shops aha there could be no mistake about him as a gentleman and a scholar out there nor would nature shut up her pocket and demand innumerable things of him as civilization did this he thought in the vengefulness of his outraged mind not only had algernon never failed to dine every day of his life he had no recollection of having ever dined without drinking wine his conception did not embrace the idea of a dinner lacking wine possibly he had some embodied understanding that wine did not fall to the lot of every fellow upon earth he had heard of gullets unrefreshed even by beer but at any rate he himself was accustomed to better things and he did not choose to excavate facts from the mass of his knowledge in order to reconcile himself to the miserable chop he saw for his dinner in the distance a spot of meat in the arctic circle of a plate not shone upon by any rosy warming sun of a decanter but metaphorical language though nothing other will convey the extremity of his misery or the form of his thoughts must be put aside egad and every friend i have is out of town he exclaimed quite willing to think it part of the plot he stuck his hands in his pockets and felt vagabond like and reckless the streets were revelling in their winter muck the carriages rolling by insulted him with their display of wealth he had democratic sentiments regarding them oh for a horse upon the boundless plains he sighed to his heart he remembered bitterly how he had that day ridden his stool at the bank dreaming of his wilds where bailiff never ran nor duns obscured the firmament and then there were theatres here huge extravagant places algernon went over to an entrance of one to amuse his mind cynically criticizing the bill a play was going forward within that enjoyed great popular esteem the holly berries seeing that the pit was crammed algernon made application to learn the state of the boxes but hearing that one box was empty he lost his interest in the performance as he was strolling forth his attention was taken by a noise at the pit doors which swung open and out tumbled a tough little old man with a younger one grasping his coat collar who proclaimed that he would sicken him of pushing past him at the end of every act you're precious fond of plays sneered the junior i'm fond of everything i pay for young fellow replied the shaken senior and that's a bit of enjoyment you've got to learn ain't it well don't you knock by me again that's all cried the choleric youth you don't think i'm likely to stop in your company do you whose expense have you been drinking at my country's young fellow and mind you don't soon feed at the table let me go algernon's hunger was appeased by the prospect of some excitement and seeing a vicious shake administered to the old man by the young one he cried hands off and undertook policeman's duty but as he was not in blue his authoritative mandate obtained no respect until he had interposed his fist when he had done so he recognized the porter at boyne's bank whose enemy retired upon the threat that there should be no more pushing past him to get back to seats for the next act i paid said anthony and you're a ticketer and you ticketers sha' n't stop me i'm worth a thousand of you holloa sir he cried to algernon i didn't know you i'm much obliged these chaps get tickets given 'm and grow as cocky in a theatre as men who pay he never had such wine in him as i've got that i'd swear ha ha i come out for an airing after every act and there's a whole pitfall of ticketers yelling and tearing and i chaff my way through and back clean as a red hot poker anthony laughed and rolled somewhat as he laughed come along sir into the street he said boring on to the pavement it's after office hours and ha ha what do you think there's old farmer in there afraid to move off his seat and the girl with him sticking to him tight and a good girl too she thinks we've had too much we been to the docks wine tasting port sherry sherry port and ha ha 'what a lot of wine' says farmer never thinking how much he's taking on board i guessed it was night says farmer as we got into the air and to see him go on blinking and stumbling and saying to me 'you stand wine brother tony' i'm blest if i ain't bottled laughter so says i 'come and see the holly berries brother william john it's the best play in london and a suitable winter piece' 'is there a rascal hanged in the piece' says he 'oh yes' i let him fancy there was and he ha ha old farmer's sticking to his seat solemn as a judge waiting for the gallows to come on the stage a thought quickened algernon's spirit it was a notorious secret among the young gentlemen who assisted in maintaining the prosperity of boyne's bank that the old porter the old ant as he was called possessed money and had no objection to put out small sums for a certain interest algernon mentioned casually that he had left his purse at home and by the way said he have you got a few sovereigns in your pocket what and come through that crush sir anthony negatived the question decisively with a reference to his general knowingness algernon pressed him saying at last well have you got one i don't think i've been such a fool said anthony feeling slowly about his person and muttering as to the changes that might possibly have been produced in him by the docks confound it i haven't dined exclaimed algernon to hasten his proceedings but at this anthony eyed him queerly what have you been about then sir don't you see i'm in evening dress i had an appointment to dine with a friend he didn't keep it i find i've left my purse in my other clothes that's a bad habit sir was anthony's comment you don't care much for your purse much for my purse be hanged interjected algernon you'd have felt it or you'd have heard it if there 'd been any weight in it anthony remarked how can you hear paper oh paper's another thing you keep paper in your mind don't you eh forget pound notes leave pound notes in a purse and you sir william's nephew sir who'd let you bank with him and put down everything in a book so that you couldn't forget or if you did he'd remember for you and you might change your clothes as often as not and no fear of your losing a penny algernon shrugged disgustedly and was giving the old man up as a bad business when anthony altered his manner oh well sir i don't mind letting you have what i've got i'm out for fun bother affairs the sum of twenty shillings was handed to algernon after he had submitted to the indignity of going into a public house and writing his iou for twenty three to anthony hackbut which included interest algernon remonstrated against so needless a formality but anthony put the startling supposition to him that he might die that night he signed the document and was soon feeding and drinking his wine this being accomplished he took some hasty puffs of tobacco and returned to the theatre in the hope that the dark girl rhoda was to be seen there for now that he had dined anthony's communication with regard to the farmer and his daughter became his uppermost thought and a young man's uppermost thought is usually the propelling engine to his actions by good chance and the aid of a fee he obtained a front seat commanding an excellent side view of the pit which sat wrapt in contemplation of a christmas scene snow ice bare twigs a desolate house and a woman shivering one of man's victims it is a good public that of britain and will bear anything so long as villany is punished of which there was ripe promise in the oracular utterances of a rolling stout stage sailor whose nose to say nothing of his frankness on the subject proclaimed him his own worst enemy and whose joke by dint of repetition had almost become the joke of the audience too for whenever he appeared there was agitation in pit and gallery which subsided only on his jovial thundering of the familiar sentence whereupon laughter ensued and a quieting hum of satisfaction it was a play that had been favoured with a great run critics had once objected to it that it was made to subsist on scenery a song and a stupid piece of cockneyism pretending to be a jest that was really no more than a form of slapping the public on the back but the public likes to have its back slapped and critics frozen by the medusa head of success were soon taught manners the office of critic is now in fact virtually extinct the taste for tickling and slapping is universal and imperative classic appeals to the intellect and passions not purely domestic have grown obsolete there are captains of the legions but no critics the mass is lord and behold our friend the sailor of the boards whose walk is even as two meeting billows appears upon the lonely moor and salts that uninhabited region with nautical interjections loose are his hose in one part tight in another and he smacks them it is cold so let that be his excuse for showing the bottom of his bottle to the glittering spheres he takes perhaps a sturdier pull at the liquor than becomes a manifest instrument of providence whose services may be immediately required but he informs us that his ship was never known not to right itself when called upon he is alone in the world he tells us likewise if his one friend the uplifted flask is his enemy why then he feels bound to treat his enemy as his friend this with a pathetic allusion to his interior economy which was applauded and the remark ain't that christian which was just a trifle risky so he secured pit and gallery at a stroke by a surpassingly shrewd blow at the bishops of our church who are it can barely be contested in foul esteem with the multitude none can say exactly for what reason and must submit to be occasionally offered up as propitiatory sacrifices this good sailor was not always alone in the world a sweet girl whom he describes as reaching to his kneecap and pathetically believes still to be of the same height once called him brother jack to hear that name again from her lips and a particular song he attempts it ludicrously yet touchingly withal hark is it an echo from a spirit in the frigid air the song trembled with a silver ring to the remotest corners of the house at that moment the breathless hush of the audience was flurried by hearing dahlia called from the pit algernon had been spying among the close packed faces for a sight of rhoda rhoda was now standing up amid gathering hisses and outcries her eyes were bent on a particular box across which a curtain was hastily being drawn my sister she sent out a voice of anguish and remained with clasped hands and twisted eyebrows looking toward that one spot as if she would have flown to it she was wedged in the mass and could not move the exclamation heard had belonged to brother jack on the stage whose burst of fraternal surprise and rapture fell flat after it to the disgust of numbers keenly awakened for the sentiment of this scene roaring accusations that she was drunk that she had just escaped from bedlam for an evening that she should be gagged and turned headlong out surrounded her but she stood like a sculptured figure vital in her eyes alone the farmer put his arm about his girl's waist the instant however that anthony's head uprose on the other side of her the evil reputation he had been gaining for himself all through the evening produced a general clamour over which the gallery played miauling and yelping like dogs that are never to be divorced from a noise algernon feared mischief he quitted his seat and ran out into the lobby half a dozen steps and he came in contact with some one and they were mutually drenched with water by the shock it was his cousin edward bearing a glass in his hand algernon's wrath at the sight of this offender was stimulated by the cold bath but edward cut him short go in there he pointed to a box door a lady has fainted hold her up till i come no time was allowed for explanation algernon passed into the box and was alone with an inanimate shape in blue bournous the uproar in the theatre raged the whole pit was on its legs and shouting he lifted the pallid head over one arm miserably helpless and perplexed but his anxiety concerning rhoda's personal safety in that sea of strife prompted him to draw back the curtain a little and he stood exposed rhoda perceived him she motioned with both her hands in dumb supplication in a moment the curtain closed between them edward's sharp white face cursed him mutely for his folly while he turned and put the water to dahlia's lips and touched her forehead with it what's the matter whispered algernon we must get her out as quick as we can this is the way with women come she's recovering edward nursed her sternly as he spoke if she doesn't pretty soon we shall have the pit in upon us said algernon is she that girl's sister don't ask damned questions dahlia opened her eyes staring placidly now you can stand up my dear dahlia all's well try said edward she sighed murmuring what is the time and again what noise is it edward coughed in a vexed attempt at tenderness using all his force to be gentle with her as he brought her to her feet the task was difficult amid the threatening storm in the theatre and cries of show the young woman her sister for rhoda had won a party in the humane public dahlia in god's name give me your help edward called in her ear the fair girl's eyelids blinked wretchedly in protestation of her weakness she had no will either way and suffered herself to be led out of the box supported by the two young men run for a cab said edward and algernon went ahead he had one waiting for them as they came out they placed dahlia on a seat with care and edward jumping in drew an arm tightly about her i can't cry she moaned the cab was driving off as a crowd of people burst from the pit doors and algernon heard the voice of farmer fleming very hoarse he had discretion enough to retire chapter xiii robert was to drive to the station to meet rhoda and her father returning from london on a specified day he was eager to be asking cheerful questions of dahlia's health and happiness so that he might dispel the absurd general belief that he had ever loved the girl and was now regretting her absence but one look at rhoda's face when she stepped from the railway carriage kept him from uttering a word on that subject and the farmer's heavier droop and acceptance of a helping hand into the cart were signs of bad import mr fleming made no show of grief like one who nursed it he took it to all appearance as patiently as an old worn horse would do although such an outward submissiveness will not always indicate a placid spirit in men he talked at stale intervals of the weather and the state of the ground along the line of rail down home and pointed in contempt or approval to a field here and there but it was as one who no longer had any professional interest in the tilling of the land doubtless he was trained to have no understanding of a good to be derived by his communicating what he felt and getting sympathy once when he was uncertain and a secret pride in dahlia's beauty and accomplishments had whispered to him that her flight was possibly the opening of her road to a higher fortune he made a noise for comfort believing in his heart that she was still to be forgiven he knew better now by holding his peace he locked out the sense of shame which speech would have stirred within him got on pretty smooth with old mas' gammon he expressed his hope and robert said capitally we shall make something out of the old man yet never fear master gammon was condemned to serve at the ready set tea table as a butt for banter otherwise it was apprehended well that mrs sumfit would have scorched the ears of all present save the happy veteran of the furrows with repetitions of dahlia's name and wailings about her darling of whom no one spoke they suffered from her in spite of every precaution well then if i'm not to hear anything dooring meals as if i'd swallow it and take it into my stomach i'll wait again for what ye've got to tell she said and finished her cup at a gulp smoothing her apron the farmer then lifted his head mother if you've done you'll oblige me by going to bed he said we want the kitchen a bed cried mrs sumfit with instantly ruffled lap upstairs mother when you've done not before then bad's the noos something have happened william you 'm not going to push me out and my place is by the tea pot which i cling to rememberin' how i seen her curly head grow by inches up above the table and the cups mas' gammon she appealed to the sturdy feeder five cups is your number her hope was reduced to the prolonging of the service of tea with master gammon's kind assistance four marm said her inveterate antagonist as he finished that amount and consequently put the spoon in his cup mrs sumfit rolled in her chair o lord mas' gammon five i say and never a cup less so long as here you've been four marm i don't know said master gammon with a slow nod of his head that ever i took five cups of tea at a stretch not runnin' i do know mas' gammon and ought to for don't i pour out to ye it's five you take and please your cup if you'll hand it over four's my number marm master gammon reiterated resolutely he sat like a rock if they was dumplins moaned mrs sumfit not four no nor five 'd do till enough you'd had and here we might stick to our chairs but you'd go on and on you know you would that's eatin' marm master gammon condescended to explain the nature of his habits i'm reg'lar in my drinkin' mrs sumfit smote her hands together o lord mas' gammon the wearisomest old man i ever come across is you more tea's in the pot and it ain't watery and you won't be comfortable may you get forgiveness from above is all i say and i say no more mr robert perhaps you'll be so good as let me help you sir it's good tea and my dody she added cajolingly my home girl 'll tell us what she saw i'm pinched and starved to hear by and by mother interposed the farmer tomorrow he spoke gently but frowned both rhoda and robert perceived that they were peculiarly implicated in the business which was to be discussed without mrs sumfit's assistance her father's manner forbade rhoda from making any proposal for the relief of the forlorn old woman and me not to hear to night about your play going sighed mrs sumfit oh it's hard on me i do call it cruel and how my sweet was dressed like as for a ball she saw the farmer move his foot impatiently then if nobody drinks this remaining cup i will she pursued no voice save her own was heard till the cup was emptied upon which master gammon according to his wont departed for bed to avoid the seduction of suppers which he shunned as apoplectic and mrs sumfit prepared in a desolate way to wash the tea things but the farmer saying that it could be done in the morning went to the door and opened it for her she fetched a great sigh and folded her hands resignedly as she was passing him to make her miserable enforced exit the heavy severity of his face afflicted her with a deep alarm she fell on her knees crying oh william it ain't for sake of hearin' talk but you that went to see our dahly the blossom 've come back streaky under the eyes and you make the house feel as if we neighboured judgement day down to tea you set the first moment and me alone with none of you and my love for my girl known well to you and now to be marched off how can i go a bed and sleep and my heart jumps so it ain't christian to ask me to i got a heart dear i have do give a bit of comfort to it only a word of my dahly to me the farmer replied mother let's have no woman's nonsense what we've got to bear let us bear and you go on your knees to the lord and don't be a heathen woman i say get up there's a bible in your bedroom find you out comfort in that no william no she sobbed still kneeling there ain't a dose o' comfort there when poor souls is in the dark and haven't got patience for passages and me and my bible how can i read it and not know my ailing and a'stract one good word william it'll seem only the devil's shootin' black lightnings across the page as poor blessed granny used to say and she believed witches could do it to you in her time when they was evil minded no to night i look on the binding of the holy book and i don't and i won't i sha' n't open it this violent end to her petition was wrought by the farmer grasping her arm to bring her to her feet go to bed mother i shan't open it she repeated defiantly and it ain't she gathered up her comfortable fat person to assist the words it ain't good no not the best pious ones i shall and will say it as is al'ays ready to smack your face with the bible now don't ye be angry said the farmer she softened instantly william dear i got fifty seven pounds sterling and odd shillings in a savings bank and that i meant to go to dahly and not to yond' dark thing sitting there so sullen and me in my misery i'd give it to you now for news of my darlin' yes william and my poor husband's cottage in sussex seventeen pound per annum that if you'll be goodness itself and let me hear a word take her upstairs said the farmer to rhoda and rhoda went by her and took her hands and by dint of pushing from behind and dragging in front mrs sumfit as near on a shriek as one so fat and sleek could be was ejected the farmer and robert heard her struggles and exclamations along the passage but her resistance subsided very suddenly there's power in that girl said the farmer standing by the shut door robert thought so too it affected his imagination and his heart began to beat sickeningly perhaps she promised to speak what has happened whatever that may be he suggested not she not she she respects my wishes robert did not ask what had happened mr fleming remained by the door and shut his mouth from a further word till he heard rhoda's returning footstep he closed the door again behind her and went up to the square deal table leaned his body forward on the knuckles of his trembling fist and said we're pretty well broken up as it is i've lost my taste for life there he paused save by the shining of a wet forehead his face betrayed nothing of the anguish he suffered he looked at neither of them but sent his gaze straight away under labouring brows to an arm of the fireside chair while his shoulders drooped on the wavering support of his hard shut hands rhoda's eyes ox like as were her father's smote full upon robert's as in a pang of apprehension of what was about to be uttered it was a quick blaze of light wherein he saw that the girl's spirit was not with him he would have stopped the farmer at once but he had not the heart to do it even had he felt in himself strength to attract an intelligent response from that strange grave bovine fixity of look over which the human misery sat as a thing not yet taken into the dull brain my taste for life the old man resumed that's gone i didn't bargain at set out to go on fighting agen the world it's too much for a man o' my years here's the farm shall 't go to pieces i'm a farmer of thirty year back thirty year back and more i'm about no better'n a farm labourer in our time which is to day i don't cost much i ask to be fed and to work for it and to see my poor bit o' property safe as handed to me by my father not for myself 't ain't though perhaps there's a bottom of pride there too as in most things say it's for the name my father seems to demand of me out loud 'what ha' ye done with queen anne's farm william' and there's a holler echo in my ears well god wasn't merciful to give me a son he give me daughters mr fleming bowed his head as to the very weapon of chastisement daughters he bent lower his hearers might have imagined his headless address to them to be also without a distinct termination for he seemed to have ended as abruptly as he had begun so long was the pause before with a wearied lifting of his body he pursued in a sterner voice don't let none interrupt me his hand was raised as toward where rhoda stood but he sent no look with it the direction was wide of her the aspect of the blank blind hand motioning to the wall away from her smote an awe through her soul that kept her dumb though his next words were like thrusts of a dagger in her side my first girl she's brought disgrace on this house she's got a mother in heaven and that mother's got to blush for her my first girl's gone to harlotry in london it was scriptural severity of speech robert glanced quick with intense commiseration at rhoda he saw her hands travel upward till they fixed in at her temples with crossed fingers making the pressure of an iron band for her head while her lips parted and her teeth and cheeks and eyeballs were all of one whiteness her tragic even in and out breathing where there was no fall of the breast but the air was taken and given as it were the square blade of a sharp edged sword was dreadful to see she had the look of a risen corpse recalling some one of the bloody ends of life the farmer went on bury her now you here know the worst there's my second girl she's got no stain on her if people 'll take her for what she is herself she's idle but i believe the flesh on her bones she'd wear away for any one that touched her heart she's a temper but she's clean both in body and in spirit as i believe and say before my god i what i'd pray for is to see this girl safe all i have shall go to her that is to the man who will won't be ashamed marry her i mean the tide of his harshness failed him here and he began to pick his words now feeble now emphatic but alike wanting in natural expression for he had reached a point of emotion upon the limits of his nature and he was now wilfully forcing for misery and humiliation right and left in part to show what a black star providence had been over him she'll be grateful i shall be gone what disgrace i bring to their union as father of the other one also will i'm bound to hope be buried with me in my grave so that this girl's husband shan't have to complain that her character and her working for him ain't enough to cover any harm he's like to think o' the connexion and he won't be troubled by relationships after that i used to think pride a bad thing i thank god we've all got it in our blood the flemings i thank god for that now i do we don't face again them as we offend not that is with the hand out we go we're seen no more and she'll be seen no more on that rely i want my girl here not to keep me in the fear of death for i fear death while she's not safe in somebody's hands kind if i can get him for her somebody young or old the farmer lifted his head for the first time and stared vacantly at robert i'd marry her he said if i was knowing myself dying now or to morrow morning i'd marry her rather than leave her alone i'd marry her to that old man old gammon the farmer pointed to the ceiling his sombre seriousness cloaked and carried even that suggestive indication to the possible bridegroom's age and habits and all things associated with him through the gates of ridicule and there was no laughter and no thought of it it stands to reason for me to prefer a young man for her husband he'll farm the estate and won't sell it so that it goes to our blood if not to a fleming if i mean he's content to farm soberly and not play jack o' lantern tricks across his own acres right in one thing's right i grant but don't argue right in all it's right only in one thing young men when they've made a true hit or so they're ready to think it's themselves that's right this was of course a reminder of the old feud with robert and sufficiently showed whom the farmer had in view for a husband to rhoda if any doubt existed previously having raised his eyes his unwonted power of speech abandoned him and he concluded wavering in look and in tone i'd half forgotten her uncle i've reckoned his riches when i cared for riches i can't say th' amount but all i've had his word for it all goes to this god knows how much girl and he don't hesitate to say she's worth a young man's fancying may be so it depends upon ideas mainly that does all goes to her and this farm i wish ye good night he gave them no other sign but walked in his oppressed way quietly to the inner door and forth leaving the rest to them chapter xiv the two were together and all preliminary difficulties had been cleared for robert to say what he had to say in a manner to make the saying of it well nigh impossible and yet silence might be misinterpreted by her he would have drawn her to his heart at one sign of tenderness there came none the girl was frightfully torn with a great wound of shame she was the first to speak do you believe what father says of my sister that she robert swallowed the words no and he made a thunder with his fist no she drank up the word you do not no you know that dahlia is innocent rhoda was trembling with a look for the asseveration her pale face eager as a cry for life but the answer did not come at once hotly as her passion for it demanded she grew rigid murmuring faintly speak do speak his eyes fell away from hers sweet love would have wrought in him to think as she thought but she kept her heart closed from him and he stood sadly judicial with a conscience of his own that would not permit him to declare dahlia innocent for he had long been imagining the reverse rhoda pressed her hands convulsively moaning oh down a short deep breath tell me what has happened said robert made mad by that reproachful agony of her voice i'm in the dark i'm not equal to you all if dahlia's sister wants one to stand up for her and defend her whatever she has done or not done ask me ask me and i'll revenge her here am i and i know nothing and you despise me because don't think me rude or unkind this hand is yours if you will come rhoda or let me hear the case and i'll satisfy you as best i can feel for her i feel for her as you do you don't want me to stand a liar to your question how can i speak a woman's instinct at red heat pierces the partial disingenuousness which robert could only have avoided by declaring the doubts he entertained rhoda desired simply to be supported by his conviction of her sister's innocence and she had scorn of one who would not chivalrously advance upon the risks of right and wrong and rank himself prime champion of a woman belied absent and so helpless besides there was but one virtue possible in rhoda's ideas as regarded dahlia to oppose facts if necessary and have her innocent perforce and fight to the death them that dared cast slander on the beloved head her keen instinct served her so far his was alive when she refused to tell him what had taken place during their visit to london she felt that a man would judge evil of the circumstances her father and her uncle had done so she felt that robert would love for him would have prompted her to confide in him absolutely she was not softened by love there was no fire on her side to melt and make them run in one stream and they could not meet then if you will not tell me said robert say what you think of your father's proposal he meant that i may ask you to be my wife he used to fancy i cared for your sister that's false i care for her yes as my sister too and here is my hand to do my utmost for her but i love you and i've loved you for some time i'd be proud to marry you and help on with the old farm you don't love me yet which is a pretty hard thing for me to see to be certain of but i love you and i trust you i like the stuff you're made of and nice stuff i'm talking to a young woman he added wiping his forehead at the idea of the fair and flattering addresses young women expect when they are being wooed as it was rhoda listened with savage contempt of his idle talk her brain was beating at the mystery and misery wherein dahlia lay engulfed she had no understanding for robert's sentimentality or her father's requisition some answer had to be given and she said i'm not likely to marry a man who supposes he has anything to pardon i don't suppose it cried robert you heard what father said i heard what he said but i don't think the same what has dahlia to do with you he was proceeding to rectify this unlucky sentence all her covert hostility burst out on it my sister what has my sister to do with me you mean you mean you can only mean that we are to be separated and thought of as two people and we are one and will be till we die i feel my sister's hand in mine though she's away and lost she is my darling for ever and ever we're one a spasm of anguish checked the girl i mean robert resumed steadily that her conduct good or bad doesn't touch you if it did it'd be the same to me i ask you to take me for your husband just reflect on what your father said rhoda the horrible utterance her father's lips had been guilty of flashed through her filling her with mastering vindictiveness now that she had a victim yes i'm to take a husband to remind me of what he said robert eyed her sharpened mouth admiringly her defence of her sister had excited his esteem wilfully though she rebutted his straightforward earnestness and he had a feeling also for the easy turns of her neck and the confident poise of her figure ha well he interjected with his eyebrows queerly raised so that she could make nothing of his look it seemed half maniacal it was so ridged with bright eagerness by heaven the task of taming you that's the blessing i'd beg for in my prayers though you were as wild as a cat of the woods by heaven i'd rather have the taming of you than go about with a leash of quiet he checked himself companions such was the sudden roll of his tongue that she was lost in the astounding lead he had taken and stared you're the beauty to my taste and devil is what i want in a woman i can make something out of a girl with a temper like yours you don't know me miss rhoda i'm what you reckon a good young man isn't that it robert drew up with a very hard smile i would to god i were mind i feel for you about your sister i like you the better for holding to her through thick and thin but my sheepishness has gone and i tell you i'll have you whether you will or no i can help you and you can help me i've lived here as if i had no more fire in me than old gammon snoring on his pillow up aloft and who kept me to it did you see i never touched liquor what did you guess from that that i was a mild sort of fellow so i am but i haven't got that reputation in other parts your father 'd like me to marry you and i'm ready who kept me to work so that i might learn to farm and be a man and be able to take a wife i came here i'll tell you how i was a useless dog i ran from home and served as a trooper an old aunt of mine left me a little money which just woke me up and gave me a lift of what conscience i had and i bought myself out i chanced to see your father's advertisement came looked at you all and liked you brought my traps and settled among you and lived like a good young man i like peace and orderliness i find i always thought i did when i was dancing like mad to hell i know i do now and you're the girl to keep me to it i've learnt that much by degrees with any other i should have been playing the fool and going my old ways long ago i should have wrecked her and drunk to forget you're my match by and by you'll know me yours you never gave me or anybody else that i've seen sly sidelooks come i'll speak out now i'm at work i thought you at some girl's games in the summer you went out one day to meet a young gentleman offence or no offence i speak and you listen you did go out i was in love with you then too i saw london had been doing its mischief i was down about it i felt that he would make nothing of you but i chose to take the care of you and you've hated me ever since that mr algernon blancove's a rascal stop you'll say as much as you like presently i give you a warning the man's a rascal i didn't play spy on your acts but your looks i can read a face like yours and it's my home my home by heaven it is now rhoda you know a little more of me perhaps i'm more of a man than you thought marry another if you will but i'm the man for you and i know it and you'll go wrong if you don't too come let your father sleep well give me your hand all through this surprising speech of robert's which was a revelation of one who had been previously dark to her she had steeled her spirit as she felt herself being borne upon unexpected rapids and she marvelled when she found her hand in his dismayed as if caught in a trap she said you know i've no love for you at all none no doubt he answered the fit of verbal energy was expended and he had become listless though he looked frankly at her and assumed the cheerfulness which was failing within him i wish to remain as i am she faltered surprised again by the equally astonishing recurrence of humility and more spiritually subdued by it i've no heart for a change father will understand i am safe she ended with a cry oh my dear my own sister i wish you were safe get her here to me and i'll do what i can if you're not hard on her she's so beautiful she can't do wrong my dahlia's in some trouble mr robert you might really be her friend drop the mister said robert father will listen to you she pleaded you won't leave us tell him you know i am safe but i haven't a feeling of any kind while my sister's away i will call you robert if you like she reached her hand forth that's right he said taking it with a show of heartiness that's a beginning i suppose she shrank a little in his sensitive touch and he added oh never fear i've spoken out and don't do the thing too often now you know me that's enough i trust you so trust me i'll talk to your father i've got a dad of my own who isn't so easily managed you and i rhoda we're about the right size for a couple there don't be frightened i was only thinking i'll let go your hand in a minute if dahlia's to be found i'll find her thank you for that squeeze you'd wake a dead man to life if you wanted to to morrow i set about the business that's settled now your hand's loose are you going to say good night you must give me your hand again for that what a rough fellow i must seem to you different from the man you thought i was i'm just what you choose to make me rhoda remember that by heaven go at once for you're an armful she took a candle and started for the door aha you can look fearful as a doe out make haste in her hurry at his speeding gestures the candle dropped she was going to pick it up but as he approached she stood away frightened one kiss my girl he said don't keep me jealous as fire one and i'm a plighted man one or i shall swear you know what kisses are why did you go out to meet that fellow do you think there's no danger in it doesn't he go about boasting of it now and saying that girl but kiss me and i'll forget it i'll forgive you kiss me only once and i shall be certain you don't care for him that's the thought maddens me outright i can't bear it now i've seen you look soft i'm stronger than you mind he caught her by the waist yes rhoda gasped you are you are only a brute a brute's a lucky dog then for i've got you will you touch me you're in my power it's a miserable thing robert why don't you struggle my girl i shall kiss you in a minute you're never my friend again i'm not a gentleman i suppose never after this it isn't done and first you're like a white rose and next you're like a red will you submit oh shame rhoda uttered because i'm not a gentleman you are not so if i could make you a lady eh the lips 'd be ready in a trice you think of being made a lady a lady his arm relaxed in the clutch of her figure she got herself free and said we saw mr blancove at the theatre with dahlia it was her way of meeting his accusation that she had cherished an ambitious feminine dream he to hide a confusion that had come upon him was righting the fallen candle now i know you can be relied on you can defend yourself he said and handed it to her lighted you keep your kisses for this or that young gentleman quite right you really can defend yourself that's all i was up to so let us hear that you forgive me the door's open you won't be bothered by me any more and don't hate me overmuch you might have learned to trust me without insulting me robert she said do you fancy i'd take such a world of trouble for a kiss of your lips sweet as they are his blusterous beginning ended in a speculating glance at her mouth she saw it would be wise to accept him in his present mood and go and with a gentle good night that might sound like pardon she passed through the doorway chapter xv next day while squire blancove was superintending the laying down of lines for a new carriage drive in his park as he walked slowly up the green slope he perceived farmer fleming supported by a tall young man and when the pair were nearer he had the gratification of noting likewise that the worthy yeoman was very much bent as with an acute attack of his well known chronic malady of a want of money the squire greatly coveted the freehold of queen anne's farm he had made offers to purchase it till he was tired and had gained for himself the credit of being at the bottom of numerous hypothetical cabals to injure and oust the farmer from his possession but if naboth came with his vineyard in his hand not even wrexby's rector his quarrel with whom haunted every turn in his life could quote scripture against him for taking it at a proper valuation the squire had employed his leisure time during service in church to discover a text that might be used against him in the event of the farmer's reduction to a state of distress and his the squire's making the most of it on the contrary according to his heathenish reading of some of the patriarchal doings there was more to be said in his favour than not if he increased his territorial property nor could he throughout the old testament hit on one sentence that looked like a personal foe to his projects likely to fit into the mouth of the rector of wrexby well farmer he said with cheerful familiarity winter crops looking well there's a good show of green in the fields from my windows as good as that land of yours will allow in heavy seasons to this the farmer replied i've not heart or will to be round about squire if you'll listen to me here or where you give command has it anything to do with pen and paper fleming in that case you'd better be in my study said the squire i don't know that it have i don't know that it have the farmer sought robert's face best where there's no chance of interruption robert counselled and lifted his hat to the squire eh well you see i'm busy the latter affected a particular indifference that in such cases when well acted as lords of money can do squires equally with usurers may be valued at hundreds of pounds in the pocket can't you put it off come again to morrow to morrow's a day too late said the farmer gravely whereto replying oh well come along in then the squire led the way you're two to one if it's a transaction he said nodding to robert to close the library door take seats now then what is it and if i make a face just oblige me by thinking nothing about it for my gout's beginning to settle in the leg again and shoots like an electric telegraph from purgatory he wheezed and lowered himself into his arm chair but the farmer and robert remained standing and the farmer spoke my words are going to be few squire i've got a fact to bring to your knowledge and a question to ask surprise exaggerated on his face by a pain he had anticipated made the squire glare hideously confound it that's what they say to a prisoner in the box here's a murder committed are you the guilty person fact and question well out with 'em both together a father ain't responsible for the sins of his children said the farmer well that's a fact the squire emphasized i've always maintained it but if you go to your church farmer small blame to you if you don't that fellow who preaches there i forget his name stands out for just the other way you are responsible he swears pay your son's debts and don't groan over it he spent the money and you're the chief debtor that's his teaching well go on what's your question a father's not to be held responsible for the sins of his children squire my daughter's left me she's away i saw my daughter at the theatre in london she saw me and saw her sister with me she disappeared it's a hard thing for a man to be saying of his own flesh and blood she disappeared she went knowing her father's arms open to her she was in company with your son the squire was thrumming on the arm of his chair he looked up vaguely as if waiting for the question to follow but meeting the farmer's settled eyes he cried irritably well what's that to me what's that to you squire are you going to make me out responsible for my son's conduct my son's a rascal everybody knows that i paid his debts once and i've finished with him don't come to me about the fellow if there's a greater curse than the gout it's a son my girl said the farmer she's my flesh and blood and i must find her and i'm here to ask you to make your son tell me where she's to be found leave me to deal with that young man leave you me but i want my girl but i can't give her to you roared the squire afflicted by his two great curses at once why do you come to me i'm not responsible for the doings of the dog i'm sorry for you if that's what you want to know do you mean to say that my son took her away from your house i don't do so mr blancove i'm seeking for my daughter and i see her in company with your son very well very well said the squire that shows his habits i can't say more but what has it got to do with me the farmer looked helplessly at robert no no the squire sung out no interlopers no interpreting here i listen to you my son your daughter i understand that so far it's between us two you've got a daughter who's gone wrong somehow i'm sorry to hear it i've got a son who never went right and it's no comfort to me upon my word if you were to see the bills and the letters i receive but i don't carry my grievances to my neighbours i should think fleming you'd do best if it's advice you're seeking to keep it quiet don't make a noise about it neighbours' gossip i find pretty well the worst thing a man has to bear who's unfortunate enough to own children the farmer bowed his head with that bitter humbleness which characterized his reception of the dealings of providence toward him my neighbours 'll soon be none at all he said let 'em talk i'm not abusing you mr blancove i'm a broken man but i want my poor lost girl and by god responsible for your son or not you must help me to find her she may be married as she says she mayn't be but i must find her the squire hastily seized a scrap of paper on the table and wrote on it there he handed the paper to the farmer that's my son's address 'boyne's bank city london' go to him there and you'll find him perched on a stool and a good drubbing won't hurt him you've my hearty permission i can assure you you may say so 'boyne's bank' anybody will show you the place he's a rascally clerk in the office and precious useful i dare swear thrash him if you think fit ay said the farmer boyne's bank i've been there already he's absent from work on a visit down into hampshire one of the young gentlemen informed me fairly park was the name of the place but i came to you mr blancove for you're his father well now my good fleming i hope you think i'm properly punished for that fact the squire stood up with horrid contortions robert stepped in advance of the farmer pardon me sir he said though the squire met his voice with a prodigious frown this would be an ugly business to talk about as you observe it would hurt mr fleming in these parts of the country and he would leave it if he thought fit but you can't separate your name from your son's begging you to excuse the liberty i take in mentioning it not in public and your son has the misfortune to be well known in one or two places where he was quartered when in the cavalry that matter of the jeweller hulloa the squire exclaimed in a perturbation why sir i know all about it because i was a trooper in the regiment your son mr algernon blancove quitted and his name if i may take leave to remark so won't bear printing how far he's guilty before mr fleming we can't tell as yet but if mr fleming holds him guilty of an offence your son 'll bear the consequences and what's done will be done thoroughly proper counsel will be taken as needn't be said mr fleming applied to you first partly for your sake as well as his own he can find friends both to advise and to aid him you mean sir thundered the squire that he can find enemies of mine like that infernal fellow who goes by the title of reverend down below there that'll do that will do there's some extortion at the bottom of this you're putting on a screw we're putting on a screw sir said robert coolly not a penny will you get by it robert flushed with heat of blood you don't wish you were a young man half so much as i do just now he remarked and immediately they were in collision for the squire made a rush to the bell rope and robert stopped him we're going he said we don't want man servants to show us the way out now mark me mr blancove you've insulted an old man in his misery you shall suffer for it and so shall your son whom i know to be a rascal worthy of transportation you think mr fleming came to you for money look at this old man whose only fault is that he's too full of kindness he came to you just for help to find his daughter with whom your rascal of a son was last seen and you swear he's come to rob you of money don't you know yourself a fattened cur squire though you be and called gentleman england's a good place but you make england a hell to men of spirit sit in your chair and don't ever you or any of you cross my path and speak a word to your servants before we're out of the house and i stand in the hall and give 'em your son's history and make wrexby stink in your nostril till you're glad enough to fly out of it now mr fleming there's no more to be done here the game lies elsewhere robert took the farmer by the arm and was marching out of the enemy's territory in good order when the squire who had presented many changeing aspects of astonishment and rage arrested them with a call he began to say that he spoke to mr fleming and not to the young ruffian of a bully whom the farmer had brought there and then asked in a very reasonable manner what he could do what measures he could adopt to aid the farmer in finding his child robert hung modestly in the background while the farmer laboured on with a few sentences to explain the case and finally the squire said that his foot permitting it was an almost pathetic reference to the weakness of flesh he would go down to fairly on the day following and have a personal interview with his son and set things right as far as it lay in his power though he was by no means answerable for a young man's follies he was a little frightened by the farmer's having said that dahlia according to her own declaration was married and therefore himself the more anxious to see mr algernon and hear the truth from his estimable offspring whom he again stigmatized as a curse terrible to him as his gouty foot but nevertheless just as little to be left to his own devices the farmer bowed to these observations as also when the squire counselled him for his own sake not to talk of his misfortune all over the parish i'm not a likely man for that squire but there's no telling where gossips get their crumbs it's about it's about about my son cried the squire my daughter oh well good day the squire resumed more cheerfully i'll go down to fairly and you can't ask more than that when the farmer was out of the house and out of hearing he rebuked robert for the inconsiderate rashness of his behaviour and pointed out how he the farmer by being patient and peaceful had attained to the object of his visit robert laughed without defending himself i shouldn't ha' known ye the farmer repeated frequently i shouldn't ha' known ye robert no i'm a trifle changed may be robert agreed i'm going to claim a holiday of you i've told rhoda that if dahlia's to be found i'll find her and i can't do it by sticking here give me three weeks the land's asleep old gammon can hardly turn a furrow the wrong way there's nothing to do which is his busiest occupation when he's not interrupted at it mas' gammon's a rare old man said the farmer emphatically so i say else how would you see so many farms flourishing come robert you hit th' old man hard you should learn to forgive so i do and a telling blow's a man's best road to charity i'd forgive the squire and many another if i had them within two feet of my fist do you forgive my girl rhoda for putting of you off robert screwed in his cheek well yes i do he said only it makes me feel thirsty that's all the farmer remembered this when they had entered the farm our beer's so poor robert he made apology but rhoda shall get you some for you to try if you like rhoda robert's solemn thirsty shall i said rhoda and she stood awaiting his bidding i'm not a thirsty subject replied robert you know i've avoided drink of any kind since i set foot on this floor but when i drink he pitched his voice to a hard sparkling heartiness i drink a lot and the stuff must be strong i'm very much obliged to you miss rhoda for what you're so kind as to offer to satisfy my thirst and you can't give better and don't suppose that i'm complaining but your father's right it is rather weak and wouldn't break the tooth of my thirst if i drank at it till gammon left off thinking about his dinner with that he announced his approaching departure the farmer dropped into his fireside chair dumb and spiritless a shadow was over the house and the inhabitants moved about their domestic occupations silent as things that feel the thunder cloud before sunset robert was gone on his long walk to the station and rhoda felt a woman's great envy of the liberty of a man who has not if it pleases him not to sit and eat grief among familiar images in a home that furnishes its altar flame chapter xvi fairly lord elling's seat in hampshire lay over the warbeach river a white mansion among great oaks in view of the summer sails and winter masts of the yachting squadron the house was ruled during the congregation of the christmas guests by charming mrs lovell who relieved the invalid lady of the house of the many serious cares attending the reception of visitors and did it all with ease under her sovereignty the place was delightful and if it was by repute pleasanter to young men than to any other class it will be admitted that she satisfied those who are loudest in giving tongue to praise edward and algernon journeyed down to fairly together after the confidence which the astute young lawyer had been compelled to repose in his cousin sir william blancove was to be at fairly and it was at his father's pointed request that edward had accepted mrs lovell's invitation half in doubt as to the lady's disposition toward him edward eased his heart with sneers at the soft sanguinary graciousness they were to expect and racked mythology for spiteful comparisons while algernon vehemently defended her with a battering fire of british adjectives in superlative he as much as hinted under instigation that he was entitled to defend her and his claim being by and by yawningly allowed by edward and presuming that he now had edward in his power and need not fear him he exhibited his weakness in the guise of a costly gem that he intended to present to mrs lovell an opal set in a cross pendant from a necklace a really fine opal coquetting with the lights of every gem that is known it shot succinct red flashes and green and yellow the emerald the amethyst the topaz lived in it and a remote ruby it was veined with lightning hues and at times it slept in a milky cloud innocent of fire quite maidenlike that will suit her was edward's remark i didn't want to get anything common said algernon making the gem play before his eyes a pretty stone said edward do you think so very pretty indeed harlequin pattern to be presented to columbine the harlequin pattern is of the best sort you know perhaps you like the watery ones best this is fresh from russia there's a set i've my eye on i shall complete it in time i want peggy lovell to wear the jolliest opals in the world it's rather nice isn't it it's a splendid opal said edward she likes opals said algernon she'll take your meaning at once said edward how i'll be hanged if i know what my meaning is ned don't you know the signification of your gift not a bit oh you'll be oriental when you present it the deuce i shall it means 'you're the prettiest widow in the world' so she is i'll be right there old boy and 'you're a rank right down widow and no mistake you're everything to everybody not half so innocent as you look you're green as jealousy red as murder yellow as jaundice and put on the whiteness of a virgin when you ought to be blushing like a penitent' in short 'you have no heart of your own and you pretend to possess half a dozen you're devoid of one steady beam and play tricks with every scale of colour you're an arrant widow and that's what you are' an eloquent gift algy gad if it means all that it'll be rather creditable to me said algernon do opals mean widows of course was the answer well she is a widow and i suppose she's going to remain one for she's had lots of offers if i marry a girl i shall never like her half as much as peggy lovell she's done me up for every other woman living she never lets me feel a fool with her and she has a way by jove of looking at me and letting me know she's up to my thoughts and isn't angry what's the use of my thinking of her at all she'd never go to the colonies and live in a log but and make cheeses while i tore about on horseback gathering cattle i don't think she would observed edward emphatically i don't think she would and i shall never have money confound stingy parents it's a question whether i shall get wrexby there's no entail i'm heir to the governor's temper and his gout i dare say he'll do as he likes with the estate i call it beastly unfair edward asked how much the opal had cost oh nothing said algernon that is i never pay for jewellery edward was curious to know how he managed to obtain it why you see algernon explained they the jewellers i've got two or three in hand the fellows are acquainted with my position and they speculate on my expectations there is no harm in that if they like it i look at their trinkets and say 'i've no money' and they say 'never mind' and i don't mind much the understanding is that i pay them when i inherit in gout and bad temper gad if i inherit nothing else they'll have lots of that for indemnification it's a good system ned it enables a young fellow like me to get through the best years of his life which i take to be his youth without that squalid poverty bothering him you can make presents and wear a pin or a ring if it takes your eye you look well and you make yourself agreeable and i see nothing to complain of in that the jewellers then have established an institution to correct one of the errors of providence oh put it in your long winded way if you like said algernon all i know is that i should often have wanted a five pound note if that is if i hadn't happened to be dressed like a gentleman with your prospects ned i should propose to charming peggy tomorrow morning early we mustn't let her go out of the family if i can't have her i'd rather you would you forget the incumbrances on one side said edward his face darkening oh that's all to be managed algernon rallied him why ned you'll have twenty thousand a year if you have a penny and you'll go into parliament and give dinners and a woman like peggy lovell 'd intrigue for you like the deuce a great deal too like edward muttered as for that pretty girl continued algernon but edward peremptorily stopped all speech regarding dahlia his desire was while he made holiday to shut the past behind a brazen gate which being communicated sympathetically to his cousin the latter chimed to it in boisterous shouts of anticipated careless jollity at fairly park crying out how they would hunt and snap fingers at jews and all mortal sorrows and have a fortnight or three weeks perhaps a full month of the finest life possible to man with good horses good dinners good wines good society at command and a queen of a woman to rule and order everything edward affected a disdainful smile at the prospect but was in reality the weaker of the two in his thirst for it they arrived at fairly in time to dress for dinner and in the drawing room mrs lovell sat to receive them she looked up to edward's face an imperceptible half second longer than the ordinary form of welcome accords one of the looks which are nothing at all when there is no spiritual apprehension between young people and are so much when there is to algernon who was gazing opals on her she simply gave her fingers at her right hand was sir john capes her antique devotee a pure milky white old gentleman with sparkling fingers who played apollo to his daphne and was out of breath lord suckling a boy with a boisterous constitution and a guardsman had his place near her left hand as if ready to seize it at the first whisper of encouragement or opportunity a very little lady of seventeen miss adeline gosling trembling with shyness under a cover of demureness fell to edward's lot to conduct down to dinner where he neglected her disgracefully his father sir william was present at the table and lord elling with whom he was in repute as a talker and a wit quickened with his host's renowned good wine and the bare renown of a wine is inspiriting edward pressed to be brilliant he had an epigrammatic turn and though his mind was prosaic when it ran alone he could appear inventive and fanciful with the rub of other minds now at a table where good talking is cared for the triumphs of the excelling tongue are not for a moment to be despised even by the huge appetite of the monster vanity for a year edward had abjured this feast before the birds appeared and the champagne had ceased to make its circle he felt that he was now at home again and that the term of his wandering away from society was one of folly he felt the joy and vigour of a creature returned to his element why had he ever quitted it already he looked back upon dahlia from a prodigious distance he knew that there was something to be smoothed over something written in the book of facts which had to be smeared out and he seemed to do it while he drank the babbling wine and heard himself talk not one man at that table as he reflected would consider the bond which held him in any serious degree binding a lady is one thing and a girl of the class dahlia had sprung from altogether another he could not help imagining the sort of appearance she would make there and the thought even was a momentary clog upon his tongue how he used to despise these people especially he had despised the young men as brainless cowards in regard to their views of women and conduct toward them all that was changed he fancied now that they on the contrary would despise him if only they could be aware of the lingering sense he entertained of his being in bondage under a sacred obligation to a farmer's daughter but he had one thing to discover and that was why sir william had made it a peculiar request that he should come to meet him here could the desire possibly be to reconcile him with mrs lovell his common sense rejected the idea at once sir william boasted of her wit and tact and admired her beauty but edward remembered his having responded tacitly to his estimate of her character and sir william was not the man to court the alliance of his son with a woman like mrs lovell he perceived that his father and the fair widow frequently took counsel together edward laughed at the notion that the grave senior had himself become fascinated but without utterly scouting it until he found that the little lady whom he had led to dinner the first day was an heiress and from that and other indications he exactly divined the nature of his father's provident wishes but this revelation rendered mrs lovell's behaviour yet more extraordinary could it be credited that she was abetting sir william's schemes with all her woman's craft has she thought edward become so indifferent to me as to care for my welfare he determined to put her to the test he made love to adeline gosling nothing that he did disturbed the impenetrable complacency of mrs lovell she threw them together as she shuffled the guests she really seemed to him quite indifferent enough to care for his welfare it was a point in the mysterious ways of women or of widows that edward's experience had not yet come across all the parties immediately concerned were apparently so desperately acquiescing in his suit that he soon grew uneasy mrs lovell not only shuffled him into places with the raw heiress but with the child's mother of whom he spoke to algernon as of one too strongly breathing of matrimony to appease the cravings of an eclectic mind make the path clear for me then said algernon if you don't like the girl pitch her tales about me say i've got a lot in me though i don't let it out the game's up between you and peggy lovell that's clear she don't forgive you my boy ass muttered edward seeing by the light of his perception that he was too thoroughly forgiven a principal charm of the life at fairly to him was that there was no one complaining no one looked reproach at him if a lady was pale and reserved she did not seem to accuse him and to require coaxing all faces here were as light as the flying moment and did not carry the shadowy weariness of years like that burdensome fair face in the london lodging house to which the fates had terribly attached themselves so he was gay he closed as it were a black volume and opened a new and a bright one young men easily fancy that they may do this and that when the black volume is shut the tide is stopped saying i was a fool they believe they have put an end to the foolishness what father teaches them that a human act once set in motion flows on for ever to the great account our deathlessness is in what we do not in what we are comfortable youth thinks otherwise the days at a well ordered country house where a divining lady rules speed to the measure of a waltz in harmonious circles dropping like crystals into the gulfs of time and appearing to write nothing in his book not a single hinge of existence is heard to creak there is no after dinner bill you are waited on without being elbowed by the humanity of your attendants it is a civilized arcadia only do not desire that you may not envy accept humbly what rights of citizenship are accorded to you upon entering discard the passions when you cross the threshold to breathe and to swallow merely are the duties which should prescribe your conduct or such is the swollen condition of the animal in this enchanted region that the spirit of man becomes dangerously beset edward breathed and swallowed and never went beyond the prescription save by talking no other junior could enter the library without encountering the scorn of his elders so he enjoyed the privilege of hearing all the scandal and his natural cynicism was plentifully fed it was more of a school to him than he knew these veterans in their arm chairs stripped the bloom from life and showed it to be bare bones they took their wisdom for an experience of the past they were but giving their sensations in the present not to perceive this is youth's error when it hears old gentlemen talking at their ease on the third morning of their stay at fairly algernon came into edward's room with a letter in his hand there read that he said it isn't ill luck it's infernal persecution what on earth why i took a close cab to the station you saw me get out of it i'll swear no creditor of mine knew i was leaving london my belief is that the fellows who give credit have spies about at every railway terminus in the kingdom they won't give me three days' peace it's enough to disgust any man with civilized life on my soul it is edward glanced at the superscription of the letter not posted he remarked no delivered by some confounded bailiff who's been hounding me bailiffs don't generally deal in warnings will you read it algernon shouted the letter ran thus mr algernon blancove the writer of this intends taking the first opportunity of meeting you and gives you warning you will have to answer his question with a yes or a no and speak from your conscience the respectfulness of his behaviour to you as a gentleman will depend upon that algernon followed his cousin's eye down to the last letter in the page what do you think of it he asked eagerly edward's broad thin lined brows were drawn down in gloom mastering some black meditation in his brain he answered algernon's yells for an opinion i think well i think bailiffs have improved in their manners and show you they are determined to belong to the social march in an age of universal progress nothing can be more comforting but suppose this fellow comes across me don't know him suppose he insists on knowing me don't know yourself yes but hang it if he catches hold of me shake him off suppose he won't let go cut him with your horsewhip you think it's about a debt then intimidation evidently i shall announce to him that the great edward blancove is not to be intimidated you'll let me borrow your name old ned i've stood by you in my time as for leaving fairly i tell you i can't it's too delightful to be near peggy lovell edward smiled with a peculiar friendliness and algernon went off very well contented with his cousin chapter xvii within a mile of fairly park lay the farm of another yeoman but he was of another character the hampshireman was a farmer of renown in his profession fifth of a family that had cultivated a small domain of one hundred and seventy acres with sterling profit and in a style to make sutton the model of a perfect farm throughout the country royal eyes had inspected his pigs approvingly royal wits had taken hints from jonathan eccles in matters agricultural and it was his comforting joke that he had taught his prince good breeding in return for the service his prince had transformed a lusty radical into a devoted royalist framed on the walls of his parlours were letters from his prince thanking him for specimen seeds and worthy counsel veritable autograph letters of the highest value the prince had steamed up the salt river upon which the sutton harvests were mirrored and landed on a spot marked in honour of the event by a broad grey stone and from that day jonathan eccles stood on a pinnacle of pride enabling him to see horizons of despondency hitherto unknown to him for he had a son and the son was a riotous devil a most wild young fellow who had no taste for a farmer's life and openly declared his determination not to perpetuate the sutton farm in the hands of the eccleses by running off one day and entering the ranks of the british army those framed letters became melancholy objects for contemplation when jonathan thought that no posterity of his would point them out gloryingly in emulation man's aim is to culminate but it is the saddest thing in the world to feel that we have accomplished it mr eccles shrugged with all the philosophy he could summon and transferred his private disappointment to his country whose agricultural day was he said doomed we shall be beaten by those yankees he gave old england twenty years of continued pre eminence due to the impetus of the present generation of englishmen and then said he the yankees will flood the market no more green pastures in great britain no pretty clean footed animals no yellow harvests but huge chimney pots everywhere black earth under black vapour and smoke begrimed faces in twenty years' time sooty england was to be a gigantic manufactory until the yankees beat us out of that field as well beyond which jonathan eccles did not care to spread any distinct border of prophecy merely thanking the lord that he should then be under grass the decay of our glory was to be edged with blood jonathan admitted that there would be stuff in the fallen race to deliver a sturdy fight before they went to their doom for this prodigious curse england had to thank young robert the erratic son of jonathan it was now two years since robert had inherited a small legacy of money from an aunt and spent it in waste as the farmer bitterly supposed he was looking at some immense seed melons in his garden lying about in morning sunshine a new feed for sheep of his own invention when the call of the wanderer saluted his ears and he beheld his son robert at the gate here i am sir robert sang out from the exterior stay there then was his welcome they were alike in their build and in their manner of speech the accost and the reply sounded like reports from the same pistol the old man was tall broad shouldered and muscular a grey edition of the son upon whose disorderly attire he cast a glance while speaking with settled disgust robert's necktie streamed loose his hair was uncombed a handkerchief dangled from his pocket he had the look of the prodigal returned with impudence for his portion instead of repentance i can't see how you are sir from this distance said robert boldly assuming his privilege to enter are you drunk jonathan asked as robert marched up to him give me your hand sir give me an answer first are you drunk robert tried to force the complacent aspect of a mind unabashed but felt that he made a stupid show before that clear headed virtuously living old man of iron nerves the alternative to flying into a passion was the looking like a fool come father he said with a miserable snigger like a yokel's smile here i am at last i don't say kill the fatted calf and take a lesson from scripture but give me your hand i've done no man harm but myself damned if i've done a mean thing anywhere and there's no shame to you in shaking your son's hand after a long absence jonathan eccles kept both hands firmly in his pockets are you drunk he repeated robert controlled himself to answer i'm not well then just tell me when you were drunk last this is a pleasant fatherly greeting robert interjected you get no good by fighting shy of a simple question mr bob said jonathan robert cried querulously i don't want to fight shy of a simple question well then when were you drunk last answer me that last night jonathan drew his hand from his pocket to thump his leg i'd have sworn it all robert's assurance had vanished in a minute and he stood like a convicted culprit before his father you know sir i don't tell lies i was drunk last night i couldn't help it no more could the little boy i was drunk last night say i'm a beast i shan't exclaimed jonathan making his voice sound as a defence to this vile charge against the brutish character say i'm worse than a beast then cried robert in exasperation take my word that it hasn't happened to me to be in that state for a year and more last night i was mad i can't give you any reasons i thought i was cured but i've trouble in my mind and a tide swims you over the shallows so i felt come sir father don't make me mad again where did you get the liquor inquired jonathan i drank at 'the pilot' ha there's talk there of 'that damned old eccles' for a month to come 'the unnatural parent' how long have you been down here eight and twenty hours eight and twenty hours when are you going i want lodging for a night what else the loan of a horse that'll take a fence go on and twenty pounds oh said jonathan if farming came as easy to you as face you'd be a prime agriculturalist just what i thought what's become of that money your aunt jane was fool enough to bequeath to you i've spent it are you a deserter for a moment robert stood as if listening and then white grew his face and he swayed and struck his hands together his recent intoxication had unmanned him go in go in said his father in some concern though wrath was predominant oh make your mind quiet about me robert dropped his arms i'm weakened somehow damned weak i am i feel like a woman when my father asks me if i've been guilty of villany desert i wouldn't desert from the hulks hear the worst and this is the worst i've got no money i don't owe a penny but i haven't got one and i won't give you one jonathan appended and they stood facing one another in silence a squeaky voice was heard from the other side of the garden hedge of clipped yew hi farmer is that the missing young man and presently a neighbour by name john sedgett came trotting through the gate and up the garden path i say he remarked here's a rumpus here's a bobbery up at fairly oh bob eccles bob eccles at it again mr sedgett shook his wallet of gossip with an enjoying chuckle he was a thin faced creature rheumy of eye and drawing his breath as from a well the ferret of the village for all underlying scandal and tattle whose sole humanity was what he called pitifully 'a peakin' at his chest and who had retired from his business of grocer in the village upon the fortune brought to him in the energy and capacity of a third wife to conduct affairs while he wandered up and down and knitted people together an estimable office in a land where your house is so grievously your castle what the devil have you got in you now jonathan cried out to him mr sedgett was seized by his complaint and demanded commiseration but recovering he chuckled again oh bob eccles don't you never grow older and the first day down among us again too why bob as a military man you ought to acknowledge your superiors why stephen bilton the huntsman says bob you pulled the young gentleman off his horse you on foot and him mounted i'd ha' given pounds to be there and ladies present lord help us i'm glad you're returned though these melons of the farmer's they're a wonderful invention people are speaking of 'em right and left and says says they farmer eccles he's best farmer going hampshire ought to be proud of him he's worth two of any others that they are fine ones and you're come back to keep 'em up eh bob are ye though my man well here i am mr sedgett said robert and talking to my father oh i wouldn't be here to interrupt ye for the world mr sedgett made a show of retiring but jonathan insisted upon his disburdening himself of his tale saying damn your raw beginnings sedgett what's been up nobody can hurt me that they can't neighbour nor bob neither as far as stand up man to man go i give him three to one bob eccles he took 'em when a boy he may you know he may have the law agin him and by george if he do why a man's no match for the law no use bein' a hero to the law the law masters every man alive and there's law in everything neighbour eccles eh sir your friend the prince owns to it as much as you or me but of course you know what bob's been doing what i dropped in to ask was why did ye do it bob why pull the young gentleman off his horse i'd ha' given pounds to be there pounds o' tallow candles don't amount to much quoth robert that's awful bad brandy at 'the pilot' said mr sedgett venomously were you drunk when you committed this assault jonathan asked his son i drank afterwards robert replied 'pilot' brandy's poor consolation remarked mr sedgett jonathan had half a mind to turn his son out of the gate but the presence of sedgett advised him that his doings were naked to the world you kicked up a shindy in the hunting field what about who mounted ye robert remarked that he had been on foot on foot eh on foot jonathan speculated unable to realize the image of his son as a foot man in the hunting field or to comprehend the insolence of a pedestrian who should dare to attack a mounted huntsman you were on foot the devil you were on foot foot and caught a man out of his saddle jonathan gave up the puzzle he laid out his fore finger decisively if it's an assault mind you stand damages my land gives and my land takes my money and no drunken dog lives on the produce a row in the hunting field's un english i call it so it is sir said robert so it be neighbour said mr sedgett whereupon robert took his arm and holding the scraggy wretch forward commanded him to out with what he knew oh i don't know no more than what i've told you mr sedgett twisted a feeble remonstrance of his bones that were chiefly his being at the gripe except that you got hold the horse by the bridle and wouldn't let him go because the young gentleman wouldn't speak as a gentleman and oh don't squeeze so hard out with it cried robert and you said steeve bilton said you said 'where is she' you said and he swore and you swore and a lady rode up and you pulled and she sang out and off went the gentleman and steeve said she said for shame and it was the truest word spoken that day robert released him you don't know much mr sedgett but it's enough to make me explain the cause to my father and with your leave i'll do so mr sedgett remarked by all means do and rather preferred that his wits should be accused of want of brightness than that he should miss a chance of hearing the rich history of the scandal and its origin something stronger than a hint sent him off at a trot hugging in his elbows the postman won't do his business quicker than sedgett 'll tap this tale upon every door in the parish said jonathan i can only say i'm sorry for your sake robert was expressing his contrition when his father caught him up who can hurt me my sake have i got the habits of a sot what you'd call 'a beast' but i know the ways o' beasts and if you did too you wouldn't bring them in to bear your beastly sins who can hurt me you've been quarrelling with this young gentleman about a woman did you damage him if knuckles could do it i should have brained him sir said robert you struck him and you got the best of it he got the worst of it any way and will again then the devil take you for a fool why did you go and drink i could understand it if you got licked drown your memory then if that filthy soaking's to your taste but why when you get the prize we'll say you go off headlong into a manure pond there except that you're a damned idiot jonathan struck the air as to observe that it beat him but for the foregoing elucidation thundering afresh why did you go and drink i went sir i went why did i go robert slapped his hand despairingly to his forehead what on earth did i go for because i'm at sea i suppose nobody cares for me i'm at sea and no rudder to steer me i suppose that's it so i drank i thought it best to take spirits on board no this was the reason i remember that lady whoever she was said something that stung me i held the fellow under her eyes and shook him though she was begging me to let him off says she but i've drunk it clean out of my mind there go in and look at yourself in the glass said jonathan give me your hand first robert put his own out humbly i'll be hanged if i do said jonathan firmly bed and board you shall have while i'm alive and a glass to look at yourself in but my hand's for decent beasts move one way or t' other take your choice seeing robert hesitate he added i shall have a damned deal more respect for you if you toddle he waved his hand away from the premises i'm sorry you've taken so to swearing of late sir said robert two flints strike fire my lad when you keep distant i'm quiet enough in my talk to satisfy your aunt anne look here sir i want to make use of you so i'll go in of course you do returned jonathan not a whit displeased by his son's bluntness what else is a father good for i let you know the limit and that's a brick wall jump it if you can don't fancy it's your aunt jane you're going in to meet robert had never been a favourite with his aunt anne who was jonathan's housekeeper no poor old soul and may god bless her in heaven he cried for leaving you what you turned into a thundering lot of liquor to consume eh for doing all in her power to make a man of me and she was close on it kind good old darling that she was she got me with that money of hers to the best footing i've been on yet bless her heart or her memory or whatever a poor devil on earth may bless an angel for but here i am the fever in robert blazed out under a pressure of extinguishing tears there go along in said jonathan who considered drunkenness to be the main source of water in a man's eyes it's my belief you've been at it already this morning robert passed into the house in advance of his father whom he quite understood and appreciated there was plenty of paternal love for him and a hearty smack of the hand and the inheritance of the farm when he turned into the right way meantime jonathan was ready to fulfil his parental responsibility by sheltering feeding and not publicly abusing his offspring of whose spirit he would have had a higher opinion if robert had preferred since he must go to the deuce to go without troubling any of his relatives as it was jonathan submitted to the infliction gravely neither in speech nor in tone did he solicit from the severe maiden known as aunt anne that snub for the wanderer whom he introduced which when two are agreed upon the infamous character of a third through whom they are suffering it is always agreeable to hear he said here anne here's robert he hasn't breakfasted he likes his cold bath beforehand said robert presenting his cheek to the fleshless semi transparent woman aunt anne divided her lips to pronounce a crisp subdued ow to jonathan after inspecting robert and she shuddered at sight of robert and said ow repeatedly by way of an interjectory token of comprehension to all that was uttered but it was a horrified no when robert's cheek pushed nearer then see to getting some breakfast for him said jonathan you're not anyway bound to kiss a drunken dog's the word sir robert helped him dogs can afford it i never saw one in that state so they don't lose character he spoke lightly but dejection was in his attitude when his aunt anne had left the room he exclaimed by jingo women make you feel it by some way that they have she's a religious creature she smells the devil in me more like the brandy his father responded well i'm on the road i'm on the road robert fetched a sigh i didn't make the road said his father no sir you didn't work hard sleep sound that's happiness i've known it for a year you're the man i'd imitate if i could the devil came first the brandy's secondary i was quiet so long i thought myself a safe man he sat down and sent his hair distraught with an effort at smoothing it women brought the devil into the world first it's women who raise the devil in us and why they he thumped the table just as his aunt anne was preparing to spread the cloth don't be frightened woman said jonathan seeing her start fearfully back you take too many cups of tea morning and night hang the stuff never never till now have you abused me jonathan she whimpered severely i don't tell you to love him but wait on him that's all and i'll about my business land and beasts they answer to you robert looked up land and beasts they sound like blessed things when next i go to church i shall know what old adam felt go along sir i shall break nothing in the house you won't go jonathan begged the trembling spinster give him some of your tea and strong and as much of it as he can take he wants bringing down was jonathan's answer and casting a glance at one of the framed letters he strode through the doorway and aunt anne was alone with the flushed face and hurried eyes of her nephew who was to her little better than a demon in the flesh but there was a bible in the room an hour later robert was mounted and riding to the meet of hounds chapter xviii a single night at the pilot inn had given life and vigour to robert's old reputation in warbeach village as the stoutest of drinkers and dear rascals throughout a sailor breeding district where dibdin was still thundered in the ale house and manhood in a great degree measured by the capacity to take liquor on board as a ship takes ballast there was a profound affectation of deploring the sad fact that he drank as hard as ever among the men and genuine pity expressed for him by the women of warbeach but his fame was fresh again as the spring brings back its flowers robert's presence revived his youthful deeds there had not been a boxer in the neighbourhood like robert eccles nor such a champion in all games nor when he set himself to it such an invincible drinker it was he who thrashed the brute nic sedgett for stabbing with his clasp knife harry boulby son of the landlady of the pilot inn thrashed him publicly to the comfort of all warbeach he had rescued old dame garble from her burning cottage and made his father house the old creature and worked at farming though he hated it to pay for her subsistence he vindicated the honour of warbeach by drinking a match against a yorkshire skipper till four o'clock in the morning when it was a gallant sight my boys to see hampshire steadying the defeated north countryman on his astonished zigzag to his flattish bottomed billyboy all in the cheery sunrise on the river yo ho ahoy glorious robert had tried first the sea and then soldiering now let us hope he'll settle to farming and follow his rare old father's ways and be back among his own people for good so chimed the younger ones and many of the elder danish blood had settled round warbeach to be a really popular hero anywhere in britain a lad must still i fear have something of a scandinavian gullet and if in addition to his being a powerful drinker he is pleasant in his cups and can sing and forgive be freehanded and roll out the grand risky phrases of a fired brain he stamps himself in the apprehension of his associates a king much of the stuff was required to deal king robert of warbeach the capital stroke and commonly he could hold on till a puff of cold air from the outer door like an admonitory messenger reminded him that he was in the greatness of his soul a king of swine after which his way of walking off without a word to anybody hoisting his whole stature while others were staggering or roaring foul rhymes or feeling consciously mortal in their sensation of feverishness became a theme for admiration ay and he was fresh as an orchard apple in the morning there lay his commandership convincingly what was proved overnight was confirmed at dawn mr robert had his contrast in sedgett's son nicodemus sedgett whose unlucky christian name had assisted the wits of warbeach in bestowing on him a darkly luminous relationship young nic loved also to steep his spirit in the bowl but in addition to his never paying for his luxury he drank as if in emulation of the colour of his reputed patron and neighbourhood to nic sedgett was not liked when that young man became thoughtful over his glass the episode of his stabbing the landlady's son harry clung to him fatally the wound was in the thigh and nothing serious harry was up and off to sea before nic had ceased to show the marks of robert's vengeance upon him but blood shedding even on a small scale is so detested by englishmen that nic never got back to his right hue in the eyes of warbeach none felt to him as to a countryman and it may be supposed that his face was seen no more in the house of gathering the pilot inn he rented one of the fairly farms known as the three tree farm subsisting there men fancied by the aid of his housekeeper's money for he was of those evil fellows who disconcert all righteous prophecy and it was vain for mrs boulby and warbeach village to declare that no good could come to him when fortune manifestly kept him going he possessed the rogue's most serviceable art in spite of a countenance that was not attractive this fellow could as was proved by evidence make himself pleasing to women the truth of it is said mrs boulby at a loss for any other explanation and with a woman's love of sharp generalization it's because my sex is fools he had one day no money to pay his rent and forthwith using for the purpose his last five shillings it was said advertized for a housekeeper and before warbeach had done chuckling over his folly an agreeable woman of about thirty five was making purchases in his name she made tea and the evening brew for such friends as he could collect and apparently paid his rent for him after a time the distress was not in the house three days it seemed to warbeach an erratic proceeding on the part of providence that nic should ever be helped to swim but our modern prophets have small patience and summon destiny to strike without a preparation of her weapons or a warning to the victim more than robert's old occasional vice was at the bottom of his popularity as i need not say let those who generalize upon ethnology determine whether the ancient opposition of saxon and norman be at an end but it is certain to my thinking that when a hero of the people can be got from the common popular stock he is doubly dear a gentleman however gallant and familiar will hardly ever be as much beloved until he dies to inform a legend or a ballad seeing that death only can remove the peculiar distinctions and distances which the people feel to exist between themselves and the gentleman class and which not to credit them with preternatural discernment they are carefully taught to feel dead britons are all britons but live britons are not quite brothers it was as the son of a yeoman showing comprehensible accomplishments that robert took his lead he was a very brave a sweet hearted and a handsome young man and he had very chivalrous views of life that were understood by a sufficient number under the influence of ale or brandy and by a few in default of that material aid and they had a family pride in him the pride was mixed with fear which threw over it a tender light like a mother's dream of her child the people i have said are not so lost in self contempt as to undervalue their best men but it must be admitted that they rarely produce young fellows wearing the undeniable chieftain's stamp and the rarity of one like robert lent a hue of sadness to him in their thoughts fortune moreover the favourer of nic sedgett blew foul whichever the way robert set his sails he would not look to his own advantage and the belief that man should set his little traps for the liberal hand of his god if he wishes to prosper rather than strive to be merely honourable in his maker's eye is almost as general among poor people as it is with the moneyed classes who survey them from their height when jolly butcher billing who was one of the limited company which had sat with robert at the pilot last night reported that he had quitted the army he was hearkened to dolefully and the feeling was universal that glorious robert had cut himself off from his pension and his hospital but when gossip sedgett went his rounds telling that robert was down among them again upon the darkest expedition their minds could conceive and rode out every morning for the purpose of encountering one of the gentlemen up at fairly and had already pulled him off his horse and laid him in the mud calling him scoundrel and challenging him either to yield his secret or to fight and that he followed him and was out after him publicly and matched himself against that gentleman who had all the other gentlemen and the earl and the law to back him the little place buzzed with wonder and alarm faint hearts declared that robert was now done for all felt that he had gone miles beyond the mark those were the misty days when fogs rolled up the salt river from the winter sea and the sun lived but an hour in the clotted sky extinguished near the noon robert was seen riding out and the tramp of his horse was heard as he returned homeward he called no more at the pilot darkness and mystery enveloped him there were nightly meetings under mrs boulby's roof in the belief that he could not withstand her temptations nor did she imprudently discourage them but the woman at last overcame the landlady within her and she wailed he won't come because of the drink oh why was i made to sell liquor which he says sends him to the devil poor blessed boy and i can't help begging him to take one little drop i did the first night he was down forgetting his ways he looked so desperate he did and it went on and went on till he was primed and me proud to see him get out of his misery and now he hates the thought of me in her despair she encouraged sedgett to visit her bar and parlour and he became everywhere a most important man farmer eccles's habits of seclusion his pride some said and more especially the dreaded austere aunt anne who ruled that household kept people distant from the warbeach farm house all excepting sedgett who related that every night on his return she read a chapter from the bible to robert sitting up for him patiently to fulfil her duty and that the farmer's words to his son had been rest here eat and drink and ride my horse but not a penny of my money do you have by the help of steeve bilton the fairly huntsman sedgett was enabled to relate that there was a combination of the gentlemen against robert whose behaviour none could absolutely approve save the landlady and jolly butcher billing who stuck to him with a hearty blind faith did he ever asked the latter did bob eccles ever conduct himself disrespectful to his superiors wasn't he always found out at his wildest for to be right to a sensible man's way of thinking though not i grant ye to his own interests there's another tale and mr billing's staunch adherence to the hero of the village was cried out to his credit when sedgett stated on stephen bilton's authority that robert's errand was the defence of a girl who had been wronged and whose whereabout that she might be restored to her parents was all he wanted to know this story passed from mouth to mouth receiving much ornament in the passage the girl in question became a lady for it is required of a mere common girl that she should display remarkable character before she can be accepted as the fitting companion of a popular hero she became a young lady of fortune in love with robert and concealed by the artifice of the offending gentleman whom robert had challenged sedgett told this for truth being instigated to boldness of invention by pertinacious inquiries and the dignified sense which the whole story hung upon him mrs boulby who as a towering woman despised sedgett's weak frame had been willing to listen till she perceived him to be but a man of fiction and then she gave him a flat contradiction having no esteem for his custom eh but missis i can tell you his name the gentleman's name said sedgett placably he's a mr algernon blancove and a cousin by marriage or something of mrs lovell i reckon you're right about that goodman replied mrs boulby with intuitive discernment of the true from the false mingled with a desire to show that she was under no obligation for the news all t' other's a tale of your own and you know it and no more true than your rigmaroles about my brandy which is french it is as sure as my blood's british oh missis quoth sedgett maliciously as to tales you've got witnesses enough it crassed chann'l aha don't bring 'em into the box don't you bring 'em into ne'er a box you mean to say mr sedgett they won't swear no missis they'll swear fast and safe if you teach 'em dashed if they won't run the pilot on a rock with their swearin' it ain't a good habit well mr sedgett the next time you drink my brandy and find the consequences bad you let me hear of it and what'll you do missis may be listeners were by and mrs boulby cruelly retorted i won't send you home to your wife which created a roar against this hen pecked man as to consequences missis it's for your sake i'm looking at them sedgett said when he had recovered from the blow you say that to the excise mr sedgett it belike 'll make 'em sorry brandy's your weak point it appears missis a little in you would stiffen your back mr sedgett poor bob eccles didn't want no stiffening when he come down first sedgett interjected at which flushing enraged mrs boulby cried mention him indeed and him and you and that son of your'n the shame of your cheeks if people say he's like his father is it your son nic sedgett thinks to inform against me as once he swore to and to get his wage that he may step out of a second bankruptcy and he a farmer you let him know that he isn't feared by me sedgett and there's one here to give him a second dose without waiting for him to use clasp knives on harmless innocents pacify yourself ma'am pacify yourself remarked sedgett hardened against words abroad by his endurance of blows at home bob eccles he's got his hands full and he maybe 'll reach the hulks before my nic do yet and how 'm i answerable for nic i ask you more luck to you not to be i say and either sedgett you does woman's work gossipin' about like a cracked bell clapper or men's the biggest gossips of all which i believe for there's no beating you at your work and one can't wish ill to you knowing what you catch in a friendly way missis sedgett fixed on the compliment to his power of propagating news in a friendly way you can't accuse me of leavin' out the l in your name now can you i make that observation the venomous tattler screwed himself up to the widow insinuatingly as if her understanding could only be seized at close quarters i make that observation because poor dick boulby your lamented husband eh poor dick you see missis it ain't the tough ones last longest he'd sing 'i'm a sea booby' to the song 'i'm a green mermaid' poor dick 'a shinin' upon the sea deeps' he kept the liquor from his head but didn't mean it to stop down in his leg have you done mr sedgett said the widow blandly you ain't angry missis not a bit mr sedgett and if i knock you over with the flat o' my hand don't you think so sedgett threw up the wizened skin of his forehead and retreated from the bar at a safe distance he called bad news that about bob eccles swallowing a blow yesterday mrs boulby faced him complacently till he retired and then observed to those of his sex surrounding her don't woman and dog and walnut tree me some of you men 'd be the better for a drubbing every day of your lives sedgett yond' 'd be as big a villain as his son only for what he gets at home that was her way of replying to the parthian arrow but the barb was poisoned the village was at fever heat concerning robert and this assertion that he had swallowed a blow produced almost as great a consternation as if a fleet of the enemy had been reported off sandy point mrs boulby went into her parlour and wrote a letter to robert which she despatched by one of the loungers about the bar who brought back news that three of the gentlemen of fairly were on horseback talking to farmer eccles at his garden gate affairs were waxing hot the gentlemen had only to threaten farmer eccles to make him side with his son right or wrong in the evening stephen bilton the huntsman presented himself at the door of the long parlour of the pilot and loud cheers were his greeting from a full company gentlemen all said stephen with dapper modesty and acted as if no excitement were current and he had nothing to tell well steeve said one to encourage him how about bob to day said another before stephen had spoken it was clear to the apprehension of the whole room that he did not share the popular view of robert he declined to understand who was meant by bob he played the questions off and then shrugged with oh let's have a quiet evening it ended in his saying about bob eccles there that's summed up pretty quick he's mad mad shouted warbeach that's a lie said mrs boulby from the doorway well mum i let a lady have her own opinion stephen nodded to her there ain't a doubt as t' what the doctors 'd bring him in i ain't speaking my ideas alone it's written like the capital letters in a newspaper lunatic's the word and i'll take a glass of something warm mrs boulby we had a stiff run to day where did ye kill steeve asked a dispirited voice we didn't kill at all he was one of those longshore dog foxes and got away home on the cliff stephen thumped his knee it's my belief the smell o' sea gives 'em extra cunning the beggar seems to have put ye out rether eh steeve so it was generally presumed and yet the charge of madness was very staggering madness being in the first place indefensible and everybody's enemy when at large and robert's behaviour looked extremely like it it had already been as a black shadow haunting enthusiastic minds in the village and there fell a short silence during which stephen made his preparations for filling and lighting a pipe come how do you make out he's mad jolly butcher billing spoke but with none of the irony of confidence oh stephen merely clapped both elbows against his sides several pairs of eyes were studying him he glanced over them in turn and commenced leisurely the puff contemplative don't happen to have a grudge of e'er a kind against old bob steeve not i mrs boulby herself brought his glass to stephen and retreating left the parlour door open what causes you for to think him mad steeve a second oh as from the heights dominating argument sounded from stephen's throat half like a grunt this time he condescended to add how do you know when a dog's gone mad well robert eccles he's gone in like manner if you don't judge a man by his actions you've got no means of reckoning he comes and attacks gentlemen and swears he'll go on doing it well and what does that prove said jolly butcher billing mr william moody boatbuilder a liver complexioned citizen undertook to reply what does that prove what does that prove when the midshipmite was found with his head in the mixedpickle jar it proved that his head was lean and t' other part was rounder the illustration appeared forcible but not direct and nothing more was understood from it than that moody and two or three others who had been struck by the image of the infatuated young naval officer were going over to the enemy the stamp of madness upon robert's acts certainly saved perplexity and was the easiest side of the argument by this time stephen had finished his glass and the effect was seen hang it he exclaimed i don't agree he deserves shooting and he may have had harm done to him in that case let him fight and i say too let the gentleman give him satisfaction hear hear cried several and if the gentleman refuse to give him satisfaction in a fair stand up fight i say he ain't a gentleman and deserves to be treated as such my objection's personal i don't like any man who spoils sport and ne'er a rascally vulpeci' spoils sport as he do since he's been down in our parts again i'll take another brimmer mrs boulby to be sure you will stephen said mrs boulby bending as in a curtsey to the glass and so soft with him that foolish fellows thought her cowed by the accusation thrown at her favourite there's two questions about they valpecies master stephen said farmer wainsby a farmer with a grievance fixing his elbow on his knee for serious utterance there's to ask and t' ask again sport i grant ye all in doo season but he performed a circle with his pipe stem and darted it as from the centre thereof toward stephen's breast with the poser do we s'pport thieves at public expense for them to keep thievin' black white or brown no matter eh well then if the public wunt bear it dang me if i can see why individles shud bear it it ent no manner o' reason net as i can see let gentlemen have their opinion or let 'em not foxes be hanged much slow winking was interchanged in a general sense farmer wainsby's remarks were held to be un english though he was pardoned for them as one having peculiar interests at stake ay ay we know all about that said stephen taking succour from the eyes surrounding him and so may be do we said wainsby fox hunting 'll go on when your great grandfather's your youngest son farmer or t' other way i reckon it'll be a stuffed fox your chil'ern 'll hunt mr steeve more straw in 'em than bow'ls if the country stephen thumped the table were what you'd make of it hang me if my name 'd long be englishman hear hear steeve was shouted in support of the conservative principle enunciated by him what i say is flesh and blood afore foxes thus did farmer wainsby likewise attempt a rallying cry but stephen's retort ain't foxes flesh and blood convicted him of clumsiness and buoyed on the uproar of cheers stephen pursued they are to kill 'em in cold blood's beast murder so it is what do we do we give 'em a fair field a fair field and no favour we let 'em trust to the instincts nature she's given 'em and don't the old woman know best if they cap get away they win the day all's open and honest and aboveboard kill your rats and kill your rabbits but leave foxes to your betters foxes are gentlemen you don't understand be hanged if they ain't i like the old fox and i don't like to see him murdered and exterminated but die the death of a gentleman at the hands of gentlemen and ladies sneered the farmer all the room was with stephen and would have backed him uproariously had he not reached his sounding period without knowing it and thus allowed his opponent to slip in that abominable addition ay and ladies cried the huntsman keen at recovery why shouldn't they i hate a field without a woman in it don't you and you and you and you too mrs boulby there you are and the room looks better for you don't it lads hurrah the cheering was now aroused and stephen had his glass filled again in triumph while the farmer meditated thickly over the ruin of his argument from that fatal effort at fortifying it by throwing a hint to the discredit of the sex as many another man has meditated before eh poor old bob stephen sighed and sipped i can cry that with any of you it's worse for me to see than for you to hear of him wasn't i always a friend of his and said he was worthy to be a gentleman many a time he's got the manners of a gentleman now offs with his hat if there's a lady present and such a neat way of speaking but there acting's the thing and his behaviour's beastly bad you can't call it no other there's two mr blancoves up at fairly relations of mrs lovell's whom i'll take the liberty of calling my beauty and no offence meant and it's before her that bob only yesterday rode up one of the gentlemen being mr algernon free of hand and a good seat in the saddle t' other's mr edward but mr algernon he's robert eccles's man up rides bob just as we was tying mr reenard's brush to the pommel of the lady's saddle down in ditley marsh and he bows to the lady says he but he's mad stark mad stephen resumed his pipe amid a din of disappointment that made the walls ring and the glasses leap a little more sugar stephen said mrs boulby moving in lightly from the doorway thank ye mum you're the best hostess that ever breathed so she be but how about bob cried her guests some asking whether he carried a pistol or flourished a stick ne'er a blessed twig to save his soul and there's the madness written on him stephen roared as loud as any of them and me to see him riding in the ring there and knowing what the gentleman had sworn to do if he came across the hunt and feeling that he was in the wrong i haven't got a oath to swear how mad i was fancy yourselves in my place i love old bob i've drunk with him i owe him obligations from since i was a boy up'ard i don't know a better than bob in all england and there he was and says to mr algernon 'you know what i'm come for' i never did behold a gentleman so pale shot all over his cheeks as he was and pinkish under the eyes if you've ever noticed a chap laid hands on by detectives in plain clothes smack at bob went mr edward's whip mr algernon's stephen was corrected mr edward's i tell ye the cousin and right across the face my lord it made my blood tingle a sound like the swish of a whip expressed the sentiments of that assemblage at the pilot bob swallowed it what else could he do the fool he had nothing to help him but his hand says he 'that's a poor way of trying to stop me my business is with this gentleman' and bob set his horse at mr algernon and mrs lovell rode across him with her hand raised and just at that moment up jogged the old gentleman squire blancove of wrexby and robert eccles says to him 'you might have saved your son something by keeping your word' it appears according to bob that the squire had promised to see his son and settle matters all mrs lovell could do was hardly enough to hold back mr edward from laying out at bob he was like a white devil and speaking calm and polite all the time says bob 'i'm willing to take one when i've done with the other' and the squire began talking to his son mrs lovell to mr edward and the rest of the gentlemen all round poor dear old bob rather bullying like for my blood till bob couldn't help being nettled and cried out 'gentlemen i hold him in my power and i'm silent so long as there's a chance of my getting him to behave like a man with human feelings' if they'd gone at him then i don't think i could have let him stand alone an opinion's one thing but blood's another and i'm distantly related to bob and a man who's always thinking of the value of his place he ain't worth it but mrs lovell she settled the case a lady farmer wainsby with your leave there's the good of having a lady present on the field that's due to a lady happen she was at the bottom of it the farmer returned stephen's nod grumpily how did it end stephen my lad said butcher billing indicating a never mind him it ended my boy it ended like my glass here hot and strong stuff with sugar at the bottom and i don't see this so glad as i saw that my word of honour on it boys all stephen drank the dregs mrs boulby was still in attendance the talk over the circumstances was sweeter than the bare facts and the replenished glass enabled stephen to add the picturesque bits of the affray unspurred by a surrounding eagerness of his listeners too exciting for imaginative effort in particular he dwelt on robert's dropping the reins and riding with his heels at algernon when mrs lovell put her horse in his way and the pair of horses rose like waves at sea and both riders showed their horsemanship and robert an adroit courtesy for which the lady thanked him with a bow of her head i got among the hounds pretending to pacify them and call 'em together said stephen and i heard her say just before all was over and he turned off i heard her say 'trust this to me i will meet you' i'll swear to them exact words though there was more and a 'where' in the bargain and that i didn't hear aha by george thinks i old bob you're a lucky beggar and be hanged if i wouldn't go mad too for a minute or so of short sweet private talk with a lovely young widow lady as ever the sun did shine upon so boldly oho you've seen a yacht upon the sea she dances and she dances o as fair is my wild maid to me something about 'prances o' on her horse you know or you're a hem'd fool if you don't i never could sing wish i could it's the joy of life it's utterance hey for harmony eh brayvo now you're a man steeve and welcomer and welcomest yi yi o jolly butcher billing sang out sharp life wants watering here's a health to robert eccles wheresoever and whatsoever and ne'er a man shall say of me i didn't stick by a friend like bob cheers my lads robert's health was drunk in a thunder and praises of the purity of the brandy followed the grand roar mrs boulby received her compliments on that head 'pends upon the tide missis don't it one remarked with a grin broad enough to make the slyness written on it easy reading ah first a flow and then a ebb said another it's many a keg i plant i' the mud coastguardsman come and i'll have your blood instigation cried cut along but the defiant smuggler was deficient in memory and like steeve bilton was reduced to scatter his concluding rhymes in prose as something about whereat jolly butcher billing a reader of song books from a literary delight in their contents scraped his head and then as if he had touched a spring carolled in spite of all you gov'ment pack i'll land my kegs of the good cognyac though he took occasion to observe when the chorus and a sort of cracker of irrelevant rhymes had ceased to explode i'm for none of them games honesty there's the sugar o' my grog ay but you like to be cock sure of the stuff you drink if e'er a man did said the boatbuilder whose eye blazed yellow in this frothing season of song and fun right so will moody returned the jolly butcher which means not wrong this time then what's understood by your sticking prongs into your hostess here concerning of her brandy here it is which is enough except for discontented fellows eh missus the jolly butcher appealed to her and pointed at moody's complexion for proof it was quite a fiction that kegs of the good cognac were sown at low water and reaped at high near the river gate of the old pilot inn garden but it was greatly to mrs boulby's interest to encourage the delusion which imaged her brandy thus arising straight from the very source without villanous contact with excisemen and corrupting dealers and as perhaps in her husband's time the thing had happened and still did at rare intervals she complacently gathered the profitable fame of her brandy being the best in the district i'm sure i hope you're satisfied mr billing she said the jolly butcher asked whether will moody was satisfied and mr william moody declaring himself thoroughly satisfied then i'm satisfied too said the jolly butcher upon which the boatbuilder heightened the laugh by saying he was not satisfied at all and to escape from the execrations of the majority pleaded that it was because his glass was empty thus making his peace with them every glass in the room was filled again the young fellows now loosened tongue and dick curtis the promising cricketer of hampshire cried mr moody my hearty that's your fourth glass so don't quarrel with me now you moody fired up in a bilious frenzy and called him a this and that and t' other young vagabond for which the company feeling the ominous truth contained in dick curtis's remark more than its impertinence fined mr moody in a song he gave the so many young captains have walked o'er my pate it's no wonder you see me quite bald sir with emphatic bitterness and the company thanked him seeing him stand up as to depart however a storm of contempt was hurled at him some said he was like old sedgett and was afraid of his wife and some that he was like nic sedgett and drank blue you're a bag of blue devils oh dear oh dear sang dick to the tune of the campbells are coming i ask e'er a man present mr moody put out his fist is that to be borne didn't you he addressed dick curtis didn't you sing into my chorus 'it's no wonder to hear how you squall'd sir' you did don't he dick addressed the company make mrs boulby's brandy look ashamed of itself in his face i ask e'er a gentleman present accusation and retort were interchanged in the course of which dick called mr moody nic sedgett's friend and a sort of criminal inquiry was held it was proved that moody had been seen with nic sedgett and then three or four began to say that nic sedgett was thick with some of the gentlemen up at fairly just like his luck stephen let it be known that he could confirm this fact he having seen mr algernon blancove stop nic on the road and talk to him in that case said butcher billing there's mischief in a state of fermentation did ever anybody see nic and the devil together i saw nic and mr moody together said dick curtis well i'm only stating a fact he exclaimed as moody rose apparently to commence an engagement for which the company quietly prepared by putting chairs out of his way but the recreant took his advantage from the error and got away to the door pursued here's an example of what we lose in having no president sighed the jolly butcher there never was a man built for the chair like bob eccles i say our evening's broke up and i for one 'd ha' made it morning hark outside by gearge they're snowballing an adjournment to the front door brought them in view of a white and silent earth under keen stars and dick curtis and the bilious boatbuilder foot to foot snowball in hand a bout of the smart exercise made mr moody laugh again and all parted merrily delivering final shots as they went their several ways thanks be to heaven for snowing said mrs boulby or when i should have got to my bed goodness only can tell with which she closed the door upon the empty inn chapter xix the night was warm with the new fallen snow though the stars sparkled coldly a fleet of south westerly rainclouds had been met in mid sky by a sharp puff from due north and the moisture had descended like a woven shroud covering all the land the house tops and the trees young harry boulby was at sea and this still weather was just what a mother's heart wished for him the widow looked through her bed room window and listened as if the absolute stillness must beget a sudden cry the thought of her boy made her heart revert to robert she was thinking of robert when the muffled sound of a horse at speed caused her to look up the street and she saw one coming a horse without a rider the next minute he was out of sight mrs boulby stood terrified the silence of the night hanging everywhere seemed to call on her for proof that she had beheld a real earthly spectacle and the dead thump of the hooves on the snow floor in passing struck a chill through her as being phantom like but she had seen a saddle on the horse and the stirrups flying and the horse looked affrighted the scene was too earthly in its suggestion of a tale of blood what if the horse were robert's she tried to laugh at her womanly fearfulness and had almost to suppress a scream in doing so there was no help for it but to believe her brandy as good and efficacious as her guests did so she went downstairs and took a fortifying draught after which her blood travelled faster and the event galloped swiftly into the recesses of time and she slept while the morning was still black and the streets without a sign of life she was aroused by a dream of some one knocking at her grave stone ah that brandy she sighed this is what a poor woman has to pay for custom which we may interpret as the remorseful morning confession of a guilt she had been the victim of over night she knew that good brandy did not give bad dreams and was self convicted strange were her sensations when the knocking continued and presently she heard a voice in the naked street below call in a moan mother my darling she answered divided in her guess at its being harry or robert a glance from the open window showed robert leaning in the quaint old porch with his head bound by a handkerchief but he had no strength to reply to a question at that distance and when she let him in he made two steps and dropped forward on the floor lying there he plucked at her skirts she was shouting for help but with her ready apprehension of the pride in his character she knew what was meant by his broken whisper before she put her ear to his lips and she was silent miserable sight as was his feeble efforts to rise on an elbow that would not straighten his head was streaming with blood and the stain was on his neck and chest he had one helpless arm his clothes were torn as from a fierce struggle i'm quite sensible he kept repeating lest she should relapse into screams lord love you for your spirit exclaimed the widow and there they remained he like a winged eagle striving to raise himself from time to time and fighting with his desperate weakness his face was to the ground after a while he was still in alarm the widow stooped over him she feared that he had given up his last breath but the candle light showed him shaken by a sob as it seemed to her though she could scarce believe it of this manly fellow yet it proved true she saw the very tears he was crying at his helplessness oh my darling boy she burst out what have they done to ye the cowards they are but do now have pity on a woman and let me get some creature to lift you to a bed dear and don't flap at me with your hand like a bird that's shot you're quite quite sensible i know quite sensible dear but for my sake robert my harry's good friend only for my sake let yourself be a carried to a clean nice bed till i get dr bean to you do do her entreaties brought on a succession of the efforts to rise and at last getting round on his back and being assisted by the widow he sat up against the wall the change of posture stupified him with a dizziness he tried to utter the old phrase that he was sensible but his hand beat at his forehead before the words could be shaped what pride is when it's a man the widow thought as he recommenced the grievous struggle to rise on his feet now feeling them up to the knee with a questioning hand and pausing as if in a reflective wonder and then planting them for a spring that failed wretchedly groaning and leaning backward lost in a fit of despair and again beginning patient as an insect imprisoned in a circle the widow bore with his man's pride until her nerves became afflicted by the character of his movements which as her sensations conceived them were like those of a dry door jarring loose she caught him in her arms it's let my back break but you shan't fret to death there under my eyes proud or humble poor dear she said and with a great pull she got him upright he fell across her shoulder with so stiff a groan that for a moment she thought she had done him mortal injury good old mother he said boyishly to reassure her yes and you'll behave to me like a son she coaxed him they talked as by slow degrees the stairs were ascended a crack o' the head mother a crack o' the head said he was it the horse my dear a crack o' the head mother what have they done to my boy robert they've he swung about humorously weak as he was and throbbing with pain they've let out some of your brandy mothergot into my head who've done it my dear they've done it mother oh take care o' that nail at your foot and oh that beam to your poor poll poor soul he's been and hurt himself again and did they do it to him and what was it for she resumed in soft cajolery they did it because yes my dear the reason for it because mother they had a turn that way thanks be to above for leaving your cunning in you my dear said the baffled woman with sincere admiration and lord be thanked if you're not hurt bad that they haven't spoilt his handsome face she added in the bedroom he let her partially undress him refusing all doctor's aid and commanding her to make no noise about him and then he lay down and shut his eyes for the pain was terrible galloped him and threw him with a shock and galloped him and threw him again whenever his thoughts got free for a moment from the dizzy aching my dear she whispered i'm going to get a little brandy she hastened away upon this mission he was in the same posture when she returned with bottle and glass she poured out some and made much of it as a specific and of the great things brandy would do but he motioned his hand from it feebly till she reproached him tenderly as perverse and unkind now my dearest boy for my sake only for my sake will you yes you will my robert no brandy mother only one small thimbleful no more brandy for me see dear how seriously you take it and all because you want the comfort no brandy was all he could say she looked at the label on the bottle alas she knew whence it came and what its quality she could cheat herself about it when herself only was concerned but she wavered at the thought of forcing it upon robert as trusty medicine though it had a pleasant taste and was really as she conceived good enough for customers she tried him faintly with arguments in its favour but his resolution was manifested by a deaf ear with a perfect faith in it she would and she was conscious that she could have raised his head and poured it down his throat the crucial test of her love for robert forbade the attempt she burst into an uncontrollable fit of crying halloa mother said robert opening his eyes to the sad candlelight surrounding them my darling boy whom i do love so and not to be able to help you what shall i do what shall i do with a start he cried where's the horse the horse the old dad 'll be asking for the horse to morrow i saw a horse my dear afore i turned to my prayers at my bedside coming down the street without his rider he came like a rumble of deafness in my ears oh my boy i thought is it robert's horse knowing you've got enemies as there's no brave man has not got 'em which is our only hope in the god of heaven mother punch my ribs he stretched himself flat for the operation and shut his mouth hard mother and quick i can't hold out long oh robert moaned the petrified woman strike you straight in the ribs shut your fist and do it quick my dear my boy i haven't the heart to do it ah robert's chest dropped in but tightening his muscles again he said now do it do it oh a poke at a poor fire puts it out dear and make a murderess of me you call mother oh as i love the name i'll obey you robert but there harder mother there goodness forgive me hard as you can all's right there and there oh mercy press in at my stomach she nerved herself to do his bidding and following his orders took his head in her hands and felt about it the anguish of the touch wrung a stifled scream from him at which she screamed responsive he laughed while twisting with the pain you cruel boy to laugh at your mother she said delighted by the sound of safety in that sweet human laughter hey don't ye shake your brain it ought to lie quiet and here's the spot of the wicked blow and him in love as i know he is what would she say if she saw him now but an old woman's the best nurse ne'er a doubt of it she felt him heavy on her arm and knew that he had fainted quelling her first impulse to scream she dropped him gently on the pillow and rapped to rouse up her maid the two soon produced a fire and hot water bandages vinegar in a basin and every crude appliance that could be thought of the maid followed her mistress's directions with a consoling awe for mrs boulby had told her no more than that a man was hurt i do hope if it's anybody it's that ther' moody said the maid a pretty sort of a christian you think yourself i dare say mrs boulby replied christian or not one can't help longin' for a choice mum we ain't all hands and knees better for you if you was said the widow it's tongues you're to remember you're not to be now come you up after me and you'll not utter a word you'll stand behind the door to do what i tell you you're a soldier's daughter susan and haven't a claim to be excitable my mother was given to faints susan protested on behalf of her possible weakness you may peep thus mrs boulby tossed a sop to her frail woman's nature but for her having been appeased by the sagacious accordance of this privilege the maid would never have endured to hear robert's voice in agony and to think that it was really robert the beloved of warbeach who had come to harm her apprehensions not being so lively as her mistress's by reason of her love being smaller she was more terrified than comforted by robert's jokes during the process of washing off the blood cutting the hair from the wound bandaging and binding up the head his levity seemed ghastly and his refusal upon any persuasion to see a doctor quite heathenish and a sign of one foredoomed she believed that his arm was broken and smarted with wrath at her mistress for so easily taking his word to the contrary more than all his abjuration of brandy now when it would do him good to take it struck her as an instance of that masculine insanity in the comprehension of which all women must learn to fortify themselves there was much whispering in the room inarticulate to her before mrs boulby came out enjoining a rigorous silence and stating that the patient would drink nothing but tea he begged she said half to herself to have the window blinds up in the morning if the sun wasn't strong for him to look on our river opening down to the ships that looks as if he meant to live susan remarked he cried the widow it's robert eccles he'd stand on his last inch would he now ejaculated susan marvelling at him with no question as to what footing that might be leastways the widow hastened to add if he thought it was only devils against him i've heard him say 'it's a fool that holds out against god and a coward as gives in to the devil' and there's my robert painted by his own hand but don't that bring him to this so often mum susan ruefully inquired joining teapot and kettle i do believe he's protected said the widow with the first morning light mrs boulby was down at warbeach farm and being directed to farmer eccles in the stables she found the sturdy yeoman himself engaged in grooming robert's horse well missis he said nodding to her you win you see i thought you would i'd have sworn you would brandy's stronger than blood with some of our young fellows if you please mr eccles she replied robert's sending of me was to know if the horse was unhurt and safe won't his legs carry him yet missis his legs have been graciously spared mr eccles it's his head that's where the liquor flies i'm told pray mr eccles believe me when i declare he hasn't touched a drop of anything but tea in my house this past night i'm sorry for that i'd rather have him go to you if he takes it let him take it good and i'm given to understand that you've a reputation that way just tell him from me he's at liberty to play the devil with himself but not with my beasts the farmer continued his labour no you ain't a hard man surely cried the widow not when i say he was sober mr eccles and was thrown and made insensible never knew such a thing to happen to him missis and what's more i don't believe it mayhap you're come for his things his aunt anne's indoors and she'll give 'em up and gladly and my compliments to robert and the next time he fancies visiting warbeach he'd best forward a letter to that effect mrs boulby curtseyed humbly you think bad of me sir for keeping a public but i love your son as my own and if i might presume to say so mr eccles you will be proud of him too before you die i know no more than you how he fell yesterday but i do know he'd not been drinking and have got bitter bad enemies and that's not astonishing missis no mr eccles and a man who's brave besides being good soon learns that well spoken missis is robert to hear he's denied his father's house i never said that mrs boulby here's my principle my house is open to my blood so long as he don't bring downright disgrace on it and then any one may claim him that likes i won't give him money because i know of a better use for it and he shan't ride my beasts because he don't know how to treat 'em that's all and so you keep within the line of your duty sir the widow summed his speech so i hope to said the farmer there's comfort in that she replied as much as there's needed said he the widow curtseyed again it's not to trouble you sir i called robert thanks be to above is not hurt serious though severe where's he hurt the farmer asked rather hurriedly in the head it is what have you come for first his best hat bless my soul exclaimed the farmer well if that 'll mend his head it's at his service i'm sure sick at his heartlessness the widow scattered emphasis over her concluding remarks first his best hat he wants and his coat and clean shirt and they mend the looks of a man mr eccles and it's to look well is his object for he's not one to make a moan of himself and doctors may starve before he'd go to any of them and my begging prayer to you is that when you see your son you'll not tell him i let you know his head or any part of him was hurt i wish you good morning mr eccles good morning to you mrs boulby you're a respectable woman not to be soaped she murmured to herself in a heat the apparently medicinal articles of attire were obtained from aunt anne without a word of speech on the part of that pale spinster the deferential hostility between the two women acknowledged an intervening chasm aunt anne produced a bundle and placed the hat on it upon which she had neatly pinned a tract the drunkard's awakening mrs boulby glanced her eye in wrath across this superscription thinking to herself oh you good people how you make us long in our hearts for trouble with you she controlled the impulse and mollified her spirit on her way home by distributing stray leaves of the tract to the outlying heaps of rubbish and to one inquisitive pig who was looking up from a badly smelling sty for what the heavens might send him she found robert with his arm doubled over a basin and susan sponging cold water on it no bones broken mother he sang out i'm sound all right again six hours have done it this time is it a thaw you needn't tell me what the old dad has been saying i shall be ready to breakfast in half an hour lord what a big arm it is exclaimed the widow and no wonder or how would you be a terror to men you naughty boy to think of stirring here you'll lie ah will i said robert and he gave a spring and sat upright in the bed rather white with the effort which seemed to affect his mind for he asked dubiously what do i look like mother she brought him the looking glass and susan being dismissed he examined his features dear said the widow sitting down on the bed it ain't much for me to guess you've got an appointment at twelve o'clock mother with her she uttered softly it's with a lady mother and so many enemies prowling about robert my dear don't tell me they didn't fall upon you last night i said nothing but i'd swear it on the book do you think you can go why mother i go by my feelings and there's no need to think at all or god knows what i should think the widow shook her head nothing 'll stop you i suppose nothing inside of me will mother doesn't she but never mind i've no right to ask robert and if i have curiosity it's about last night and why you should let villains escape but there's no accounting for a man's notions only this i say and i do say it nic sedgett he's at the bottom of any mischief brewed against you down here and last night stephen bilton or somebody declared that nic sedgett had been seen up at fairly selling eggs mother why shouldn't he we mustn't complain of his getting an honest livelihood he's black blooded robert and i never can understand why the lord did not make him a beast in face i'm told that creature's found pleasing by the girls ugh mother i'm not she won't have you robert he laughed we shall see to day you deceiving boy cried the widow and me not know it's mrs lovell you're going to meet and would to heaven she'd

over again how to bear me the old dad bless his heart gave me sound wind and limb to begin upon so i'm not easily stumped you see though i've been near on it once or twice in my life mrs boulby murmured ah are you still going to be at war with those gentlemen robert he looked at her steadily while a shrewd smile wrought over his face and then taking her hand he said i'll tell you a little you deserve it and won't tattle my curse is i'm ashamed to talk about my feelings but there's no shame in being fond of a girl even if she refuses to have anything to say to you is there no there isn't i went with my dear old aunt's money to a farmer in kent and learnt farming clear of the army first by but i must stop that burst of swearing half the time i've been away i was there the farmer's a good sober downhearted man a sort of beaten englishman who don't know it tough and always backing he has two daughters one went to london and came to harm of a kind the other i'd prick this vein for and bleed to death singing and she hates me i wish she did she thought me such a good young man i never drank went to bed early was up at work with the birds mr robert armstrong that changeing of my name was like a lead cap on my head i was never myself with it felt hang dog it was impossible a girl could care for such a fellow as i was mother just listen she's dark as a gipsy she's the faithfullest stoutest hearted creature in the world she has black hair large brown eyes see her once she's my mate i could say to her 'stand there take guard of a thing' and i could be dead certain of her she'd perish at her post is the door locked lock the door i won't be seen when i speak of her well never mind whether she's handsome or not she isn't a lady but she's my lady she's the woman i could be proud of she sends me to the devil i believe a woman 'd fall in love with her cheeks they are so round and soft and kindly coloured think me a fool i am and here am i away from her and i feel that any day harm may come to her and she 'll melt and be as if the devils of hell were mocking me who's to keep harm from her when i'm away what can i do but drink and forget only now when i wake up from it i'm a crawling wretch at her feet if i had her feet to kiss i've never kissed her never and no man has kissed her damn my head here's the ache coming on that's my last oath mother i wish there was a bible handy but i'll try and stick to it without my god when i think of her i fancy everything on earth hangs still and doubts what's to happen i'm like a wheel and go on spinning feel my pulse now why is it i can't stop it but there she is and i could crack up this old world to know what's coming i was mild as milk all those days i was near her my comfort is she don't know me and that's my curse too if she did she'd know as clear as day i'm her mate her match the man for her i am by heaven that's an oath permitted to see the very soul i want and to miss her i'm down here mother she loves her sister and i must learn where her sister's to be found one of those gentlemen up at fairly's the guilty man i don't say which perhaps i don't know but oh what a lot of lightnings i see in the back of my head robert fell back on the pillow mrs boulby wiped her eyes her feelings were overwhelmed with mournful devotion to the passionate young man and she expressed them practically a rump steak would never digest in his poor stomach he seemed to be of that opinion too for when after lying till eleven he rose and appeared at the breakfast table he ate nothing but crumbs of dry bread it was curious to see his precise attention to the neatness of his hat and coat and the nervous eye he cast upon the clock while brushing and accurately fixing these garments the hat would not sit as he was accustomed to have it owing to the bruise on his head and he stood like a woman petulant with her milliner before the glass now pressing the hat down till the pain was insufferable and again trying whether it presented him acceptably in the enforced style of his wearing it he persisted in this till mrs boulby's exclamation of wonder admonished him of the ideas received by other eyes than his own when we appear most incongruous we are often exposing the key to our characters and how much his vanity wounded by rhoda had to do with his proceedings down at warbeach it were unfair to measure just yet lest his finer qualities be cast into shade but to what degree it affected him will be seen mrs boulby's persuasions induced him to take a stout silver topped walking stick of her husband's a relic shaped from the wood of the royal george leaning upon which rather more like a naval pensioner than he would have cared to know he went forth to his appointment with the lady chapter xx the park sward of fairly white with snow rolled down in long sweeps to the salt water and under the last sloping oak of the park there was a gorse bushed lane green in summer but now bearing cumbrous blossom like burdens of the crisp snow fall mrs lovell sat on horseback here and alone with her gauntleted hand at her waist charmingly habited in tone with the landscape she expected a cavalier and did not perceive the approach of a pedestrian but bowed quietly when robert lifted his hat they say you are mad you see i trust myself to you i wish i could thank you for your kindness madam are you ill i had a fall last night madam the lady patted her horse's neck i haven't time to inquire about it you understand that i cannot give you more than a minute she glanced at her watch let us say five exactly to begin i can't affect to be ignorant of the business which brings you down here i won't pretend to lecture you about the course you have taken but let me distinctly assure you that the gentleman you have chosen to attack in this extraordinary manner has done no wrong to you or to any one it is therefore disgracefully unjust to single him out you know he cannot possibly fight you i speak plainly yes madam said robert i'll answer plainly he can't fight a man like me i know it i bear him no ill will i believe he's innocent enough in this matter as far as acts go that makes your behaviour to him worse robert looked up into her eyes you are a lady you won't be shocked at what i tell you yes yes said mrs lovell hastily i have learnt i am aware of the tale some one has been injured or you think so i don't accuse you of madness but good heavens what means have you been pursuing indeed sir let your feelings be as deeply engaged as possible you have gone altogether the wrong way to work not if i have got your help by it madam gallantly spoken she smiled with a simple grace the next moment she consulted her watch time has gone faster than i anticipated i must leave you let this be our stipulation she lowered her voice you shall have the address you require i will undertake to see her myself when next i am in london it will be soon in return sir favour me with your word of honour not to molest this gentleman any further will you do that you may trust me i do madam with all my soul said robert that's sufficient i ask no more good morning her parting bow remained with him like a vision her voice was like the tinkling of harp strings about his ears the colour of her riding habit this day harmonious with the snow faced earth as well as the gentle mission she had taken upon herself strengthened his vivid fancy in blessing her as something quite divine he thought for the first time in his life bitterly of the great fortune which fell to gentlemen in meeting and holding equal converse with so adorable a creature and he thought of rhoda as being harshly earthly repulsive in her coldness as that black belt of water contrasted against the snow on the shores he walked some paces in the track of mrs lovell's horse till his doing so seemed too presumptuous though to turn the other way and retrace his steps was downright hateful and he stood apparently in profound contemplation of a ship of war and the trees of the forest behind the masts either the fatigue of standing or emotion caused his head to throb so that he heard nothing not even men's laughter but looking up suddenly he beheld as in a picture mrs lovell with some gentlemen walking their horses toward him the lady gazed softly over his head letting her eyes drop a quiet recognition in passing one or two of the younger gentlemen stared mockingly edward blancove was by mrs lovell's side his eyes fixed upon robert with steady scrutiny and robert gave him a similar inspection though not knowing why it was like a child's open look and he was feeling childish as if his brain had ceased to act one of the older gentlemen with a military aspect squared his shoulders and touching an end of his moustache said half challengingly you are dismounted to day i have only one horse robert simply replied algernon blancove came last he neither spoke nor looked at his enemy but warily clutched his whip all went by riding into line some paces distant and again they laughed as they bent forward to the lady shouting odd to have out the horses on a day like this robert thought and resumed his musing as before the lady's track now led him homeward for he had no will of his own rounding the lane he was surprised to see mrs boulby by the hedge she bobbed like a beggar woman with a rueful face my dear she said in apology for her presence i shouldn't ha' interfered if there was fair play i'm englishwoman enough for that i'd have stood by as if you was a stranger gentlemen always give fair play before a woman that's why i come lest this appointment should ha' proved a pitfall to you now you'll come home won't you and forgive me i'll come to the old pilot now mother said robert pressing her hand that's right and ain't angry with me for following of you follow your own game mother i did robert and nice and vexed i am if i'm correct in what i heard say as that lady and her folk passed never heeding an old woman's ears they made a bet of you dear they did i hope the lady won said robert scarce hearing and it was she who won dear she was to get you to meet her and give up and be beaten like as far as i could understand their chatter gentlefolks laugh so when they talk and they can afford to laugh for they has the best of it but i'm vexed just as if i'd felt big and had burst i want you to be peaceful of course i do but i don't like my boy made a bet of oh tush mother said robert impatiently i heard 'em my dear and complimenting the lady they was as they passed me if it vexes you my thinking it i won't dear i reelly won't i see it lowers you for there you are at your hat again it is lowering to be made a bet of i've that spirit that if you was well and sound i'd rather have you fighting 'em she's a pleasant enough lady to look at not a doubt small boned and slim and fair robert asked which way they had gone back to the stables my dear i heard 'em say so because one gentleman said that the spectacle was over and the lady had gained the day and the snow was balling in the horses' feet and go they'd better before my lord saw them out and another said you were a wild man she'd tamed and they said you ought to wear a collar with mrs lovell's her name graved on it but don't you be vexed you may guess they're not my robert's friends and i do assure you robert your hat's neat if you'd only let it be comfortable such fidgeting worries the brim you're best in appearance and i always said it when stripped for boxing hats are gentlemen's things and becomes them like as if a title to their heads though you'd bear being sir robert that you would and for that matter your hat is agreeable to behold and not like the run of our sunday hats only you don't seem easy in it oh oh my tongue's a yard too long it's the poor head aching and me to forget it it's because you never will act invalidy and i remember how handsome you were one day in the field behind our house when you boxed a wager with simon billet the waterman and you was made a bet of then for my husband betted on you and that's what made me think of comparisons of you out of your hat and you in it thus did mrs boulby chatter along the way there was an eminence a little out of the road overlooking the fairly stables robert left her and went to this point from whence he beheld the horsemen with the grooms at the horses' heads thank god i've only been a fool for five minutes he summed up his sensations at the sight he shut his eyes praying with all his might never to meet mrs lovell more it was impossible for him to combat the suggestion that she had befooled him yet his chivalrous faith in women led him to believe that as she knew dahlia's history she would certainly do her best for the poor girl and keep her word to him the throbbing of his head stopped all further thought it had become violent he tried to gather his ideas but the effort was like that of a light dreamer to catch the sequence of a dream when blackness follows close up devouring all that is said and done in despair he thought with kindness of mrs boulby's brandy mother he said rejoining her i've got a notion brandy can't hurt a man when he's in bed i'll go to bed and you shall brew me some and you'll let no one come nigh me and if i talk light headed it's blank paper and scribble mind that the widow promised devoutly to obey all his directions but he had begun to talk light headed before he was undressed he called on the name of a major waring of whom mrs boulby had heard him speak tenderly as a gentleman not ashamed to be his friend first reproaching him for not being by and then by the name of percy calling to him endearingly and reproaching himself for not having written to him two to one and in the dark he kept moaning and i one to twenty percy all in broad day was it fair i ask robert's outcries became anything but blank paper and scribble to the widow when he mentioned nic sedgett's name and said look over his right temple he's got my mark a second time hanging by his bedside mrs boulby strung together bit by bit the history of that base midnight attack which had sent her glorious boy bleeding to her nic sedgett she could understand was the accomplice of one of the fairly gentlemen but of which one she could not discover and consequently set him down as mr algernon blancove by diligent inquiry she heard that algernon had been seen in company with the infamous nic and likewise that the countenance of nicodemus was reduced to accept the consolation of a poultice which was confirmation sufficient by nightfall robert was in the doctor's hands unconscious of mrs boulby's breach of agreement his father and his aunt were informed of his condition and prepared both of them to bow their heads to the close of an ungodly career it was known over warbeach that robert lay in danger and believed that he was dying

powers who feed us dead britons are all britons but live britons are not quite brothers he had no recollection of having ever dined without drinking wine he tried to gather his ideas but the effort
