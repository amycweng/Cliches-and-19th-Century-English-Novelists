and perplexities of my fathers grand parade xlii the marquis of edbury and his puppet xliii i become one of the chosen of the nation xliv my father is miraculously relieved by fortune chapter xxxix i see my father taking the tide and am carried on it myself my father stood in the lobby of the opera holding a sort of open court it appeared to me for a cluster of gentlemen hung round him and i had presently to bow to greetings which were rather of a kind to flatter me leading me to presume that he was respected as well as marvelled at the names of mr serjeant wedderburn mr jennings lord alton sir weeton slater mr monterez williams admiral loftus the earl of witlington were among those which struck my ear and struck me as good ones i could not perceive anything of the air of cynical satellites in these gentlemenon the contrary they were cordially deferential i felt that he was encompassed by undoubted gentlemen and my warmer feelings to my father returned when i became sensible of the pleasant sway he held over the circle both in speaking and listening his sympathetic smile and semidroop of attention his readiness when occasion demanded it to hit the key of the subject and help it on with the right word his air of unobtrusive appreciation his sensibility to the moment when the run of conversation depended upon himshowed inimitable art coming of natural genius and he did not lose a shade of his superior manner the while mr serjeant wedderburn professionally voluble a lively talker brimming with anecdote but too sparkling too prompt too full of personal relish of his point threw my fathers urbane supremacy into marked relief and so in another fashion did the earl of witlington a youth in the season of guffaws as jorian dewitt described him whom a jest would seize by the throat shaking his sapling frame jorian strolled up to us goutily no efforts of my fathers would induce him to illustrate his fame for repartee so it remained established very pretty waxwork he said to me of our english beauties swimming by now those women young richmond if they were inflammable to the fiftieth degree that is if they had the fiftieth part of a frenchwoman in them would have canvassed society on the great mans account long before this and sent him to the top like a bubble he wastes his time on them that fat woman hes bowing to is viscountess sedley a porcine empress widow of three with a soupcon of bigamy to flavour them she mounted from a grocers shop i am told constitution has done everything for that woman so it will everywhereit beats the world now hes on allfours to lady rachel stokes our pure aristocracy she walks as if she were going through a doorway and couldnt risk an eyelid i d like to see her tempting st anthony thats little wreckhams wife shes had as many adventures as gil blas before he entered the duke of lermas service he reviewed several ladies certainly not very witty when malignant as i remembered my father to have said of him the style of your englishwoman is to keep the nose exactly at one elevation to show youre born to it they darent run a gamut these women these englishwomen are a fiction the model of them is the nurserymiss but theyre like the names of true lovers cut on the bark of a treeawfully stiff and longitudinal with the advance of time weve our lady jezebels my boy theyre in the pay of the bishops or the police to make vice hideous the rest do the same for virtue and get their pay for it somewhere i dont doubt perhaps from the newspapers to keep up the fiction i tell you these englishwomen have either no life at all in them or theyre nothing but animal life gad how they dizen themselves theyve no other use for their fingers the wealth of this countrys frightful jorian seemed annoyed that he could not excite me to defend my countrywomen but i had begun to see that there was no necessity for the sanguine to encounter the bilious on their behalf and was myself inclined to be critical besides i was engaged in watching my father whose bearing toward the ladies he accosted did not dissatisfy my critical taste though i had repeated fears of seeing him overdo it he summoned me to an introduction to the countess szezedy a merry little hungarian dame so said she at once speaking german you are to marry the romantic head the princess ottilia of eppenwelzen i know her well i have met her in vienna schone seele and bas bleu its just those that are won with a duel i know prince otto too she prattled away and asked me whether the marriage was to take place in the summer i was too astounded to answer no date is yet fixed my father struck in its the talk of london she said before i could demand explanations of my father with regard to this terrible rumour involving ottilia i found myself in the box of the city widow lady sampleman a grievous person of the complexion of the autumnal brambleleaf whose first words were ah the young suitor and how is our german princess i had to reply that the theme was more of german princes than princesses in england oh but said she you are having ashall i call itnational revenge on them i will take one of your princesses says you and as soon as said done im dying for a sight of her portrait captain dewitt declares her heavenlyi mean he says she is fair and nice quite a ladythat of course and never mind her not being rich you can do the decoration to the match hm she perused my features pale lovelorn excuse an old friend of your fathers one of his very oldest id say if it didnt impugn as such proud of your alliance i am i speak of it everywhere everywhere here she dramatized the circulation of the gossip have you heard the news no what fitzgeorges son marries a princess of the german realm indeed true as gospel and how soon in a month and now you will see the dear neglected man command the court i looked at my father i felt stifling with confusion and rage he leant over to her imparting some ecstatic news about a great lady having determined to call on her to regulate the affairs of an approaching grand ball and under cover of this we escaped if it were not said he for the chassedianeyou are aware richie poor jorian is lost to herhe has fallen at her quicksilver feet she is now in london half the poor fellows income expended in bouquets her portrait in the character of the widow lefourbe has become a part of his dressing apparatus he shaves fronting her playbill his first real affaire de coeur and he is fortyfive so he is taken in the stomach that is why love is such a dangerous malady for middle age as i said but for jenny chassediane our sampleman would be the fortune for jorian i have hinted it on both sides women richie are cleverer than the illustrious lord nelson in not seeing what their inclinations decline to see and jorian would do me any service in the world except that one you are restless my son i begged permission to quit the house and wait for him outside he in return begged me most urgently to allow myself to be introduced to lady edbury the stepmother of lord destrier now marquis of edbury and using conversational pressure he adjured me not to slight this lady adding with more significance than the words conveyed i am taking the tide richie the tide took me and i bowed to a lady of impressive languor pale and young with pleasant manners showing her character in outline like a glove on the hand but little of its quality she accused my father of coming direct from that persons box he replied that he never forsook old friends you should was her rejoinder it suggested to me an image of one of the sister fates cutting a thread my heart sank when from lady edbury too i heard the allusion to germany and its princess some one told me she was dark blonde my father corrected the report lady edbury thought it singular for a german woman of the blood to be a brunette they had not much dark mixture among them particularly in the north her name she had forgotten the name of the princess my father repeated the princess ottilia princess of eppenwelzen sarkeld brunette you say the purest blonde a complexion a complexion to dazzle the righteous lady edbury threw a flying glance in a mirror the unrighteous you leave to us then they bandied the weariful shuttlecock of gallantry i bowed and fled my excuse was that i had seen anna penrhys in an upper tier of boxes and i made my way to her doubting how i should be welcomed the happy woman is a german princess we hear she set me shivering her welcome was perfectly unreserved and friendly she asked the name of the lady whose box i had quitted and after bending her operaglass on it for a moment said with a certain air of satisfaction she is young which led me to guess that lady edbury was reputed to be annas successor but why the latter should be flattered by the formers youth was one of the mysteries for me then her aunt was awakened from sleep by the mention of my name is the man here she exclaimed starting anna smiled and talked to me of my father saying that she was glad to see me at his right hand for he had a hard battle to fight she spoke of him with affectionate interest in his fortunes no better proof of his generosity as well as hers could have been given me i promised her heartily i would not be guilty of letting our intimacy drop and handed the ladies down to the crushroom where i saw my father leading lady edbury to her carriage much observed destrier the young marquis coming in to meet the procession from other haunts linked his arm to his friend witlingtons and said something in my hearing of old duke fitz which provoked i fancied signs of amusement equivalent to tittering in a small ring of the select assembly lady samplemans carriage was called another victim said a voice anna penrhys walked straight out to find her footman and carriage for herself i stood alone in the street wondering fretting filled with a variety of ugly sensations when my father joined me humming an air of the opera i was looking for jorian richie he had our sampleman under his charge he is off to the chassediane well and well richie you could not bear the absence from your dada you find me in full sail on the tide i am at home if our fortunes demand it in a little german principality but there is he threw out his chest a breadth in london nowhere else do i breathe with absolute freedomso largely and this is my battlefield by the way lady edbury accounts you complete which is no more to say than that she is a woman of taste the instance she positively would not notice that you wear a dresscoat of a foreign cut correct it tomorrow my tailor shall wait on you i meant to point out to you that when a london woman has not taken note of that the face and the man have made the right impression on her richie dear boy how shall i speak the delight i have in seeing you my arm in yours old richie strolling home from the fashion this seems to me what i dreamt of all in sound health at the grange she too the best of women i have come on very particular business i interposed briefly he replied i am alive to you richie speak the squire has seen my bankers book he thinks ive been drawing rather wildly no doubt hes right he wants some sort of explanation he consents to an interview with you i have come to ask you to go down to him sir tomorrow morning without an hours delay my dear boy very agreeable will be the sight of old riversley and in the daylight he prefers to meet you at bulsted captain bulsted offers his house for the purpose i have to warn you sir that we stand in a very exceptional position the squire insists upon having a full account of the money rendered to him i invite him to london richie i refer him to dettermain and newson i request him to compute the value of a princess you are aware that he will not come to your invitation tell me then how is he to understand what i have established by the expenditure my son i refer him to dettermain and newson but you must know that he sets his face against legal proceedings involving exposure but surely richie exposure is the very thing we court the innocent the unjustly treated court it we would be talked about you shall hear of us and into the bargain an hereditary princess upon my faith mr beltham i think you have mighty little to complain of my temper was beginning to chafe at the curb as regards any feeling about the money personally sir you know i have none but i must speak of one thing i have heard tonight i confess with as much astonishment as grief the name i could not have guessed that i should hear the princesss name associated with mine and quite openly as a matter of course he nodded and struck out a hand in wavy motion well sir if you cant feel for her or her family be good enough to think of me and remember that i object to it for you all said he buoyantly i feel for you all and i will act for you all i bring the princess to your arms my dear boy you have written me word that the squire gives her a royal dowryhave you not my combinations permit of no escape to any one of you nay tis done i think for youi feel for youi act for you by heaven you shall be happy sigh richie sigh your destiny is now entrusted to me i daresay im wasting my breath sir but i protest against false pretences you know well that you have made use of the princesss name for your own purposes most indubitably richie i have and are they not yours i must have social authority to succeed in our main enterprise possibly the princesss name serves for a temporary chandelier to cast light on us she belongs to us for her sake we are bringing the house she enters into order thus richie i could tell mr beltham you and he supply the money the princess the name and i the energy the skilfulness and the estimable cause i pay the princess for the use of her name with the dowry which is royal i pay you with the princess who is royal too and i richie am paid by your happiness most royally together it is past contest that we winhere my little one he said to a woman and dropped a piece of gold into her hand on condition that you go straight home the woman thanked him and promised as i was observing we are in the very tide of success curious i have a slight inclination to melancholy success quotha why hundreds before us have paced the identical way homeward at night under these lamps between the mansions and the park the bare thought makes them resemble a double line of undertakers the tomb is down there at the end of themcostly or not at the age of four on my birthday i was informed that my mother lay dead in her bed i remember to this day my astonishment at her not moving her heart is broken my old nurse said to me she appeared intact her sister took possession of me and of her papers and the weddingringnow in the custody of dettermain and newsontogether with the portraits of both my parents and she poor soul to sustain me as i verily believeshe had a great idea of my never asking unprofitably for anything in lifebartered the most corroborative of the testificatory documents which would now make the establishment of my case a comparatively light task have i never spoken to you of my boyhood my maternal uncle was a singingmaster and master of elocution i am indebted to him for the cultivation of my voice he taught me an effective delivery of my sentences the english of a book of his called the speaker is still to my mind a model of elegance remittances of money came to him from an unknown quarter and with a break or two have come ever since up to this period my old nurseheaven bless her resumed the occupation of washing i have stood by her tub richie blowing bubbles and listening to her prophecies of my exalted fortune for hours on my honour i doubt i seriously doubt if i have ever been happier i depend just nowi have to avow it to youslightly upon stimulants of a perfectly innocuous character mrs waddy will allow me a pint of champagne the truth is richieyou see these two or three poor pensioners of mine honi soit qui mal y pensemy mother has had hard names thrown at her the stones of these streets cry out to me to have her vindicated i am not tired but i want my wine he repeated several times before he reached his housedoor that he wanted his wine in a manner to be almost alarming his unwonted effort of memory the singular pictures of him which it had flashed before me and a sort of impatient compassion made me forget my wrath i saw him take his restorative at one draught he lay down on a sofa and his valet drew his boots off and threw a cloak over him lying there he wished me gaily goodnight mrs waddy told me that he had adopted this system of sleeping for the last month bless you as many people call on him at night now as in the day she said and i was induced to suppose he had some connection with the press she had implicit faith in his powers of constitution and would affirm that he had been the death of dozens whom the attraction had duped to imitate his habits he is now a field marshal on his campaign she betrayed a twinkle of humour he must himself have favoured her with that remark the report of the housedoor frequently shutting in the night suggested the passage of his aidesde camp early in the morning i found him pacing through the open doors of the diningroom and the library dictating to a secretary at a desk now and then tossing a word to dettermain and newsons chief clerk the floor was strewn with journals he wore hessian boots a voluminous black cloak hung loosely from his shoulders i am just settling the evening papers he said after greeting me with a show of formality in his warmth and immediately added that will do mr jopson put in a note mr harry lepel richmond of riversley and twnyglas my son takes no step to official distinction in his native land save through the ordinary parliamentary channels your pardon richie presently i am replying to a morning paper whats this why print my name i cried merely the correction of an error i have to insist my dear boy that you claim no privileges you are apart from them mr jopson i beseech you not a minutes delay in delivering that fetch me from the printers my pamphlet this afternoon mr jacobs my compliments to dettermain and newson i request them to open proceedings instanter and let the world know of it goodmorning gentlemen and now turning to me my father fenced me with the whole weight of his sententious volubility which was the force of a river why did my name appear in the papers because i was his son but he assured me that he carefully separated me from public companionship with his fortunes and placed me on the side of my grandfather as a plain gentleman of england the heir of the most colossal wealth possible in the country i dissociate you from me richie do you see i cause it to be declared that you need on no account lean on me jopson will bring you my pamphletmy declaration of rightsto peruse in the press in literature at law and on social ground i meet the enemy and i claim my own by heaven i do and i will down to the squire for a distraction if you esteem it necessary certainly halfadozen words to him why do you maintain him to be insensible to a title for you no no and ask my friends i refer him to any dozen of my friends to convince him i have the prize almost in my possession why dear boy i have witnesses living witnesses to the ceremony am i tell me to be deprived of money now once again for the eleventh time oh and put aside my duty to you i protest i am bound in duty to her who bore meyou have seen her miniature how lovely that dear woman was how gentlebound in duty to her to clear her good name this does not affect you oh but it does he allowed me to plead ay through your love for your dada he shook me by both hands i was touched with pity and at the same time in doubt whether it was not an actor that swayed me for i was discontented and could not speak my discontent i was overborne overflowed his evasion of the matter of my objections relating to the princess i felt to be a palpable piece of artfulness but i had to acknowledge to myself that i knew what his argument would be and how overwhelmingly his defence of it would spring forth my cowardice shrank from provoking a recurrence to the theme in fact i submitted consciously to his masterful fluency and emotional power and so i was carried on the tide with him remaining in london several days to witness that i was not the only one my father admitting that money served him in his conquest of society and defying any other man to do as much with it as he did replied to a desperate insinuation of mine this money i spend i am actually putting out to interest as much as or more than your grandad he murmured confidentially i have alarmed the government indeed i have warrant for saying i am in communication with its agents they are bribing me they are positively bribing me richie i receive my stipend annually they are mighty discreet so am i but i push them hard i take what they offer i renounce none of my claims janet wrote that it would be prudent for me to return i am prepared my father said i have only to meet mr beltham in a roomi stipulate that it shall be between square wallsto win him the squire to back us richie we have command of the entire world his wealth and my good cause and your illustrious unionby the way it is announced definitely in this mornings paper dismayed i asked what was announced read said he this will be something to hand to mr beltham at our meeting i might trace it to one of the embassies imperial or royal no matterthere it is i read a paragraph in which ottilias name and titles were set down then followed mine and my wealthy heirship andwoe was me in the perusing of ita roundabout vindication of me as one not likely to be ranked as the first of english commoners who had gained the hand of an hereditary foreign princess though it was undoubtedly in the light of a commoner that i was most open to the congratulations of my countrymen upon my unparalleled felicity a display of historical erudition cited the noble inferiors by birth who had caught princesses to their armscharles humphrey william john under this list a later harry the paragraph closed by fixing the nuptials to take place before the end of the season i looked at my father to try a struggle with him the whole man was efflorescent cant it be stopped i implored him he signified the impossibility in a burst of gesticulations motions of the mouth smiling frowns various patterns of an absolute negative beating down opposition things printed can never be stopped richie our jorian compares them to babies baptized they have a soul from that moment and go on for everan admirable word of jorians and a word to you richie will you swear to me by the veracity of your lovers heart that paragraph affords you no satisfaction he cannot swear it my father exclaimed seeing me swing my shoulder round and he made me feel that it would have been a false oath if i had sworn it but i could have sworn that i had rather we two were at the bottom of the sea than that it should come under the princesss eyes i read it again it was in print it looked like reality it was at least the realization of my dream but this played traitor and accused me of being crowned with no more than a dream the sole practical thing i could do was to insist on our starting for riversley immediately to make sure of my own position name your hour richie my father said confidently and we waited a rather plainer view of my fathers position as i inclined to think was afforded to me one morning at his breakfasttable by a conversation between him and jorian dewitt who brought me a twisted pink note from mdlle chassediane the which he delivered with the air of a dog made to disgorge a bone and he was very cool to me indeed the cutlets of alphonse were subject to snappish criticism i assume he said the fellow knew i was coming he saw it in my handwriting of yesterday replied my father but be just to him acknowledge that he is one of the few that perform their daily duties with a tender conscience this english climate has bedevilled the fellow he peppers his dishes like a mongrel indian reared on mangoes ring him up ring him up jorian all i beg of you is not to disgust him with life for he quits any service in the world to come to me and in fact he suits me exactly so you spoil him my father shrugged the state of the case is that your stomach is growing delicate friend jorian the actual state of the case being that my palate was never keener and consequently my stomach knows its business you should have tried the cold turbot with oil and capers your man had better stick to buttered eggs in my opinion say porridge no ill be hanged if i think hes equal to a bowl of porridge careme might have confessed to the same with this difference cried jorian in a heat that he would never have allowed the thought of any of your barbarous messes to occur to a man at table let me tell you roy you astonish me up till now i have never known you guilty of the bad taste of defending a bad dish on your own board then you will the more readily pardon me jorian oh i pardon you jorian sneered tripped to the carpet by such ignoble mildness a breakfast is no great loss my father assured him he would have a serious conversation with alphonse for whom he apologized by saying that alphonse had not to his knowledge served as hospital cook anywhere and was therefore quite possibly not sufficiently solicitous for appetites and digestions of invalids jorian threw back his head as though to discharge a spiteful sarcasm with good aim but turning to me said harry the thing must be done your father must marry notoriety is the season for a pick and choice of the wealthiest and the loveliest i refuse to act the part of warmingpan any longer i refuse point blank its not a personal feeling on my part my advice is that of a disinterested friend and i tell you candidly roy set aside the absurd exhibition of my dancing attendance on that last rose of guildhallegad the alderman went like summer and left us the very picture of a fruity autumni say you cant keep her hanging on the tree of fond expectation for ever shell drop catch her jorian you are on guard upwards of three hundred thousand if a penny roy richmond who i i am not a fortunehunter nor am i friend jorian no it s because youre not thorough you ll fall between the stools my father remarked that he should visit this upon mr alphonse you shook off that fine welsh girl and she was in your handthe act of a madman jorian continued youre getting older the day will come when youre a flat excitement you know the first lady edbury spoilt one of your best chances when you had the market now youre trifling with the second shes the head of the light brigade but you might fix her down if shes not too much in debt you re not at the end of your run i dare say only my good roy let me tell you in life you mustnt wait for the prize of the race till you touch the goalif you prefer metaphor you generally come forward about every seven years or so add on another seven and womenll begin to think you cant beat time mon roy so said my father i touch the goal and women begin to think and i cant beat time to them jorian your mind is in a state of confusion i do not marry then roy richmond hear what a friend says i do not marry jorian and you know my reasons sentiments they are a part of my life just as i remarked you are not thorough you have genius and courage out of proportion and you are a dead failure roy because no sooner have you got all covent garden before you for the fourth or fifth time than in go your hands into your pockets and you sayno theres an apple i cant have so ill none of these and by the way the apple must be tolerably withered by this time and you know perfectly well for you dont lack common sense at a shaking roy richmond that youre guilty of simple madness in refusing to make the best of your situation you havent to be taught what money means with moneyand a wife to take care of it mind youyou are preeminently the man for which you want to be recognized without itharry ll excuse me i must speak plainlyyoure a sort of a spectacle of a bobcherry down on your luck up on your luck and getting dead stale and never bitten a familiar curiosity jorian added oh by jove its not nice to think of my father said harry i am sure will excuse you for talking in your extreme friendliness of matters that he and i have notand they interest us deeplyyet thought fit to discuss and you may take my word for it jorian that i will give alphonse his medical dose i am quite of your opinion that the kings of cooks require it occasionally harry will inform us of mdlle chassedianes commands the contents of the letter permitted me to read it aloud she desired to know how she could be amused on the sunday we will undertake it said my father i depute the arrangements to you jorian respect the prejudices and avoid collisions that is all captain dewitt became by convenient stages cheerful after the pink slip of paper had been made common property and from a seriouslyadvising friend in his state of spite relapsed to the idle and shadowlike associate when pleased i had to thank him for the gift of fresh perceptions surely it would be as well if my father could get a woman of fortune to take care of him we had at my request a consultation with dettermain and newson on the eve of the journey to riversley temple and jorian dewitt assisting strange documentary evidence was unfolded and compared with the date of a royal decree affidavits of persons now dead a ring the ring fans and lace and handkerchiefs with notable initials jewelry stamped to the divine anastasia from an adoring christian name old brown letters that shrieked wife when charmer seemed to have palled oaths of fidelity ran through them like bass notes jorian held up the discoloured sheets of ancient paper saying here you behold the mummy of the villain love such love as it wasthe love of the privileged butcher for the lamb the burden of the letters put in epigram was rattlesnake and bird a narrative of anastasias sister elizabeth signed and sealed with names of witnesses appended related in brief bald english the history of the events which had killed her it warmed pathetically when dwelling on the writers necessity to part with letters and papers of greater moment that she might be enabled to sustain and educate her sisters child she named the certificate she swore to the tampering with witnesses the number and exact indication of the house where the ceremony took place was stateda house in sohothe date was given and the incident on that night of the rape of the beautiful miss armett by mad lord beaumaris at the theatre doors aided by masked ruffians after anastasias performance of zamira there are witnesses i know to be still living mr temple my father said seeing the young studentatlaw silent and observant one of them i have under my hand i feed him listen to this he read two or three insufferable sentences from one of the love epistles and broke down i was ushered aside by a member of the firm to inspect an instrument prepared to bind me as surety for the costs of the appeal i signed it we quitted the attorneys office convinced i speak of temple and myself that we had seen the shadow of something chapter xl my fathers meeting with my grandfather my fathers pleasure on the day of our journey to bulsted was to drive me out of london on a lofty open chariot with which he made the circuit of the fashionable districts and caused innumerable heads to turn i would have preferred to go the way of other men to be unnoticed but i was subject to an occasional glowing of undefined satisfaction in the observance of the universally acknowledged harmony existing between his pretensions his tastes and habits and his person he contrived by i know not what persuasiveness and simplicity of manner and speech to banish from me the idea that he was engaged in playing a high stake and though i knew it and he more than once admitted it there was an ease and mastery about him that afforded me some degree of positive comfort still i was still most securely attached to his fortunes supposing the ghost of dead hector to have hung over his body when the inflamed son of peleus whirled him at his chariot wheels round troy he would with his natural passions sobered by erebus have had some of my reflections upon force and fate and my partial sense of exhilaration in the tremendous speed of the course during the whole of the period my father termed his grand parade i showed just such acquiescence or resistance as were superinduced by the variations of the ground otherwise i was spellbound and beyond interdicting any further public mention of my name or the princesss i did nothing to thwart him it would have been no light matter we struck a station at a point halfway down to bulsted and found little kiomi there thunder in her brows carrying a bundle and purchasing a railwayticket not to travel in our direction she gave me the singular answer that she could not tell me where her people were nor would she tell me whither she was going alone and by rail i chanced to speak of heriot one of her sheetlightning flashes shot out he wont be at bulsted she said as if that had a significance i let her know we were invited to bulsted oh she s at home kiomi blinked and her features twitched like whipcord i saw that she was possessed by one of her furies that girls face had the art of making me forget beautiful women and what beauty was by comparison it happened that the squire came across us as we were rounding the slope of larch and fir plantation near a part of the riversley hollows leading to the upper heathland where behind a semicircle of birches bulsted lay he was on horseback and called hoarsely to the captains coachman who was driving us to pull up here harry he sang out to me in the same rough voice i dont see why we should bother captain william its a bit of business not pleasure ive got the book in my pocket you askis it convenient to step into my bailiffs cottage hard by and run through it ten minutes ll tell me all i want to know i want it done with ask my father stood up and bowed bareheaded my grandfather struck his hat and bobbed mr beltham i trust i see you well better sir when ive got rid of a damned unpleasant bit o business i offer you my hearty assistance do you then step down and come into my bailiffs i come sir my father alighted from the carriage the squire cast his gouty leg to be quit of his horse but not in time to check my fathers advances and ejaculations of condolence gout mr beltham is a little too much a proof to us of a long line of ancestry his hand and arm were raised in the form of a splint to support the squire who glared back over his cheekbone horrified that he could not escape the contact and in too great pain from arthritic throes to protest he resembled a burglar surprised by justice what infernal nonsense fellow talking now i heard him mutter between his hoppings and dancings with one foot in the stirrup and a toe to earth the enemy at his heel and his inclination half bent upon swinging to the saddle again i went to relieve him damn oh its you said he the squire directed uberly acting as his groom to walk his horse up and down the turf fronting young tom eckerthys cottage and me to remain where i was then hobbled up to the door followed at a leisurely march by my father the door opened my father swept the old man in before him with a bow and flourish that admitted of no contradiction and the door closed on them i caught a glimpse of uberly screwing his wrinkles in a queer grimace while he worked his left eye and thumb expressively at the cottage by way of communicating his mind to samuel captain bulsteds coachman and i became quite of his opinion as to the nature of the meeting that it was comical and not likely to lead to much i thought of the princess and of my hope of her depending upon such an interview as this from that hour when i stepped on the sands of the continent to the day of my quitting them i had been folded in a dream i had stretched my hands to the highest things of earth and here now was the retributive material moneyquestion like a keen scytheblade the cottagedoor continued shut the heaths were darkening i heard a noise of wheels and presently the unmistakable voice of janet saying that must be harry she was driving my aunt dorothy both of them hushed at hearing that the momentous duel was in progress janets first thought was of the squire i wont have him ride home in the dark she said and ordered uberly to walk the horse home the ladies had a ladies altercation before janet would permit my aunt to yield her place and proceed on foot accompanied by me naturally the best driver of the two kept the whip i told samuel to go on to bulsted with word that we were coming and janet nodding bluntly agreed to direct my father as to where he might expect to find me on the riversley road my aunt dorothy and i went ahead slowly at her request i struck a pathway to avoid the ponycarriage which was soon audible and when janet chattering to the squire had gone by we turned back to intercept my father he was speechless at the sight of dorothy beltham at his solicitation she consented to meet him next day his account of the result of the interview was unintelligible to her as well as to me even after leaving her at the parkgates i could get nothing definite from him save that all was well and that the squire was eminently practical but he believed he had done an excellent evenings work yes said he rubbing his hands excellent making due allowances for the emphatically commoners mind we have to deal with and then to change the subject he dilated on that strange story of the man who an enormous number of years back in the date of the worlds history carried his little son on his shoulders one night when the winds were not so boisterous though we were deeper in winter along the identical road we traversed between the gorsemounds across the heaths with yonder remembered firtree clump in sight and the wastewater visible to footfarers rounding under the firs at nighttime he vowed that as far as nature permitted it he had satisfied the squirecompletely satisfied him i mean he said to give me sound sleep no doubt of it no doubt of it richie he won julias heart straight off and captain bulsteds profound admiration now i know the man ive always been adoring since you were so high harry said she captain bulsted sighed your husband bows to your high good taste my dear they relished him sincerely and between them and him i suffered myself to be dandled once more into a state of credulity until i saw my aunt dorothy in the afternoon subsequent to the appointed meeting his deep respect and esteem for her had stayed him from answering any of her questions falsely to that extent he had been veracious it appeared that driven hard by the squire who would have no waving of flags and lighting of fireworks in a matter of business and whose commoners mind chafed sturdily at a hint of the necessity for lavish outlays where there was a princess to win he had rallied on the fiction that many of the cheques standing for the bulk of the sums expended were moneys borrowed by him of me which he designed to repay and was prepared to repay instantlycould in fact the squire demanding it repay as it were on the spot for behold these borrowed moneys were not spent they were moneys invested in undertakings put out to high rates of interest moneys that perhaps it would not be adviseable to call in without a season of delay still if mr beltham acting for his grandson and heir insisted it should be done the moneys had been borrowed purely to invest them with profit on my behalf a gentlemans word of honour was pledged to it the squire grimly gave him a couple of months to make it good dorothy beltham and my father were together for about an hour at eckerthys farm she let my father kiss her hand when he was bending to take his farewell of her but held her face away he was in manifest distress hardly master of his voice begged me to come to him soon and bowing with god bless you madam my friend on earth turned his heel bearing his elastic frame lamentably a sad or a culprit air did not befit him one reckoned up his foibles and errors when seeing him under a partly beaten aspect at least i did not my dear aunt who was compassionate of him however thoroughly she condemned his ruinous extravagance and the shifts and evasions it put him to she feared that instead of mending the difficulty he had postponed merely to exaggerate it in the squires mind and she was now of opinion that the bringing him down to meet the squire was very bad policy likely to result in danger to my happiness for if the money should not be forthcoming on the date named all my fathers faults would be transferred to me as his accomplice both in the original wastefulness and the subterfuges invented to conceal it i recollected that a sum of money had really been sunk in prince ernests coalmine my aunt said she hoped for the best mounting the heaths we looked back on the long yellow road where the carriage conveying my father to the railwaystation was visible and talked of him and of the elements of antique tragedy in his history which were at that period let me say precisely what my incessant mental efforts were strained to expel from the idea of our human life the individuals freedom was my tenet of faith but pity pleaded for him that he was wellnigh irresponsible was shamefully sinned against at his birth one who could charge the gods with vindictiveness and complain of the persecution of natal furies my aunt dorothy advised me to take him under my charge and sell his house and furniture make him live in bachelor chambers with his faithful waitingwoman and a single manservant he will want money even to do that i remarked she murmured is there not some annual income paid to him her quick delicacy made her redden in alluding so closely to his personal affairs and i loved her for the nice feeling it was not much i said the miserable attempt to repair the wrongs done to him with this small annuity angered meand i remembered little pleased the foolish expectations he founded on this secret acknowledgement of the justice of his claims we wont talk of it i pursued i wish he had never touched it i shall interdict him you would let him pay his debts with it harry i am not sure aunty that he does not incur a greater debt by accepting it ones wish would be that he might not ever be in need of it ay or never be caring to find the key of it that must be waste of time she said i meant something else but it was useless to tell her so chapter xli commencement of the splendours and perplexities of my fathers grand parade janet in reply to our inquiries as to the condition of the squires temper pointed out in the newspaper a notification of a grand public ball to be given by my father the first of a series of three and said that the squire had seen it and shrugged she thought there was no positive cause for alarm even though my father should fail of his word but expressed her view decidedly that it was an unfortunate move to bring him between the squire and me and so she blamed captain bulsted this was partly for the reason that the captain and his wife charmed by my father were for advocating his merits at the squires table our ingenuity was ludicrously taxed to mystify him on the subject of their extravagant eulogies they told him they had been invited and were going to the great london balls subscription balls asked the squire no sir rejoined the captain tradesmens balls d ye call em then no sir they are balls given by a distinguished gentleman take care its not another name for tradesmens balls william i do not attend tradesmens balls sir take care o that william the captain was very angry what said he turning to us what does the squire mean by telling an officer of the royal navy that he is conducting his wife to a tradesmens ball julia threatened malicious doings for the insult she and the squire had a controversy upon the explication of the word gentleman she describing my fathers appearance and manners to the life now listen to me squire a gentleman i say is one youd say if he wasnt born a duke he ought to have been and more shame to the title he turns the key of a ladys heart with a twinkle of his eye he s never meanwhat he has is yours hes a true friend and if he doesnt keep his word you know in a jiffy its the fault of affairs and stands about five feet eleven hes a fullblown man and so forth the squire listened and perspired at finding the object of his abhorrence crowned thus in the unassailable realms of the abstract julia might have done it more elegantly but her husband was rapturous over her skill in portraiture and he added thats a gentleman squire and that s a man pretty sure to be abused by half the world threequarters william said the squire theres about the computation for your gentlemans creditors i suspect ay sir well returned the captain to whom this kind of fencing in the dark was an affliction we make it up in qualityin quality i ll be bound you do said the squire and so you will so long as you re only asked to dance to the other poor devils fiddling captain bulsted bowed the last word to you squire the squire nodded i ll hand it to your wife william julia took it graciously a perfect gentleman perfect confound his enemies why maam you might keep from swearing the squire bawled la squire said she why dont you know the national anthem national anthem maam and a fellow a velvettonguedconfound him if you like and wheres my last word if you please julia jumped up and dropped a provoking curtsey you silly old grandada said janet going round to him dont you see the cunning woman wants to dress you in our garments and means to boast of it to us while youre finishing your wine the old man fondled her i could have done the same she bent over him with such homely sweetness one comfort you wont go to these gingerbread balls he said im not invited she moaned comically no nor shant be while i can keep you out of bad company but grandada i do like dancing dance away my dear ive no objection but wheres the music oh you can always have music but where are my partners the squire pointed at me you dont want more than one at a time eh he corrected his error no the fellows engaged in another quadrille mind you miss janet he shall dance to your tune yet d ye hear sir the irritation excited by captain bulsted and julia broke out in fury whos that fellow danced when rome was burning the emperor nero said janet he killed harrys friend seneca in the eightysomethingth year of his age an old man andhush grandada she could not check him hark you mr harry dance your hardest up in town with your rips and reps and the lot of ye all very fine while the burning goes on you wont see the fun of dancing on the ashes a nice king of rome nero was next morning by the lord if i couldnt swear youll be down on your knees to an innocent freshhearted girl s worth five hundred of the crew youre for partnering now while youve a penny for the piper janet shut his mouth kissed him and held his wine up he drank and thumped the table we ll have parties here too the girl shall have her choice of partners she shant be kept in the background by a young donkey take any six of your own age and six sensible men to try you by your chances by george the whole dozen d bring you in noncompos youve only got the women on your side because of a smart face and figure janet exclaimed indignantly grandada im offended with you and walked out on a high step come if he has the women on his side said captain bulsted mildly hell be able to go partnering and gallopading as long as his banker ll let him williamlike your gentleman thats true we shall soon see i leave my character in your hands sir said i rising if you would scold me in private i should prefer it on behalf of your guests but i am bound to submit to your pleasure and under any circumstances i remember what you appear to forget that you are my grandfather so saying i followed the ladies it was not the wisest of speeches and happened captain bulsted informed me to be delivered in my fathers manner for the squire pronounced emphatically that he saw very little beltham in me the right course would have been for me to ask him then and there whether i had his consent to start for germany but i was the sport of resentments and apprehensions and indeed i should not have gone i could not go without some title beyond that of the heir of great riches janet kept out of my sight i found myself strangely anxious to console her less sympathetic perhaps than desirous to pour out my sympathy in her ear which was of a very pretty shape with a soft unpierced lobe we danced together at the riversley ball given by the squire on the night of my fathers ball in london janet complimented me upon having attained wisdom now we get on well she said grandada only wants to see us friendly and feel that i am not neglected the old man a martyr to what he considered due to his favourite endured the horror of the ball until suppertime and kept his eyes on us two he forgot or pretended to forget my foreign engagement altogether though the announcement in the newspapers was spoken of by sir roderick and lady echester and others how do you like that he remarked to me seeing her twirled away by one of the young rubreys she seems to like it sir i replied like it said he in my day you wouldnt have caught me letting the bloom be taken off the girl i cared for by a parcel o scampish young dogs right in their arms look at her build shes strong shes healthy she goes round like a tower if you want a girl to look like a princess his eulogies were not undeserved but she danced as lightly and happily with mr fred rubrey as with harry richmond i congratulated myself on her lack of sentiment later when in london where mlle jenny chassediane challenged me to perilous sarabandes i wished that janet had ever so small a grain of sentiment for a preservative to me ottilia glowed high and distant she sent me no message her image did not step between me and disorder the whole structure of my idea of my superior nature seemed to be crumbling to fragments and beginning to feel in despair that i was wretchedly like other men i lost by degrees the sense of my hold on her it struck me that my worst fears of the effect produced on the princesss mind by that last scene in the lakepalace must be true and i abandoned hope temple thought she tried me too cruelly under these circumstances i became less and less resolutely disposed to renew the forlorn conflict with my father concerning his prodigal way of living let it last as long as i have a penny to support him i exclaimed he said that dettermain and newson were now urging on his case with the utmost despatch in order to keep pace with him but that the case relied for its life on his preserving a great appearance he handed me his division of our twin chequebooks telling me he preferred to depend on his son for supplies and i was in the mood to think this a partial security but you can take what there is i said on the contrary i will accept nothing but minor sumsso to speak the fractional shillings though i confess i am always bewildered by silver said he i questioned him upon his means of carrying on his expenditure his answer was to refer to the pavement of the city of london by paving here and there he had he informed me made a concrete for the wheels to roll on he calculated that he now had credit for the space of three new yearsample time for him to fight his fight and win his victory my tradesmen are not like the tradesmen of other persons he broke out with a curious neigh of supreme satisfaction in that retinue they believe in me i have de facto harnessed them to my fortunes and if you doubt me on the point of success i refer you to dettermain and newson all i stipulate for is to maintain my position in society to throw a lustre on my case so much i must do my failures hitherto have been entirely owing to the fact that i had not my son to stand by me then you must have money sir yes money then what can you mean by refusing mine i admit the necessity for it my son say you hand me a cheque for a temporary thousand your credit and mine in conjunction can replace it before the expiration of the two months or he meditated it might be better to give a bond or so to a professional lender and preserve the account at your bankers intact the truth is i have in my interview with the squire drawn in advance upon the material success i have a perfect justification to anticipate and i cannot allow the old gentleman to suppose that i retrench for the purpose of giving a large array of figures to your bankers book it would be sheer madness i cannot do it i cannot afford to do it when you are on a runaway horse i prefer to say a racehorserichie you must ride him you dare not throw up the reins only last night wedderburn appealing to loftus a practical sailor was approved when he offeredi forget the subjectmatterthe illustration of a ship on a leeshore you are lost if you do not spread every inch of canvas to the gale retrenchment at this particular moment is perdition count our gains richie we have won a princess i called to him not to name her he persisted half a minute she is won she is ours and let me in passingbear with me one secondcounsel you to write to prince ernest instanter proposing formally for his daughter and in your grandfathers name state her dowry at fifty thousand per annum oh you forget i interjected no richie i do not forget that you are off a leeshore you are mounted on a skittish racehorse with if you like a new forest fly operating within an inch of his bellygirths our situation is so far ticklish and prompts invention and audacity you must forget sir that in the present state of the squires mind i should be simply lying in writing to the prince that he offers a dowry no for your grandfather has yielded consent by implication you know he withdraws it but if i satisfy him that you have not been extravagant i must wait till he is satisfied the thing is done richie done i see it in advanceit is done whatever befalls me you my dear boy in the space of two months may graspyour fortune besides here is my hand i swear by it my son that i shall satisfy the squire i go farther i say i shall have the means to refund to youthe means the money the marriage is announced in our prints for the summersay early june and i undertake that you the husband of the princess shall be the first gentleman in england that is europe oh not ruling a coterie not dazzling the world with entertainments he thought himself in earnest when he said i attach no mighty importance to these things though there is no harm i can perceive in leading the fashionnone that i see in having a consummate style i know your taste and hers richie the noble ladys she shall govern the intellectual worldyour poets your painters your men of science they reflect a beautiful sovereign mistress more exquisitely than almost aristocracy does but you head our aristocracy also you are a centre of the political world so i scheme it between you i defy the court to rival you this i call distinction it is no mean aim by heaven i protest it is an aim with the mark in sight and not out of range he whipped himself up to one of his oratorical frenzies of which a cheque was the common fruit the power of his persuasiveness in speech backed by the spectacle of his social accomplishments continued to subdue me and i protested only inwardly even when i knew that he was gambling with fortune i wrote out many cheques and still it appeared to me that they were barely sufficient to meet the current expenses of his household temple and i calculated that his grand parade would try the income of a duke and could but be a matter of months mention of it reached riversley from various quarters from lady maria higginson from captain bulsted and his wife and from sir roderick ilchester who said to me with fine accentuation i have met your father sir roderick an englishman reputed of good breeding informed the son that he had actually met the father in lofty society at viscountess sedleys at lady dolchesters at bramham dewitts and heard of him as a frequenter of the prussian and austrian embassy entertainments and also that he was admitted to the exclusive dinnerparties of the countess de strode which are he observed in the moderated tone of an astonishment devoting itself to propagation the cream of society indubitably then my father was an impostor more society proved it the squire listened like one pelted by a storm sure of his day to come at the close of the two months i gained his commendation by shunning the metropolitan balls nor did my father press me to appear at them it was tacitly understood between us that i should now and then support him at his dinnertable and pass bowing among the most select of his great ladies and this i did and i felt at home with them though i had to bear with roughnesses from one or two of the more venerable dames which were not quite proper to good breeding old lady kane greataunt of the marquis of edbury was particularly my tormentor through her plain spoken comments on my fathers legal suit for i had to listen to her without wincing and agree in her general contempt of the georges and foil her queries coolly when i should have liked to perform jorian dewitts expressed wish to squeeze the acid out of her in one grip and toss her to the gods that collect exhausted lemons she took extraordinary liberties with me why not marry an englishwoman rich young men ought to choose wives from their own people out of their own sets foreign women never get on well in this country unless they join the hounds to hunt the husband she cited naturalized ladies famous for the pastime her world and its outskirts she knew thoroughly even to the fact of my grandfathers desire that i should marry janet ilchester she named a dukes daughter an earls of course i should have to stop the scandal otherwise the choice i had was unrestricted my father she evidently disliked but she just as much disliked an encounter with his invincible bonhomie and dexterous tongue she hinted at family reasons for being shy of him assuring me that i was not implicated in them the guelph pattern was never much to my taste she said and it consoled me with the thought that he was not ranked as an adventurer in the houses he entered i learned that he was supposed to depend chiefly on my vast resources edbury acted the part of informant to the inquisitive harridan her poor dear goodfornothing edbury whose only cure would be a nice wellconducted girl an heiress she had cast her eye on anna penrhys but considered her antecedents doubtful spotless innocence was the sole receipt for edburys malady my father in a fit of bold irony proposed lady kane for president of his tattle and scandal cluba club of ladies dotted with select gentlemen the idea of which jorian dewitt claimed the merit of starting and my father surrendered it to him with the reservation that jorian intended an association of backbiters pledged to reveal all they knew whereas the club in its present form was an engine of morality and decency and a social safeguard as well as an amusement it comprised a committee of investigation and a court of appeal its object was to arraign slander lady kane declined the honour i am not a washerwoman she said to me and spoke of where dirty linen should be washed and was distressingly broad in her innuendoes concerning edburys stepmother this club sat and became a terror for a month adding something to my fathers reputation his inexhaustible conversational art and humour gave it such vitality as it had ladies of any age might apply for admission when well seconded gentlemen under fortyfive years were rigidly excluded and the seniors must also have passed through the marriage ceremony outside tattle and scandal declared that the club was originated to serve as a club for lady edbury but i chose to have no opinion upon what i knew nothing of these matters were all ephemeral and freaks they produced however somewhat of the same effect on me as on my father in persuading me that he was born for the sphere he occupied and rendering me rather callous as to the sources of ways and means i put my name to a bond for several thousand pounds in conjunction with lord edbury thinking my father right in wishing to keep my chequebook unworried lest the squire should be seized with a spasm of curiosity before the two months were over i promise you i surprise him my father said repeatedly he did not say how i had the suspicion that he did not know his confidence and my growing recklessness acted in unison happily the newspapers were quiet i hoped consequently to find peace at riversley but there the rumours of the grand parade were fabulous thanks to captain bulsted and julia among others these two again provoked an outbreak of rage from the squire and i after hearing them was almost disposed to side with him they suggested an inexplicable magnificence and created an image of a man portentously endowed with the capacity to throw dust in the eyes no description of the balls could have furnished me with such an insight of their brilliancy as the consuming ardour they awakened in the captain and his wife he reviewed them princely entertainments arabian nights she built them up piecemeal the company the dresses the band the supper the host was a personage supernatural aladdins magician if you like said julia onlygood a perfect gentleman and ill say again confound his enemies she presumed as she was aware she might do upon the squires prepossession in her favour without reckoning that i was always the victim heard o that new story bout a dauphin he asked a dauphin quoth captain bulsted i dont know the fish youve been in a pretty kettle of em lately william i heard of it yesterday on the bench lord shale our new lordlieutenant brought it down a trick they played the fellow bout a dauphin serve him right you heard anything bout it harry i had not but i tell ye there is a dauphin mixed up with him a dauphin and mr ik dine mr ik dine exclaimed the captain perplexed ay thats german lingo william and you ought to know it if youre a loyal sailormeans i serve mr beltham said the captain seriously i give you my word of honour as a man and a british officer i dont understand one syllable of what youre saying but if it means any insinuation against the gentleman who condescends to extend his hospitalities to my wife and me i must with regret quit the place where i have had the misfortune to hear it you stop where you are william the squire motioned to him gad i shall have to padlock my mouth or i shant have a friend left soon confounded fellow i tell you they call him mr ik dine in town ik dine and a dauphin they made a regular clown and pantaloon o the pair im told couple o pretenders to thrones invited to dine together and talk over their chances and show their private marks oho byand by william you and i never a man made such a fool of in his life the ladies retired the squire continued in a furious whisper they got the two together william who are you im a dauphin who are you im ik dine bar sinister oh says the other then i take precedence of you devil a bit says the other ive got more spots than you proof says one you first t other count one cries t other sings out measles better than a dying dauphin roars t other and swore both of m twas nothing but portwine stains and pimples ha

he brought it to us hot from towndidnt know i knew the fellow says the fellows charging and firing himself off all day and all night too cant make him out says londons mad about him lots o women the fools ha ha a dauphin ah well sir captain bulsted supplicated feverishly rubbing his brows and whiskers it s true william fellow ought to be taken up and committed as a common vagabond and would be anywhere but in london id jail him fore you cocked your eye twice fellow came here and talked me over to grant him a couple o months to prove he hasnt swindled his son of every scrap of his money we

brokenhearted mother with interest and treat you like a man and never played spy never made an inquiry till i heard the scamp had been fastening on you like a bloodsucker and singing hymns into the ears of that squeamish dolt of a pipesmoking parson peterboroughnever thought of doing it am i the man that dragged your grandmothers name through the streets and soiled yours i remarked that i was sensible of the debt of gratitude i owed to him but would rather submit to the scourge or to destitution than listen to these attacks on my father cut yourself loose harry he cried a trifle mollified dont season his stewd ye hear stick to decent people why you dont expect hell be locked up in the tower for a finish eh itll be newgate or the bench he and his dauphinha ha a rascal crow and a jack dauphin captain bulsted reached me his hand you have a great deal to bear harry i commend you my boy for taking it manfully i say no more quoth the squire but what i said was true the fellow gives his little dinners and suppers to his marchionesses countesses duchesses and plays clown and pantaloon among the men he thinks a parcel o broidered petticoats ll float him so they may till a tradesman sent stark mad pops a pin into him harry id as lief hang on to a fireship heres ilchester tells me and ilchester speaks of him under his breath now as if he were sitting in a pew funking the parson confound the fellow i say hes guilty of treason pooh who cares he cuts out the dandies of his day does he hes past sixty if hes a month its all damned harlequinade let him twirl off one columbine or another or a dozen and thenthe last of him fellow makes the world look like a farce he s got about eight feet by five to caper on and all london gaping at himgeese are you a gentleman and a man of sense harry richmond to let yourself be lugged about in public by the lord like a pair of streettumblers in spangled haunchbags father and boy on a patch of carpet and a drum banging and tossed and turned inside out and my god the ass of a fellow strutting the ring with you on his shoulder thats the spectacle and you harry now i ll ask you do you mean your wifeegad itd be a pretty scene with your princess in hipup petticoats stiff as bottlefunnel top downards airing a whole leg and knuckling a tambourine not crying my dear lad captain bulsted put his arm round me kindly and tried to catch a glimpse of my face i let him see i was not going through that process whew said he and enough to make any christian sweat youre in a bath harry i wouldnt expect the man who murdered his godmother for one shilling and fivepence threefarthings the other day to take such a slinging and think he deserved it my power of endurance had reached its limit you tell me sir you had this brutal story from the lordlieutenant of the county ay from lord shale but i wont have you going to him and betraying our connection with a halloo captain bulsted sang out to his wife on the lawn and now squire i have had my dose and you will permit me to observe that i find it emphatically what we used to call at school blackjack and you were all the better for it afterwards william we did not arrive at that opinion sir harry your arm an hour with the ladies will do us both good the squire he murmured wiping his forehead as he went out has a knack of bringing us into close proximity with hellfire when he pleases julia screamed on beholding us arent you two men as pale as death janet came and looked merely a dose said the captain we are anxious to play battledore and shuttlecock madly so he shall the dear julia caressed him well all have a tournament in the wetweather shed janet whispered to me was itthe returning thanks the what said i with the dread at my heart of something worse than i had heard she hailed julia to run and fetch the battledores and then told me she had been obliged to confiscate the newspapers that morning and cast the burden on postoffice negligence they reach grandadas hands by afternoon post harry and he finds objectionable passages blotted or cut out and as long as the scissors dont touch the business columns and the debates he never asks me what i have been doing he thinks i keep a scrapbook i havent often time in the morning to run an eye all over the paper this morning it was the first thing i saw what had she seen she led me out of view of the windows and showed me my father was accused of having stood up at a public dinner and returned thanks on behalf of an estate of the realm it read monstrously i ceased to think of the suffering inflicted on me by my grandfather janet and i side by side with the captain and julia carried on the game of battledore and shuttlecock in a match to see whether the unmarried could keep the shuttle flying as long as the married with varying fortunes she gazed on me to give me the comfort of her sympathy too much and i was too intent on the vision of my father either persecuted by lies or guilty of hideous follies to allow the match to be a fair one so julia could inform the squire that she and william had given the unmarried pair a handsome beating when he appeared peeping round one of the shedpillars of course you beat em said the squire it s not my girls fault he said more to the old tune which drove janet away i remembered when back in the london vortex the curious soft beauty she won from casting up her eyes to watch the descending feathers and the brilliant direct beam of those thickbrowed firm clear eyes with her frown and her set lips and brave figure when she was in the act of striking to keep up a regular quick fusilade i had need of calm memories the town was astir and humming with one name chapter xlii the marquis of edbury and his puppet i passed from man to man hearing hints and hesitations alarming half remarks presumed to be addressed to one who could supply the remainder and deduce consequences there was a clearer atmosphere in the street of clubs jennings was the first of my fathers more intimate acquaintances to meet me frankly he spoke though not with great seriousness of the rumour of a possible prosecution sir weeton slater tripped up to us with a mixed air of solicitude and restraint asked whether i was well and whether i had seen the newspapers that morning and on my informing him that i had just come up from riversley on account of certain rumours advised me to remain in town strictly for the present he also hinted at rumours of prosecutions the fact is he began several times rendered discreet i suppose by my juvenility fierte and reputed wealth we were joined by admiral loftus and lord alton they queried and counterqueried as to passages between my father and the newspapers my father and the committee of his club preserving sufficient consideration for me to avoid the serious matter in all but distant allusions a point upon which the breeding of mr serjeant wedderburn was not so accurate a guide to him an exciting public scandal soon gathers knots of gossips in clubland we saw wedderburn break from a group some way down the pavement and pick up a fresh crumb of amusement at one of the doorsteps roy richmond is having his benefit today he said and repeated this and that half audible to me for the rest he poohpoohed the idea of the law intervening his how d ye do mr richmond how d ye do was almost congratulatory i think we meet at your fathers table tonight it wont be in the tower take my word for it oh the papers theres no act to compel a man to deny what appears in the papers no such luck as the towerthough littlepitt mr wedderburns nickname for our premier would be fool enough for that he would if he could turn attention from his bill hed do it we should have to dine off boleyns blockcoquite horum obsonia hed say eh jennings espied my fathers carriage and stepped to speak a word to the footman he returned saying with a puff of his cheeks the grand monarque has been sending his state equipage to give the old backbiting cripple brisby an airing he is for horse exercise today theyve dropped him in courtenay square there goes brisby hed take the good samaritans shilling to buy a flask of poison for him he ll use roys carriage to fetch and carry for that venomous old woman kane ill swear shes a male in scripture said wedderburn and this reminded me of an anecdote that reminded him of another and after telling them he handed round his hat for the laugh as my father would have phrased it has her ladyship declared war sir weeton slater inquired no thats not her preliminary to wageing it wedderburn replied these highpressure smart talkers had a moment of dulness and he bethought him that he must run into the club for letters and was busy at westminster where if anything fresh occurred between meridian and six oclock he should be glad he said to have word of it by messenger that he might not be behind his age the form of humour to express the speed of the world was common but it struck me as a terrible illustration of my fathers i had still a sense of pleasure in the thought that these intimates of his were gentlemen who relished and perhaps really liked him they were not parasites not the kind of men found hanging about vulgar profligates i quitted them sir weeton slater walked halfadozen steps beside me may i presume on a friendly acquaintance with your father mr richmond he said the fact isyou will not be offendedhe is apt to lose his head unless the committee of supply limits him very precisely i am aware that there is no material necessity for any restriction he nodded to me as to one of the marvellously endowed as who should say the gods presided at your birth the worthy baronet struggled to impart his meaning which was that he would have me define something like an allowance to my father not so much for the purpose of curtailing his expenditurehe did not venture upon private groundas to bridle my fathers ideas of things possible for a private gentleman in this country in that character none were like him as to his suit or appeal he could assure me that serjeant wedderburn and all who would or could speak on the subject saw no prospect of success not any the worst of it was that it caused my father to commit himself in sundry ways it gave a handle to his enemies ithe glanced at me indicatively i thanked the wellmeaning gentleman without encouraging him to continue it led him to perform once more as a statue of bronze before the whole of gaping london i could have added that scene on the pinepromontory arose in my vision followed by other scenes of the happy german days i had no power to conjure up the princess jorian dewitt was the man i wanted to see after applications at his club and lodgings i found him dragging his burgundy leg in the park on his road to pay a morning visit to his fair french enchantress i impeached him and he pleaded guilty clearly not wishing to take me with him nor would he give me mlle jennys address which i had by virtue of the threat that i would accompany him if he did not satisfy me i managed to extract the story of the dauphin aghast at the discovery of its being true the fatal afterdinner speech he believed to have been actually spoken and he touched on that first a trap was laid for him harry richmond and a deuced clever trap it was they smuggled in special reporters there wasnt a bit of necessity for the toast but the old vixen has shown her hand so now he must fight he can beat her singlehanded on settees hell find her a tartar at long bowls she sticks at nothing she blazes out that he scandalizes her family she has a dozen indictments against him you must stop in town and keep watch theres fire in my leg to explode a powdermagazine a mile off is it the margravine of rippau i inquired i could think of no other waspish old woman lady dane said jorian she set edbury on to face him with the dauphin you dont fancy it came of the young dog all of himself do you why it was clever he trots about a briefless little barrister a scribbler devilish clever and impudent who does his farces for him tenby s the fellows name and its the only thing i havent heard him pun on puns are the smallpox of the languagewere cursed with an epidemic by gad the next time i meet him i ll roar out for vaccine matter he described the dinner given by edbury at a celebrated city tavern where my father and this socalled dauphin were brought together dinner to night he nodded as he limped away on his blissful visit of ceremony to sprightly chassediane a bouquet had gone in advance he left me stupefied the sense of ridicule enveloped me in suffocating folds howling sentences of the squires boeotian burlesque by fits i felt that i could not but take the worlds part against the man who allowed himself to be made preposterous externally when i knew him to be staking his frail chances and my fortune with such rashness it was unpardonable for one in his position to incur ridicule nothing but a sense of duty kept me from rushing out of london and i might have indulged the impulse advantageously delay threw me into the clutches of lady kane herself on whom i looked with as composed a visage as i could command while she leaned out of her carriage chattering at me and sometimes over my head to passing gentlemen she wanted me to take a seat beside her she had so much to say was there not some funny story abroad of a pretender to the throne of france she asked wrinkling her crowsfeet eyelids to peer at me and wished to have the particulars i had none to offer ah well said she you stay in london come and see me im sure you re sensible you and i can put our heads together hes too often in courtenay square and hes ten years too young for that still he ought to have good advice tell me how can a woman who cant guide herself help a manand the most difficult man alive im sure you understand me i cant drive out in the afternoon for them they make a crush here and a clatter of tongues thats my private grievance but hes now keeping persons away who have the first social claim i know they cant appear dont look confused no one accuses you only i do say it s getting terribly hot in london for somebody call on me will you she named her hours i bowed as soon as i perceived my opportunity her allusions were to lady edbury and to imputed usurpations of my fathers i walked down to the chambers where temple was reading law for a refuge from these annoyances i was in love with the modest shadowed life temple lived diligently reading and glancing on the world as through a dusky window happy to let it run its course while he sharpened his weapons a look at temples face told me he had heard quite as much as was known in the west dininghalls of lawyers are not cistercian he was able to give me three distinct versions of the story of the dauphin no one could be friendlier indeed temple now urged me forcibly to prevent my father from spending money and wearing his heart out in vain by stopping the case in dettermain and newsons hands they were respectable lawyers he said in a lawyers ordinary tone when including such of his species as are not black sheep he thought it possible that my fathers personal influence overbore their judgment in fact nothing bound them to refuse to work for him and he believed that they had submitted their views for his consideration i do wish hed throw it up temple exclaimed it makes him enemies and just examining it you see he could get no earthly good out of it he might as well try to scale a perpendicular rock but when im with him im ready to fancy what he pleasesi acknowledge that he has excess of phosphorus or hes ultraelectrical doctors could tell us better than lawyers temple spoke of the clever young barrister tenby as the man whom his father had heard laughing over the trick played upon roy richmond i conceived that i might furnish mr tenby a livelier kind of amusement and the thought that i had once been sur le terrain and had bitterly regretted it by no means deterred me from the idea of a second expedition so black was my mood a review of the circumstances aided by what reached my ears before the night went over convinced me that edbury was my man his subordinate helped him to the instrument and possibly to the plot but edbury was the capital offender the scene of the prank was not in itself so bad as the stuff which a cunning anecdotist could make out of it edbury invited my father to a dinner at a celebrated city tavern he kept his guests jennings jorian dewitt alton wedderburn were among the few i was acquainted with who were present awaiting the arrival of a person for whom he professed extraordinary respect the dauphin of france was announced a mild flabby amiablelooking old person with shelving forehead and grey locksexcellently built for the object jorian saidentered the capet head and embonpoint were there as far as a personal resemblance might go his pretensions to be the longlost dauphin were grotesquely convincing for notwithstanding the accurate picture of the family presented by him the man was a pattern bourgeoisa sturdy impostor one would have thought and i thought so when i heard of him but i have been assured that he had actually grown old in the delusion that he carrying on his business in the city of london was the identical dauphin edbury played his part by leading his poor old victim half way to meet his other most honoured guest hesitating then and craving counsel whether he was right in etiquette to advance the dauphin so far the dauphin left him mildly to decide the point he was eminently mild throughout and seems to have thought himself in good faith surrounded by believers and adherents edburys task soon grew too delicate for that coarse boy in my fathers dexterous hands he at once lost his assumption of the gallantry of manner which could alone help him to retain his advantage when the wine was in him he began to bawl i could imagine the sort of dialogue he raised bets on the dauphin bets on roy they were matched as on a racecourse the dauphin remembered incidents of his residence in the temple with a beautiful juvenile faintness a conscientious angling for recollection wedderburn said roy was requested to remember something to drink and refresh his memory infantine incidents were suggested he fenced the treacherous host during dinner with superb complacency the dauphin was of an immoveable composure he stated simple facts he was the dauphin of france providentially rescued from the temple in the days of the terror for this deliverance somewhat to the consternation of the others he offered up a short prayer of thanksgiving over his plate he had he said encountered incredulity he had his proofs he who had never been on the soil of france since early boyhood spoke french with a pure accent he had the physical and moral constitution of the family owing to events attending his infant days he was timid jorian imitated himi start at the opening of a door i see dark faces in my sleep it is a dungeon i am at the knees of my unfortunate royal father with my beautiful mother his french was quaint but not absurd he became loquacious apostrophizing vacancy with uplifted hand and eye the unwonted invitation to the society of noblemen made him conceive his dauphinship to be on the high road to a recognition in england and he was persuaded to drink and exhibit proofs which were that he had the constitution of the family as aforesaid in every particular that he was peculiarly marked with testificatory spots and that his mere aspect inspired all members and branch members of the family with awe and stupefaction one of the latter hearing of him had appointed to meet him in a pastrycooks shop he met him and left the place with a cloud on his brow showing tokens of respectful sympathy conceive a monomaniacal obese old english citizen given to lift hand and eye and address the cornices claiming to be an illustrious boy and calling on a beautiful historic mother and unfortunate royal sire to attest it no wonder the table was shaken with laughter he appealed to tenby constantly as to the one man he knew in the room tenby it was who made the discovery of him somewhere in the city where he earned his livelihood either as a cornmerchant or a stockbroker or a chronometer maker or a drysalter and was always willing to gratify a customer with the sight of his proofs of identity mr tenby made it his business to push his clamorous waggishness for the exhibition i could readily believe that my father was more than his match in disposable sallies and weight of humour and that he shielded the old creature successfully so long as he had a tractable being to protect but the dauphin was plied with wine and the marquis had his fun proof upon proof in verification of his claims was proffered by the nowtremulous son of st louisso he called himself with jorian admitted a real courtly dignity he stood up and proposed to lead the way to any neighbouring cabinet to show the spots on his person living witnesses to the truth of his allegations he declared them to be the squire had authority for his broad farce except in so far as he mixed up my father in the swinery of it i grew more and more convinced that my father never could have lost his presence of mind when he found himself in the net of a plot to cover him with ridicule he was the only one who did not retire to the dauphins chamber of testification to return convulsed with vinous laughter after gravely inspecting the evidence for which abstention the dauphin reproached him violently in round terms of abuse challengeing him to go through a similar process this was the signal for edbury tenby and some of the rest they formed a circle onehalf for the dauphin one for roy how long the boorish fun lasted and what exactly came of it i did not hear jorian dewitt said my father lost his temper a point contested by wedderburn and jennings for it was unknown of him anyhow he thundered to some effect inasmuch as he detached those that had gentlemanly feelings from the wanton roysterers and next day the latter pleaded wine but they told the story not without embellishments the world followed their example i dined and slept at temples house not caring to meet my incarnate humiliation i sent to hear that he was safe a quiet evening with a scholarly man and a man of strong practical ability and shrewdness like mr temple did me good i wished my father and i were on the same footing as he and his son and i may add his daughters they all talked sensibly they were at feud with nobody they reflected their condition it was a simple orderly english household of which the father was the pillar the girls the ornaments the son the hope growing to take his fathers place my envy of such a home was acute and i thought of janet and how well she was fashioned to build one resembling it if only the mate allotted to her should not be a fantastical dreamer temples character seemed to me to demand a wife like janet on its merits an idea that depressed me exceedingly i had introduced temple to anna penrhys who was very kind to him but these two were not framed to be other than friends janet on the contrary might some day perceive the sterling fellow temple was notwithstanding his moderate height she might i thought i remembered that i had once wished that she would and i was amazed at myself but why she was a girl sure to marry i brushed these meditations away they recurred all the time i was in temples house mr temple waited for my invitation to touch on my fathers case when he distinctly pronounced his opinion that it could end but in failure though a strict constitutionalist he had words of disgust for princes acknowledging however that we were not practical in our use of them and kept them for political purposes often to the perversion of our social laws and their natural dispositions he spoke of his sons freak in joining the navy that was the princesss doing said temple she talked of our naval heroes till she made me feel i had only to wear the anchor buttons to be one myself dont tell her i was invalided from the service richie for the truth is i believe i halfshammed and the time wont be lost youll see i shall extract guineas from old ocean like salt precious few barristers understand maritime cases the other day i was in court and prompted a great qc in a case of collision didnt i sir i think there was a hoarse whisper audible up to the judges seat at intervals said mr temple the bar cannot confess to obligations from those who dont wear the robe temple rejoined his father advised me to read for the bar as a piece of very good training i appealed to temple whether he thought it possible to read lawbooks in a cockboat in a gale of wind temple grimaced and his father nodded still it struck me that i might one day have the felicity of quiet hours to sit down with temple and read lawfar behind him in the race and he envied me in his friendly manner i knew my ambition had been blown to tatters a new day dawned the household rose and met at the breakfasttable devoid of any dread of the morning newspapers their talk was like the chirrup of birds temple and his father walked away together to chambers bent upon actual businessupon doing something i reflected emphatically and compared them to ships with rudders while i was at the mercy of wind tide and wave i called at dettermain and newsons and heard there of a discovery of a witness essential to the case either in north wales or in new south i did not as i had intended put a veto on their proceedings the thing to do was to see my father and cut the case at the fountain head for this purpose it was imperative that i should go to him and prepare myself for the interview by looking at the newspapers first i bought one hastily running my eyes down the columns in the shop his name was printed but merely in a fashionable notification that carriages took up and set down for his costume ball according to certain regulations the relief of comparative obscurity helped me to breathe freely not to be laughed at was a gain i was rather inclined to laud his courage in entering assemblyrooms where he must be aware that he would see the dauphin on every face perhaps he was guilty of some new extravagance last night too late for scandal to reinforce the reporters mrs waddy had a woeful visage when informing me that he was out gone to courtenay square she ventured a murmur of bills coming in like everybody else she fancied he drew his supplies from my inexhaustible purse she hoped the bills would be paid off immediately the servants wages were overdue never can i get him to attend to small accounts she whimpered and was so ready to cry outright that i said tusk and with the one word gave her comfort of course you mr harry can settle them i know that we were drawing near to poor old sewiss legacy even for the settling of the small accounts london is a narrow place to one not caring to be seen i could not remain in this creditorriddled house i shunned the parks the clubs and the broad brighter streets of the west musing on the refreshing change it would be to me to find myself suddenly on board captain jasper welshs barque priscilla borne away to strange climes and tongues the world before me i put on the striding pace which does not invite interruption and no one but edbury would have taken the liberty i heard his shout halloa richmond he was driving his friend witlington in his cabriolet richmond my hearty where the deuce have you been i wanted you to dine with me the other night i replied looking at him steadily that i wished i had been there compendious larks cried he in the slang of his dogs day i say youre one at duke fitzs masquerade tonight tell us your toggery hang it you might go for the black prince im prince hal got a headache come to my club and try my mixture yoicks itd make methuselah and melchisedec jump up and have a twirl and a fandango i say youre thick with that little french actress chastedian jolly little woman too much to say for herself to suit me he described the style of woman that delighted himan ideal english shepherdess of the printshops it appeared and of extremely remote interest to me i thought at the time eventually i appointed to walk round to his club and he touched his horse gently and bobbed his diminutive henchman behind his smart cabriolet the admiration of the street i found him waiting for me on the steps of his club puffing a cigar with all his vigour in the classic attitude of a trumpeter my first words were i think i have to accuse you of insulting me insulting you richmond he cried much surprised holding his cigar in transit if you insult my father i make you responsible to me insult old duke fitz i give you my word of honour richmondwhy i like him i like the old boy wouldnt hurt him for the world and all havannah what the deuce have you got into your head come in and smoke the mention of his dinner and the dauphin crazed him with laughter he begged me as a man to imagine the scene the old bloated bourbon of london wall and camberwell an illustrious boydrank like a fish ready to show himself to the waiters and then with gee and gaw the marquis spouted out reminiscences of scene the best ever witnessed up starts the dauphin damn you sir and damn me sir if believe you have a spot on your whole body and snuffles and puffsyou should have been there richmond i wrote to ask you did upon my life wanted you there lord why you wont get such fun in a century and old roy he behaved uncommonly finely said capital things by jove never saw him shine so old trump says dauphin my beautiful mother had a longing for strawberries out of season i am marked with a strawberry here says roy it is an admirable and roomy site but as i am not your enemy sir i doubt if i shall often have the opportunity to behold it ha hagee richmond youve missed the deucedest good scene ever acted how could i after having had an adversary like prince otto call upon a fellow such as edbury to give me reason for his conduct he rollicked and laughed until my ungovernable impatience brought him to his senses dash it youre a fireeater i know richmond we cant fight in this country aint allowed and fighting s infernal folly by jove if youre going to tumble down every man who enjoys old roy youve your work cut out for you hes long chalks the best joke out twixt you and me he did return thanks what does it matter what old duke fitz does i give him a lift on his ladder with all my heart he keeps a capital table and ill be hanged if he hasnt got the secret of the women how he does it old roy if the lords were ladies theyd vote him premier peer double quick and ill tell you what richmond im thought a devil of a goodtempered fellow for not keeping watch over courtenay square i dont call it my business to be house dog for a pretty stepmother but theres talking and nodding and oh leave all that come in and smoke and let me set you up and ill shake your hand halloa im hailed a lady grasping the veil across her face beckoned her hand from a closed carriage below edbury ran down to her i caught sight of ravishing golden locks reminding me of mabel sweetwinters hair and pricking me with a sensation of spite at the sex for their deplorable madness in the choice of favourites edbury called me to come to the carriage window i moved slowly but the carriage wheeled about and rolled away i could just see the outline of a head muffled in furs and lace queer fish women he delivered himself of the philosophical ejaculation cloudily i was not on terms with him to offer any remark upon the one in question his imperturbable good humour foiled me and i left him merely giving him a warning to which his answer was oh come in and have a bottle of claret claret or brandy had done its work on him by the time i encountered him some hours later in the park bramham dewitt whom i met in the same neighbourhood offered me a mount after lunch advising me to keep near my father as much as i conveniently could and he being sure to appear in the park i went and heard his name to the right and left of me he was now as he said to me once that he should become the tongue of london i could hardly expect to escape from curious scrutiny myself i was looked at here and there i had to lift my hat and bow the stultification of ones feelings and ideas in circumstances which divide and set them at variance is worse than positive pain the looks shed on me were rather flattering but i knew that in the background i was felt to be the son of the notorious edbury came trotting up to us like a shaken sack calling neigh any of you seen old roy bramham dewitt a stiff fashionable man of fifty proud of his blood and quick as his cousin jorian to resent an impertinence replied are you the marquis of edbury or a drunken groom sir gad old gentleman ive half a mind to ride you down said edbury and espying me challenged me to a race to run down the fogies a cavalcade of six abreast came cantering along i saw my father listen to a word from lady edbury and push his horse to intercept the marquis they spoke presently presently my father said ride to the rear and keep at half a stones throwsay a grooms distance groom be hanged edbury retorted i made a bet id drive you out of the park old roy ride behind then said my father and to my astonishment edbury obeyed him with laughter lady edbury smiled to herself and i experienced the esteem i perceived in her for a masterful manner a few minutes later my father beckoned me to pay my respects to graf kesensky an ambassador with strong english predilections and some influence among us he asked me if he was right in supposing i wished to enter parliament i said he was wondering at the interest a foreigner could find in it the count stopped a quietpacing gentleman bramhaxri dewitt joined them and a group of friends i was introduced to mr beauchamp hill the government whip who begged me to call on him with reference to the candidature of a sussex borough that is said he turning to graf kesensky if youre sure the place is open ive heard nothing of falmouths accident the count replied that falmouth was his intimate friend he had received a special report that falmouth was dying just as he was on the point of mounting his horse we shant have lost time said mr hill the government wanted votes i went down to the house of commons at midnight to see him he had then heard of falmouths hopeless condition and after extracting my political views which were for the nonce those of a happy subserviency he expressed his belief that the new writ for the borough of chippenden might be out and myself seated on the government benches within a very short period nor would it be necessary he thought for the government nominee to spend money though that does not affect you mr richmond my supposed wealth gave me currency even in political circles chapter xliii i become one of the chosen of the nation an entire revulsion in my feelings and my way of thinking was caused by this sudden change of prospect a member of our parliament i could then write to ottilia and tell her that i had not wasted time and it was due to my father i confessed when he returned from his ball at dawn that i should thank him for speaking to graf kesensky oh said he that was our luck richie i have been speaking about you to hundreds for the last six months and now we owe it to a foreigner i thanked him again he looked eminently handsome in his henry iii costume and was disposed to be as luxurious as his original he had brought count lika secretary of legation to the austrian embassy dressed as an albanian with him the two were stretched on couches and discoursing of my fathers reintroduction of the sedan chair to society my father explained that he had ordered a couple of dozen of these chairs to be built on a pattern of his own and he added by the way richie there will be sedaniersporters to pay today poor men should be paid immediately i agreed with the monarch contemplating him i became insensible to the sting of ridicule which had been shooting through me agonizing me for the last eightandforty hours still i thought can i never escape from the fascinationlet me only get into parliament the idea in me was that parliament lifted me nearer to ottilia and would prompt me to resolute action out of his tangle of glittering cobwebs i told him of my interview with beauchamp hill i have never known kesensky wrong yet said he except in his backing of falmouths horses count lika murmured that he hoped his chief would be wrong in something else he spoke significantly my father raised his eyebrows in his opinion lika accepted the invitation to pursue prince ernest will not let that announcement stand uncontradicted my fathers eyes dwelt on him are we accused of it lika slipped from the question who is accused of a newspapers doings it is but the denial of a statement i dare them to deny itand lika my dear fellow light me a cigarette said my father then said lika touching the flame delicately you take the view that kesensky is wrong in another thing besides horses i believe he struck on the subject casually there was nothing for him to gain or lose in it and he had a liking for my father after puffing the cigarette twice or thrice my father threw it down resuming his conversation upon the sedan the appropriate dresses of certain of the great masquerading ladies and an incident that appeared to charge jorian dewitt with having misconducted himself the moment lika had gone upstairs for two or three hours sleep he said to me richie you and i have no time for that we must have a man at falmouths house by eight oclock if the scrubbingmaid on all fours not an inelegant position i have remarkeddeclares him dead we are at bartletts moneylender by ten and in chippenden borough before two post meridian as i am a tactician there is mischief but i will turn it to my uses as i did our poor jorian tonight he smuggled in the chassediane i led her out on my arm of that by and by the point is that from your oath in parliament you fly to sarkeld i implore you now by your love for me and the princess not to lose precious minutes richie we will press things so that you shall be in sarkeld by the end of the month my son my dear boy how you loved me onceyou do still then follow my directions i have a head ay you think it wild tis true my mother was a poetess but i will convince my son as i am convincing the worldtut tut to avoid swelling talk i tell you richie i have my hand on the worlds wheel and now is the time for you to spring from it and gain your altitude if you fail my success is emptiness will you avoid edbury and his like and protect yourself was my form of stipulation spoken to counteract his urgency he gave no answer beyond a wave of the hand suitable to his princely one coloured costume of ruffled lavender silk and the magnificent leg he turned to front me my senses even up to that period were so impressionable as to be swayed by a rich dress and a grand manner when circumstances were not too unfavourable now they seemed very favourable for they offered me an upward path to tread his appearance propitiated me less after he had passed through the hands of his man tollingby but i had again surrendered the lead to him as to the risk of proceedings being taken against him he laughed scornfully at the suggestion they dare not the more i dare the less dare they again i listened to his curious roundabout reasoning which dragged humour at its heels like a comical cur proclaiming itself imposingly in spite of the mongrels barking to be prudence and common sense could i deny that i owed him gratitude for the things i cherished most for my acquaintance with ottiliafor his services in germanyfor the prospect of my elevation in england i could not and i tried hard to be recklessly grateful as to money he reiterated that he could put his hand on it to satisfy the squire on the day of accounts for the present we must borrow his argument upon borrowingwhich i knew well and wondered that i did not at the outset disperse with a breath of contemptgained on me singularly when reviewed under the light of my immediate interests it ran thuswe have a rich or a barren future just as we conceive it the art of generalship in life consists in gathering your scattered supplies to suit a momentous occasion and it is the future which is chiefly in debt to us and adjures us for its sake to fight the fight and conquer that man is vile and fit to be trampled on who cannot count his future in gold and victory if as we find we are always in debt to the past we should determine that the future is in our debt and draw on it why let our future lie idle while we need succour for instance tomorrow i am to have what saves my reputation in the battle today shall i not take it at once the military commander who acts on that principle overcomes his adversary to a certainty you richie the member for this borough of chippenden have won solid ground i guarantee it to you and you go straight from the hustings or the first taste of parliamentary benches to sarkeld you take your grandads proposition to prince ernest you bring back the princes acceptance to the squire can you hope to have a princess without a battle for her more and much more in this strain untilfor he could read me and most human beings swiftly on the surface notwithstanding the pressure of his fancifulnesshe perceived that talking influenced me far less than activity and so after a hurried breakfast and an innocuous glance at the damp morning papers we started to the moneylenders with jennings to lend his name we were in chippenden close upon the hour my father had named bringing to the startled electors the first news of their members death during the heat of the canvass for votes i received a kind letter from the squire in reply to one of mine wherein he congratulated me on my prospects of success and wound up glad to see it announced you are off with that princess of yours show them we are as proud as they are harry and a fig for the whole foreign lot come to riversley soon and be happy what did that mean heriot likewise said in a letter so its over the proud prince kicks you will not thank me for telling you now what you know i think about it i appealed to my father canvass canvass cried he and he persistently baffled me it was from temple i learnt that on the day of our starting for chippenden the newspapers contained a paragraph in large print flatly denying upon authority that there was any foundation for the report of an intended marriage between the princess of eppenwelzensarkeld and an english gentleman then i remembered how that morning my father had flung the papers down complaining of their dampness would such denial have appeared without ottilias sanction my father proved that i was harnessed to him there was no stopping no time for grieving pace was his specific he dragged me the round of the voters he gave dinners at the inn of true liberals and ate of them contentedly he delivered speeches incessantly the whole force of his seriocomic genius was alive in its element at chippenden from balls and dinners and a sharp contest to maintain his position in town he was down among us by the first morning train bright as apollo and quite the sun of the place dazzling the independent electors and their wives and even me somewhat amazing me certainly dettermain his lawyer who had never seen him in action and supposed he would treat an election as he did his case with fits and starts of energy was not less astonished and tried to curb him mr dettermain my dear sir i apprehend it is the electoral maxim to woo the widowed borough with the tear in its eye and i shall do so hotly in a right masculine manner my father said we have the start and if we beat the enemy by nothing else we will beat him by constitution we are the first in the field and not to reap it is to acknowledge oneself deficient in the very first instrument with which grass was cut our difficulty all through the election was to contend with his humour the many triumphs it won for him both in speech and in action turned at least the dialectics of the argument against us and amusing flattering or bewildering contributed to silence and hold us passive political convictions of his own i think i may say with truth he had none he would have been just as powerful after his fashion on the tory side pleading for mr normanton hipperdon more perhaps he would have been more in earnest his store of political axioms was tory but he did remarkably well and with no great difficulty in confuting them to the wives of voters to the voters themselves and at public assemblies our adversary was redoubtable a promising opposition member ousted from his seat in the northa handsome man too which my father admitted and wealthy being junior partner in a city banking firm anna penrhys knew him and treacherously revealed some of the enemys secrets notably concerning what he termed our incorrigible turn for bribery and that means my father said that mr hipperdon does not possess the art of talking to the ladies i shall try him in repartee on the hustings i must contrive to have our jorian at my elbow the task of getting jorian to descend upon such a place as chippenden worried my father more than electoral anxieties jorian wrote my best wishes to you be careful of your heads the habit of the anglosaxon is to conclude his burlesques with a play of cudgels it is his notion of freedom and at once the exordium and peroration of his eloquence spare me the sussex accent on your return my father read out the sentences of this letter with admiring bursts of indignation at the sarcasms and an evident idea that i inclined to jealousy of the force displayed but we must have him he said i do not feel myself complete without jorian so he made dispositions for a concert to be given in chippenden town jenny chassediane was invited down to sing and jorian came in her wake of course he came to suffer tortures she was obliging enough to transform me into her weapon of chastisement upon the poor fellow for his behaviour to her at the ballatrocious i was bound to confess on this point she hesitated just long enough to imply a doubt whether under any circumstances the dues of men should be considered before those of her sex and then struck her hands together with enthusiasm for my father who was she observedcritical in millinery in the height of her ecstasythe most majestic charming handsome henri iii imaginable the pride and glory of the assembly only one degree too rosy at night for the tone of the lavender needing a touch of french hands and the merest trifle in want of compression about the waistband she related that a certain prince henri dangleterre had buzzed at his ear annoyingly et gascoigne ou estil called the king and the judge stepped forth to correct the obstreperous youth the judge was jennings clearly prepared by my father to foil the princeno other than edbury it was incomprehensible to me that my father should tolerate the tatters pranks unless indeed he borrowed his name to bonds of which i heard nothing mademoiselle chassediane vowed that her own dress was ravishing she went attired as a boudoirshepherdess or demurelycoquettish sevreschina ninette such of whom louis quinze would chuck the chin down the deadly introductory walks of versailles the reason of her desiring to go was the fatal sin of curiosity and therefore her sexs burden not hers jorian was a mousquetaire with plumes and ruffles prodigious and a hens heart beneath his cocks feathers pourtant jy allai i saw your great ladies how they carry themselves when they would amuse themselves and mon dieu paris has done its utmost to grace their persons and the length of their robes did the part of providence in bestowing height upon them parceque vous savez monsieur cest extraordinaire comme ils ont les jambes courtes ces anglaises our aristocracy however was not so bad in that respect as our bourgeoisie yet it was easy to perceive that our female aristocracy though they could ride had never been drilled to walk de belles femmes oui seulement tenez je nadmire ni les yeux de vache ni de souris ni mime ceux de verre comme ornement feminin avec de lembonpoint elles

she cried out tearfully the two wishes must not necessarily exist together like the masculine and the feminine in this world prince hal acting the most profligate period of his career espied her behind the mousquetaires moustache and did not fail to make much of his discovery in a perilous moment for the reputation of the ball my father handed him over to gascoigne and conducted jenny in a leisurely walk on his arm out of the rooms il est comme les romains she said he never despairs of himself it is a jupiter if he must punish you he confers a dignity in doing it now i comprehend that with such women as these grandes dames anglaises i should have done him harm but for his greatness of soul some harm i fancied must have been done in spite of his boast to the contrary he had to be in london every other night and there were tales current of intrigues against him which had their sources from very lofty regions but in chippenden he threw off london just as lightly as in london he discarded chippenden no symptom of personal discouragement or of fatigue was betrayed in his face i spoke once of that paragraph purporting to emanate from prince ernest it may he said business richie he set to counting the promises of votes disdaining fears and reflections concerts cricketmatches balls dinnerparties and the round of the canvass and speechmaking at our gatherings occupied every minute of my time except on saturday evenings when i rode over to riversley with temple to spend the sunday temple always willing to play second to me and a trifle melancholy under his partial eclipse which perhaps suggested the loss of janet to himwould have it that this election was one of the realizations of our boyish dreams of greatness the ladies were working rosettes for me my aunt dorothy talked very anxiously about the day appointed by my father to repay the large sum expended all hung upon that day she said speaking from her knowledge of the squire she was moved to an extreme distress by the subject he is confident harry but where can he obtain the money if your grandfather sees it invested in your name in government securities he will be satisfied not otherwise nothing less will satisfy him and if that is not done he will join you and your father together in his mind and as he has hitherto treated one he will treat both i know him he is just to the extent of his vision but he will not be able to separate you he is aware that your father has not restricted his expenses since they met he will say you should have used your influence she insisted on this until the tears streamed from her eyes telling me that my grandfather was the most upright and unsuspicious of men and precisely on that account the severest when he thought he had been deceived the fair chances of my election did not console her as it did me by dazzling me she affirmed strongly that she was sure my father expected success at the election to be equivalent to the promised restitution of the money and begged me to warn him that nothing short of the sum squandered would be deemed sufficient at riversley my dear aunt good woman though she was seemed to me to be waxing miserly the squire had given her the name of parsimony she had vexed him janet told me by subscribing a miserable sum to a sailors asylum that he patronizeda sum he was ashamed to see standing as the gift of a beltham and she had stopped the building of a wing of her village schoolhouse designed upon his plan altogether she was fretful and distressful she appeared to think that i could have kept my father in better order riversley was hearing new and strange reports of him but how could i at chippenden thwart his proceedings in london besides he was serving me indefatigably it can easily be imagined what description of banter he had to meet and foil this gentleman is obliging enough to ask me how about the royal arms if in his extreme consideration he means to indicate my arms i will inform him that they are open to him he shall find entertainment for man and beast so he is doubly assured of a welcome questioned whether he did not think he was entitled to be rated at the value of halfacrown he protested that whatever might be the sum of his worth he was pure coin of which neither party in chippenden could accuse the silver of rubbing off and he offered forthwith an impromptu apologue of a copper penny that passed itself off for a crownpiece and deceived a portion of the country that was why with a wave of the arm over the hipperdon faction it had a certain number of backers for everybody on whom the counterfeit had been foisted praised it to keep it in the currency now gentlemen i apprehend that chippenden is not the pocketborough for hipperdon coin back with him to the mint and with your permission we will confiscate the first syllable of his name while we consign him to oblivion with a hip hip hip hurrah for richmond the cheers responded thunderingly and were as loud when he answered a how bout the dauphin by saying that it was the tory hotel of which he knew nothing a cheer for old roy edbury sang out my father checked the roar and turned to him marquis of edbury come to the front edbury declined to budge but the fellows round him edged aside to show him a mark for my fathers finger gentlemen this is the young marquis of edbury a member of the house of lords by right of his birth born to legislate for you and me he gentlemen makes our laws examine him hear him meditate on him he paused cruelly for edbury to open his mouth the young lord looked confounded and from that moment behaved becomingly he might have been doing mischief tomorrow my father said to me and by letting me conceive his adroitness a matter of design comforted me with proofs of intelligent power and made me feel less the melancholy conjunction of a piece of mechanism and a piece of criticism which i was fast growing to be in the contemplation of the agencies leading to honour in our land edbury whipped his fourinhand to conduct our voters to the poll we had to pull hard against tory interest it was a sharp dubious hot daya day of outcries against undue influence and against briberya day of beer and cheers and the insanest of tricks to cheat the pollingbooth old john thresher of dipwell and farmer eckerthy drove over to chippenden to afford me aid and countenance disconcerting me by the sight of them for i associated them with janet rather than with ottilia and it was to ottilia that i should have felt myself rising when the figures increased their pace in my favour and the yeasty mob surrounding my fathers superb fourhorsed chariot responded to his orations by proclaiming me victor i congratulate you mr richmond dettermain said up to this day i have had my fears that we should haul more moonshine than fish in our net your father has accomplished prodigies my father with the bloom of success on his face led me aside soon after a safe majority of upwards of seventy had been officially announced now richie said he you are a member now to the squire away thank the multitude and off and as quick to sarkeld as you well can and tell the squire from me that i pardon his suspicions i have landed you a memberthat will satisfy him i am willing tell him you know me competent to direct mines bailiff of his estates whatever he pleases to effect a reconciliation i must be in london to nighti am in the thick of the fray there no matter go my son he embraced me it was not a moment for me to catechize him though i could see that he was utterly deluded between moonlight and morning riding with temple and captain bulsted on either side of me i drew rein under the red grange windows tired and in love with its air of sleepy grandeur janets window was open i hailed her has he won she sang out in the dark of her room as though the cry of delight came upon the leap from bed she was dressed she had commissioned farmer eckerthy to bring her the news at any hour of the night seeing me she clapped hands harry i congratulate you a thousand times she had wit to guess that i should never have thought of coming had i not been the winner i could just discern the curve and roll of her famed thick brown hair in the happy shrug of her shoulder and imagined the full stream of it as she leaned out of window to talk to us janet herself unfastened the halldoor bolts she caressed the horses feverishly exulting with charming subdued laughter of victory and welcome and amused us by leading my horse round to stables and whistling for one of the lads playing what may now and then be a pretty feature in a young woman of characterthe fair tomboy girl she and her maid prepared coffee and toast for us and entered the hall one after the other laden with dishes of cold meat and not until the captain had eaten well did she tell him slyly that somebody whom she had brought to riversley yesterday was abed and asleep upstairs the slyness and its sisterly innocence lit up our eyes and our hearts laughed her cheeks were deliciously overcoloured we stole i know not what from the night and the day and conventional circumstances and rallied captain bulsted and behaved as decorous people who treat the night properly and live by rule do not quite do never since janet was a girl had i seen her so spirited and responsive the womanly armour of halfreserve was put away we chatted with a freshhearted natural young creature who forfeited not a particle of her ladyship while she made herself our comrade in talk and frolic janet and i walked part of the way to the station with temple who had to catch an early train and returningthe song of skylarks covering us joined hands having our choice between nothing to say and the excess perilous both chapter xliv my father is miraculously relieved by fortune my grandfather had a gratification in my success mingled with a transparent jealousy of the chief agent in procuring it he warned me when i left him that he was not to be hoodwinked he must see the money standing in my name on the day appointed his doubts were evident but he affected to be expectant not a word of sarkeld could be spoken my success appeared to be on a more visionary foundation the higher i climbed now jorian dewitt had affirmed that the wealthy widow lady sampleman was to be had by my father for the asking placed as we were i regarded the objections to his alliance with her in a mild light she might lend me the money to appease the squire that done i would speedily repay it i admitted in a letter to my aunt dorothy the existing objections but the lady had long been enamoured of him i pleaded and he was past the age for passionate affection and would infallibly be courteous and kind she was rich we might count on her to watch over him carefully of course with such a wife he would sink to a secondary social sphere was it to be regretted if he did the letter was a plea for my own interests barely veiled at the moment of writing it and moreover when i treated my father with especial coldness my heart was far less warm in the contemplation of its preeminent aim than when i was suffering him to endanger it almost without a protest janet and a peaceful riversley and a life of quiet english distinction beckoned to me visibly and not hatefully the image of ottilia conjured up pictures of a sea of shipwrecks a scene of immeasurable hopelessness still i strove toward that my strivings were against my leanings and imagining the latter which involved no sacrifice of the finer sense of honour to be in the direction of my lower nature i repelled them to preserve a lofty aim that led me through questionable ways can it be you harry my aunt dorothys reply ran i had anticipated her line of reasoning though not her warmth who advise him to this marriage from a motive so inexplicably unworthy that you will repay her the money i do not require your promise to assure me the money is nothing it is the prospect of her life and fortune which you are consenting if not urging him to imperil for your own purposes are you really prepared to imitate in him with less excuse for doing it the things you most condemn let it be checked at the outset it cannot be a marriage of inclination on both sides prudent in a worldly sense we might wish for him perhaps if he could feel quite sure of himself his wife might persuade him not to proceed in his lawcase there i have long seen his ruin he builds such expectations on it you speak of something worse than a mercenary marriage i see this in your handwritingyour approval of it i have to check the whisper that tells me it reads like a conspiracy is she not a simpleton can you withhold your pity and pitying can you possibly allow her to be entrapped forgive my seeming harshness i do not often speak to my harry so i do now because i must appeal to you as the one chiefly responsible on whose head the whole weight of a dreadful error will fall oh my dearest be guided by the purity of your feelings to shun doubtful means i have hopes that after the first few weeks your grandfather willi know he does not expect to find the engagement fulfilledbe the same to you that he was before he discovered the extravagance you are in parliament and i am certain that by keeping as much as possible to yourself and living soberly your career there will persuade him to meet your wishes the letter was of great length in conclusion she entreated me to despatch an answer by one of the early morning trains entreating me once more to cause any actual deed to be at least postponed the letter revealed what i had often conceived might be my rejoinder to my aunt dorothy laid stress on my fathers pledge of his word of honour as a gentleman to satisfy the squire on a stated day i shrank from the idea of the riversley crow over him as to the lady i said we would see that her money was fastened to her securely before she committed herself to the deeps the money to be advanced to me would lie at my bankers in my nameuntouched it would be repaid in the bulk after a season this i dwelt on particularly both to satisfy her and to appease my sense of the obligation an airy pleasantry in the tone of this epistle amused me while writing it and vexed me when it had gone but a letter sent upon special request by railway should not i thought be couched in the ordinary strain besides one could not write seriously of a person like lady sampleman i consulted my aunt dorothys scruples by stopping my father on his way to the lady his carriage was at the door i suggested moneylenders he had tried them all he begged me to permit him to start but it was too ignominious to think of its being done under my very eyes and i refused he had tried the moneylenders yesterday they required a mortgage solider than expectations for the sum we wanted dettermain and newson had declined to undertake the hypothecation of his annuity providence pointed to sampleman you change in a couple of nights richie said he now i am always the identical man i shall give happiness to one sincerely good soul i have only to offer myselflet me say in becoming modesty i believe so let me go to her and have it over for with me a step taken is a thing sanctified i have in fact held her in reserve not that i think fortune has abandoned us but a sagacious schemer will not leave everything to the worthy dame i should have driven to her yesterday if i had not heard from dettermain and newson that there was a hint of a negotiation for a compromise government is fairly frightened he mused however i slept on it and arrived at the conclusion this morning that my old richie stood in imminent jeopardy of losing the fruit of all my toil the good woman will advance the money to her husband when i pledged my word to the squire i had reason to imagine the two months a sufficient time we have still a couple of days i have heard of men who lost heart at the eleventh hour and if they had only hung on with gallant faith in themselves they would have been justified by the result faith works miracles at least it allows time for them his fertile ingenuity spared mine the task of persuading him to postpone the drive to lady sampleman but that he would have been prompt to go at a word from me and was actually about to go when i entered his house i could not question he drove in manifest relief of mind to dettermain and newsons i had an appointment with mr temple at a great political club to meet the gentlemen who were good enough to undertake the introduction of the infant member to the house of commons my incessantly twisting circumstances foiled the pleasure and pride due to me from the club i bent my steps to temples district and met in the street young eckart vom hof my champion and second on a memorable occasion fresh upon london and looking very germanic in this drab forest of our city people he could hardly speak of deutschland for enthusiasm at the sight of the moving masses his object in coming to england he assured me honestly was to study certain editions of tibullus in the british museum when he deigned to speak of sarkeld it was to say that prince hermann was frequently there i gave him no chance to be sly though he pushed for it at a question of the princess ottilias health the funeral pace of the block of cabs and omnibuses engrossed his attention suddenly the englishman afforded him an example of the reserve of impetuosity we may contain i had seen my aunt dorothy in a middle line of cabs coming from the city and was darting in a twinkling among wheels and shafts and nodding cabhorse noses to take her hand and know the meaning of her presence in london she had family business to do she said no more i mentioned that i had checked my father for a day or two she appeared grateful her anxiety was extreme that she might not miss the return train so i relinquished her hand commanded the cabman to hasten and turned to rescue eckarttoo young and faithful a collegian not to follow his friend though it were into the lions den from a terrific entanglement of horseflesh and vehicles brawled over by a splendid collision of tongues secure on the pavement again eckart humbly acknowledged that the english tongue could come out upon occasions i did my best to amuse him whether it amused him to see me take my seat in the house of commons and hear a debate in a foreign language i cannot say but the only pleasure of which i was conscious at that period lay in the thought that he or his father baron vom hof might some day relate the circumstance at prince ernests table and fix in ottilias mind the recognition of my having tried to perform my part of the contract beggared myself and knowing prince hermann to be in sarkeld all i hoped for was to show her i had followed the path she traced my state was lower besides misfortune i now found myself exalted only to feel my profound insignificance the standard for the house is a mans ability to do things said charles etherell my friendly introductor by whom i was passingly perhaps ironically advised to preserve silence for two or three sessions he counselled the study of foreign affairs for a present theme i talked of our management of them in the strain of dr julius von karsteg thats journalism or clippings from a bilious essay it wont do for the house he said revile the house to the country if you like but not the country to the house when i begged him to excuse my absurdity he replied its full of promise so long as youre silent but to be silent was to be merely an obedient hound of the whip and if the standard for the house was a mans ability to do things i was in the seat of a better man external sarcasms upon the house flavoured with justness came to my mind but if these were my masters surrounding me how indefinitely small must i be leaving the house on that first night of my sitting i received temples congratulations outside and as though the sitting had exhausted every personal sentiment i became filled with his under totally new sensations i enjoyed my distinction through the perception of my old comrades friendly jealousy ill be there too some day he said moaning at the prospect of an extreme age before such honours would befall him the society of eckart prevented me from urging him to puff me up with his talk as i should have wished and after i had sent the german to be taken care of by mrs waddy i had grown so accustomed to the worldly view of my position that i was fearing for its stability threats of a petition against me were abroad supposing the squire disinherited me could i stand an extraordinary appetite for wealth a novel appreciation of it which was in truth a voluntary enlistment into the army of mankind and the adoption of its passionspricked me with an intensity of hope and dread concerning my dependence on my grandfather i lay sleepless all night tossing from riversley to sarkeld condemned it seemed to marry janet and gain riches and power by renouncing my hope of the princess and the glory belonging to her unless i should within a few hours obtain a show of figures at my bankers i had promised etherell to breakfast with him a notea faint scream despatched by mrs waddy to mr temples house informed me that the men were upon them if so they were the forerunners of a horde and my father was as good as extinguished he staked everything on success consequently he forfeited pity goodbye to ambition i thought and ate heartily considering robustly the while how far lower than the general level i might avoid falling the report of the debates in morning papersdoubtless more flowing and perhaps more grammatical than such as i gave ear to overnighthad the odd effect on me of relieving me from the fit of subserviency into which the speakers had sunk me a conceit of towering superiority took its place and as etherell was kind enough to draw me out and compliment me i was attacked by a tragic sense of contrast between my capacities and my probable fortunes it was open to me to marry janet but this meant the loosening of myself with my own hand for ever from her who was my mentor and my glory to gain whom i was in the very tideway i could not submit to it though the view was like that of a green field of the springs passed by a climber up the crags i went to anna penrhys to hear a womans voice and partly told her of my troubles she had heard mr hipperdon express his confident opinion that he should oust me from my seat her indignation was at my service as a loan it sprang up fiercely and spontaneously in allusions to something relating to my father of which the marquis of edbury had been guilty how you can bear it she exclaimed for i was not wordy the exclamation however stung me to put pen to paperthe woman was not so remote in me as not to be roused by the woman i wrote to edbury and to heriot bidding him call on the young nobleman late at night i was at my fathers door to perform the act of duty of seeing him and hearing how he had entertained eckart if he was still master of his liberty i should have known him better i expected silence and gloom the windows were lighted brilliantly as the halldoor opened a band of stringed and wood instruments commenced an overture mrs waddy came to me in the hall she was unintelligible one thing had happened to him at one hour of the morning and another at another hour he was at one moment suffering the hands of the officers on his shoulder and behold you mr harry a knock a letter from a messenger and he conquers government it struck me that the epitome of his life had been played in a day i was quite incredulous of downright good fortune he had been giving a dinner followed by a concert and the deafening strains of the music clashed with my acerb spirit irritating me excessively where are those men you spoke of i asked her gone she repliedgone long ago paid said i she was afraid to be precise but repeated that they were long since gone i singled jorian dewitt from among the crowd of loungers on the stairs and landing between the drawingrooms oh yes government has struck its flag to him jorian said why werent you here to dine alphonse will never beat his achievement of today jenny and carigny gave us a quarterofanhour before dinnera capital ideaveuve et bachelier as if by inspiration no preparation for it no formal taking of seats it seized amazinglyfloated small talk over the soup beautifully i questioned him again oh dear yes there cant be a doubt about it he answered airily roy richmond has won his game two or three urgent men round a great gentleman were extracting his affable approbation of the admirable nature of the experiment of the chassediane before dinner i saw that eckart was comfortably seated and telling jorian to provide for him in the matter of tobacco i went to my room confused beyond power of thought by the sensible command of fortune my father fortunes sport at times seemed really to have his statement of the circumstances bewildered me even more he was in no hurry to explain them when we met next morning he waited for me to question him and said yes i think we have beaten them so far his mind was preoccupied he informed me concerning the defence of a lady much intrigued against and resuming the subject yes we have beaten them up to a point richie and that reminds me would you have me go down to riversley and show the squire the transfer paper at any rate you can now start for sarkeld and you do do you not today to morrow at latest i insisted but how and in what manner has this money been paid the idea struck me that he had succeeded in borrowing it transferred to me in the bank and intelligence of the fact sent to dettermain and newson my lawyers he replied beyond that i know as little as you richie though indubitably i hoped to intimidate them if he added with a countenance perfectly simple and frank they expect me to take money for a sop i am not responsible as i by no means provoked it for their mistake i proceed the money is useful to you so i rejoice at it five and twenty thousand pounds was the amount no stipulation was attached to it none of course a stipulation was implied but of that i am not bound to be cognizant absurd i cried it cant have come from the quarter you suspect where else he asked i thought of the squire lady edbury my aunt lady sampleman anna penrhys some one or other of his frantic female admirers but the largeness of the amount and the channel selected for the payment precluded the notion that any single person had come to succour him in his imminent need and as it chanced mine observing that my speculations wavered he cited numerous instances in his life of the special action of providence in his favour and was bold enough to speak of a star which his natural acuteness would have checked his doing before me if his imagination had not been seriously struck you hand the money over to me sir i said without a moment of hesitation my dear boy he melted me by answering you believe you have received a bribe that is my entire beliefthe sole conclusion i can arrive at i will tell you richie the old marquis of edbury once placed five thousand pounds to my account on a proviso that i shouldneglect is the better word my case i inherited from him at his death of course his demise cancelled the engagement he had been the friend of personages implicated he knew i suspect he apprehended the unpleasant position of a witness but what was the stipulation you presume was implied said i something that passed between lawyers i am not bound to be cognizant of it abandon my claims for a few thousands not for ten not for ten hundred times the sum to be free from his boisterous influence which made my judgement as unsteady as the weatherglass in a hurricane i left my house and went straight to dettermain and newson who astonished me quite as much by assuring me that the payment of the money was a fact there was no mystery about it the intelligence and transfer papers they said had not been communicated to them by the firm they were opposed to but by a solicitor largely connected with the aristocracy and his letter had briefly declared the unknown donators request that legal proceedings should forthwith be stopped they offered no opinion of their own suggestions of any kind they seemed to think had weight and all of them an equal weight to conclude from the value they assigned to every idea of mine the name of the solicitor in question was charles adolphus bannerbridge it was indeed my old one of my oldest friends the same by whom i had been led to a feast and an evening of fun when a little fellow starting in the london streets sure of learning the whole truth from old mr bannerbridge i walked to his office and heard that he had suddenly been taken ill i strode on to his house and entered a house of mourning the kind old man remembered by me so vividly had died overnight miss bannerbridge perceived that i had come on an errand and with her gentle good breeding led me to speak of it she knew nothing whatever of the sum of money she was however aware that an annuity had been regularly paid through the intervention of her father i was referred by her to a mr richards his recentlyestablished partner this gentleman was ignorant of the whole transaction throughout the day i strove to combat the pressure of evidence in favour of the idea that an acknowledgement of special claims had been wrested from the enemy temple hardly helped me though his solid sense was dead against the notions entertained by my father and jorian dewitt and others besides our elders the payment of the sum through the same channel which supplied the annuity pointed distinctly to an admission of a claim he inclined to think and should be supposed to come from a personage having cause either to fear him or to assist him he set my speculations astray by hinting that the request for the stopping of the case might be a blind a gift of money he said shrewdly was a singularly weak method of inducing a man to stop the suit of a lifetime i thought of lady edbury but her income was limited and her expenditure was not of lady sampleman but it was notorious that she loved her purse as well as my aunt dorothy and was even more in the squires phrase a petticoated parsimony anna penrhys appeared the likelier except for the fact that the commencement of the annuity was long before our acquaintance with her i tried her on the subject her amazement was without a shadow of reserve it s welsh its not english she remarked i knew no welshwoman save anna do you know the whole of his history said she possibly one of the dozen unknown episodes in it might have furnished the clue i agreed with her the sight of twentyone thousand pounds placed to my credit in the funds assuaged my restless spirit of investigation letters from the squire and my aunt dorothy urged me to betake myself to riversley there finally to decide upon what my course should be now that you have the money pray st parsimony wrotepray be careful of it do not let it be encroached on remember it is to serve one purpose it should be guarded strictly against every appeal for aid etc with much underlining my grandfather returned the papers his letter said i shall not break my word please to come and see me before you take steps right or left so here was the dawn again i could in a day or two start for sarkeld meanwhile to give my father a lesson i discharged a number of bills and paid off the bond to which edburys name was attached my grandfather i knew was too sincerely and punctiliously a gentleman in practical conduct to demand a further inspection of my accounts these things accomplished i took the train for riversley and proceeded from the station to durstan where i knew heriot to be staying had i gone straight to my grandfather there would have been another story to tell etext editors bookmarks bandied the weariful shuttlecock of gallantry determine that the future is in our debt and draw on it faith works miracles at least it allows time for them he whipped himself up to one of his oratorical frenzies i was discontented and could not speak my discontent no act to compel a man to deny what appears in the papers puns are the smallpox of the language stultification of ones feelings and ideas they dare not the more i dare the less dare they too prompt too full of personal relish of his point
