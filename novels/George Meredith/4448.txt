the adventures of harry richmond by george meredith book xxxiii what came of a shilling xxxiv i gain a perception of princely state xxxv the scene in the lakepalace library xxxvi homeward and home again xxxvii janet renounces me xxxviii my bankers book chapter xxxiii what came of a shilling the surgeon who attended us both loudly admired our mutual delicacy in sparing arteries and vital organs but a bullet cuts a rougher pathway than the neat steel blade and i was prostrate when the prince came to press my hand on his departure for his quarters at laibach the utterly unreasonable nature of a duel was manifested by his declaring to me that he was now satisfied i did not mean to insult him and then laugh at him we must regard it rather as a sudorific for feverish blood and brains i felt my wound acutely seeing his brisk step when he retired having overthrown me bodily it threw my heart back to its first emotions and i yearned to set eyes on my father with a haunting sense that i had of late injured him and owed him reparation it vanished after he had been in my room an hour to return when he had quitted it and incessantly and inexplicably it went and came in this manner he was depressed i longed for drollery relieved only by chance allusions to my beloved one whereas he could not conceal his wish to turn the stupid duel to account pencil a line to her he entreated me and dictated his idea of a moving line adding urgently that the crippled letters would be affecting to her as to the great frederick his last review of his invalid veterans your namethe signature of your name alone darling richie and he traced a crooked scrawl with a forefinger still dearest angel in contempt of death and blood i am yours to eternity harry lepel richmond sometimes called roya point for your decision in the future should the breath everlastingly devoted to the most celestial of her sex continue to animate the frame that would rise on wings to say adieu adieurichie just a sentence he was distracting his natural tenderness and neatness of hand qualified him for spreading peace in a sickroom but he was too full of life and his scheme and knowing me out of danger he could not forbear giving his despondency an outlet i heard him exclaim in big sighs heavens how near and again she must hear of it never was man so incorrigibly dramatic he would walk up to a bookcase and take down a volume when the interjectional fit waxed violent flip the pages affecting a perplexity he would assuredly have been struck by had he perused them and read as he did onceitaly the land of the sun and she is to be hurried away there and we are left to groan the conspiracy is infamous one of the family takes it upon himself to murder us and she is to be hurried out of hearing and so we are to have the blood of the roys spilt for nothingno and he shut up the book with a report and bounded to my side to beg pardon of me from his particular abuse of the margravine the iteration of certain phrases which he uttered to denounce and defy them i gathered that an interview had passed between the two and that she had notified a blockade against all letters addressed to the princess he half admitted having rushed to the palace on his road to me but richie said he pressing me again to write the moving line a letter with a broad black border addressed by me might pass he looked mournfully astute the margravine might say to herself heres doctor death in full diploma come to cure the wench of her infatuation i am but quoting the coarse old woman richie confusion on her and me for i like her it might pass in my handwriting with a smudge for paternal griefit might to her serene highness the margravine of rippau etc etc etc in trust for the most exalted the princess of eppenwelzen sarkeld i transpose or omit a title or so aha says she theres verwirrung in roys poor head poor fellow the boy has sunk to a certainty here to the princess it seems my dear this is for you pray do not communicate the contents for a day or so or a month his imitation of the margravine was the pleasantest thing i heard from him the princesss maid and confidante he regretted to state was incorruptible which i knew that line of ottilias writing violets are over read by me in view of the rootmountain of the royal house of princes scoffed at me insufferably whenever my father showed me these openings of his mind until i was dragged down to think almost that i had not loved the woman and noble soul but only the glorified princess the carved gilt frame instead of the divine portrait a shameful acrid suspicion ransacking my conscience with the thrusting in of a foul torch here and there for why had i shunned him of late how was it that he tortured me now did i in no degree participate in the poignant savour of his scheme such questionings set me flushing in deadly chills my brain was weak my heart exhausted my body seemed truthful perforce and confessed on the rack i could not deny that i had partly insensibly clung to the vain glitter of hereditary distinction my fathers pitfall taking it for a substantial foothold when a young man of wit and sensibility and mark you true pride would have made it his first care to trample that under heel excellent is pride but oh be sure of its foundations before you go on building monument high i know nothing to equal the anguish of an examination of the basis of ones pride that discovers it not solidly fixed an imposing selfimposing structure piled upon empty cellarage it will inevitably like a tree striking bad soil betray itself at the top with time and the anguish i speak of will be the sole healthy sign about you whether in the middle of life it is adviseable to descend the pedestal altogether i dare not say few take the precaution to build a flight of steps insideit is not a labour to be proud of fewer like to let themselves down in the public eyeit amounts to a castigation you must i fear remain up there and accept your chance in toppling over but in any case delude yourself as you please your lofty baldness will assuredly be seen with time meanwhile you cannot escape the internal intimations of your unsoundness a mans pride is the front and headpiece of his character his souls support or snare look to it in youth i have to thank the interminable hours on my wretched sickbed for a singularly beneficial investigation of the ledger of my deeds and omissions and moral stock perhaps it has already struck you that one who takes the trouble to sit and write his history for as large a world as he can obtain and shape his style to harmonize with every development of his nature can no longer have much of the hard grain of pride in him a proud puppetshowman blowing into pandaean pipes is an inconceivable object except to those who judge of characteristics from posture it began to be observed by others that my father was not the most comforting of nurses to me my landlady brought a young girl up to my room and introduced her under the name of lieschen saying that she had for a long time been interested in me and had been diligent in calling to inquire for news of my condition commanded to speak for herself this lieschen coloured and said demurely i am in service here sir among goodhearted people who will give me liberty to watch by you for three hours of the afternoon and three of the early part of the night if you will honour me my father took her shoulder between finger and thumb and slightly shook her to each ejaculation of his emphatic no no no no what a young maiden nurse to a convalescent young gentleman why goodness gracious me eh she looked at me softly and i said i wished her to come my father appealed to the sagacity of the matron so jealous was he of a suggested partner in his task that he had refused my earnest requests to have mr peterborough to share the hours of watching by my side the visits of college friends and acquaintances were cut very short he soon reduced them to talk in a hush with thumbs and nods and eyebrows and if it had not been so annoying to me i could have laughed at his method of accustoming the regular visitors to make ready immediately after greeting for his affectionate dismissal of them lieschen went away with the mute blessing of his finger on one of her modest dimples but to his amazement she returned in the evening he gave her a lecture to which she listened attentively and came again in the morning he was petrified idiots insects women and the salt sea ocean said he to indicate a list of the untameables without distressing the one present and acknowledging himself beaten he ruefully accepted his holiday the girl was like sweet spring in my room she spoke of sarkeld familiarly she was born in that neighbourhood she informed me and had been educated by a dear great lady her smile of pleasure on entering the room one morning and seeing me dressed and sitting in a grand fatherly chair by the breezy window was like a salutation of returning health my father made another stand against the usurper of his privileges he refused to go out then must i go said lieschen for two are not allowed here no dont leave me i begged of her and stretched out my hands for hers while she gazed sadly from the doorway he suspected some foolishness or he was actually jealous humoh he went forthwith a murmured groan she deceived me by taking her seat in perfect repose after smoothing her apron now i must go she said what to leave me here alone she looked at the clock and leaned out of the window not alone oh not alone the girl exclaimed and please please do not mention mepresently hark do you hear wheels your heart must not beat now farewell you will not be alone at least so i think see what i wear dear mr patient she drew from her bosom attached to a piece of blue ribbon the half of an english shilling kissed it and blew a soft farewell to me she had not been long gone when the princess ottilia stood in her place a shilling tossed by an english boy to a couple of little foreign girls in a woodmans hutyou would not expect it to withstand the common fate of silver coins and preserve mysterious virtues by living celibate neither multiplying nor reduced ultimately to play the part of a powerful magician in bringing the boy grown man to the feet of an illustrious lady and her to his side in sickness treasonably to the laws of her station the little women quarrelled over it and snatched and hid and contemplated it in secret each in her turn until the strife it engendered was put an end to by a doughty smith their mothers brother who divided it into equal halves through which he drove a hole and the pieces being now thrown out of the currency each one wore her share of it in her bosom from that time proudly appeased they were not ordinary peasant children and happily for them they had another friend that was not a bird of passage and was endowed by nature and position to do the work of an angel she had them educated to read write and knit and learn pretty manners and in good season she took one of the sisters to wait on her own person the second went upon her recommendation into the household of a professor of a neighbouring university but neither of them abjured her superstitious belief in the proved merits of the talisman she wore so when they saw the careless giver again they remembered him their gratitude was as fresh as on that romantic morning of their childhood and they resolved without concert to serve him after their own fashion and quickly spied a way to it they were german girls you are now enabled to guess more than was known to ottilia and me of the curious agency at work to shuffle us together the doors of her suite in the palace were barred against letters addressed to the princess the delivery of letters to her was interdicted she consenting yet she found one it lay on the broad walk of the orangetrees between the pleasure and the fruitgardens as if dropped by a falcon in mid air ottilia beheld it and started her little maid walking close by exclaimed scuttling round in front of her the while like an urchin in sabots ha what is it a snake let me let me the guileless mistress replied a letter whereupon the maid said not a window near and no wall neither why dearest princess we have walked up and down here a dozen times and not seen it staring at us oh my good heaven the letter was seized and opened and ottilia read he who loves you with his heart has been cruelly used they have shot him he is not dead he must not die he is where he has studied since long he has his medicine and doctors and they say the bullet did not lodge he has not the sight that cures now is he the strong young man laid helpless at anybodys mercy she supped at her fathers table and amused the margravine and him alternately with cards and a sonata before twelve at midnight she was driving on the road to the university saying farewell to what her mind reverenced so that her lover might but have sight of her she imagined i had been assassinated for a long time and most pertinaciously this idea dwelt with her i could not dispossess her of it even after uttering the word duel i know not how often i had flatly to relate the wholeof the circumstances but otto is no assassin she cried out what was that she reverenced it was what she jeopardizedher state her rank her dignity as princess and daughter of an ancient house things typical to her of sovereign duties and the high seclusion of her name to her the escapades of foolish damsels were abominable the laws of society as well as of her exalted station were in harmony with her intelligence she thought them good but obeyed them as a subject not slavishly she claimed the right to exercise her trained reason the modestest humblest sweetest of women undervaluing nothing that she possessed least of all what was due from her to others she could go whithersoever her reason directed her putting anything aside to act justly according to her light nor would she have had cause to repent had i been the man she held me to be even with me she had not behaved precipitately my course of probation was severe and long before she allowed her heart to speak pale from a sleepless night and her hearts weariful eagerness to be near me she sat by my chair holding my hand and sometimes looking into my eyes to find the life reflecting hers as in a sunken well that has once been a spring my books and poor bachelor comforts caught her attention betweenwhiles we talked of the day of storm by the lake we read the unsigned letter with her hand in mine i slept some minutes and awoke grasping it doubting and terrified so great a wave of life lifted me up no you are not gone i sighed only come said she the nature of the step she had taken began to dawn on me but when they miss you at the palace prince ernest hush they have missed me already it is done she said it smiling ottilia will he take you away us dear us can you meet his anger our aunt will be the executioner we have a day of sweet hours before she can arrive may i see her first we will both see her as we are now we must have prompt answers for the margravine none harry i do not defend myself ever distant hills and folds of receding clouds and skies beyond them were visible from my window and beyond the skies i felt her soul ottilia you were going to italy yes or whither they please for as long as they please i wished once to go i have told you why one of the series she touched the letter lying on a readingtable beside her turned the channel of all wishes and intentions my friends left me to fall at the mercy of this one i consented to the injunction that i should neither write nor receive letters do i argue ill in saying that a trust was implied surely it was a breach of the trust to keep me ignorant of the danger of him i love now they know it i dared not consult themnot my dear father about any design of mine when i had read this odd copybook writing all in brief sentences each beginning he and he it struck me like thrusts of a sword it illuminated me like lightning that he was the heart within my heart the writer must be some clever woman or simple friend who feels for us very strongly my lover assassinated where could i be but with him her little ann coming in with chocolate and strips of fine white bread to dip in it stopped my efforts to explain the distinction between an assassination and a duel i noticed then the likeness of aennchen to lieschen she has a sister here said ottilia and let her bring lieschen to visit me here this afternoon aennchen with a blush murmured that she heard and would obey i had a memorable pleasure in watching my beloved eat and drink under my roof the duel remained incomprehensible to her she first frightened me by remarking that duels were the pastime of brainless young men her next remark in answer to my repeated attempts to shield my antagonist from a capital charge but only military men and frenchmen fight duels accompanied by a slightly investigating glance of timid surprise gave me pain together with a flashing apprehension of what she had forfeited whom offended to rush to the succour of a duellist i had to repeat to her who my enemy was so that there should be no further mention of assassination prince ottos name seemed to entangle her understanding completely otto otto she murmured he has i have heard been obliged by some socalled laws of honour once or twice totohe is above suspicion of treachery to my mind it is one and the same but i would not harshly exclude the view the world puts on things and i use the worlds language in saying that he could not do a dishonourable deed how far he honours himself is a question apart that may be low enough while the world is full of a mans praises she knew the nature of a duel it is the work of soulless creatures she broke through my stammered explanations with unwonted impatience and pressing my hand ah you are safe i have you still do you know harry i am not yet able to endure accidents and misadventures i have not fortitude to meet them or intelligence to account for them they are little ironical laughter say we build so high the lightning strikes uswhy build at all the summer fly is happier if i had lost you i can almost imagine that i should have asked for revenge for why should the bravest and purest soul of my worship be snatched away i am not talking wisdom only my shaken self will speak just now i pardon otto though he has behaved basely no not basely i felt bound to plead on his behalf thinking in spite of a veritable anguish of gathering dread that she had become enlightened and would soon take the common view of our case not basely he was excessively irritated without cause in my opinion he simply misunderstood certain matters dearest you have nations fighting a war is only an exaggerated form of duelling nations at war are wild beasts she replied the passions of these hordes of men are not an example for a living soul our souls grow up to the light we must keep eye on the light and look no lower nations appear to me to have no worse than a soiled mirror of themselves in mobs they are still uncivilized they still bear a resemblance to the old monsters of the mud do you not see their claws and fangs harry do you find an apology in their acts for intemperate conduct men who fight duels appear in my sight no nobler than the first desperate creatures spelling the cruel a b c of the passions no nor in mine i assented hastily we are not perfect but hear me yes the passions are cruel circumstances howeveri mean there are social usagesay if one were always looking up t but should we not be gentle with our comparisons if we would have our views in proportion she hung studiously silent and i pursued i trust you so much as my helper and my friend that i tell you what we do not usually tell to womenthe facts and the names connected with them sooner or later you would have learnt everything beloved i do not wait to let you hear it by degrees to be reconciled to it piecemeal and i forgive him she sighed i scarcely bring myself to believe that harry has bled from ottos hand it was the accident of the case ottilia we had to meet to meet there are circumstances when men will not accept apologies theywe heaven knows i was ready to do all that a man could do to avoid this follywickedness give it the worst of titles it did not occur accidentally she inquired her voice sounded strange half withheld in the utterance it occurred said i feeling my strength ebb and despair set in it occurredthe prince compelled me to the meet him but my cousin otto is no assassin compelled i say that is he conceived i had injured him and left me no other way of making amends her defence of otto was in reality the vehement cherishing of her idea of me this caused her bewilderment and like a barrier to the flowing of her mind it resisted and resisted she could not suffer herself to realize that i was one of the brainless young savages creatures with claws and fangs her face was unchanged to me the homeliness of her large mild eyes embraced me unshadowed and took me to its inner fire unreservedly leaning in my roomy chair i contemplated her at leisure while my heart kept saying mine mine to awaken an active belief in its possession her face was like the quiet morning of a winter day when cloud and sun intermix and make an ardent silver with lights of blue and faint fresh rose and over them the beautiful fold of her full eyebrow on the eyelid like a bending upper heaven those winter mornings are divine they move on noiselessly the earth is still as if awaiting a wren warbles and flits through the lank drenched brambles hillside opens green elsewhere is mist everywhere expectancy they bear the veiled sun like a sangreal aloft to the wavy marble flooring of stainless cloud she was as fair gazing across her shoulders gentle depression i could have desired to have the couchant brow and round cheek and rounding chin no more than a young mans dream of woman a picture alive without the animating individual awful mind to judge of me by my acts i chafed at the thought that one so young and lovely should meditate on human affairs at all she was of an age to be maidenly romantic our situation favoured it but she turned to me and i was glad of the eyes i knew she kissed me on the forehead sleep she whispered i feigned sleep to catch my happiness about me some disenchanting thunder was coming i was sure and i was right my father entered princess he did amazed and delighted homage and forthwith uncontrollably poured out the history of my heroism a hundred words for onemy promptitude in picking the princes glove up on my swords point my fine play with the steel my scornful magnanimity the admiration of my fellowstudentsevery line of it in stupendous language an artillery celebration of victory i tried to stop him ottilia rose continually assenting with short affirmatives to his glorifying interrogationsa method he had of recapitulating the main points she glanced to right and left as if she felt caged is it known i heard her ask in the half audible strange voice which had previously made me tremble known i certify to you princessthe unhappy man spouted his withering fountain of interjections over us anew known in every court and garrison of germany known by this time in old england and what was more the correct version of it was known it was known that the young englishman had vanquished his adversary with the small sword and had allowed him because he had raged demoniacally on account of his lamed limb to have a shot in revenge the honour done me by the princess in visiting me is not to be known i summoned energy enough to say she shook her head my father pledged himself to the hottest secresy equivalent to a calm denial of the fact if necessary pray be at no trouble she addressed him the where am i look was painful in her aspect it led me to perceive the difference of her published position in visiting a duellist lover instead of one assassinated in the latter case the rashness of an hereditary virgin princess avowing her attachment might pass condoned or cloaked by general compassion how stood it in the former i had dragged her down to the duellists level and as she was not of a nature to practise concealments and scorned to sanction them she was condemned seeing that concealment as far as possible was imperative to suffer bitterly in her own esteem this the cruellest was the least of the evils to keep our names disjoined was hopeless my weakened frame and mental misery coined tears when thoughts were needed presently i found the room empty of our poor unconscious tormentor ottilia had fastened her hand to mine again be generous i surprised her by saying go back at once i have seen you let my father escort you the road you will meet the margravine or some one i think with you it will be the margravine and my father puts her in good humour pardon a wretched little scheme to save you from annoyance so thus you return within a day and the margravine shelters you your name will not be spoken but go at once for the sake of prince ernest i have hurt him already help me to avoid doing him a mortal injury it was schwartz who drove you our old schwartz old warhead you see we may be safe only every fresh minute adds to the danger and another reason for goinganother ah she breathed my harry will talk himself into a fever i shall have it if the margravine comes here she shall not be admitted or if i hear her or hear that she has come consent at once and revive me oh i am begging you to leave me and wishing it with all my soul think over what i have done do not write to me i shall see the compulsion of mere kindness between the lines you consent your wisdom i never doubti doubt my own when it is yours you would persuade me to confide in said she with some sorrowful archness wits clear as hers could see that i had advised well except in proposing my father for escort it was evidently better that she should go as she came i refrained from asking her what she thought of me now suing for immediate pardon would have been like the applying of a lancet to a vein for blood it would have burst forth meaning mere words coloured by commiseration kindness desperate affection anything but her souls survey of herself and me and though i yearned for the comfort passion could give me i knew the mind i was dealing with or rather i knew i was dealing with a mind and i kept my tongue silent the talk between us was of the possible date of my recovery the hour of her return to the palace the writer of the unsigned letters books we had read apart or peeped into together she was a little quicker in speech less meditative my sensitive watchfulness caught no other indication of a change my father drove away an hour in advance of the princess to encounter the margravine by said he rehearsing his exclamation of astonishment and delight at meeting her by the most miraculous piece of good fortune conceivable dear madam and now comes the question since you have condescended to notice a solitary atom of your acquaintance on the public highroad whether i am to have the honour of doubling the freight of your carriage or you will deign to embark in mine but the direction of the horses heads must be reversed absolutely it must if your highness would repose in a bed tonight good so and now at a conversational trot we may happen to be overtaken by acquaintances i had no doubt of his drawing on his rarelyabandoned sevenleague boots of jargon once so delicious to me for the margravines entertainment his lack of discernment in treating the princess to it ruined my patience the sisters aennchen and lieschen presented themselves a few minutes before his departure lieschen dropped at her feet my child said the princess quite maternally could you be quit of your service with the mahrlens for two weeks think you to do duty here the professor grants her six hours out of the twentyfour already said i to go where she asked alarmed to come here here she knows you she did not curtsey to you nurses do not usually do that the appearance of both girls was pitiable but having no suspicion of the cause for it i superadded she was here this morning ah we owe her more than we were aware of the princess looked on her kindly though with suspense in the expression she told me of my approaching visitor i said oh not told lieschen burst out did youthe princess questioned her and murmured to me these children cannot speak falsehoods they shone miserably under the burden of uprightness did you make sure that i should come lieschen thoughtshe supposed but why why did she think and suppose what made her anticipate the princesss arrival this inveterate why communicated its terrors to aennchen upon whom the princess turned scrutinizing eyes saying you write of me to your sister yes princess and she to you lieschen answered forgive me your highness dearest lady you offered yourself here unasked yes princess have you written to others besides your sister seldom princess i do not remember you know the obligation of signatures to letters ah you have been remiss in not writing to me child oh princess i did not dare to you have not written to me ah princess how dared i are you speaking truthfully the unhappy girls stood trembling ottilia spared them the leap into the gulfs of confession her intuitive glance assisted by a combination of minor facts had read the story of their misdeeds in a minute she sent them down to the carriage suffering her culprits to kiss her fingers while she said to one this might be a fable of a pair of mice when she was gone after many fits of musing the signification of it was revealed to my slower brain i felt that it could not but be an additional shock to the regal pride of such a woman that these little maidens should have been permitted to act forcibly on her destiny the mystery of the letters was easily explained as soon as a direct suspicion fell on one of the girls who lived in my neighbourhood and the other who was near the princesss person doubtless the revelation of their effective mouse plot had its humiliating bitterness for her on a day of heavy oppression smile at it as she subsequently might the torture of heart with which i twisted the meaning of her words about the pair of mice to imply that the pair had conspired to make a net for an eagle and had enmeshed her may have struck a vein of the truth i could see no other antithesis to the laudable performance of the single mouse of fable lieschen when she next appeared in the character of nurse met my inquiries by supplicating me to imitate her sisters generous mistress and be merciful she remarked byandby of her own accord princess ottilia does not regret that she had us educated a tender warmth crept round me in thinking that a mind thus lofty would surely be however severe in its insight above regrets and recantations chapter xxxiv i gain a perception of princely state i had a visit from prince ernest nominally one of congratulation on my escape i was never in my life so much at any mans mercy he might have fevered me to death with reproaches and i expected them on hearing his name pronounced at the door i had forgotten the ways of the world for some minutes i listened guardedly to his affable talk my thanks for the honour done me were awkward as if they came upon reflection the prince was particularly civil and cheerful his relative he said had written of me in high termsthe very highest declaring that i was blameless in the matter and that though he had sent the horse back to my stables he fully believed in the fine qualities of the animal and acknowledged his fault in making it a cause of provocation to all of which i assented with easy nods your shakespeare i think said the prince has a scene of young frenchmen praising their horses i myself am no stranger to the enthusiasm one could not stake life and honour on a nobler brute pardon me if i state my opinion that you young englishmen of today are sometimes rather overbearing in your assumption of a superior knowledge of horseflesh we germans in the baltic provinces and in the austrian cavalry think we have a right to a remark or two and if we have not suborned the testimony of modern history the value of our hanoverian troopers is not unknown to one at least of your generals however the odds are that you were right and otto wrong and he certainly put himself in the wrong to defend his ground i begged him to pass a lenient sentence upon fiery youth he assured me that he remembered his own our interchange of courtesies was cordially commonplace we walked as it were arminarm on thin ice rivalling one anothers gentlemanly composure satisfied with my discretion the prince invited me to the lakepalace and then a weeks shooting in styria to recruit i thanked him in as clear a voice as i could command your highness the mine flourishes i trust it does i think i may say it does he replied there is always the want of capital what can be accomplished in the present state of affairs your father performs on the whole well you smilebut i mean extraordinarily well he has with an accountant at his elbow really the genius of management he serves me busily and i repeat well a better employment for him than the direction of court theatricals undoubtedly it is or than bestriding a bronze horse personifying my good ancestor are you acquainted with the chancellor von redwitz all i know of him sir is that he is fortunate to enjoy the particular confidence of his master he has a long head but now he is a disappointing man in action responsibility overturns him he is the reverse of roy whose advice i do not take though im glad to set him running von redwitz is in the town he shall call on you and amuse an hour or so of your convalescence i confessed that i began to feel longings for society prince ernest was kind enough to quit me without unmasking i had not to learn that the simplest visits and observations of ruling princes signify more than lies on the surface interests so highly personal as theirs demand from them a decent insincerity chancellor von redwitz called on me and amused me with secret anecdotes of all the royal houses of germany amusing chiefly through the veneration he still entertained for them the grave senior was doing his utmost to divert one of my years the immoralities of blue blood like the amours of the gods were to his mind tolerable if not beneficial to mankind and he presumed i should find them toothsome nay he besought me to coincide in his excuses of a widely charming young archduchess for whom no estimable husband of a fitting rank could anywhere be discovered so she had to be bestowed upon an archducal imbecile and henceand henceoh certainly generous youth and benevolent age joined hands of exoneration over her the princess of satteberg actually married under covert a colonel of uhlans at the age of seventeen the marriage was quashed the colonel vanished the princess became the scandalous duchess of ilmilm and was surprised one infamous night in the outer court of the castle by a soldier on guard who dragged her into the guardroom and unveiled her there and would have been summarily shot for his pains but for the locket on his breast which proved him to be his sovereigns sona perfect romance mr chancellor we will say the soldier son loved a delicate young countess in attendance on the duchess the countess spies the locket takes it to the duchess is reprimanded when behold the locket opens and colonel von bein appears as in his blooming youth in lancer uniformyoung sir your piece of romance has exaggerated history to caricature romances are the destruction of human interest the moment you begin to move the individuals they are puppets nothing but poetry and i say it who do not read it chancellor von redwitz is the speakernothing but poetry makes romances passable for poetry is the everlastingly and embracingly human without it your fictions are flat foolishness nonnourishing substancea species of brandy and grueldiet for craving stomachs that can support nothing solider and must have the weak stuff stiffened talking of poetry there was an independent hereditary princess of leiterstein in love with a poeta leonora destethis was no tasso nevertheless she proposed to come to nuptials good you observe i confine myself to the relation of historical circumstances in other words facts and of good or bad i know not chancellor von redwitz smoothed the black silk stocking of his crossed leg and set his bunch of seals and watchkey swinging he resumed entirely to amuse me the princess elizabeth of leiterstein promised all the qualities which the most solicitous of paternal princes could desire as a guarantee for the judicious government of the territory to be bequeathed to her at his demise but as there is no romance to be extracted from her story i may as well tell you at once that she did not espouse the poet on the contrary dear mr chancellor i am interested in the princess proceed and be as minute as you please it is but a commonplace excerpt of secret historical narrative buried among the archives of the family my good mr richmond the princess elizabeth thoughtlessly pledged her hand to the young sonneteer of course she could not fulfil her engagement why not you see you are impatient for romance young gentleman not at all mr chancellor i do but ask a question you fence your question was dictated by impatience yes for the facts and elucidations for the romance that is you wish me to depict emotions hereupon this destroyer of temper embrowned his nostrils with snuff addingi am unable to then one is not to learn why the princess could not fulfil her engagement judged from the point of view of the pretender to the supreme honour of the splendid alliance the fault was none of hers she overlooked his humble his peculiarly dubious birth her father interposed no the family quite inefficacious to arrest her determinations what thenwhat was in her way germany what great germany young gentleman i should have premised that besides mental she had eminent moral dispositionsi might term it the conscience of her illustrious rank she would have raised the poet to equal rank beside her had she possessed the power she could and did defy the family and subdue her worshipping father the most noble prince to a form of paralysis of acquiescenceif i make myself understood but she was unsuccessful in her application for the sanction of the diet the diet the german diet have you not lived among us long enough to know that the german diet is the seat of domestic legislation for the princely houses of germany a prince or a princess may say i will this or that the diet says thou shalt not preeminently thou shalt not mix thy blood with that of an impure race nor with blood of inferiors hence we have it what we see it a translucent flood down from the topmost founts of time so we revere it qua man and woman the diet says by implication do as you like marry in the ditches spawn plentifully qua prince and princess no your nuptials are nought or would you maintain them a legal ceremony and be bound by them you descend you go forth you are no reigning sovereign you are a private person his serene highness the prince was thus prohibited from affording help to his daughter the princess was reduced to the decision either that she the sole child born of him in legal wedlock would render him qua prince childless or that she wouldin short would have her womans way the sovereignty of leiterstein continued uninterruptedly with the elder branch she was a true princess a true woman said i thinking the sneer weighty the chancellor begged me to recollect that he had warned me there was no romance to be expected i bowed and bowed during the remainder of the interview chancellor von redwitz had performed his mission the hours of my convalescence were furnished with food for amusement sufficient to sustain a years blockade i had no further longing for society but i craved for fresh air intensely did ottilia know that this iron law enforced with the might of a whole empire environed her held her fast from any motion of heart and will i could not get to mind that the prince had hinted at the existence of such a law yet why should he have done so the word impossible in which he had not been sparing when he deigned to speak distinctly comprised everything more profitable than shooting empty questions at the sky was the speculation on his project in receiving me at the palace and that was dark my father who might now have helped me was off on duty again i found myself driving into sarkeld with a sense of a whirlwind round my head wheels in multitudes were spinning inside striking sparks for thoughts i met an orderly in hussar uniform of blue and silver trotting on his errand there he was and whether many were behind him or he stood for the army in its might he wore the trappings of an old princely house that nestled proudly in the bosom of its great jealous fatherland previously in sarkeld i had noticed members of the diminutive army to smile down on them i saw the princely arms and colours on various houses and in the windows of shops emblems of a small state they belonged to the history of the empire the court physician passed with a bit of ribbon in his buttonhole a lady driving in an open carriage encouraged me to salute her she was the wife of the princes minister of justice upon what foundation had i been building a reflection of the ideas possessing me showed riversley my undecorated home of rough red brick in the middle of barren heaths i entered the palace i sent my respects to the prince in return the hour of dinner was ceremoniously named to me ceremony damped the air i had been insensible to it before or so i thought the weight was now so crushing arms emblems colours liveries portraits of princes and princesses of the house of this the warrior that the seductress burst into sudden light what had i to do among them the presence of the living members of the family was an extreme physical relief for the moment beholding ottilia i counted her but as one of them she welcomed me without restraint we chattered pleasantly at the dinnertable ah you missed our french troupe said the margravine yes said i resigning them to her she nodded and one very pretty little woman they had i can tell youfor a frenchwoman you thought her pretty frenchwomen know what to do with their brains and their pins somebody has said and exceedingly well said too where is that man roy good things always remind me of him the question was addressed to no one in particular the man happened to be my father i remembered a second allusion to him was answered by prince ernest roy is off to croatia to enrol some dozens of cheap workmen the strength of those croats is prodigious and well looked after they work he will be back in three or four or more days you have spoilt a good man rejoined the margravine and that reminds me of a bad onea cutthroat have you heard of that creature the princesss tutor happily cut loose from us though he has published a booka horror all against scripture and divine right is there any one to defend him now i should like to ask i said ottilia gracious me you have not read the book right through dear aunt with all respect to you it s in the house it is in my study then i dont wonder i dont wonder the margravine exclaimed best hear what the enemy has to say prince ernest observed excellently argued papa supposing that he be an enemy an enemy as much as the fox is the enemy of the poultryyard and the hound is the enemy of the fox said the margravine i take your illustration auntie said ottilia he is the enemy of chickens and only does not run before the numbers who bark at him my noble old professor is a resolute truthseeker he raises a light to show you the ground you walk on how is it that you adoring heroes as you do cannot admire him when he stands alone to support his view of the truth i would i were by him but i am whenever i hear him abused i daresay you discard nothing that the wretch has taught you nothing nothing said ottilia and made my heart live the grim and taciturn baroness turckems sitting opposite to her sighed audibly has the princess been trying to convert you the margravine asked her trying no madam reading yes my good turckems you do not get your share of sleep it is her highness the princess who despises sleep see there the way with your freethinkers they commence by treading under foot the pleasantest half of life and then they impose their bad habits on their victims ottilia ernest i do insist upon having lights extinguished in the childs apartments by twelve oclock at midnight twelve oclock is an extraordinary latitude for children said ottilia smiling the prince with a scarce perceptible degree of emphasis said women born to rule must be held exempt from nursery restrictions here the conversation opened to let me in more than once the margravine informed me that i was not the equal of my father why said she why cant you undertake this detestable coalmine and let your father disport himself i suggested that it might be because i was not his equal she complimented me for inheriting a spark of roys brilliancy i fancied there was a conspiracy to force me back from my pretensions by subjecting me to the contemplation of my bare self and actual condition had there been i should have suffered from less measured strokes the unconcerted design to humiliate inferiors is commonly successfuller than conspiracy the prince invited me to smoke with him and talked of our gradual subsidence in england to one broad level of rank through the intermixture by marriage of our aristocracy squirearchy and merchants here it is not so he said and no democratic rageings will make it so rank with us is a principle i suppose you have not read the professors book it is powerfulhe is a powerful man it can do no damage to the minds of persons destined by birth to wield authority none therefore to the princess i would say to youavoid it for those who have to carve their way it is bad you will enter your parliament of course there you have a fine career he asked me what i had made of chancellor von redwitz i perceived that prince ernest could be cool and sagacious in repairing what his imprudence or blindness had left to occur that he must have enlightened his daughter as to her actual position and was most dexterously and devilishly flattering her worldly good sense by letting it struggle and grow instead of opposing her his appreciation of her intellect was an idolatry he really confided in it i knew and this reacted upon her did it my hesitations and doubts my fantastic raptures and despair my loss of the power to appreciate anything at its right value revealed the madness of loving a princess there were preparations for the arrival of an important visitor the margravine spoke of him emphatically i thought it might be her farcically pompous way of announcing my fathers return and looked pleased i suppose for she added do you know prince hermann he spends most of his time in eberhardstadt he is cousin of the king a wealthy branch tant soit peu philosophe a ce quon dit a traveller they say he has a south american complexion i knew him a boy and his passion is to put together what nature has unpieced bones of fishes and animals il faut passer le temps he adores the deluge anything antediluvian excites him he can tell us the modes of those days and if i am not very much misinformed he still expects us to show him the very latest of these happily my milliner is back from paris ay and we have fossils in our neighbourhood though on my honour i dont know wheresomewhere the princess can guide him and you can help at the excavations i am told he would go through the crust of earth for the backbone of an idioiliosomethingsaurus i scrutinized prince hermann as rarely my observation had dwelt on any man he had the german head wide so as seemingly to force out the ears honest ready interested eyes in conversation parched lips a rather tropicallycoloured skin and decidedly the manners of a gentleman to all excepting his retinue of secretaries valets and chasseurshis blacks he called them they liked him one could not help liking him you study much he addressed the princess at table she answered i throw aside books now you have come to open the earth and the sea from that time the topics started on every occasion were theirs the rest of us ran at their heels giving tongue or not to me prince hermann was perfectly courteous he had made english friends on his travels he preferred english comrades in adventure to any other thought our east indian empire the most marvellous thing the world had seen and our indian government cigars very smokeable upon acquaintance when stirred he bubbled with anecdote not been there was his reply to the margravines tentatives for gossip of this and that of the german courts his museum hunting and the opera absorbed and divided his hours i guessed his age to be mounting forty he seemed robust he ate vigorously drinking he conscientiously performed as an accompanying duty and was flushed after dinner burning for tobacco and a couch for his length then he talked of the littleness of europe and the greatness of germany logical postulates fell in collapse before him america to america north and south india to europe india was for the land with the largest seaboard mistress of the baltic of the north sea and the east as eventually she must be germany would claim to take india as a matter of course and find an outlet for the energies of the most prolific and the toughest of the races of mankindthe purest in fact the only true race properly so called out of india to which it would return as to its source and there create an empire magnificent in force and solidity the actual wedding of east and west an empire firm on the ground and in the blood of the people instead of an empire of aliens that would bear comparison to a finely fretted cottonhung palanquin balanced on an elephants back all depending on the docility of the elephant his description of great britains indian empire and mind me he said the masses of india are in character elephant all over tail to proboscis servile till they trample you and not so stupid as they look but youve done wonders in india and we cant forget it your administration of justice is worth all your battles there this was the man a milder one after the evaporation of his wine in speech and peculiarly moderate on his return exhaling sandalwood to the society of the ladies ottilia danced with prince hermann at the grand ball given in honour of him the wives and daughters of the notables present kept up a buzz of comment on his personal advantages in which i heard it said you saw his german heart though he had spent the best years of his life abroad much court was paid to him by the men sarkeld visibly expressed satisfaction one remark we shall have his museum in the town left me no doubt upon the presumed object of his visit it was uttered and responded to with a depth of sentiment that showed how lively would be the general gratitude toward one who should exhilarate the place by introducing cases of fishbones so little did he think of my presence that returning from a ride one day he seized and detained the princesss hand she frowned with pained surprise but unresistingly as became a young gentlewomans dignity her hand was rudely caught and kept in the manner of a boisterous wooer a harry the fifth or lusty petruchio she pushed her horse on at a bound prince hermann rode up head to head with her gallantly having now both hands free of the reins like an indian spearing the buffalo it was buffalo courtship and his shout of rallying astonishment at her resistance what what rang wildly to heighten the scene she leaning constrained on one side and he bending half his bodys length a strange scene for me to witness they proceeded with old schwartz at their heels doglike it became a question for me whether i should follow in the bitter track and further the question whether i could let them escape from sight they wound up the roadway two figures and one following now dots against the sky now a single movement in the valley now concealed buried under billows of forest making the low noising of the leaves an intolerable whisper of secresy and forward i rushed again to see them rounding a belt of firs or shadowed by rocks solitary on shorn fields once more dipping to the forest and once more emerging vanishing when i had grown sure of their reappearance from some point of view or other i spied for them in vain my destiny whatever it might be fluttered over them to see them seemed near the knowing of it and not to see them deadly i galloped so intent on the three in the distance that i did not observe a horseman face toward me on the road it was prince hermann he raised his hat i stopped short and he spoke mr richmond permit me to apologize to you i have to congratulate you it appears i was not awarehowever the princess has done me the favour to enlighten me how you will manage i cant guess but that is not my affair i am a man of honour and on my honour i conceived that i was invited here to decide as my habit is on the spot if i would or if i would not i speak clearly to you no doubt there could be no hesitation in the mind of a man of sense my way is prompt and blunt i am sorry i gave you occasion to reflect on it there i have been deceiveddeceived myself lets say sharp methods play the devil with you now and then to speak the truthperhaps you wont care to listen to itfamily arrangements are the best take my word for it they are the best and in the case of princesses of the bloodwhy look you i happen to be suitable it s a matter of chance like your height complexion constitution one is just what one is born to be eh you have your english notions i my german but as a man of the world in the bargain and gentleman i hope i should say that to take a young princesss fancy and drag her from her station is notof course you know that the actual value of the title goes if she steps down very well but enough said i thought i was in a clear field we are used to having our way cleared for us nous autres i will not detain you we saluted gravely and i rode on at a mechanical pace discerning by glimpses the purport of what i had heard without drawing warmth from it the mans outrageously royal way of wooing in contempt of minor presences and flimsy sentiment made me jealous of him notwithstanding his overthrow i was in the mood to fall entirely into my fathers hands as i did by unbosoming myself to him for the first time since my heart had been under the charm fresh from a rapid course of travel and with the sense of laying the prince under weighty obligations he made light of my perplexity and at once delivered himself bluntly she plights her hand to you in the presence of our good peterborough his plans were shaped on the spot we start for england the day after tomorrow to urge on the suit richie our peterborough is up at the chateau the frau feldmarschall honours him with a farewell invitation you have a private interview with the princess at midnight in the library where you are accustomed to read as a student of books should my boy at a touch of the bell or mere opening of the door i see that peterborough comes to you it will not be a ceremony but a binding of you both by your word of honour before a ghostly gentleman he informed me that his foresight had enlisted and detained peterborough for this particular moment and identical piece of duty which seemed possible and in a singular manner incited me to make use of peterborough for the princess still denied me the look of loves intelligence she avoided me she still kept to the riddle and my delicacy went so far that i was restrained from writing i agreed with my father that we could not remain in germany but how could i quit the field and fly to england on such terms i composed the flattest letter ever written requesting the princess to meet me about midnight in the library that i might have the satisfaction of taking my leave of her and this done my spirits rose and it struck me my father was practically wise and i looked on peterborough as an almost supernatural being if ottilia refused to come at least i should know my fate was i not bound in manly honour to be to some degree adventurous so i reasoned in exclamations being to tell truth tired of seeming to be what i was not quite of striving to become what i must have divined that i never could quite attain to so my worthier or ideal self fell away from me i was no longer devoted to be worthy of a womans love but consenting to the plot to entrap a princess i was somewhat influenced too by the consideration which i regarded as a glimpse of practical wisdom that prince ernest was guilty of cynical astuteness in retaining me as his guest under manifold disadvantages personal pride stood up in arms and my fathers exuberant spirits fanned it he dwelt loudly on his services to the prince and his own importance and my heirship to mighty riches he made me almost believe that prince ernest hesitated about rejecting me nor did it appear altogether foolish to think so or why was i at the palace i had no head for reflections my father diverted me by levelling the whole battery of his comic mind upon peterborough who had a heap of manuscript directed against heretical german theologians to pack up for publication in his more congenial country how different he ejaculated from this nestthis forest of heresy where pamphlets and critical essays were issued without let or hindrance and as far as he could see no general reprobation of the press such as would most undoubtedly with one voice hail any strange opinions in our happy land at home whether he really understood the function my father prepared him for i cannot say the invitation to dine and pass a night at the lakepalace flattered him immensely we went up to the chateau to fetch him a look of woe was on peterboroughs countenance when we descended at the palace portals he had forgotten his pipe you shall smoke one of the princes my father said peterborough remarked to mewe shall have many things to talk over in england no tobacco allowed on the premises at riversley i m afraid said i he sighed and bade me jocosely to know that he regarded tobacco as just one of the consolations of exiles and bachelors peterborough my good friend you are a hero cried my father he divorces tobacco to marry permit me peterborough interposed with an ingenuous pretension to subtle waggery in itself very comicalpermit me no legitimate union has taken place between myself and tobacco he puts an end to the illegitimate union between himself and tobacco that he may marry according to form cried my father we entered the palace merrily and presently peterborough who had worn a studious forehead in the midst of his consenting laughter observed well you know there is more in that than appears on the surface his sweet simpleton air of profundity convulsed me i handed my father the letter addressed to the princess to entrust it to the charge of one of the domestics thinking carelessly at the time that ottilia now stood free to make appointments and receive communications and moreover that i was too proud to condescend to subterfuge except this minor one in consideration for her of making it appear that my father and not i was in communication with her my fit of laughter clung i dressed chuckling the margravine was not slow to notice and comment on my hilarious readiness roy she said you have given your son spirit one sees he has your blood when you have been with him an hour the season has returned if your highness will let it be spring said my father far fetchedfrom the lower danube she ejaculated in mock scorn to excite his sprightliness and they fell upon a duologue as good as wit for the occasion prince hermann had gone his departure was mentioned with the ordinary commonplaces of regret ottilia was unembarrassed both in speaking of him and looking at me we had the court physician and his wife at table chancellor von redwitz and his daughter and general happenwyll chief of the princes contingent a prussian at heart said to be a good officer on the strength of a military book of some sort that he had full leisure to compose the chancellors daughter and baroness turckems enclosed me i was questioned by the baroness as to the cause of my fathers unexpected return he is generally opportune she remarked he goes with me to england i said oh he goes said she and asked why we were honoured with the presence of mr peterborough that evening there had always been a smouldering hostility between her and my father to my surprise the baroness spoke of ottilia by her name ottilia must have mountain air these late hours destroy her complexion active exercise by day and proper fatigue by night time that is my prescription the princess i replied envying peterborough who was placed on one side of her will benefit i am sure from mountain air does she read excessively the sea the sea i pronounce bad for herunwholesome returned the baroness it is damp i laughed damp she reiterated the vapours i am convinced affect mind and body that excursion in the yacht did her infinite mischief the mountains restored her they will again take my word for it now take you my word for it they will again she is not too strong in constitution but in order to prescribe accurately one must find out whether there is seated malady to ride out in the night instead of reposing to drive on and on and not reappear till the night of the next dayi ask you is it sensible does it not approach mania the princess said i ottilia has done that baroness can i believe youand alone a marvellous twinkle of shuffle appeared in the small slatecoloured eyes i looked at under their roofing of thick black eyebrows alone she said that is she was precautious to have her giant to protect her from violence there you have a glimmering of reason in her and all of it that i can see old schwartz is a very faithful servant said i thinking that she resembled the old warhead in visage a dogs obedience to the masters whims you call faithfulness hem the baroness coughed dryly i whispered does prince ernestis he aware you are aware retorted the baroness that what a man idolizes he wont see flaw in remember i am something here or i am nothing the enigmatical remark was received by me decorously as a piece of merited chastisement nodding with gravity i expressed regrets that the sea did not please her otherwise i could have offered her a yacht for a cruise she nodded stiffly her mouth shut up a smile showing more of the door than the ray the dinner virtually a german supper ended in general conversation on political affairs preceded and supported by a discussion between the prussianhearted general and the austrianhearted margravine prince ernest true to his view that diplomacy was the weapon of minor sovereigns held the balance with now a foot in one scale now in the other a politic proceeding so long as the rival powers passively consent to be weighed we trifled with music made our bow to the ladies and changed garments for the smokingroom prince ernest smoked his one cigar among guests the general the chancellor and the doctor knew the signal for retirement and rose simultaneously with the discharge of his cigarend in sparks on the unlit logwood pile my father and mr peterborough kept their chairs there was i felt with relief no plot for nothing had been definitely assented to by me i received prince ernests proffer of his hand on making my adieux to him with a passably clear conscience i went out to the library a man came in for orders i had none to give he saw that the shutters were fixed and the curtains down examined my handlamp and placed lamps on the readingdesk and mantelpiece bronze busts of sages became my solitary companions the room was long low and dusky voluminously and richly hung with draperies at the farther end where a table stood for the prince to jot down memoranda and a sofa to incline him to the relaxation of romancereading a door at this end led to the sleeping apartments of the west wing of the palace where i sat the student had ranges of classical volumes in prospect and classic heads no other decoration to the walls i paced to and fro and should have flung myself on the sofa but for a heap of books there covered from dust perhaps concealed that the yellow parisian volumes of which i caught sight of some new dozen might not be an attraction to the eyes of chancecomers at the lakepalace the prince frequently gave audience here he had said to me when i stated my wish to read in the library you keep to the classical department i thought it possible he might not like the coloured volumes to be inspected i had no taste for a perusal of them i picked up one that fell during my walk and flung it back and disturbed a heap under cover for more fell and there i let them lie ottilia did not keep me waiting chapter xxxv the scene in the lakepalace library i was humming the burden of gothes zigeunerlied a favourite one with me whenever i had too much to think of or nothing a low rush of sound from the halldoorway swung me on my heel and i saw her standing with a silver lamp raised in her right hand to the level of her head as if she expected to meet obscurity a thin blue indian scarf mufed her throat and shoulders her hair was loosely knotted the lamps full glow illumined and shadowed her she was like a statue of twilight i went up to her quickly and closed the door saying you have come my voice was not much above a breath she looked distrustfully down the length of the room you were speaking to some one no you were speaking to myself then i suppose i remembered and repeated the gipsy burden she smiled faintly and said it was the hour for anna and ursel and kith and liese to be out her hands were gloved a small matter to tell of we heard the porticosentinel challenged and relieved midnight i said she replied you were not definite in your directions about the minutes i feared to name midnight why lest the appointment of midnighti lose my knowledge of youshould make you reflect frighten you you see i am inventing a reason i really cannot tell why if it was not that i hoped to have just those few minutes more of you and now theyre gone i would not have asked you but that i thought you free to act i am and you come freely a therefore belongs to every grant of freedom i understand your judgement was against it be comforted she said it is your right to bid me come if you think fit one of the sofavolumes fell she caught her breath and smiled at her foolish alarm i told her that it was my intention to start for england in the morning that this was the only moment i had and would be the last interview my rights if i possessed any and i was not aware that i did i threw down you throw down one end of the chain she said in the name of heaven then cried i release yourself she shook her head that is not my meaning note the predicament of a lover who has a piece of dishonesty lurking in him my chilled selflove had certainly the right to demand the explanation of her coldness and i could very well guess that a word or two drawn from the neighbourhood of the heart would fetch a warmer current to unlock the ice between us but feeling the coldness i complained of to be probably a suspicion i fixed on the suspicion as a new and deeper injury done to my loyal love for her and armed against that i dared not take an initiative for fear of unexpectedly justifying it by betraying myself yet supposing her inclination to have become diverted i was ready frankly to release her with one squeeze of hands and take all the pain of she pain and i said pray do not speak of chains but they exist things cannot be undone for us two by words the tremble as of a strung wire in the strenuous pitch of her voice seemed to say she was not cold though her gloved hand resting its fingerends on the table her restrained attitude her very calm eyes declared the reverse this and that sensation beset me in turn we shrank oddly from uttering one anothers christian name i was the first with it my ottilia brought soon after harry on her lips and an atmosphere about us much less arctic ottilia you have told me you wish me to go to england i have we shall be friends yes harry we cannot be quite divided we have that knowledge for our present happiness the happy knowledge that we may have our bone to gnaw when foods denied it is something one would like possibly after expulsion out of eden to climb the gates to see how the trees grow there what i cannot imagine is the forecasting of any joy in the privilege by nature or system then you are more impatient than i for i can said ottilia she added so much of your character i divined early it was part of my reason for wishing you to work you will find that hard work in englandbut why should i preach to you harry you have called me here for some purpose i must have detained you already too long time is not the offender since i have come the evil evil are not your actions free patience my friend the freer my actions the more am i bound to deliberate on them i have the habit of thinking that my deliberations are not in my sexs fashion of taking counsel of the nerves and the blood in truth harry i should not have come but for my acknowledgement of your right to bid me come you know princess that in honouring me with your attachment you imperil your sovereign rank i do what next except that it is grievously in peril nothing have you known it all along dimlyscarcely to some extent i knew it but it did not stand out in broad daylight i have been learning the worlds wisdom recently would you have had me neglect it surely much is due to my father my relatives have claims on me our princely houses have my country has oh princess if you are pleading can you think that i am the splendour of her high nature burst on me with a shock i could have fallen to kiss her feet and i said indifferently not pleading only it is evident the claimsi hate myself for bringing you in antagonism with them yes and i have been learning some worldly wisdom i wish for your sake it had not been so late what made me overleap the proper estimate of your rank i cant tell but now that i know better the kind of creaturethe man who won your esteem when you knew less of the world hush i have an interest in him and do not suffer him to be spurned ottilia checked me i too know him better and still if he is dragged down i am in the dust if he is abused the shame is mine her face bloomed her sweet warmth of colour was transfused through my veins we shall part in a few minutes i have a mind to beg a gift of you name it that glove she made her hand bare and gave me not the glove but the hand ah but this i cannot keep will you have everything spoken she said in a tone that would have been reproachful had not tenderness melted it there should be a spirit between us harry to spare the task you do keep it if you choose i have some little dread of being taken for a madwoman and morean actual horror of behaving ungratefully to my generous father he has proved that he can be indulgent most trusting and considerate for his daughter though he is a prince my duty is to show him that i do not forget i am a princess i owe my rank allegiance when he forgets his on my behalf my friend you are young none but an inexperienced girl hoodwinked by her tricks of intuition would have dreamed you superior to the passions of other men i was blind i am regretfultake my word as you do my hand for no ones sake but my fathers you and i are bound fast only help me that the blow may be lighter for him if i descend from the place i was born to let me tell him it is to occupy one i am fitted for or should not at least feel my familys deep blush in filling to be in the midst of life in your foremost england is in my imagination very glorious harry i remember picturing to myself when i reflected upon your countrys historyperhaps a year after i had seen the two young english gentlemen that you touch the morning and evening star and wear them in your coronet and walk with the sun west and east childs imagery but the impression does not wear off if i rail at england it is the anger of love i fancy i have good and great things to speak to the people through you there she stopped the fervour she repressed in speech threw a glow over her face like that on a frosty bare autumn sky after sunset i pressed my lips to her hand in our silence another of the fatal yellow volumes thumped the floor she looked into my eyes and asked have we been speaking before a witness so thoroughly had she renovated me that i accused and reproved the lurking suspicion with a soft laugh beloved i wish we had been if it might be she said divining me and musing why not she stared how what do you ask the look on my face alarmed her i was breathless and colourless with the heart of a hawk eyeing his birda fox would be the truer comparison but the bird was noble not one that cowered her beauty and courage lifted me into high air in spite of myself and it was a huge weight of greed that fell away from me when i said i would not urge it for an instant considerif you had just plighted your hand in mine before a witness my hand is in yours my word to you is enough enough my thanks to heaven for it but considera pledge of fidelity that should be my secret angel about me in trouble and trial my wedded soul she cannot falter she is mine for ever she guides me holds me to work inspirits meshe is secure from temptation from threats from everythingnothing can touch nothing move her she is mine i mean an attested word a form that isa betrothal for me to saymy beloved and my betrothed you hear that beloved is a lonely word betrothed carries us joined up to death would youi do but ask to know that you would tomorrow i am loose in the world and there s a darkness in the thought of it almost too terrible would youone sworn word that gives me my bride let men do what they may i go then singing to battlesureremember it is but the question whether you would harry i would and will she said her lips shudderingwaitfor a cry of joy escaped mei will look you me in the eyes and tell me you have a doubt of me i looked she swam in a mist we had our full draught of the divine selfoblivion which floated those ghosts of the two immortal lovers through the bounds of their purgatorial circle and for us to whom the minutes were ages as for them to whom all time was unmarked the power of supreme love swept out circumstance such embraces cast the soul beyond happiness into no known region of sadness but we drew apart sadly even as that involved pair of bleeding recollections looked on the life lost to them i knew well what a height she dropped from when the senses took fire she raised me to learn how little of fretful thirst and its reputed voracity remains with love when it has been met midway in air by a winged mate able to sustain unable to descend farther and it was before a witness though unviewed by us the farewell had come her voice was humbled never i said delighting in the now conscious bravery of her eyes engaging mine shadowy with the struggle i would never doubt her and i renounced all pledges to be clear in my own sight as well as in hers i made mention of the halfformed conspiracy to obtain her plighted troth in a binding manner it was not necessary for me to excuse myself she did that saying could there be a greater proof of my darlings unhappiness i am to blame we closed hands for parting she hesitated and asked if my father was awake then promptly to my answer i will see him i have treated you ill i have exacted too much patience the suspicion was owing to a warning i had this evening harry a silly warning to beware of snares and i had no fear of them believe me though for some moments and without the slightest real desire to be guarded i fancied harrys father was overhearing me he is your father dearest fetch him to me my father will hear of this from my lipswhy not he ah did i suspect you ever so little i will atone for it not atone i will make it my pleasure it is my pride that has hurt you both o my lover my lover dear head dear eyes delicate and noble that you are my own stronger soul where was my heart is it sometimes dead or sleeping but you can touch it to life look at mei am yours i consent i desire it i will see him i will be bound the heavier the chains oh the better for me what am i to be proud of anything not yours harry and i that have passed over to you i will see him at once a third in the room cried out no not thatyou do not the tongue was german and struck on us like a roll of unfriendly musketry before we perceived the enemy princess ottilia you remember your dignity or i defend you and it think of me what you will baroness turckems desperately entangled by the sofacovering rushed into the ray of the lamps and laid her hand on the bellrope in a minute we had an alarm sounding my father was among us there was a mad play of chatter and we stood in the strangest nightmarelight that ever ended an interview of lovers chapter xxxvi homeward and home again the room was in flames baroness turckems plucking at the bellrope my father looking big and brilliant hold hand he shouted to the frenzied baroness she countershouted both of them stamped feet the portico sentinel struck the butt of his musket on the halldoors bell answered bell along the upper galleries foolish woman be silent cried my father incendiary she halfshrieked he turned to the princess begging her to retire but she stared at him and i too after having seen him deliberately apply the flame of her lamp to the curtains deemed him mad he was perfectly selfpossessed and said this will explain the bell and fetched a deep breath and again urged the princess to retire peterborough was the only one present who bethought him of doing firemans duty the risk looked greater than it was he had but to tear the lighted curtains down and trample on them suddenly the baroness called out the man is right come with me princess escape your highness escape and you she addressed meyou rang the bell you to repair your error baroness said my father i have my conscience pure have you she retorted he bowed and said the fire will also excuse your presence on the spot baroness i thank my god i am not so cool as you said she your warmthhe bent to hershall always be your apology baroness seeing the curtains extinguished ottilia withdrew she gave me no glance all this occurred before the nightporter who was going his rounds could reach the library lacqueys and maids were soon at his heels my father met prince ernest with a florid story of a reckless student either asleep or too anxious to secure a particular volume and showed his usual consideration by not asking me to verify the narrative with that and with high praise of peterborough as to whose gallantry i heard him deliver a very circumstantial account he i suppose satisfied the princes curiosity and appeased him the damage being small compared with the uproar prince ernest questioned two or three times what set him ringing so furiously my father made some reply ottilias cloudpale windows were the sole greeting i had from her on my departure early next morning far wretcheder than if i had encountered a misfortune it was impossible for me to deny that my father had shielded the princess she would never have run for a menace as he remarked the ringing of the bell would not of itself have forced her to retreat and the nature of the baronesss alarm demanded nothing less than a conflagration to account for it to the household but i felt humiliated on ottilias behalf and enraged on my own and i had i must confess a touch of fear of a man who could unhesitatingly go to extremities as he had done by summoning fire to the rescue he assured me that moments such as those inspired him and were the pride of his life and he was convinced that upon reflection i should rise to his pitch he deluded himself with the idea of his having foiled baroness turckems nor did i choose to contest it though it struck me that she was too conclusively the foiler she must have intercepted the letter for the princess i remembered acting carelessly in handing it to my father for him to consign it to one of the domestics and he passed it on with a flourish her place of concealment was singularly well selected under the sofa cover and the little heaps of paperbound volumes i do not fancy she meant to rouse the household her notion probably was to terrorize the princess that she might compel her to quit my presence in rushing to the bellrope her impetuosity sent her stumbling on it with force and while threatening to ring and meaning merely to threaten she rang and as it was not a retractable act she continued ringing and the more violently upon my fathers appearance catching sight of peterborough at his heels she screamed a word equivalent to a clergyman she had lost her discretion but not her wits for any one save a loverthwarted as i was and perturbed by the shadow falling on the princessmy fathers aplomb and promptness in conjuring a check to what he assumed to be a premeditated piece of villany on the part of baroness turckems might have seemed tolerably worthy of admiration me the whole scene affected as if it had burnt my skin i loathed that picture of him constantly present to me of his shivering the glass of ottilias semiclassical nightlamp gravely asking her pardon and stretching the flame to the curtain with large eyes blazing on the baroness the stupid burlesque majesty of it was unendurable to thought nevertheless i had to thank him for shielding ottilia and i had to brood on the fact that i had drawn her into a situation requiring such a shield he meanwhile according to his habit was engaged in reviewing the triumphs to come we have won a princess and what england would say how england would look when on a further journey i brought my princess home entirely occupied his imagination to my excessive torturea state of mind for which it was impossible to ask his mercy his sole link with the past appeared to be this notion that he had planned all the good things in store for us consequently i was condemned to hear of the success of the plot untilfor i had not the best of consciencesi felt my hand would be spellbound in the attempt to write to the princess and with that sense of incapacity i seemed to be cut loose from her drifting back into the desolate days before i saw her wheeled in her invalid chair along the sands and my life knew sunrise but whatever the mood of our affections so it is with us island wanderers we cannot gaze over at england knowing the old country to be close under the sealine and not hail it and partly forget ourselves in the time that was the smell of seaair made me long for the white cliffs the sight of the white cliffs revived pleasant thoughts of riversley and thoughts of riversley thoughts of janet which were singularly and refreshingly free from selfaccusations some love for my home similar to what one may have for winter came across me and some appreciation of janet as well in whose society was sure to be at least myself a creature much reduced in altitude but without the cramped sensations of a man on a monument my hearty janet i thanked her then for seeing me of my natural height some hours after parting with my father in london i lay down to sleep in my old home feeling as if i had thrown off a coat of armour i awoke with a sailors song on my lips looking out of window at the wellknown features of the heaths and dark firs and waning oak copses and the shadowy line of the downs stretching their long whale backs south to west it struck me that i had been barely alive of late indeed one who consents to live as i had done in a hope and a retrospect will find his life slipping between the two like the ships under the striding colossus i shook myself braced myself and saluted every one at the breakfast table with the frankness of harry richmond congratulated on my splendid spirits i was confirmed in the idea that i enjoyed them though i knew of something hollow which sent an echo through me at intervals janet had become a fixed inmate of the house ive bought her and i shall keep her shes the apple of my eye said the squire adding with characteristic scrupulousness if apples female i asked her whether she had heard from temple latterly no dear little fellow cried she and i saw in a twinkling what it was that the squire liked in her and liked it too i caught sight of myself as through a rift of cloud trotting home from the hunt to a glad frank unpretending mate with just enough of understanding to look up to mine for a second or so it was pleasing as a glance out of his library across hill and dale will be to a strained student our familiarity sanctioned a comment on the growth of her daughteroftheregiment moustache the faintest conceivable suggestion of a shadow on her soft upper lip which a poet might have feigned to have fallen from her dark thick eyebrows why you dont mean to say hal its not to your taste said the squire no said i turning an eye on my aunt dorothy ive loved it all my life the squire stared at me to make sure of this muttered that it was to his mind a beauty and that it was nothing more on janets lip than down on a flower bloom on a plum the poetical comparisons had the effect of causing me to examine her critically she did not raise a spark of poetical sentiment in my bosom she had grown a tall young woman firmly built light of motion graceful perhaps but it was not the grace of grace the grace of simplicity rather she talked vivaciously and frankly and gave to friends her whole eyes and a fine animation in talking and her voice was a delight to friends there was always the full ring of janet in it and music also she still lifted her lip when she expressed contempt or dislike of persons nor was she cured of her trick of frowning she was as ready as ever to be flattered that was evident my grandfathers praise of her she received with a rewarding look back of kindness she was not discomposed by flattery and threw herself into no postures nor blushed very deeply thank you for perceiving my merits she seemed to say and to be just i should add that one could fancy her saying you see them because you love me she wore her hair in a plain knot peculiarly neatly rounded away from the temples which sometimes gave to a face not aquiline a look of swiftness the face was mobile various not at all suggestive of bad temper in spite of her frowns the profile of it was less assuring than the front because of the dark eyebrows extension and the occasional frown but that was not shared by the mouth which was i admitted to myself a charming bow running to a length at the corners like her eyebrows quick with smiles the corners of the mouth would often be in movement setting dimples at work in her cheek while the brows remained fixed and thus at times a tender meditative air was given her that i could not think her own upon what could she possibly reflect she had not a care she had no education she could hardly boast an ideatwo at a time i was sure she never had entertained the sort of wife for a foxhunting lord i summed up and hoped he would be a good fellow peterborough was plied by the squire for a description of german women blushing and shooting a timid look from under his pendulous eyelids at my aunt indicating that he was prepared to go the way of tutors at riversley he said he really had not much observed them theyre a whiteybrown sort of women arent they the squire questioned him with tow hair and fish eyes high o the shoulder bony and a towel skin and gone teeth so ive heard tell ive heard thats why the men have all taken to their beastly smoking peterborough ejaculated indeed sir really he assured my aunt that german ladies were most agreeable cultivated persons extremely domesticated retiring the encomiums of the roman historian were as well deserved by them in the present day as they had been in the past decidedly on the whole peterborough would call them a virtuous race why do they let the men smoke then said the squire a pretty style o courtship come sit by my hearth maam i ll be your chimney faugh dirty rascals janet said i rather like the smell of cigars like what you please my dearhell be a lucky dog the squire approved her promptly and asked me if i smoked i was not a stranger to the act i confessed wellhe took refuge in practical philosophya man must bring some dirt home from every journey only dont smoke me out mercys sake here was a hint of janets influence with him and of what he expected from my return to riversley peterborough informed me that he suffered persecution over the last glasses of port in the evening through the squires persistent inquiries as to whether a woman had anything to do with my staying so long abroad a lady sir quoth peterborough lady if you like rejoined the squire you parsons and petticoats must always mince the meat to hash the fact peterborough defended his young friend harrys moral reputation and was amazed to hear that the squire did not think highly of a mans chastity the squire acutely chagrined the sensitive gentleman by drawling the word after him and declaring that he tossed that kind of thing into the womens washbasket peterborough not without signs of indignation protesting the squire asked him point blank if he supposed that old england had been raised to the head of the world by such as he in fine he favoured peterborough with a lesson in worldly views but these peterborough said to me are not the views dear harryif they are the views of ladies of any description which i take leave to doubtnot the views of the ladies you and i would esteem for instance the ladies of this household my aunt dorothys fate was plain in reply to my grandfathers renewed demand to know whether any one of those highdutch women had got hold of me peterborough said mr beltham the only lady of whom it could be suspected that my friend harry regarded her with more than ordinary admiration was hereditaryprincess of one of the ancient princely houses of germany my grandfather thereupon said oh pushed the wine and was stopped peterborough chuckled over this oh and the stoppage of further questions while acknowledging that the luxury of a pipe would help to make him more charitable he enjoyed the port of his native land but he did likewise feel the want of one whiff or so of the less restrictive foreigners pipe and he begged me to note the curiosity of our worship of aristocracy and royalty and we who were such slaves to rank and such tyrants in our own householdswe britons were the great sticklers for freedom his conclusion was that we were not logical we would have a throne which we would not allow the liberty to do anything to make it worthy of rational veneration we would have a peerage of which we were so jealous that it formed almost an assembly of automatons we would have virtuous women only for them to be pursued by immoral men peterborough feared he must say that we were an inconsequent people his residence abroad had so far unhinged him but a pipe would have stopped his complainings moved perhaps by generous wine in concert with his longing for tobacco he dropped an observation of unwonted shrewdness he said the squire my dear harry a most honourable and straightforward country gentleman and one of our very wealthiest is still i would venture to suggest an example of old blood that requiresi study racevarying modifying one might venture to say correcting and really a friend with more privileges than i possess would or should throw him a hint that no harm has been done to the family by an intermixture old blood does occasionally need ityou know i study bloodit becomes too coarse or in some cases too fine the study of the mixture of blood is probably one of our great physical problems peterborough commended me to gratitude for the imaginative and chivalrous element bestowed on me by a father that was other than a country squire one who could be tolerant of innocent habits and not of guilty ones a further glance at the interdicted pipe i left him almost whimpering for it the contemplation of the curious littleness of the lives of men and women lived in this england of ours made me feel as if i looked at them out of a palace balconywindow for no one appeared to hope very much or to fear people trotted in their different kinds of harness and i was amused to think of my heart going regularly in imitation of those about me i was in a princely state of mind indeed not disinclined for a time to follow the general course of life while despising it an existence without colour without anxious throbbing without salient matter for thought challenged contempt but it was exceedingly funny my aunt dorothy the squire and janet submitted to my transparent inward laughter at them patiently waiting for me to share their contentment in the deluded belief that the hour would come the principal items of news embraced the death of squire gregory bulsted the marriage of this and that young lady a legal contention between my grandfather and lady maria higginson the wife of a rich manufacturer newly located among us on account of a right of encampment on durstan heath my grandfather taking side with the gipsies and beating her ladyshipa friend of heriots by the way concerning heriot my aunt dorothy was in trouble she could not she said approve his behaviour in coming to this neighbourhood at all and she hinted that i might induce him to keep away i mentioned julia bulsteds being in mourning merely to bring in her name tentatively ay mournings her outer rig never doubt said the squire flick your whip at her she s a charitable soul judy bulsted she knits stockings for the poor shed down and kiss the stump of a sailor on a stick o timber all the same she oughtnt to be alone pity she hasnt a baby you and ill talk it over byandby harry kiomi was spoken of and lady maria higginson and then heriot mmmm rascal hummed the squire theres three and thats not enough for him six months back a man comes over from surreywards a farm he calls dipwell and asks after you harry rigmaroles about a handsome lass gone off some scoundrel you and ill talk it over byandby harry janet raised and let fall her eyebrows the fiction that so much having been said an immediate show of reserve on such topics preserved her in ignorance of them was one she subscribed to merely to humour the squire i was half in doubt whether i disliked or admired her want of decent hypocrisy she allowed him to suppose that she did not hear but spoke as a party to the conversation my aunt dorothy blamed julia the squire thundered at heriot janet liking both contented herself with impartial comments i always think in these cases that the women must be the fools she said her affectation was to assume a knowledge of the world and all things in it we rode over to julias cottage on the outskirts of the estate now devolved upon her husband irish eyes are certainly bewitching lights i thought for my part i could not do as the captain was doing serving his country in foreign parts while such as these were shining without a captain at home janet approved his conduct and was right what can a wife think the man worth who sits down to guard his housedoor she answered my slight innuendo she compared the man to a kenneldog this said i comes of madeup matches whereat she was silent julia took her own view of her position she asked me whether it was not dismal for one who was called a grass widow and was in reality a salt water one to keep fresh with a lapdog a cook and a maidservant and a postman that passed the gate twenty times for twice that he opened it and nothing to look for but this disappointing creature day after day at first she was shy stole out a coy line of fingers to be shaken and lisped and out of that mood came rightaboutface with an exclamation of regret that she supposed she must not kiss me now i projected she drew back shall janet go said i then if nobodys present i ll be talked of said she moaning queerly the tendency of her hair to creep loose of its bands gave her handsome face an aspect deliriously wild i complimented her on her keeping so fresh in spite of her saltwater widowhood she turned the tables on me for looking so powerful though i was dying for a foreign princess oh but thatll blow over she said anything blows over as long as you dont go up to the altar and she eyed her ringed finger woebegone and flashed the pleasantest of smiles with the name of her william heriot whom she always called walter heriot was she informed me staying at durstan hall the new great house built on a plot of ground that the lancashire millionaire had caught up while the squire and the other landowners of the neighbourhood were sleeping and if you get walter heriot to come to you harry richmond itll be better for him im sure she added and naively i d like to meet him up at the grange temple she said had left the navy and was reading in london for the bargood news to me you have not told us anything about your princess harry janet observed on the ride home do you take her for a real person janet one thinks of her as a snowmountain youve been admiring very well so let her be is she kind and good yes does she ride well she rides remarkably well she s fair i suppose janet if i saw you married to temple it would be the second great wish of my heart harry youre a bit too cruel as julia would say have you noticed she gets more and more irish perhaps she finds it is liked some women can adapt themselves they re the happiest all i meant to ask you is whether your princess is like the rest of us not at all said i unconscious of hurting never mind dont be hard on julia she has the making of a good womana girl can see that only she cant bear loneliness and doesnt understand yet what it is to be loved by a true gentleman persons of that class cant learn it all at once i was pained to see her in tears her figure was straight and she spoke without a quaver of her voice heriots an excellent fellow i remarked he is i cant think ill of my friends said she dear girl is it these two who make you unhappy no but dear old grandada the course of her mind was obvious i would rather have had her less abrupt and more personal in revealing it i stammered something heriot does not know you as i do she said strangling a whimper i was sure it was serious though ones accustomed to associate princesses with young mens dreams i fear harry it will half break our dear old grandadas heart he is rough and you have often been against him for one unfortunate reason if you knew him as i do you would pity him sincerely he hardly grumbled at all at your terribly long absence poor old man he hopes on hes incurably unjust to my father your father has been with you all the time harry i guessed it well it generally bodes no good to the grange do pardon me for saying that i know nothing of him i know only that the squire is generous and that i stand for with all my might forgive me for what i said forgive youwith all my heart i like you all the better you re a brave partisan i dont expect women to be philosophers well harry i would take your side as firmly as anybodys do then tell the squire how i am situated ah she half sighed i knew this was coming how could it other than come you can do what you like with the squire im dependent on him and i am betrothed to the princess ottilia god knows how much she has to trample down on her part she casts offto speak plainly she puts herself out of the line of succession and for whom for me in her fathers lifetime she will hardly yield me her hand but i must immediately be in a position to offer mine she may who can tell she is above all women in power and firmness you talk of generosity could there be a higher example of it i daresay i know nothing of princesses janet murmured i dont quite comprehend what she has done the point is what am i to do prepare him for it soothe him in advance why dear janet you can reconcile him to anything in a minute lie to him downright now what on earth is the meaning of that and why cant you speak mildly i suppose i speak as i feel im a plain speaker a plain person you dont give me an easy task friend harry if you believe in his generosity janet should you be afraid to put it to proof grandadas generosity harry i do believe in it as i believe in my own life it happens to be the very thing i must keep myself from rousing in him to be of any service to you look at the old house she changed her tone looking on old riversley with the eyes of my head even i think im looking at something far away in the memory perhaps the deep red brick causes it there never was a house with so many beautiful creepers bright as they are you notice the roses on the wall theres a face for me forever from every window and goodbye riversley harry ill obey your wishes so saying she headed me trotting down the heathtrack chapter xxxvii janet renounces me an illness of old sewis the butleramazingly resembling a sick monkey in his bedkept me from paying a visit to temple and seeing my father for several weeks during which time janet loyally accustomed the squire to hear of the german princess and she did it with a decent and agreeable cheerfulness that i quite approved of i should have been enraged at a martyrlike appearance on her part for i demanded a sprightly devotion to my interests considering love so holy a thing that where it existed all surrounding persons were bound to do it homage and service we were thrown together a great deal in attending on poor old sewis who would lie on his pillows recounting for hours my fathers midnight summons of the inhabitants of riversley and his little harrys infant expedition into the world temple and heriot came to stay at the grange and assisted in some rough scenepaintingtorrid colours representing the island of jamaica we hung it at the foot of old sewiss bed he awoke and contemplated it and went downstairs the same day cured he declared the fact being that the unfortunate picture testified too strongly to the reversal of all he was used to in life in having those he served to wait on him the squire celebrated his recovery by giving a servants ball sewis danced with the handsomest lass swung her to supper and delivered an extraordinary speech entirely concerning me and rather to my discomposure particularly so when it was my fate to hear that the old man had made me the heir of his savings such was his announcement in a very excited voice but incidentally upon a solemn adjuration to the squire to beware of his tempergovern his temper and not be a turncoat we were present at the head of the suppertable to hear our healths drunk sewis spoke like a halfcaste oblivious of his training and of the subjects he was at liberty to touch on as well evidently there was a weight of foreboding on his mind he knew his master well the squire excused him under the ejaculation drunk by the lord sewis went so far as to mention my father he no disgrace sar he no disgrace i say but he pull one way old house pull other way and tween em my little harry torn apieces squire he set out in the night you not enter it any more very well i go my lawyer next day you see my will squire years ago and little harry so high old sewis not the man to change he no turncoat squire god bless you my master you recollect and ladies tell you if you forget old sewis no turncoat you hate turncoat you taught old sewis and god bless you and mr harry and british constitution all amen with that he bounded to bed he was dead next morning the squire was humorous over my legacy it amounted to about seventeen hundred pounds invested in government stock and he asked me what i meant to do with it proposed a charity to be established on behalf of decayed halfcastes insisting that servants money could never be appropriated to the uses of gentlemen all the while he was muttering turncoat eh turncoatproof that the word had struck where it was aimed for me after thinking on it i had a superstitious respect for the legacy so i determined in spite of the squires laughter over sixty pounds per annum to let it rest in my name i saw for the first time the possibility that i might not have my grandfathers wealth to depend upon he warned me of growing miserly with my father in london living freely on my property i had not much fear of that however i said discreetly i dont mind spending when i see my way oh see your way said he better a niggard than a chuckfist only there s my girl she s good at accounts one ll do for them harry hant been long enough at home yet few were the occasions when our conversation did not diverge to this sort of interrogation temple and heriot with whom i took counsel advised me to wait until the idea of the princess had worn its way into his understanding and leave the work to janet though said heriot to me aside upon my soul its slaughter he believed that janet felt keenly but then she admired him and so they repaid one another i won my grandfathers confidence in practical matters on a trip we took into wales but it was not enough for me to be a man of business he affirmed he wanted me to have some ambition why not stand for our county at the next general election he offered me his welsh borough if i thought fit to decline a contest this was to speak as mightily as a german prince virtually in wealth and power he was a prince but of how queer a kind he was immensely gratified by my refraining to look out for my father on our return journey through london and remarked that i had not seen him for some time he supposed to which i said no i had not he advised me to let the fellow run his length suggesting that he held it likely i contributed to the fellows support he said generously keep clear of him hal i add you a thousand a year to your allowance and damned me for being so thoughtful over it i found myself shuddering at a breath of anger from him could he not with a word dash my hopes for ever the warning i had taken from old sewis transformed me to something like a hypocrite and i dare say i gave the squire to understand that i had not seen my father for a very long period and knew nothing of his recent doings been infernally quiet these last two or three years the squire muttered of the object of his aversion i heard of a city widow last sick as a dover packetboat bout the fellow well the women are ninnies but youre a man harry youre not to be taken in any longer eh i replied that i knew my father better now and was asked how the deuce i knew him better it was the world i knew better after my stay on the continent i contained myself enough to say very well the world sir flirted with one of their princesses he winked on that subject i will talk to you some other time said i got to pay an indemnity or what he professed alarm and pushed for explanations with the air of a man of business ready to help me if need were make a clean breast of it harry you re not the son of tom fool the bastard for nothing ill swear all the same youre beltham youre my grandson and heir and ill stand by you out with t shes a princess is she the necessity for correcting his impressions taught me to think the moment favourable i said i am engaged to her sir he returned promptly then youll break it off i shook my head why you cant jilt my girl at home said he do you find a princess objectionable sir objectionable shes a foreigner i dont know her i never saw her heres my janet ive brought up for you under my own eyes out of the way of every damned softsawderer safe and plump as a melon under a glass and you fight shy of her and go and engage yourself to a foreigner i dont know and never saw by george harry ill call in a parson to settle you soon as ever we sight riversley ill couple you by george i will fore either of you know whether youre on your legs or your backs we were in the streets of london so he was obliged to moderate his vehemence have you consulted janet said i consulted her ever since she was a chick with half a feather on a chick with half a feather on i remarked is not always of the same mind as a piece of poultry of full plumage hang your sneering and your talk of a fine girl like my janet as a piece of poultry you young rooster you toss your head up like a cock too conceited to crow i ll swear the girl s in love with you she does you the honour to be fond of you she s one in a million a handsome girl straightbacked honest just a dash and not too much of our blood in her consult her again sir i broke in you will discover she is not of your way of thinking do you mean to say shes given you a lefthander harry i have only to say that i have not given her the option he groaned going up the steps of his hotel faced me once or twice and almost gained my sympathy by observing when were boys the old ones worry us when were old ones the boys begin to tug he rarely spoke so humanelyrarely at least to me for a wonder he let the matter drop possibly because he found me temperate i tried the system on him with good effect during our stay in london that is i took upon myself to be always cool always courteous deliberate in my replies and not uncordial though i was for representing the reserved young man i obtained some praise for my style and bearing among his acquaintances to one lady passing an encomium on me he said oh some foreign princess has been training him which seemed to me of good augury my friends temple and heriot were among the riversley guests at christmas we rode over to john threshers of whom we heard that the pretty mabel sweetwinter had disappeared and understood that suspicion had fallen upon one of us gentlemen bob her brother had gone the way of the bravest english fellows of his classto america we called on the miller a soured old man bobs evasion affected him more than mabels martha thresher said in derision of our sex i was pained to hear from her that bob supposed me the misleader of his sister and that he had as she believed left england to avoid the misery of ever meeting me again because he liked me so much she had been seen walking down the lanes with some one resembling me in figure heriot took the millers view counting the loss of one stout young englishman to his country of far greater importance than the escapades of dozens of girls for which simple creatures he had no compassion he held the expression of it a sham he had grown coxcombical without talking of his conquests he talked largely of the ladies who were possibly in the situation of victims to his grace of person though he did not do so with any unctuous boasting on the contrary there was a rather taking undertone of regret that his enfeebled overfat country would give her military son no worthier occupation he laughed at the mention of julia bulsteds name she proves richie marriage is the best of all receipts for women just as its the worst for men poor billy bulsted for instance a first rate seaman and his hearts only half in his profession since he and julia swore their oath and no wonderhe made something his own that wont go under lock and key no military or naval man ought ever to marry stop said temple is the poor old country how about continuing the race of heroes heriot commended him to rectories vicarages and curates lodgings for breeding grounds and coming round to julia related one of the racy dialogues of her married life the saltwater widows delicious billy rushes home from his ship in a hurry whats this greg writes methat he s got a friend of his to drink with him d ye mean william a friend of yours maamand will you say a friend of mine is not a friend of yours williamjulia youre driving me madand is that far from crazy where you said i drove you at first sight of me william back to his ship goes billy with a song of love and constancy i said nothing of my chagrin at the behaviour of the pair who had furnished my first idea of the romantic beauty of love why does she talk twice as irish as she used to heriot just to coax the world to let her be as nonsensical as she likes shes awfully dull she has only her nonsense to amuse her i repeat soldiers and sailors oughtnt to marry im her best friend i am on my honour for i m going to make billy give up the service since he cant give her up there she is he cried out and waved his hat to a lady on horseback some way down the slope of a road leading to the view of our heathland theres the only girl living fit to marry a man and swear she ll stick to him through life and death he started at a gallop temple would have gone too at any possible speed for he knew as well as i did that janet was the girl alone capable of winning a respectful word from heriot but i detained him to talk of ottilia and my dismal prospect of persuading the squire to consent to my proposal for her and to dower her in a manner worthy a princess he doled out his yes and no to me vacantly janet and heriot came at a walking pace to meet us he questioning her she replying but a little differently from her usual habit of turning her full face to the speaker he was evidently startled and to judge from his posture repeated his question as one would say you did this she nodded and then uttered some rapid words glanced at him laughed shyly and sank her features into repose as we drew near she had a deep blush on her face i thought it might be that janet and her loud champion had come to particular terms a supposition that touched me with regrets for temples sake but heriot was not looking pleased it happened that whatever janet uttered struck a chord of opposition in me she liked the winter and the winter sunsets had hopes of a frost for skating liked our climate thought our way of keeping christmas venerable rejoiced in dispensing the squires bountiescalled them bounties joined heriot in abusing foreign countries to the exaltation of her own all this with well harry im sorry you dont think as we do and we do dont we she addressed him i reserve a point he said and not playfully she appeared distressed and courted a change of expression in his features and i have to confess that never having seen her gaze upon any one save myself in that fashion which was with her very winning especially where some of her contralto tones of remonstrance or entreaty aided it i felt as a man does at a neighbours shadow cast over his rights of property heriot dropped to the rear i was glad to leave her with temple and glad to see them canter ahead together on the sand of tie heaths she has done it heriot burst out abruptly she has done it he said again upon my soul i never wished in my life before that i was a marrying man i might have a chance of ending worth something she has won the squire round with a thundering fib and youre to have the german if you can get her dont be in a hurry the squire ll speak to you tonight but think over it will you think what a girl this is i believe on my honour no man ever had such an offer of a true woman come dont think its heriot speakingive always liked her of course but i have always respected her and thats not of course depend upon it a woman who can be a friend of men is the right sort of woman to make a match with do you suppose she couldnt have a dozen fellows round her at the lift of her finger the pick of the land id trust her with an army i tell you janet ilchester s the only girl alive wholl double the man she marries i dont know another who wouldnt make the name of wife laugh the poor devil out of house and company shes firm as a rock and sweet as a flower on it will that touch you bah richie lets talk like men i feel for her because shes fond of you and i know what it is when a girl like that sets her heart on a fellow there he concluded i d ask you to go down on your knees and pray before you decide against her heriot succeeded in raising a certain dull indistinct image in my mind of a wellmeaning girl to whom i was bound to feel thankful and felt so i thanked heriot too for his friendly intentions he had never seen the princess ottilia and at night i thanked my grandfather he bore himself on the whole like the good and kindly old gentleman janet loved to consider him he would not stand in my light he said recurring to that sheetanchor of a tolerant sentence whenever his forehead began to gather clouds he regretted that janet was no better than her sex in her preference for rakes and wished me to the deuce for bringing heriot into the house and not knowing when i was lucky german grandchildren eh he muttered no beltham had ever married a foreigner what was the time fixed between us for the marriage he wanted to see his line safe before he died how do i know this foreign womanll bear he asked expecting an answer his hand was on the back of a chair grasping and rocking it his eyes bent stormily on the carpet they were set blinking rapidly after a glance at me altogether his selfcommand was creditable to janets tuition janet met me next day saying with some insolence so it struck me from her liveliness well its all right harry now youll be happy i hope i did not shine in my reply her amiable part appeared to be to let me see how brilliant and gracious the commonplace could be made to look she kept heriot at the grange against the squires remonstrance and her mothers it s to keep him out of harms way the women he knows are not of the best kind for him she said with astounding fatuity he submitted and seemed to like it she must be teaching temple to skate figures in the frost with a great display of good humoured patience and her voice at musical pitches but her principal affectation was to talk on matters of business with mr burgin and mr trewint the squires lawyer and bailiff on mines and interest on money and economical questions not shrinking from politics either until the squire cries out to the males assisting in the performance gad she s a head as good as our halfdozen put together and they servilely joined their fragmentary capitals in agreement she went so far as to retain peterborough to teach her latin he was idling in the expectation of a living in the squires gift the annoyance for me was that i could not detach myself from a contemplation of these various scenes by reverting to my life in germany the preposterous closing of my interview with ottilia blocked the way and i was unable to write to herunable to address her even in imagination without pangs of shame at the review of the petty conspiracy i had sanctioned to entrap her to plight her hand to me and without perpetually multiplying excuses for my conduct so to escape them i was reduced to study janet forming one of her satellites she could say to me impudently with all the air of a friendly comrade had your letter from germany yet harry she flewshe was always on the chase i saw her permit heriot to kiss her hand and then the squire appeared and heriot and she burst into laughter and the squire with a puzzled face would have the game explained to him but understood not a bit of it only growled at me upon which janet became serious and chid him i was told by my aunt dorothy to admire this behaviour of hers one day she certainly did me a service a paragraph in one of the newspapers spoke of my father not flatteringly richmond is in the field again it commenced the squire was waiting for her to hand the paper to him none of us could comprehend why she played him off and denied him his right to the first perusal of the news she was voluble almost witty full of sprightly roxalana petulance this paper she said deserves to be burnt and she was allowed to burn itmoney article mining column as wellon the pretext of an infamous antitory leader of which she herself composed the first sentence to shock the squire completely i had sight of that paper some time afterwards richmond was in the field again it stated with mock flourishes but that was not the worst my grandfathers name was down there and mine and princess ottilias my fathers connection with the court of eppenwelzensarkeld was alluded to as the latest and next to his winning the heiress of riversley the most successful of his ventures inasmuch as his son if rumour was to be trusted had obtained the promise of the hand of the princess the paragraph was an excerpt from a gossiping weekly journal perhaps less malevolent than i thought it there was some fun to be got out of a man who the journal in question was informed had joined the arms of england and a petty german principality stamped on his plate and furniture my gratitude to janet was fervent enough when i saw what she had saved me from i pressed her hand and held it i talked stupidly but i made my cruel position intelligible to her and she had the delicacy on this occasion to keep her sentiments regarding my father unuttered we sat hardly less than an hour side by sidei know not how long hand in hand the end was an extraordinary trembling in the limb abandoned to me it seized her frame i would have detained her but it was plain she suffered both in her heart and her pride her voice was under fair commandmore than mine was she counselled me to go to london at once i would be off to london if i were you harryfor the purpose of checking my fathers extravaganceswould have been the further wording which she spared me and i thanked her wishing at the same time that she would get the habit of using choicer phrases whenever there might by chance be a stress of emotion between us her trembling and her id be off came into unpleasant collision in the recollection i acknowledge to myself that she was a true and hearty friend she listened with interest to my discourse on the necessity of my being in parliament before i could venture to propose formally for the hand of the princess and undertook to bear the burden of all consequent negotiations with my grandfather if she would but have allowed me to speak of temple instead of saying dont harry i like him so much at the very mention of his name i should have sincerely felt my indebtedness to her and some admiration of her fine spirit and figure besides i could not even agree with my aunt dorothy that janet was handsome when i had to grant her a pardon i appreciated her better chapter xxxviii my bankers book the squire again did honour to janets eulogy and good management of him and where said she would you find a radical to behave so generously harry when it touches him so he accorded me his permission to select my side in politics merely insisting that i was never to change it and this he requested me to swear to for he called the ghost of old sewis to witness he abhorred a turncoat if youre to be a whig or a sneaking halfandhalf i cant help you much he remarked i can pop a young tory in for my borough maybe but i cant insult a number of independent englishmen by asking them to vote for the opposite crew thats reasonable eh and i cant promise you plumpers for the county neither you can date your address from riversley youll have your house in town tell me this princess of yours is ready with her hand and he threw in roughly is a respectable young woman ill commence building youll have a house fit for a prince in town and country both temple had produced an effect on him by informing him that this princess of mine was entitled to be considered a fit and proper person in rank and blood for an alliance with the proudest royal houses of europe and my grandfather was not quite destitute of consolation in the prospect i presented to him he was a curious study to me of the tory mind in its attachment to solidity fixity certainty its unmatched generosity within a limit its devotion to the family and its family eye for the country an immediate introduction to ottilia would have won him to enjoy the idea of his grandsons marriage but not having seen her he could not realize her dignity nor even the womanliness of a foreign woman thank god for one thing he said we shant have that fellow botheringshant have the other half of your family messing the business youll have to account for him to your wife as you best can i ve nothing to do with him mind that he came to my house stole my daughter crazed her wits dragged us all the excuse to turn away from the hearing of abuse of my father was too good to be neglected though it was horribly humiliating that i should have to take advantage of itvexatious that i should seem chargeable with tacit lying in allowing the squire to suppose the man he hated to be a stranger to the princess not feeling sure whether it might be common prudence to delude him even passively i thought of asking janet for her opinion but refrained a stout deceiver has his merits but a feeble hypocrite applying to friends to fortify him in his shifts and tergiversations must provoke contempt i desired that janet might continue to think well of me i was beginning to drop in my own esteem which was the mirror of my conception of ottilias view of her lover now had i consulted janet i believe the course of my history would have been different for she would not then i may imagine have been guilty of her fatal slip of the tongue that threw us into heavy seas when we thought ourselves floating on canal waters a canal barge an image to me of the most perfect attainable peace suddenly on its passage through our long firwoods with their scented reeds and flowing rushes wild balsam and silky cottongrass beds sluiced out to sea and storm would be somewhat in my likeness soon after a single luckless observation had passed at our riversley breakfasttable one sunday morning my aunt dorothy and mr peterborough were conversing upon the varieties of christian sects and particularly such as approached nearest to anglicanism together with the strange saddening fact that the christian religion appeared to be more divided than peterborough regretted to say the forms of idolatry established by the buddha mahomet and other impostors he claimed the audacious merit for us that we did not discard the reason of man we admitted mans finite reason to our school of faith and it was found refractory hence our many divisions the roman catholics admit reason said janet who had too strong a turn for showing her keenness in little encounters with peterborough no said he the protestants and anxious to elude her he pressed on to enchain my aunt dorothys attention janet plagued him meanwhile and i helped her we ran him and his schoolboy the finite refractory up and down until peterborough was glad to abandon him and janet said did you preach to the germans much he had officiated in prince ernests private chapel not he added in his egregious modesty not that he personally wished to officiate it was harrys wish janet said smiling my post of tutor peterborough hastened to explain was almost entirely supernumerary the circumstances being so i the more readily acquiesced in the title of private chaplain prepared to fulfil such duties as devolved upon me in that capacity and acting thereon i proffered my occasional services lutheranism and anglicanism are not doubtless you are aware divided on the broader bases we are common protestants the papacy i can assure you finds as little favour with one as with the other yes i held forth as you would say from time to time my assumption of the title of private chaplain it was thought improved the family dignitythat is on our side thought by harry said janet and my aunt dorothy said you and harry had a consultation about it wanted to appear as grand as they could quoth the squire peterborough signified an assent designed to modify the implication not beyond due bounds i trust sir oh now i understand janet broke out in the falsetto notes of a puzzle solved in the mind it was his father harry proclaiming his private chaplain mr harrys father did first suggest said peterborough but her quicklyaltered features caused him to draw in his breath as she had done after one short laugh my grandfather turned a round sideeye on me hard as a cocks janet immediately started topics to fill peterboroughs mouth the weather the walk to church the probable preacher and grandada said she to the squire who was muttering ominously with a grim under jaw his private chaplain and for this once would not hear her grandada i shall drive you over to see papa this afternoon she talked as if nothing had gone wrong peterborough criminal red attacked a jampot for a diversion such sweets are rare indeed on the continent he observed to my aunt dorothy our homemade dainties are matchless private chaplain the squire growled again its you that preach this afternoon janet said to peterborough do you give us an extempore sermon you remind me miss ilchester i must look to it i have a little trimming to do peterborough thought he might escape but the squire arrested him youll give me five minutes before youre out of the house please d ye smoke on sundays not on sundays sir said peterborough openly and cordially as to signify that they were of one mind regarding the perniciousness of sunday smoking see you dont set fire to my ricks with your foreign chaplains tricks i spied you puffing behind one t other day there the squire dispersed peterboroughs unnecessary air of abstruse recollection dont look as though you were trying to hit on a pins head in a bushel of oats dont set my ricks on firethat s all mr peterborough my aunt dorothy interposed her voice to soften this rough treatment of him with the offer of some hothouse flowers for his sittingroom oh i thank you i heard the garlanded victim lowing as i left him to the squires mercy janet followed me out it was my fault harry you wont blame him i know but will he fib i dont think hes capable of it and im sure he cant run and double grandada will have him fast before a minute is over i told her to lose no time in going and extracting the squires promise that peterborough should have his livingso much it seemed possible to save she flew back and in peterboroughs momentary absence did her work nothing could save the unhappy gentleman from a distracting scene and much archaic english the squires power of vituperation was notorious he could be more than a match for roadside navvies and predatory tramps in cogency of epithet peterborough came to me drenched and wailing that he had never heard such languagenever dreamed of it and to find himself the object of itand worse to be unable to conscientiously defend himself the pain to him was in the consciencewhich is like the spleen a function whose uses are only to be understood in its derangement he had eased his conscience to every question right out and he rejoiced to me at the immense relief it gave him conscientiously he could not deny that he knew the squires objection to my being in my fathers society and he had connived at it for reasons my dearest harry i can justify to god and man but noti had to confess as much not i grieve to say to your grandfather i attempted to do justice to the amiable qualities of the absent in a moment i was assailed with epithets that and not a word is to be got in when he is so violent one has to make up ones mind to act andromeda and let him be the seamonster as somebody has said i forget the exact origin of the remark the squire certainly had a whole ocean at command i strung myself to pass through the same performance to my astonishment i went unchallenged janet vehemently asserted that she had mollified the angry old man who however was dark of visage though his tongue kept silence he was gruff over his wineglass the blandishments of his favourite did not brighten him from his point of view he had been treated vilely and he was apparently inclined to nurse his rancour and keep my fortunes trembling in the balance under these circumstances it was impossible for me to despatch a letter to ottilia though i found that i could write one now and i sat in my room writing all daymost eloquent stuff it was the shadow of misfortune restored the sense of my heroical situation which my father had extinguished and this unlocked the powers of speech i wrote so admirably that my wretchedness could enjoy the fine millinery i decorated it in then to tear the noble composition to pieces was a bitter gratification ottilias station repelled and attracted me mysteriously i could not separate her from it nor keep my love of her from the contentions into which it threw me in vain i raved what is rank there was a magnet in it that could at least set me quivering and twisting behaving like a man spellbound as madly as any hero of the ballads under a wizards charm at last the squire relieved us he fixed that sidecast cocks eye of his on me and said where s your bankers book sir i presumed that it was with my bankers but did not suggest the possibility that my father might have it in his custody for he had a chequebook of his own and regulated our accounts why not i thought and flushed somewhat defiantly the money was mine any objection to my seeing that book said the squire none whatever sir he nodded i made it a point of honour to write for the book to be sent down to me immediately the book arrived and the squire handed it to me to break the cover insisting youre sure you wouldnt rather not have me look at it quite i replied the question of money was to me perfectly unimportant i did not see a glimpse of danger in his perusing the list of my expenses cause i give you my word i know nothing about it now he said i complimented him on his frank method of dealing and told him to look at the book if he pleased but with prudence sufficiently awake to check the declaration that i had not once looked at it myself he opened it we had just assembled in the hall where breakfast was laid during winter before a huge wood fire janet had her teeth on her lower lip watching the old mans face i did not condescend to be curious but when i turned my head to him he was puffing through thin lips and then his mouth crumpled in a knob he had seen sights by george i must have breakfast fore i go into this he exclaimed and stared as if he had come out of an oven dorothy beltham reminded him that prayers had not been read prayers he was about to objurgate but affirmatived her motion to ring the bell for the servants and addressed peterborough you read em abroad every morning peterboroughs conscience started off on its inevitable jogtrot at a touch of the whip ayes that isoh it was my office he had to recollect with exactitude i should specify exceptions there were intervals please open your bible the squire cut him short i dont want a damned fine edge on everything partly for an admonition to him or in pure nervousness peterborough blew his nose monstrously an unlucky note nothing went well after it a slight cold he murmured and resumed the note and threw himself maniacally into it the unexpected figure of captain bulsted on tiptoe wearing the ceremonial depressed air of intruders on these occasions distracted our attention for a moment fresh from ship william the squire called out the captain ejaculated a big word to judge of it from the aperture but it was mute as his footing on the carpet and he sat and gazed devoutly toward peterborough who had waited to see him take his seat and must now in his hurry to perform his duty sweep the peccant little redbound book to the floor here ill have that said the squire allow me sir said peterborough and they sprang into a collision would you jump out of your pulpit to pick up an old womans umbrella the squire asked him in wrath and muttered of requiring none of his clerical legerdemain with books of business tears were in peterboroughs eyes my aunt dorothys eyes dwelt kindly on him to encourage him but the mans irritable nose was again his enemy captain bulsted chanced to say in the musical voice of inquiry prayers are not yet over are they no nor never will be with a parson blowing his horn at this rate the squire rejoined and mind you he said to peterborough after dismissing the servants to whom my aunt dorothy read the morning lessons apart id not have had this happen sir for money in lumps ive always known i should hang the day when my house wasnt blessed in the morning by prayer so did my father and his before him fiddle sir you cant expect young people to wear decent faces when the parsons hopping over the floor like a flea and trumpeting as if the organpipe wouldnt have the sermon at any price you tried to juggle me out of this book here on myindeed sir no peterborough proclaimed his innocence and it was unlikely that the squire should have suspected him captain bulsted had come to us for his wife whom he had not found at home on his arrival last midnight god bless my soul said the squire you dont mean to tell me shes gone off william oh dear no sir said the captain shes only cruising the squire recommended a draught of old ale the captain accepted it his comportment was cheerful in a sober fashion notwithstanding the transparent perturbation of his spirit he answered my aunt dorothys questions relating to julia simply and manfully as became a gallant seaman cordially excusing his wife for not having been at home to welcome him with the singular plea based on his knowledge of the sex that the nearer she knew him to be the less able was she to sit on her chair waiting like patience he drank his ale from the hands of sillabin our impassive new butler who had succeeded sewis the squire told him like a whig ministry the tory proof that things were not improving i thought sir things were getting better said the captain the damnedest mistake ever made william how about the fall of man then eh you talk like a heathen radical its scripture says were going from better to worse and thats tory doctrine and stick to the good as long as you can why william you were a jolly bachelor once sir and maam the captain bowed to dorothy beltham i have thanks to you never known happiness but in marriage and all i want is my wife the squire fretted for janet to depart i m going grandada she said youll oblige me by not attending to any matter of business today give me that book of harrys to keep for you how d ye mean my dear it s bad work done on a sunday you know so it is ill lock up the book i have your word for that grandada said janet the ladies retired taking peterborough with them goodbye to the frocks and now william out with your troubles said the squire the captains eyes were turned to the door my aunt dorothy had passed through you remember the old custom sir ay do i william sorry for you then infernally sorry for you now that i am but youve run your head into the halter i love her sir i love her to distraction let any man on earth say shes not an angel i flatten him dead as his lie by the way sir i am bound in duty to inform you i am speaking of my wife to be sure you are william and a trim schooneryacht she is she s off sir shes off i thought it time to throw in a word captain bulsted i should hold any man but you accountable to me for hinting such things of my friend harry your hand he cried sparkling hum his hand growled the squire his hands been pretty lively on the continent william here look at this book william and the bundle o cheques no i promised my girl well go into it tomorrow he and i early the fellow has shot away thousands and thousandsbeen gallivanting among his foreign duchesses and countesses there s a petticoat in that bankbook of his and more than one i wager now hes for marrying a foreign princessgot himself in a tangle there it seems mightily well done harry captain bulsted struck a terrific encomium on my shoulder groaning may she be true to you my lad the squire asked him if he was going to church that morning i go to my post sir by my fireside the captain replied nor could he be induced to leave his post vacant by the squires promise to him of a sermon that would pickle his temper for a whole weeks wear and tear he regretted extremely that he could not enjoy so excellent a trial of his patience but he felt himself bound to go to his post and wait i walked over to bulsted with him and heard on the way that it was heriot who had called for her and driven her off the man had been i supposed captain bulsted said deputed by some of you to fetch her over to riversley my servants mentioned his name i thought it adviseable not to trouble the ladies with it today he meditated i hoped i should find her at the grange in the morning harry i slept on it rather than startle the poor lamb in the night i offered him to accompany him at once to heriots quarters what and let my wife know i doubted her fidelity my girl shall never accuse me of that as it turned out julia had been taken by heriot on a visit to lady maria higginson the wife of the intrusive millionaire who particularly desired to know her more intimately thoughtless julia accepting the impudent invitation without scruple had allowed herself to be driven away without stating the place of her destination she and heriot were in the higginsons pew at church hearing from janet of her husbands arrival she rushed home and there instead of having to beg forgiveness was summoned to grant pardon captain bulsted had drawn largely on squire gregorys cellar to assist him in keeping his post the pair appeared before us fondling ineffably next day neither one of them capable of seeing that our domestic peace at the grange was unseated we re the two wretchedest creatures alive havent any of ye to spare a bit of sympathy for us julia began we re like on a pitchfork theres williams duty to his country and there s his affection for me and they wont go together because government which is that horrid admiralty fears pitching and tossing for postcaptains wives and william away i m distracted and the admiraltys hairs on end if he stops and deed miss beltham im not more than married to just half a husband the captain echoed her half but happy enough for twenty whole ones if youll be satisfied my duck julia piteously entreated me for my future wifes sake not to take service under government as for the admiralty she said it had no characteristic but the abominable one that it hated a woman the squire laid two or three moderately coarse traps for the voluble frank creature which she evaded with surprising neatness showing herself more awake than one would have imagined her janet and i fancied she must have come with the intention to act uxorious husband and irish wife for the distinct purpose of diverting the squires wrath from me for he greatly delighted in the sight of merry wedded pairs but they were as simple as possible in their display of happiness it chanced that they came opportunely my bankers book had been the theme all the morning and an astonishing one to me equally with my grandfather since our arrival in england my father had drawn nine thousand pounds the sums expended during our absence on the continent reached the perplexing figures of fortyeight thousand i knew it too likely besides that all debts were not paid selfselfself drew for thousands at a time sometimes as the squires convulsive forefinger indicated for many thousands within a week it was incomprehensible to him until i driven at bay by questions and insults and perceiving that concealment could not long be practised made a virtue of the situation by telling him what he in fact must have seen that my father possessed a chequebook as well as i and likewise drew upon the account we had required the money it was mine and i had sold out bank stock and consolswhich gave very poor interest i remarked cursorilyand had kept the money at my bankers to draw upon according to our necessities i pitied the old man while speaking his face was livid language died from his lips he asked to have little things explained to himthe two chequebooks for instanceand what i thought of doing when this money was all gone for he supposed i did not expect the same amount to hand every two years unless he added i had given him no more than a couple of years lease of life when i started for my tour then the moneys gone he summed up and this was the signal for redemanding explanations had he not treated me fairly and frankly in handing over my own to me on the day of my majority yes and like a fool you thinkeh i have no such thought in my head sir you have been keeping that fellow in his profligacy and you re keeping him now why you re all but a beggar comes to my house talks of his birth carries off my daughter makes her mad lets her child grow up to lay hold of her money and then grips him fast and pecks him fleeces him you re beggaredd ye know that hes had the two years of you and sucked you dry what were you about what were you doing did you have your head on you shared chequebooks good the devil in hell never found such a fool as you you had your house full of your foreign bonyroberseh out with it how did you pass your time drunk and dancing by such degrees my grandfather worked himself up to the pitch for his style of eloquence i have given a faint specimen of it when i took the liberty to consider that i had heard enough he followed me out of the library into the hall where janet stood in her presence he charged the princess and her family with being a pack of greedy adventurers conspirators with that fellow to plunder me and for a proof of it he quoted my words that my fathers time had been spent in superintending the opening of a coalmine on prince ernests estate that fellow pretending to manage a coalmine could not a girl see it was a shuffle to hoodwink a greenhorn and now he remembered it was colonel goodwin and his daughter who had told him of having seen the fellow engaged in playing courtbuffoon to a petty german prince and performing his antics cutting capers like a clown at a fair shame said janet hear her the squire turned to me but she cried oh grandada hear yourself or dont be silent if harry has offended you speak like one gentleman to another dont rob me of my love for you i havent much besides that no because of a scoundrel and his young idiot janet frowned in earnest and said i dont permit you to change the meaning of the words i speak he muttered a proverb of the stables reduced to behave temperately he began the whole history of my bankers book anewthe same queries the same explosions and imprecations come for a walk with me dear harry said janet i declined to be protected in such a manner absurdly on my dignity and the refusal together possibly with some air of contemptuous independence in the tone of it brought the squire to a climax you wont go out and walk with her you shall go down on your knees to her and beg her to give you her arm for a walk by god you shall now here on the spot or off you go to your german princess with your butlers legacy and nothing more from me but goodbye and the door bolted now down with you he expected me to descend and if he did he would never have my arm janets eyes glittered hard on the squire before that rascal dies my dear he shall whine like a beggar out in the cold for the tips of your fingers not if he asks me first said janet this set him off again he realized her prospective generosity and contrasted it with my actual obtuseness janet changed her tactics she assumed indifference but she wanted experience and a heriot to help her in playing a part she did it badlyoverdid it so that the old man now imagining both of us to be against his scheme for uniting us counted my iniquity as twofold her phrase harry and i will always be friends roused the loudest of his denunciations upon me as though there never had been question of the princess so inveterate was his minds grasp of its original designs friends would our being friends give him heirs by law to his estate and name and so forth my aunt dorothy came to moderate his invectives in her room the heavily burdened little book of figures was produced and the items read aloud and her task was to hear them without astonishment but with a business like desire to comprehend them accurately a method that softened the squires outbursts by degrees she threw out hasty running commentaries yes that was for a yacht and they were living at the court of a prince such and such a sum was large but harry knew his grandfather did not wish him to make a poor appearance why do you mean to swear to me on your oath dorothy beltham said the squire amazed at the small amazement he created you think these two fellows have been spending within the right margin whatll be womens ideas next no she answered demurely i think harry has been extravagant and has had his lesson and surely it is better now than later but you are not making allowances for his situation as the betrothed of a princess that s what turns your head said he and she allowed him to have the notion and sneer at herself and her sex how about this money drawn since he came home the squire persisted my aunt dorothy reddened he struck his finger on the line marking the sum repeating his demand and at this moment captain bulsted and julia arrived the ladies manoeuvred so that the captain and the squire were left alone together some time afterward the captain sent out word that he begged his wifes permission to stay to dinner at the grange and requested me to favour him by conducting his wife to bulsted proof as julia said that the two were engaged in a pretty hot tussle she was sure her william would not be the one to be beaten i led her away rather depressed by the automaton performance assigned to me from which condition i awoke with a touch of horror to find myself paying her very warm compliments for she had been coquettish and charming to cheer me and her voice was sweet we reached a point in our conversation i know not where but i must have spoken with some warmth then guess said she what william is suffering for your sake now harry that is suffering in remaining away from me on your account and thus in an instant with a skill so intuitive as to be almost unconscious she twirled me round to a right sense of my position and set me reflecting whether a love that clad me in such imperfect armour as to leave me penetrable to these feminine gracesa plump figure swinging skirts dewy dark eyelids laughing red lipscould indeed be absolute love and if it was not love of the immortal kind what was i i looked back on the thought like the ship on its furrow through the waters and saw every mortal perplexity and death under my love of ottilia delusion then life was delusion i contemplated julia in alarm somewhat in the light fair witches were looked on when the faggots were piled for them the sense of her unholy attractions abased and mortified me and it set me thinking on the strangeness of my disregard of mdlle jenny chassediane when in germany who was far sprightlier if not prettier and as i remembered had done me the favour to make discreet play with her eyelids in our encounters and long eyes in passing i caught myself regretting my coldness of that period for which regrets i could have swung the scourge upon my miserable flesh ottilias features seemed dying out of my mind poor darling harry julia sighed and d ye know the sight of a young man far gone in love gives me the trembles i rallied her concerning the ladder scene in my old schooldays and the tender things she had uttered to heriot she answered oh i think i got them out of poets and chapters about lovemaking or i felt it very much and thats what i miss in william he cant talk soft nice nonsense i believe him he would if he could but he s like a lion of the desertit s a roar i rejoiced when we heard the roar captain bulsted returned to take command of his ship not sooner than i wanted him and told us of a fierce tussle with the squire he had stuck to him all day and up to pm by george harry he had to make humble excuses to dodge out of eyeshot a minute conquered him over the fourth bottle and now alls right hell see your dad in a barn says the squire here s to your better health sir i bowed to him gentlemen dont meet in barns none but mice and traps make appointments there to shorten my story my lad i have arranged for the squire and your excellent progenitor to meet at bulsted we may end by bringing them over a bottle of old gregs best see the boys father i kept on insisting the point is that this confounded book must be off your shoulders my lad a dirty dog may wash in a duckpond you see harry the dear old squire may set up your account twenty times over but he has a right to know how you twirl the coin he says you dont supply the information i suggest to him that your father can and will so we get them into a room together ill be answerable for the rest and now top your boom and to bed here off in the morning and tug the big vessel into port here and harry three cheers and another bottle to crown the victory if you re the man for it julia interposed a decided negative to the proposal an ordinarily unlucky thing to do with bibulous husbands and the captain looked uncomfortably checked but when he seemed to be collecting to assert himself the humour of her remark now no bravado william disarmed him bravado my sweet chuck wont another bottle be like flashing your sword after youve won the day said she he slung his arm round her and sent a tremendous whisper into my ear a perfect angel i started for london next day more troubled aesthetically regarding the effect produced on me by this order of perfect angels than practically anxious about material affairs though it is true that when i came into proximity with my father the thought of his all but purely mechanical power of making money spin fly and vanish like sparks from a fire engine awakened a serious disposition in me to bring our monetary partnership to some definite settlement he was living in
