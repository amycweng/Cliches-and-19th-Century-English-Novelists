pass a delightful evening and i have a morning vision xix our return homeward xx news of a fresh conquest of my fathers xxi a promenade in bath xxii conclusion of the bath episode chapter xv we are accosted by a beautiful little lady in the forest bowls of hot coffee and milk with white rolls of bread to dip in them refreshed us at a forest inn for some minutes after the meal temple and i talked like interchangeing puffs of steam but soon subsided to our staring fit the pipes were lit again what we heard sounded like a language of the rocks and caves and roots plucked up a language of gluttons feasting the word ja was like a door always on the hinge in every mouth dumpy children bulky men compressed old women with baked faces and comical squat dogs kept the villages partly alive we observed one young urchin sitting on a stone opposite a dog and he and the dog took alternate bites off a plattershaped cake big enough to require both his hands to hold it whether the dog ever snapped more than his share was matter of speculation to us it was an education for him in good manners and when we were sitting at dinner we wished our companions had enjoyed it they fed with their heads in their plates splashed and clattered jaws without paying us any hospitable attention whatever so that we had the dish of lazarus they were perfectly kind notwithstanding and allowed a portion of my great map of germany to lie spread over their knees in the diligence whilst temple and i pored along the lines of the rivers one would thrust his squarenailed finger to the name of a city and pronounce it one gave us lessons in the expression of the vowels with the softening of three of them which seemed like a regulation drill movement for taking an egg into the mouth and showing repentance of the act sarkeld we exclaimed mutually and they made a galloping motion of their hands pointing beyond the hills sarkeld was to the right sarkeld to the left as the road wound on sarkeld was straight in front of us when the conductor according to directions he had received requested us to alight and push through this endless firforest up a hilly branch road and away his hand galloped beyond it coming to a deep place and then to grapes then to a tiptoe station and under it lay sarkeld the pantomime was not bad we waved our hand to the diligence and set out cheerfully with our bags at our backs entering a gorge in the fircovered hills before sunset after starting the propositiondoes the sun himself look foreign in a foreign country yes he does said temple and so i thought but denied it for by the suns favour i hoped to see my father that night and hail apollo joyfully in the morning a hope that grew with exercise of my limbs beautiful cascades of dark bright water leaped down the gorge we chased an invisible animal suddenly one of us exclaimed we re in a german forest and we remembered grim tales of these forests their awful castles barons knights ladies longbearded dwarfs gnomes and thin people i commenced a legend offhand no no said temple as if curdling lets call this place the mouth of hades greek things dont make you feel funny i laughed louder than was necessary and remarked that i never had cared so much for greek as on board captain welshs vessel its because he was all on the opposite tack i went on quoting said temple i used to read with my father in the holidays and your rev simon has kept you up to the mark so it was all fair it s not on our consciences that we crammed the captain about our knowledge no im glad of it said i temple pursued whatever happens to a fellow he can meet anything so long as he can sayi ve behaved like a man of honour and those german talesthey only upset you you dont see the reason of the thing why is a man to be haunted half his life well suppose he did commit a murder but if he didnt cant he walk through an old castle without meeting ghosts or a forest the dusky scenery of a strange land was influencing temple it affected me so i made the worst of it for a cure fancy those pines saying there go two more temple well and fancy thisa little earthdwarf as broad as im long and high as my shoulder one day he met the loveliest girl in the whole country and she promised to marry him in twenty years time in return for a sack of jewels worth all germany and half england you should have seen her dragging it home people thought it full of charcoal she married the man she loved and the twenty years passed over and at the stroke of the hour when she first met the dwarf thousands of bells began ringing through the forest and her husband cries out what is the meaning of it and they rode up to a garland of fresh flowers that dropped on her head and right into a gold ring that closed on her finger andlook temple look where asked the dear little fellow looking in all earnest from which the gloom of the place may be imagined for by suddenly mixing it with my absurd story i discomposed his air of sovereign indifference as much as one does the surface of a lake by casting a stone in it we rounded the rocky corner of the gorge at a slightly accelerated pace in dead silence it opened out to restorative daylight and we breathed better and chaffed one another and beholding a house with pendent gold grapes applauded the diligence conductors expressive pantomime the opportunity was offered for a draught of wine but we held water preferable so we toasted the priscilla out of the palms of our hands in draughts of water from a rill that had the sound of aspenleaves such as i used to listen to in the riversley meadows pleasantly familiar several commanding elevations were in sight some wooded some bare we chose the nearest to observe the sunset and concurred in thinking it unlike english sunsets though not so very unlike the sunset we had taken for sunrise on board the priscilla a tumbled dark and light green country of swelling forestland and slopes of meadow ran to the west and the west from flaming yellow burned down to smoky crimson across it temple bademe catch the discthat was english enough a glance at the suns disc confirmed the truth of his observation gazing on the outline of the orb one might have fancied oneself in england yet the moment it had sunk under the hill this feeling of ours vanished with it the coloured clouds drew me ages away from the recollection of home a tower on a distant hill white among pines led us to suppose that sarkeld must lie somewhere beneath it we therefore descended straight toward the tower instead of returning to the road and struck confidently into a rugged path recent events had given me the assurance that in my search for my father i was subject to a special governing direction i had aimed at the benchmissed itbeen shipped across sea and precipitated into the arms of friends who had seen him and could tell me i was on his actual track only blindly and no longer blindly now follow the path i said when temple wanted to have a consultation so we did in the london fog said he with some gloom but my retort hasnt it brought us here was a silencer dark night came on every height stood for a ruin in our eyes every dip an abyss it grew bewilderingly dark but the path did not forsake us and we expected at halfhour intervals to perceive the lights of sarkeld soon to be thundering at one of the inns for admission and supper i could hear temple rehearsing his german vocabulary brod butter wasser fleisch bett as we stumbled along then it fell to brod wasser bett and then bett by itself his confession of fatigue our path had frequently the nature of a waterway and was very fatiguing more agreeable to mount than descend for in mounting the knees and shins bore the brunt of it and these sufferers are not such important servants of the footfarer as toes and ankles in danger of tripping and being turned i was walking on leveller ground my head bent and eyes halfshut when a flash of light in a brook at my feet caused me to look aloft the tower we had marked after sunset was close above us shining in a light of torches we adopted the sensible explanation of this mysterious sight but were rather in the grip of the superstitious absurd one until we discerned a number of reddened men robbers exclaimed one of us our common thought was no robbers would never meet on a height in that manner and we were emboldened to mount and request their help fronting the tower which was of white marble a high tent had been pitched on a green platform semicircled by pines torches were stuck in clefts of the trees or in the fork of the branches or held by boys and men and there were clearly men at work beneath the tent at a busy rate we could hear the paviours breath escape from them outside the ring of torchbearers and others was a long cart with a dozen horses harnessed to it all the men appeared occupied too much for chatter and laughter what could be underneath the tent seeing a boy occasionally lift one of the flapping corners we took licence from his example to appease our curiosity it was the statue of a bronze horse rearing spiritedly the workmen were engaged fixing its pedestal in the earth our curiosity being satisfied we held debate upon our immediate prospects the difficulty of making sure of a bed when you are once detached from your home was the philosophical reflection we arrived at for nothing practical presented itself to arm ourselves we pulled out miss goodwins paper gasthof is the word cried temple gasthof zimmer bett that means inn hot supper and bed well ask we asked several of the men those in motion shot a stare at us the torchbearers pointed at the tent and at an unseen height muttering morgen referring to miss goodwins paper we discovered this to signify the unintelligible word morning which was no answer at all but the men apparently deeming our conduct suspicious gave us to understand by rather menacing gestures that we were not wanted there so we passed into the dusk of the trees angry at their incivility had it been summer we should have dropped and slept the night air of a sharp season obliged us to keep active yet we were not willing to get far away from the torches but after a time they were hidden then we saw one moving ahead the holder of it proved to be a workman of the gang and between us and him the strangest parley ensued he repeated the word morgen and we insisted on zimmer and bett he takes us for twin caspar hausers sighed temple nein said the man and perhaps enlightened by hearing a foreign tongue beckoned for us to step at his heels his lodging was a woodmans hut he offered us bread to eat milk to drink and straw to lie on we desired nothing more and were happy though the bread was black the milk sour the straw mouldy our breakfast was like a continuation of supper but two little girls of our host whose heads were cased in tightfitting dirty linen caps munched the black bread and drank the sour milk so thankfully while fixing solemn eyes of wonder upon us that to assure them we were the same sort of creature as themselves we pretended to relish the stuff rather to our amazement we did relish it mutter i said to them they pointed to the room overhead temple laid his cheek on his hand one of the little girls laid hers on the table i said doctor they nodded and answered princess which seemed perfectly good english and sent our conjectures as to the state of their mothers health astray i shut a silver english coin in one of their fat little hands we now with the name sarkeld craved of their father a direction to that place at the door of his but he waved his hand carelessly south for sarkeld and vigorously west where the tower stood then swept both hands up to the tower bellowed a fire of cannon waved his hat and stamped and cheered temple glancing the way of the tower performed on a trumpet of his joined fists to show we understood that prodigious attractions were presented by the tower we said ja and ja and nevertheless turned into the sarkeld path some minutes later the sound of hoofs led us to imagine he had despatched a messenger after us a little lady on a pony attended by a tawnyfaced great squareshouldered groom on a tall horse rode past drew up on one side and awaited our coming she was dressed in a grey ridinghabit and a warm winterjacket of gleaming grey fur a soft white boa loose round her neck crossed at her waist white gauntlets and a pretty black felt hat with flowing rim and plume there she passed as under review it was a curious scene the ironfaced greatsized groom on his bony black charger dead still his mistress a girl of about eleven or twelve or thirteen with an arm bowed at her side whip and reins in one hand and slips of golden brown hair straying on her flushed cheek rocks and trees high silver firs rising behind her and a slender water that fell from the rocks running at her ponys feet halfadozen yards were between the chargers head and the ponys flanks she waited for us to march by without attempting to conceal that we were the objects of her inspection and we in good easy swing of the feet gave her a look as we lifted our hats that look was to me like a net thrown into moonlighted water it brought nothing back but broken lights of a miraculous beauty burning to catch an excuse for another look over my shoulder i heard her voice young english gentlemen we turned sharp round it was she without a doubt who had addressed us she spurred her pony to meet us stopped him and said with the sweetest painful attempt at accuracy in pronouncing a foreign tongue i sthink you go a wrong way our hats flew off again and bareheaded i seized the reply before temple could speak is not this may i ask you the way to sarkeld she gathered up her knowledge of english deliberately yes one goes to sarkeld by sthis way here but today goes everybody up to our bella vista and i entreat you do not miss it for it is somes thing to write to your home of up at the tower then oh we were there last night and saw the bronze horse mademoiselle yes i know i called on my poor sick woman in a but where you fell asleep sirs her little ones are my lambs she has been of our household she is good and they said two young strange small gentlemen have gone for sarkeld and i supposed sthey cannot know all go to our bella vista today you knew at once we were english mademoiselle yes i could read it off your backs and truly too your english eyes are quite open at a glance it is of you both i speak if i but make my words plain my th i cannot always and to understand your english is indeed heavy speech not so in books i have my english governess we read english tales english poetryand sthat is your excellence and so will you not come sirs up when a way is to be shown to you it is my question temple thanked her for the kindness of the offer i was hesitating half conscious of surprise that i should ever be hesitating in doubt of taking the direction toward my father hearing temples boldness i thanked her also and accepted then she said bowing i beg you will cover your heads we passed the huge groom bolt upright on his towering horse he raised two fingers to the level of his eyebrows in the form of a salute temple murmured i shouldnt mind entering the german army just as after our interview with captain bulsted he had wished to enter the british navy this was no more than a sign that he was highly pleased for my part delight fluttered the words in my mouth so that i had to repeat half i uttered to the attentive ears of our gracious new friend and guide ah she said one does sthink one knows almost all before experiment i am ashamed yet i will talk for is it not so experiment is a school and you if you please will speak slow for i say of you english gentlemen silk you spin from your lips it is not as a language of an alphabet it is pleasant to hear when one would lull but italian can do that and do it moream i right soft bella vista lovely view said i lovely view she repeated she ran on in the most musical tongue to my thinking ever heard and see my little pensioners poor cottage who are out up to lovely view miles round go the people to it good and i will tell you strangers sthe prince von eppenwelzen had his great ancestor and his sister markgrafin von rippau said erect a statue of him for he was a great warrior he could not or he would not we know not so she said i will she said i will do it in seven days she does constantly amuse him everybody at de court immense excitement for suppose ita statue of a warrior on horseback in perfect likeness chapeau tricorne perruque all of bronze and his marshals baton eh bien well a bronze horse is come at a gallop from berlin sthat we know by fortune a most exalted sculptor in berlin has him readyand many horses pulled him to here to lovely view by posthaste sthat we know but we are in extremity of puzzlement for where is the statue to ride him wheream i plain to you sirsis sthe marshal furst von eppenwelzen our great ancestor yet the markgrafin says it is right wait she nods she smiles our court is all at de lakepalace odder side sthe tower and it is bets of gems of feathers of lace not to be numbered the markgrafin sayssthere today you see him albrecht wohlgemuth furst von eppenwelzen but no sculptor can have cast him in bronzenot copied him and cast him in a time of seven days and we say sthishas she given a secret order to a sculptoryou understand me sirs commissionwhere how has he sthe likeness copied or did he come to our speisesaal of our lakepalace disguised oh but to see to copy to model to cast in bronze to travel betwixt berlin and sarkeld in a time of seven days no sooh we guess we guess we are in exhaustion and today is like an eagle we have sent an arrow to shoot and know not if he will come down for shall we see our ancestor on horseback it will be a notscribable joy or not so we guess we are worried at near eleven oclock a cannon fires sthe tent is lifted and we see but i am impatient wid my breaths for de gun to go i said it would be a fine sight for strangers yes you should be of de palace to know what a fine sight sthe finest and you are for sarkeld you have friends in sarkeld my father is in sarkeld mademoiselle i am told he is at the palace indeed and he is english your fater yes i have not seen him for years i have come to find him indeed it is for love of him your fater sir you come and not speak german i signified that it was so she stroked her ponys neck musing because of love is not much in de family in england it is said she remarked very shyly and in recovering her selfpossession asked the name of my father his name mademoiselle is mr richmond mr richmond mr richmond roy she sprang in her saddle you are son to mr richmond roy oh it is wonderful mademoiselle then you have seen him lately yes yes i have seen him i have heard of his beautiful child his son and you it is she studied my countenance a moment tell me is he well mademoiselle is he quite well oh yes she answered and broke into smiles of merriment and then seemed to bite her underlip he is our funmaker he must always be well i owe to him some of my english you are his son you were for sarkeld you will see him up at our bella vista quick let us run she put her pony to a canter up the brown path between the firtrees crying that she should take our breath but we were tight runners and i though my heart beat wildly was full of fire to reach the tower on the height so when she slackened her pace finding us close on her ponys hoofs she laughed and called us brave boys temples being no more than my friend who had made the expedition with me out of friendship surprised her not that she would not have expected it to be done by germans further she was unable to explain her astonishment at a turning of the ascent she pointed her whip at the dark knots and lines of the multitude mounting by various paths to behold the ceremony of unveiling the monument i besought her to waste no time you must if you please attend my pleasure if i guide you she said tossing her chin i thank you i cant tell you how much mademoiselle said i she answered you were kind to my two pet lambs sir so we moved forward chapter xvi the statue on the promontory the little lady was soon bowing to respectful salutations from crowds of rustics and others on a broad carriageway circling level with the height i could not help thinking how doubly foreign i was to all the world herei who was about to set eyes on my lost living father while these people were tiptoe to gaze on a statue but as my father might also be taking an interest in the statue i got myself round to a moderate sentiment of curiosity and a partial share of the general excitement temple and mademoiselle did most of the conversation which related to glimpses of scenery pine oak beechwood and lakewater until we gained the plateau where the tower stood when the giant groom trotted to the front and worked a clear way for us through a mass of travelling sightseers and she leaned to me talking quite inaudibly amid the laughter and chatting a band of wind instruments burst out this is glorious i conceived temple to cry like an openmouthed mute i found it inspiriting the rush of pride and pleasure produced by the music was irresistible we marched past the tower all of us i am sure with splendid feelings a stones throw beyond it was the lofty tent over it drooped a flag and flags were on poles round a wide ring of rope guarded by foresters and gendarmes mounted and afoot the band dressed in green with black plumes to their hats played in the middle of the ring outside were carriages and ladies and gentlemen on horseback full of animation rustics foresters town and village people men women and children pressed against the ropes it was a day of rays of sunshine now from off one edge now from another of large slow clouds so that at times we and the tower were in a blaze next the lakepalace was illuminated or the long grey lake and the woods of pine and of bare brown twigs making bays in it several hands beckoned on our coming in sight of the carriages there he is then i thought and it was like swallowing my heart in one solid lump mademoiselle had free space to trot ahead of us we saw a tall sitting lady attired in sables raise a finger to her and nip her chin away the little lady flew to a second carriage and on again as one may when alive with an inquiry i observed to temple i wonder whether she says in her german it is my question do you remember there was no weight whatever in what i said or thought she rode back exclaiming nowhere he is nowhere and nobody knows he will arrive but he is not yet now she bent coaxingly down to me can you not a few words of german only a smallest sum it is the markgrafin my good aunt would speak wid you and she can no english only she is eager to behold you and come you will know for my sake some scrap of germanja you willnicht wahr or french make your glompudding of it will you i made a shocking plumpudding of it temple was no happier the margravine a fine vigorous lady with a lively mouth and livelier eyes of a restless grey that rarely dwelt on you when she spoke and constantly started off on a new idea did me the honour to examine me much as if i had offered myself for service in her corps of grenadiers and might do in time but was decreed to be temporarily wanting in manly proportions she smiled a form of excuse of my bungling halfenglish horrid french talked over me and at me forgot me and recollected me all within a minute and fished poor temple for intelligible replies to incomprehensible language in the same manner then threw her head back to gather the pair of us in her sight then eyed me alone cest peutetre le fils de son petit papa et cest tout dire such was her summary comment but not satisfied with that she leaned out of the carriage and making an extraordinary grimace appear the mother in labour of the difficult words said doos yo laff there was no helping it i laughed like a madman giving one outburst and a dead stop far from looking displeased she nodded i was again put to the dreadful test can yo mak laff it spurred my wits i had no speech to mak laff with at the very instant of my dilemma i chanced to see a soberlyclad old townsman hustled between two helpless women of the crowd his pipe in his mouth and his hat wig and handkerchief sliding over his face showing his bald crown and he not daring to cry out for fear his pipe should be trodden under foot he can your highness her quick eyes caught the absurd scene she turned to one of her ladies and touched her forehead her hand was reached out to me temple she patted on the shoulder he canja du auch a grand gentleman rode up they whispered gazed at the tent and appeared to speak vehemently all the mens faces were foreign none of them had the slightest resemblance to my fathers i fancied i might detect him disguised i stared vainly temple to judge by the expression of his features was thinking yes thought i we might as well be at home at old riversley that distant spot we re as out of place here as frogs in the desert riding to and fro and chattering and commotion of which the margravine was the centre went on and the band played beautiful waltzes the workmen in and out of the tent were full of their business like seamen under a storm fraulein sibley the margravine called i hoped it might be an english name so it proved to be and the delight of hearing english spoken and what was more having english ears to speak to was blissful as the leap to daylight out of a nightmare i have the honour to be your countrywoman said a lady english all over to our struggling senses we became immediately attached to her as a pair of shipwrecked boats lacking provender of every sort are taken in tow by a wellstored vessel she knew my father knew him intimately i related all i had to tell and we learnt that we had made acquaintance with her pupil the princess ottilia wilhelmina frederika hedwig only child of the prince of eppenwelzen your father will certainly be here he is generally the margravines right hand and its wonderful the margravine can do without him so long said miss sibley and conversed with the margravine after which she informed me that she had been graciously directed to assure me my father would be on the field when the cannon sounded perhaps you know nothing of court life she resumed we have very curious performances in sarkeld and we owe it to the margravine that we are frequently enlivened you see the tall gentleman who is riding away from her i mean the one with the black hussar jacket and thick brown moustache that is the prince do you not think him handsome he is very kindrather capricious but that is a way with princes indeed i have no reason to complain he has lost his wife the princess frederika and depends upon his sister the margravine for amusement he has had it since she discovered your papa is the gun never going off i groaned if they would only conduct their ceremonies without their guns exclaimed miss sibley the origin of the present ceremony is this the margravine wished to have a statue erected to an ancestor a renowned soldierand i would infinitely prefer talking of england but never mind oh you wont understand what you gaze at well the prince did not care to expend the money instead of urging that as the ground of his refusal he declared there were no sculptors to do justice to prince albrecht wohlgemuth and one could not rely on their effecting a likeness we have him in the dininghall he was strikingly handsome afterward he pretendedim speaking now of the existing prince ernest that it would be ages before the statue was completed one day the margravine induced him to agree to pay the sum stipulated for by the sculptor on condition of the statue being completed for public inspection within eight days of the hour of their agreement the whole court was witness to it they arranged for the statue horse and man to be exhibited for a quarter of an hour of course the margravine did not signify it would be a perfectly finished work we are kept at a great distance that we may not scrutinize it too closely they unveil it to show she has been as good as her word and then cover it up to fix the rider to the horsea screw is employed i imagine for one thing we know about it we know that the horse and the horseman travelled hither separately in all probability the margravine gave the order for the statue last autumn in berlin now look at the prince he has his eye on you look down now he has forgotten you he is impatient to behold the statue our chief fear is that the statue will not maintain its balance fortunately we have plenty of guards to keep the people from pushing against it if all turns out well i shall really say the margravine has done wonders she does not look anxious but then she is not one ever to show it the prince does every other minute he is glancing at the tent and at his watch can you guess my idea your fathers absence leads me to thinkoh only a passing glimmer of an idea the statue has not arrived and he is bringing it on otherwise he would be sure to be here the margravine beckons me dont go we cried simultaneously the princess ottilia supplied her place i have sent to our stables for two little pretty hungarian horses for you two to ride she said no i have not yet seen him he is asked for and de markgrafin knows not at all he bades in our lake he has been seen since the man is exciteable but he is so sensible oh no and he is full of laughter we shall soon see him would he not ever be cautious of himself for a son like you her compliment raised a blush on me the patience of the people was creditable to their phlegm the smoke of pipes curling over the numberless heads was the most stirring thing about them temple observed to me well give the old statue a british cheer wont we richie after coming all the way from england said i in dejection no no richie youre sure of him now he s somewhere directing affairs i suspect i say do let us show them we can ring out the right tune upon occasion by jingo there goes a fellow with a match we saw the cannonier march up to the margravines carriage for orders she summoned the prince to her side ladies in a dozen carriages were standing up handkerchief in hand and the gentlemen got their horses heads on a line temple counted nearly sixty persons of quality stationed there the workmen were trooping out of the tent miss sibley ran to us saying the gunhorror has been commanded now then the prince can scarcely contain himself the gunner is ready near his gun he has his frightful match lifted see the managersuperintendent is receiving the margravines last injunctions how firm womens nerves are now the margravine insists on the princes reading the exact time by her watch everybody is doing it let us see by my watch it is all but fifteen minutes to eleven am dearest she addressed the little princess would you not like to hold my hand until the gun is fired dearest replied the princess whether in childish earnest or irony i could not divine if i would hold a hand it would be a gentlemans all eyes were on the prince of eppenwelzen as he gazed toward the covered statue with imposing deliberation his hand rose to his hat we saw the hat raised the cannon was fired and roared the band struck up a pompous slow march and the tentveil broke apart and rolled off it was like the dawn flying and sunrise mounting i confess i forgot all thought of my father for awhile the shouts of the people the braying of the brass instruments the ladies cheering sweetly the gentlemen giving short hearty expressions of applause intoxicated me and the statue was superbhorse and rider in new bronze polished by sunlight it is lifelike it is really noble it is a true prince exclaimed miss sibley she translated several exclamations of the ladies and gentlemen in german they were entirely to the same effect the horse gave us a gleam of his neck as he pawed a forefoot just reined in we knew him he was a gallant horse but it was the figure of the prince albrecht that was so fine i had always laughed at sculptured figures on horseback this one overawed me the marshal was acknowledging the salute of his army after a famous victory over the infidel turks he sat upright almost imperceptibly but effectively bending his head in harmony with the curve of his horses neck and his baton swept the air low in proud submission to the honours cast on him by his acclaiming soldiery his threecornered lace hat curled wig heavytrimmed surcoat and high boots reminded me of prince eugene no prince eugenenay nor marlborough had such a martial figure such an animated high old warriors visage the bronze features reeked of battle temple and i felt humiliated without cause i granted at the success of a work of art that struck us as a new military triumph of these germans and it was impossible not to admire it the little princess ottilia clapped hands by fits what words she addressed to me i know not i dealt out my stock of germanja jato her english we were drawn by her to congratulate the margravine whose hand was then being kissed by the prince he did it most courteously and affectionately other gentlemen counts and barons bowed over her hand ladies according to their rank and privileges saluted her on the cheek or in some graceful fashion when our turn arrived miss sibley translated for us and as we were at concert pitch we did not acquit ourselves badly temples remark was that he wished she and all her family had been english nothing was left for me to say but that the margravine almost made us wish we had been german smiling cordially the margravine spoke miss sibley translated her royal highness asks you if you have seen your father i shook my head the princess ottilia translated her highness my good aunt would know would you know him did you see him yes anywhere i cried the margravine pushed me back with a gesture yes your highness on my honour anywhere on earth she declined to hear the translation her insulting disbelief in my ability to recognize the father i had come so far to embrace would have vexed me but for the wretched thought that i was losing him again we threaded the carriages gazed at the horsemen in a way to pierce the hair on their faces the little princess came on us hurriedly here see are the horses i will you to mount are they not pretty animals she whispered i believe your fater have been hurt in his mind by something it is only perhaps now mount for de markgrafin says you are our good guests we mounted simply to show that we could mount for we would rather have been on foot and drew up close to the right of the margravines carriage hush a poet is reading his ode said the princess it is count fretzel von wolfenstein this ode was dreadful to us and all the court people pretended they liked it when he waved his right hand toward the statue there was a shout from the rustic set when he bowed to the margravine the ladies and gentlemen murmured agreeably and smiled we were convinced of its being downright hypocrisy rustic stupidity court flattery we would have argued our case too i proposed a gallop temple said no well give the old statue our cheer as soon as this awful fellow has done i dont care much for poetry but dont let me ever have to stand and hear german poetry again for the remainder of my life we could not imagine why they should have poetry read out to them instead of their fine band playing but supposed it was for the satisfaction of the margravine with whom i grew particularly annoyed on hearing miss sibley say she conceived her highness to mean that my father was actually on the ground and that we neither of us father and son knew one another i swore on my honour on my life he was not present and the melancholy in my heart taking the form of extreme irritation i spoke passionately i rose in my stirrups ready to shout father heres harry richmond come to see you where are you i did utter something a syllable or two make haste i think the words were they sprang from my inmost bosom addressed without forethought to that drawling mouthing poet the margravines face met mine like a challenge she had her lips tight in a mere lipsmile and her eyes gleamed with provocation her highness miss sibley translated asks whether you are prepared to bet that your father is not on the ground beg her to wait two minutes and ill be prepared to bet any sum said i temple took one half the circle i the other riding through the attentive horsemen and carriagelines and making sure the face we sought was absent more or less discomposing everybody the poet finished his ode he was cheered of course mightily relieved i beheld the band resuming their instruments for the cheering resembled a senseless beating on brass shields i felt that we english could do it better temple from across the sector of the circle running about two feet in front of the statue called aloud richie hes not here not here cried i the people gazed up at us wondering at the tongue we talked richie now let s lead these fellows off with a tiptop cheer little temple crowed lustily the head of the statue turned from temple to me i found the people falling back with amazed exclamations iso prepossessed was isimply stared at the suddenflashing white of the statues eyes the eyes from being an instant ago dull carved balls were animated they were fixed on me i was unable to give out a breath its chest heaved both bronze hands struck against the bosom richmond my son richie harry richmond richmond roy that was what the statue gave forth my head was like a ringing pan i knew it was my father but my father with death and strangeness earth metal about him and his voice was like a human cry contending with earth and metalmine was stifled i saw him descend i dismounted we met at the ropes and embraced all his figure was stiff smooth cold my arms slid on him each time he spoke i thought it an unnatural thing i myself had not spoken once after glancing by hazard at the empty saddle of the bronze horse i called to mind more clearly the appalling circumstance which had stupefied the whole crowd they had heard a statue speakhad seen a figure of bronze walk for them it was the ancestor of their prince it was the famous dead old warrior of a hundred and seventy years ago set thus in motion imagine the behaviour of people round a slain tiger that does not compel them to fly and may yet stretch out a dreadful paw much so they pressed for a nearer sight of its walnut visage and shrank in the act perhaps i shared some of their sensations i cannot tell my sensations were tranced there was no warmth to revive me in the gauntlet i clasped i looked up at the sky thinking that it had fallen dark chapter xvii my father breathes moves and speaks the people broke away from us like furrowed water as we advanced on each side of the ropes toward the margravines carriage i became a perfectly mechanical creature incapable of observing just capable of taking an impression here and there and in such cases the impressions that come are stamped on hot wax they keep the scene fresh they partly pervert it as well temples version is i am sure the truer historical picture he however could never repeat it twice exactly alike whereas i failed not to render image for image in clear succession as they had struck me at the time i could perceive that the figure of the prince albrecht in its stiff condition was debarred from vaulting or striding or stooping so that the ropes were a barrier between us i saw the little princess ottilia eyeing us with an absorbed comprehensive air quite unlike the manner of a child dots of heads curious faces peering and starting eyes met my vision i heard sharp talk in german and a rider flung his arm as if he wished to crash the universe and flew off the margravine seemed to me more an implacable parrot than a noble lady i thought to myself this is my father and i am not overjoyed or grateful in the same way i felt that the daylight was bronze and i did not wonder at it nay i reasoned on the probability of a composition of sun and mould producing that colour the truth was the powers of my heart and will were frozen i thought and felt at random and i crave excuses for dwelling on such trifling phenomena of the sensations which have been useful to me by helping me to realize the scene even as at the time they obscured it according to temples description when the statue moved its head toward him a shudder went through the crowd and a number of forefingers were levelled at it and the head moved toward me marked of them all its voice was answered by a dull puling scream from women and the men gaped when it descended from the saddle the act was not performed with one bound as i fancied but difficultly and it walked up to me like a figure dragging logs at its heels halfadozen workmen ran to arrest it some townswomen fainted there was a heavy altercation in german between the statue and the superintendent of the arrangements the sun shone brilliantly on our march to the line of carriages where the prince of eppenwelzen was talking to the margravine in a fury and he dashed away on his horse after bellowing certain directions to his foresters and the workmen by whom we were surrounded while the margravine talked loudly and amiably as though everything had gone well her watch was out she acknowledged my fathers bow and overlooked him she seemed to have made her courtiers smile the ladies and gentlemen obeyed the wave of her hand by quitting the ground the band headed a long line of the commoner sort and a body of foresters gathered the remnants and joined them to the rear of the procession a liveried groom led away temples horse and mine temple declared he could not sit after seeing the statue descend from its pedestal her highnesss behaviour roughened as soon as the place was clear of company she spoke at my father impetuously with manifest scorn and reproach struck her silvermounted stick on the carriage panels again and again stamped her foot lifting a most variable emphatic countenance princess ottilia tried to intercede the margravine clenched her hands and to one not understanding her speech appeared literally to blow the little lady off with the breath of her mouth her whole bearing consisted of volleys of abuse closed by magisterial interrogations temple compared her highnesss language to the running out of captain welshs chaincable and my fathers replies to the hauling in his sentences were short they sounded like manful protestations i barely noticed them temples version of it went and there was your father apologizing and the margravine rating him etc my father as it happened was careful not to open his lips wide on account of the plaster or thick coating of paint on his face no one would have supposed that he was burning with indignation the fact being that to give vent to it he would have had to exercise his muscular strength he was plastered and painted from head to foot the fixture of his wig and hat too constrained his skin so that his looks were no index of his feelings i longed gloomily for the moment to come when he would present himself to me in his natural form he was not sensible of the touch of my hand nor i of his there we had to stand until the voluble portion of the margravines anger came to an end she shut her eyes and bowed curtly to our salute you have seen the last of me madam my father said to her whirling carriagewheels he tried to shake and strained in his ponderous garments temple gazed abashed i knew not how to act my father kept lifting his knees on the spot as if practising a walk the tent was in its old place covering the bronze horse a workman stepped ahead of us and we all went at a strange leisurely pace down the hill through tall pinetrees to where a closed vehicle awaited us here were also a couple of lackeys who deposited my father on a bed of moss and with much effort pulled his huge boots off leaving him in red silk stockings temple and i snatched his gauntlets temple fell backward but we had no thought of laughter people were seen approaching and the three of us jumped into the carriage i had my fathers living hand in mine to squeeze feeling him scarcely yet the living man i had sought and with no great warmth of feeling his hand was very moist often i said dear fatherpapa im so glad at last in answer to his short breathed richie my little lad my son richmond you found me out you found me we were conscious that his thick case of varnished clothing was against us one would have fancied from his way of speaking that he suffered from asthma i was now gifted with a tenfold power of observation and let nothing escape me temple sitting opposite grinned cheerfully at times to encourage our spirits he had not recovered from his wonderment nor had i introduced him my father however had caught his name temple who might as well have talked i thought was perpetually stealing secret glances of abstracted perusal at him with a pair of round infants eyes sucking his reflections the while my father broke our silence mr temple i have the honour he said as if about to cough the honour of making your acquaintance i fear you must surrender the hope of making mine at present temple started and reddened like a little fellow detected in straying from his spellingbook which was the windowframe in a minute or so the fascination proved too strong for him his eyes wandered from the window and he renewed his shy inspection bit by bit as if casting up a column of figures yes mr temple we are in high germany said my father it must have cost temple cruel pain for he was a thoroughly gentlemanly boy and he could not resist it finally he surprised himself in his stealthy reckoning arrived at the fullbreech or buttoned waistband about halfway up his ascent from the red silk stocking he would pause and blink rapidly sometimes jump and cough to put him at his ease my father exclaimed as to this exterior he knocked his knuckles on the heaving hard surface i can only affirm that it was on horsebackahem particularly as the horse betrayed no restivity pronounced perfect the sole complaint of our interior concerns the resemblance we bear to a lobster human somewhere i do believe myself to be i shall have to be relieved of my shell before i can at all satisfactorily proclaim the fact i am a human being believe me he begged permission to take breath a minute i know you for my sons friend mr temple here is my son my boy harry lepel richmond roy have patience i shall presently stand unshelled i have much to relate you likewise have your narrative in store that you should have lit on me at the critical instant is one of those miracles which combine to produce overwhelming testimonyay richie without a doubt there is a hand directing our destiny his speaking in such a strain out of pure kindness to temple huskily with his painful attempt to talk like himself revived his image as the father of my heart and dreams and stirred my torpid affection though it was still torpid enough as may be imagined when i state that i remained plunged in contemplation of his stocking of red silk emerging from the full bronzed breech considering whether his comparison of himself to a shellfish might not be a really just one we neither of us regained our true natures until he was free of every vestige of the garb of prince albrecht wohlgemuth attendants were awaiting him at the gardengate of a beautiful villa partly girdled by rising firwoods on its footing of bright green meadow they led him away and us to bathrooms chapter xviii we pass a delightful evening and i have a morning vision in a long saloon ornamented with stags horns and instruments of the chase tusks of boars spearstaves boarknives and silver horns my father i and temple sat down to a memorable breakfast my father in his true form dressed in black silken jacket and kneebreeches purple stockings and pumps without a wig i thanked heaven to see how blithely he flung out his limbs and heaved his chest released from confinement his face was stained brownish but we drank old rhine wine and had no eye for appearances so you could bear it no longer richie my father interrupted the narrative i doled out anxious for his and he began and i interrupted him you did think of me often papa didnt you his eyes brimmed with tenderness think of you he sighed i gave him the account of my latest adventures in a few panting breaths suppressing the bench he set my face to front him we are two fools mr temple he said no sir said temple now you speak papa said i he smiled warmly richie begins to remember me i gazed at him to show it was true i do papaim not beginning to at his request i finished the tale of my life at school ah well that was bad fortune this is good he exclaimed tis your father my son tis daylight though you look at it through a bedcurtain and think you are halfdreaming now then for me richie my father went on in this wise excitedly i was laying the foundation of your fortune here my boy heavens when i was in that bronze shell i was astonished only at my continence in not bursting you have grownyou have shot up and filled out i register my thanks to your grandfather beltham the same in a minor degree to captain jasper welsh between that man rippenger and me there shall be dealings he flogged you let that pass he exposed you to the contempt of your schoolfellows because of a breach in my correspondence with a baseborn feruleswinger what are we coming to richie my son i was building a future for you here and colonel goodwincolonel goodwin you encountered him too and his marriageable daughteri owe it to them that i have you here well in the event of my sitting out the period this morning as the presentment of prince albrecht i was to have won something would have astonished that unimpressionable countryman of ours goodness gracious my boy when i heard your english shout it went to my marrow could they expect me to look down on my own flesh and blood on my sonmy son richmondafter a separation of years and continue a statue nay i followed my paternal impulse grant that the show was spoilt does the markgrafin insist on my having a bronze heart to carry on her pastime why naturally i deplore a failure let the cause be what it will whose regrets can eclipse those of the principal actor quotha as our old plays have it regrets did i not for fifteen minutes and more of mortal time sit in view of a multitude motionless i ask you like a chiselled block of stoneand the compact was one quarter of an hour and no farther that was my stipulation i told heri can hold out one quarter of an hour i pledged myself to it who then is to blame i was exposed to view twentythree minutes odd seconds is there not some ancient story of a monstrous wretch baked in his own bull my situation was as bad if i recollect aright he could roar no such relief was allowed to me and i give you my word richie lads both that while that most infernal count fretzel was pouring forth his execrable humdrum i positively envied the privilege of an old palsied fellow chief boatman of the forest lake for thinks i hang him he can nod his head and i can not let me assure you twenty minutes of an ordeal like thatone posture mind you no raising of your eyelids taking your breath mechanically and your heart beating jumping like an enraged balletdancer boxed in your bosoma literal description upon my honour and not only jumping jumping every now and then i may say with a toe in your throat i was halfchokedwell i say twenty minutes twentyseven minutes and a half of that getting on in fact to halfanhour it is superhumanby heavens it is heroical and observe my reward i have a sonmy only one i have been divided from him for years i am establishing his fortune i know he is provided with comforts richie you remember the woman waddy a faithful soul she obtained my consent at lastpreviously i had objections in fact your address was withheld from the womanto call at your school she saw rippenger a girl of considerable attractions she heard you were located at riversley i say i know the boy is comfortably provided for but we have been separated since he was a little creature with curls on his forehead scarce breeched i protested papa i have been in jacket and trousers i dont know how long let me pursue said my father and to show you richie it is a golden age ever when you and i are together and ever shall be till we lose our manly spirit and we cling to thattill we lose our princely spirit which we never will abandonperish ratheri drink to you and challenge you and mind you old hock wine has charms if burgundy is the emperor of wines hock is the empress for youngsters perhaps i should except the hock that gets what they would fancy a trifle pique turned with age so as to lose in their opinion its empress flavour temple said modestly i should call that the margravine of wines my father beamed on him with great approving splendour join us mr temple you are a man of wit and may possibly find this specimen worthy of you this wine has a history you are drinking wine with blood in it well i was saying the darling of my heart has been torn from me i am in a foreign land foreign that is by birth and on the whole foreign yesi am the cynosure of eyes i am in a singular posture a singular situation i hear a cry in the tongue of my native land and what i presume is my boys name i look i behold him i follow a parents impulse on my soul none but a fishfather could have stood against it well for this my reward isand i should have stepped from a cathedral spire just the same if i had been mounted on itthat i iand the woman knows all my secreti have to submit to the foul tirade of a vixen she drew language i protest from the slums and i entreat you mr temple with your margravine of wineswhich was very neatly said to be surenote you this curious point for the confusion of radicals in your after life her highnesss pleasure was to lend her tongue to the languageor something like itof a besotted fishwife so very well and just as it is the case with that particular old hock you youngsters would disapprove of and we cunning oldsters know to contain more virtues in maturity than a nunnery of mayblooming virgins just so the very faults of a royal ladyroyal by birth and in temper a termagantimpart a perfume a flavour you must age you must live in courts you must sound the human bosom rightly to appreciate it she is a woman of the most malicious fine wit imaginable she is a generous woman a magnanimous woman wear her chains and she will not brain you with her club she is the light the centre of every society where she appears like what shall i say like the moon in a bowl of old rhenish and you will drain that bowl to the bottom to seize her as it werecatch a correct idea of her ay and your brains are drowned in the attempt yes richie i was aware of your residence at riversley were you reminded of your wandering dada on valentines day come my boy we have each of us a thousand things to relate i may be dulli do not understand what started you on your journey in search of me an impulse an accident say a directing angel we rest our legs here till evening and then we sup you will be astonished to hear that you have dined tis the fashion with the germans i promise you good wine shall make it up to you for the return to schoolhabits we sup and we pack our scanty baggage and we start tonight brook no insult at courts if you are of material value if not it is unreservedly a question whether you like kickings my father paused yawned and stretched to be rid of the remainder of his aches and stiffness out of a great yawn he said dear lads i have fallen into the custom of the country i crave your permission that i may smoke wander if you choose within hail of me or sit by me if you can bear it and talk of your schoollife and your studies your aunt dorothy richie she is well i know not her like i could bear to hear of any misfortune but that she suffered pain my father smoked his cigar peacefully he had laid a guitar on his knees and flipped a string or chafed over all the strings and plucked and thrummed them as his mood varied we chatted and watched the going down of the sun and amused ourselves idly fermenting as we were anything that gave pleasure to us two boys pleased and at once occupied my father it was without aid from temples growing admiration of him that i recovered my active belief and vivid delight in his presence my younger days sprang up beside me like brothers no one talked looked flashed frowned beamed as he did had such prompt liveliness as he such tenderness no one was ever so versatile in playfulness he took the colour of the spirits of the people about him his vivacious or sedate manoftheworld tone shifted to playfellows fun in a twinkling i used as a little fellow to think him larger than he really was but he was of good size inclined to be stout his eyes were grey rather prominent and his forehead sloped from arched eyebrows so conversational were his eyes and brows that he could persuade you to imagine he was carrying on a dialogue without opening his mouth his voice was charmingly clear his laughter confident fresh catching the outburst of his very self as laughter should be other sounds of laughter were like echoes strange to say i lost the links of my familiarity with him when he left us on a short visit to his trunks and portmanteaux and had to lean on temple who tickled but rejoiced me by saying richie your father is just the one i should like to be secretary to we thought it a pity to have to leave this nice foreign place immediately i liked the scenery and the wine and what i supposed to be the habit of the gentlemen here to dress in silks on my fathers return to us i asked him if we could not stay till morning till morning then he said and to england with the first lark his complexion was ruddier his valet had been at work to restore it he was getting the sanguine hue which coloured my recollection of him wearing a black velvet cap and a spanish furred cloak he led us over the villa in sarkeld he resided at the palace and generally at the lake palace on the removal of the court thither the margravine had placed the villa which was her own property at his disposal the better to work out their conspiracy it would have been mine said my father bending suddenly to my ear and humming his philosophical heigho as he stepped on in minuet fashion we went through apartments rich with gilded oak and pine panellings in one was a rough pattern of a wooden horse opposite a mirror by no means a figure of a horse but apparently a number of pieces contributed by a carpenters workshop having a rueful seat in the middle my father had practised the attitude of prince albrecht wohlgemuth on it she timed me five and twenty minutes there only yesterday he said and he now supposed he had sat the bronze horse as a statue in public view exactly thirtyseven minutes and a quarter tubs full of colouring liquid to soak the garments of the prince pots of paint and paint and plaster brushes hinted the magnitude of the preparations here said my father in another apartment i was this morning apparelled at seven oclock and i would have staked my right arm up to the collarbone on the success of the undertaking werent they sure to have found it out in the end papa i inquired i am not so certain of that he rejoined i cannot quaff consolation from that source i should have been covered up after exhibition i should have been pronounced imperfect in my fittingapparatus the sculptor would have claimed me and i should have been enjoying the fruits of a brave and harmless conspiracy to do honour to an illustrious prince while he would have been moulding and casting an indubitable bronze statue in my image a fig for rumours we show ourself we are caught from sight we are again on show now this being successfully done do you see royalty declines to listen to vulgar tattle presumably richie it was suspected by the court that the margravine had many months ago commanded the statue at her own cost and had set her mind on winning back the money the wonder of it was my magnificent resemblance to the defunct i sat some three hours before the old warriors portraits in the diningsaloon of the lakepalace accord me one good spell of meditation over a tolerable sketch i warrant myself to represent him to the life provided that he was a personage i incline to stipulate for handsome as well on my word of honour as a man and a gentleman i pity the margravinemy poor good frau feldmarschall now here richiemy father opened a sidedoor out of an elegant little room into a spacious dark place here is her cabinettheatre where we act german and french comediettas in spring and autumn i have superintended it during the two or more years of my stay at the court humph tis over he abruptly closed the door his dress belonged to the part of a spanish nobleman personated by him in a play called the hidalgo enraged he said pointing a thumb over his shoulder at the melancholy door behind which gay scenes had sparkled papa said i sadly for consolation youre change for a sovereign to the amount of four hundred and forty nine thousand shillings every time you speak cried he kissing my forehead he sparkled in good earnest on hearing that i had made acquaintance with the little princess ottilia what i thought of her how she looked at me what i said to her what words she answered how the acquaintance began who were observers of iti had to repair my omission to mention her by furnishing a precise description of the circumstances describing her face and style repeating her pretty english my father nodded he thought i exaggerated that foreign english of hers but as i said i was new to it and noticed it he admitted the greater keenness of attention awakened by novelty only said he i rather wonder and here he smiled at me inquiringly tis true he added a boy of fourteen or fifteen ay richie have your fun out a youngster saw the comic side of her do you know that child has a remarkable character her disposition is totally unfathomable you are a deep reader of english poetry i hope she adores it and the english navy she informed me that if she had been the english people she would have made nelson king the royal family of england might see objections to that i told her cries she oh anything for a seahero you will find these young princes and princesses astonishingly revolutionary when they entertain brains now at present just at present an english naval officer and a poet stand higher in the esteem of that young princess ottilia than dukes kings or emperors so you have seen her my father ejaculated musingly and hummed and said by the way we must be careful not to offend our grandpapa beltham richie good acresgood anchorage good coffers good harbourage regarding poetry my dear boy you ought to be writing it for i dothe diversion of leisure hours impromptus in poetry i would scorn anything but impromptus i was saying richie that if tremendous misfortune withholds from you your legitimate prestige you must have the substantial element tis your springboard to vault by and cushions on the other side if you make a miss and fall tis the essence if you have not the odour i followed my fathers meaning as the shadow of a bird follows it in sunlight it made no stronger an impression than a flying shadow on the grass still i could verify subsequently that i had penetrated himi had caught the outline of his meaningthough i was little accustomed to his manner of communicating his ideas i had no notion of what he touched on with the words prestige essence and odour my efforts to gather the reason for his having left me neglected at school were fruitless business business sad necessity hurry worrythehounds was his nearest approach to an explicit answer and seeing i grieved his kind eyes i abstained nor did i like to defend mr rippenger for expecting to be paid we came to that point once or twice when so sharply wronged did he appear and vehement and indignant that i banished thoughts which marred my luxurious contentment in hearing him talk and sing and behave in his old ways and new habits plain velvet was his dress at dinner we had a yellow hock temples meditative face over it to discover the margravine or something in its flavour was a picture it was an evening of incessant talking no telling of events straightforwardly but all by fitsall here and there my father talked of turkey so i learnt he had been in that country temple of the routine of our life at riversley i of kiomi the gipsy girl then we two of captain jasper welsh my father of the princess ottilia when i alluded to the margravine he had a word to say of mrs waddy so i learnt she had been in continual correspondence with him and had cried heavily about me poor soul temple laughed out a recollection of captain bulsteds hic haec hoc i jumped janet ilchester up on the table my father expatiated on the comfort of a volume of shakespeare to an exiled englishman we drank to one another and heartily to the statue my father related the history of the margravines plot in duck anddrake skips and backward to his first introduction to her at some austrian baths among the mountains she wanted amusementhe provided it she never let him quit her sight from that moment and now he said she has lost me he drew out of his pocketbook a number of designs for the statue of prince albrecht to which the margravines initials were appended and shuffled them and sighed and saidmost complete arrangements most complete no body of men were ever so well drilled as those fellows up at bella vistacould not have been and at the climax in steps the darling boy for whom i laboured and sweated and down we topple incontinently nothing would have shaken me but the apparition of my son i was proof against everything but that i sat invincible for close upon an hourcall it an hour not a muscle of me moved i repeat the heart in my bosom capered like an independent organ had it all its own way leaving me mine until mr temple take my word for it there is a guiding hand in some families believe it and be serene in adversity the change of life at a merry court to life in a london alley will exercise our faith but the essential thing is that richie has been introduced here and i intend him to play a part here the grandson and heir of one of the richest commoners in englandi am not saying commoner as a term of reproach possessed of a property that turns itself over and doubles itself every ten years maymind you mayon such a solid foundation as thatand as to birth your highness has only to grant us a private interview temple was dazed by this mystifying address to him nor could i understand it why papa you always wished for me to go into parliament said i i do he replied and i wish you to lead the london great world such topics are for byandby adieu to them he kissed his wafting finger tips we fell upon our random talk again with a merry rattle i had to give him a specimen of my pianoplaying and singing he shook his head the cricketer and the scholar have been developed at the expense of the musician and music richie music unlocks the chamber of satinrose late at night we separated temple and i slept in companionrooms deadly drowsy the dear little fellow sat on the edge of my bed chattering of his wonder my dreams led me wandering with a ships diver under the sea where we walked in a light of pearls and exploded old wrecks i was assuring the glassy man that it was almost as clear beneath the waves as above when i awoke to see my father standing over me in daylight and in an ecstasy i burst into sobs here richiehe pressed fresh violets on my nostrils you have had a morning visitor quick out of bed and you will see the little fairy crossing the meadow i leapt to the window in time to have in view the little princess ottilia followed by her faithful gaunt groom before she was lost in the shadow of the firtrees chapter xix our return homeward we started for england at noon much against my secret wishes but my father would not afford the margravine time to repent of her violent language and injustice toward him reflection increased his indignation anything that went wrong on the first stages of the journey caused him to recapitulate her epithets and reply to them proudly he confided to me in cologne cathedral that the entire course of his life was a grand plot resembling an unfinished piece of architecture which might at a future day prove the wonder of the world and he had therefore packed two dozen of hoar old uralt he used comical german hock for a present to my grandfather beltham in the hope of its being found acceptable for richie said he you may not knowand it is not to win your thanks i inform you of itthat i labour unremittingly in my sons interests i have established him on his majority in germany at a court my object now is to establish him in england promise me that it shall be the decided endeavour of your energies and talents to rise to the height i point out to you you promise i perceive he added sharp in detecting the unpleasant predicament of a boy who is asked to speak priggishly so then i could easily promise with a firm voice he dropped certain explosive hints which reminded me of the funny ideas of my state and greatness i had when a child i shrugged at them i cared nothing for revelations to come byandby my object was to unite my father and grandfather on terms of friendship this was the view that now absorbed and fixed my mind to have him a frequent visitor at riversley if not a resident in the house enlivening them all while i perhaps trifled a cavalry sabre became one of my settled dreams the difficult part of the scheme appeared to me the obtaining of my fathers consent i mentioned it and he said immediately that he must have his freedom now for instance said he what is my desire at this moment i have always a big one perched on a rock in the distance but i speak of my present desire and let it be supposed that the squire is one of us we are returning to england well i want to show you a storks nest we are not far enough south for the stork to build here it is a fact richie that i do want to show you the bird for luck and as a feature of the country and in me a desire to do a thing partakes of the impetus of steam well you see we are jogging home to england i resist myself for dutys sake that i can do but if the squire were here with his yea and his nay by heavens i should be off to the top of the rhine like a tornado i submit to circumstances i cannot and i will not be dictated to by men that seems to me rather unreasonable i remonstrated it is i am ashamed of it he answered do as you will richie set me down at riversley but under no slight mark you i keep my honour intact like a bottled cordial my unfailing comfort in adversity i hand it to you my son on my deathbed and say you have there the essence of my life never has it been known of me that i swallowed an insult then papa i shall have a talk with the squire make good your ground in the castle said he i string a guitar outside you toss me a key from the walls if there is room and i have leisure i enter if not you know i am paving your way in other quarters riversley my boy is an excellent foothold and fortress riversley is not the world at riversley i should have to wear a double face and egad a double stomachbag like young jack feeding with the giantone full of ambition the other of provender that place is our touchstone to discover whether we have prudence we have i hope and we will have mr temple a pleasant day or two in paris it was his habit to turn off the bent of these conversations by drawing temple into them temple declared there was no feeling we were in a foreign country while he was our companion we simply enjoyed strange scenes looking idly out of our windows our recollection of the strangest scene ever witnessed filled us with i know not what scornful pleasure and laughed in the background at any sight or marvel pretending to amuse us temple and i cantered over the great belgian battlefield talking of bella vista tower the statue the margravine our sour milk and blackbread breakfast the little princess ottilia with her it is my question and you were kind to my lambs sir thoughtless of glory and dead bones my father was very differently impressed he was in an exultant glow far outmatching the bloom on our faces when we rejoined him i cried papa if the prince wont pay for a real statue i will and ill present it in your name to the nation cried he staring and arresting his arm in what seemed an orchestral movement to the margravine he heard but had to gather his memory he had been fighting the battle and made light of bella vista i found that incidents over which a day or two had rolled lost their features to him he never smiled at recollections if they were forced on him noisily by persons he liked perhaps his face was gay but only for a moment the gaiety of his nature drew itself from hotsprings of hopefulness our arrival in england our interviews there my majority burgundy my revisitation of germanythese events to come gave him the aspect children wear out a maying or in an orchard he discussed the circumstances connected with the statue as dry matteroffact and unless it was his duty to be hilarious at the dinnertable he was hardly able to respond to a call on his past life and mine his future too was present tense we do this not we will do this so that generally no sooner did we speak of an anticipated scene than he was acting in it i studied him eagerly i know and yet quite unconsciously and i came to no conclusions boys are always putting down the ciphers of their observations of people beloved by them but do not add up a sum total our journey home occupied nearly eleven weeks owing to stress of money on two occasions in brussels i beheld him with a little beggargirl in his arms she has asked me for a copper coin richie he said squeezing her fat cheeks to make cherries of her lips i recommended him to give her a silver one something richie i must give the little wench for i have kissed her and in my list of equivalents gold would be the sole form of repayment after that you must buy me off with honour my boy i was compelled to receive a dab from the childs nose by way of a kiss in return for buying him off with honour the child stumped away on the pavement fronting our hotel staring at its fist that held the treasure poor pet wee drab of it exclaimed my father one is glad richie to fill a creature out of ones emptiness now she toddles she is digesting it rapidly the last performance of ones purse is rarely so pleasant as that i owe it to her that i made the discovery in time in this manner i also made the discovery that my father had no further supply of money none whatever how it had run out without his remarking it he could not tell he could only assure me that he had become aware of the fact while searching vainly for a coin to bestow on the beggar girl i despatched a letter attested by a notary of the city applying for money to the banker to whom colonel goodwin had introduced me on my arrival on the continent the money came and in the meantime we had formed acquaintances and entertained them they were chiefly halfpay english military officers dashing men one a major dykes my father established in our hotel and we carried him on to paris where consequent upon our hospitalities the purse was again deficient two reasons for not regretting it were adduced by my father firstly that it taught me not to despise the importance of possessing money secondly that we had served our country by assisting dykes who was on the scent of a new and terrible weapon of destruction which he believed to be in the hands of the french government major dykes disappeared on the scent but we had the satisfaction of knowing that we had done our best toward saving the navy of great britain from being blown out of water temple and i laughed over major dykes and he became our puppet for byplay on account of his enormous whiskers his passion for strong drinks and his air of secresy my fathers faith in his patriotic devotedness was sufficient to withhold me from suspicions of his character whenever my instinct or common sense would have led me to differ with my father in opinion fun supervened i was willing that everything in the world should be as he would have it be and took up with a spirit of laughter too happy in having won him in having fished him out of the deep sea at one fling of the net as he said to care for accuracy of sentiment in any other particular our purse was at its lowest ebb he suggested no means of replenishing it and i thought of none he had heard that it was possible to live in paris upon next to nothing with very great luxury so we tried it we strolled through the lilac aisles among bonnes and babies attended military spectacles rode on omnibuses dined on the country heights went to theatres and had a most pleasurable time gaining everywhere front places friendly smiles kind little services in a way that would have been incomprehensible to me but for my consciousness of the magical influence of my fathers address a mixture of the ceremonious and the affable such as the people could not withstand the poet is perhaps on the whole more exhilarating than the alderman he said these were the respective names given by him to the empty purse and the full purse we vowed we preferred the poet ay said he but for all that the alderman is lighter on his feet i back him to be across the channel first the object of my instructions to you will be lost richie if i find you despising the aldermans pegasus on money you mount we are literally chained here you know there is no doubt about it and we are adding a nail to our fetters daily true you are accomplishing the parisian accent paris has also this immense advantage over all other cities tis the central hotel on the highroad of civilization in paris you meet your friends to a certainty it catches them every one in turn so now we must abroad early and late and cut for trumps a meeting with a friend of my father mr monterez williams was the result of our resolute adoption of this system he helped us on to boulogne where my father met another friend to whom he gave so sumptuous a dinner that we had not money enough to pay the hotel bill now observe the inconvenience of leaving paris said he ten to one we shall have to return we will try a weeks whistling on the jetty and if no luck comes and you will admit richiemr temple i call your attention to itthat luck will scarcely come in profuse expedition through the narrow neck of a solitary seaport why we must return to paris i proposed to write to my aunt dorothy for money but he would not hear of that after two or three days of whistling i saw my old friend mr bannerbridge step out of the packetboat on condition of my writing to my aunt to say that i was coming home he advanced me the sum we were in need of grudgingly though and with the prediction that we should break down again which was verified it occurred only a stage from riversley where my grandfathers name was good as coin of the realm besides my father remained at the inn to guarantee the payment of the bill while temple and i pushed on in a fly with the two dozen of hock it could hardly be called a breakdown but my father was not unwilling for me to regard it in that light among his parting remarks was an impressive adjuration to me to cultivate the squires attachment at all costs do this he said and i shall know that the lesson i have taught you on your journey homeward has not been thrown away my darling boy my curse through life has been that the sense of weight in money is a sense i am and was born utterly a stranger to the consequence is my grandest edifices fall there is no foundation for them not that i am worse understand me than under a temporary cloud and the blessing of heaven has endowed me with a magnificent constitution heaven forefend that i should groan for myself or you for me but digest what you have learnt richie press nothing on the squire be guided by the advice of that esteemed and admirable woman your aunt dorothy and by the way you may tell her confidentially of the progress of your friendship with the princess ottilia here i shall employ my hours in a tranquil study of nature until i see you thus he sped me forward we sighted riversley about midday on a sunny june morning compared with the view from bella vista our firs looked scanty our heathtracts dull as places having no page of history written on them our fresh green meadows not more than commonly homely i was so full of my sense of triumph in my adventurous journey and the recovery of my father that i gazed on the old grange from a towering height the squire was on the lawn surrounded by a full company the ilchesters the ambroses the wilfords captain and squire gregory bulsted the rubreys and others all bending to roses to admire smell or pluck charming groups of ladies were here and there and temple whispered as we passed them we beat foreigners in our women richie i making it my business to talk with perfect unconcern replied do you think so perhaps not in all cases all the while i was exulting at the sweet beams of england radiating from these dear early morninglooking women my aunt dorothy swam up to me and kissing me murmured take no rebuff from your grandpapa darling my answer was i have found him captain bulsted sang out our names i caught sight of julia rippengers face the squire had his back turned to me which reminded me of my first speech with captain jasper welsh and i thought to myself i know something of the world now and the thing is to keep a good temper here there was no wirecoil to intercept us so i fronted him quickly hulloa he cried and gave me his shoulder temple is your guest sir said i he was obliged to stretch out his hand to temple a prompt instinct warned me that i must show him as much beltham as i could summon dogs and horses all right sir i asked captain bulsted sauntered near here william said the squire tell this fellow about my stables in excellent condition harry richmond returned the captain oh he s got a new name i ll swear said the squire not i then what have you got of your trip eh a sharper eye than i had sir youve been sharpening it in london have you ive been a little farther than london squire well youre not a liar there you see the lad can stand fire captain bulsted broke in harry richmond im proud to shake your hand but ill wait till youre through the ceremony with your grandad the squires hands were crossed behind him i smiled boldly in his face shall i make the tour of you to get hold of one of them sir he frowned and blinked shuffle in among the ladies you seem to know how to make friends among them he said and pretended to disengage his right hand for the purpose of waving it toward one of the groups i seized it saying heartily grandfather upon my honour i love you and im glad to be home again mind you youre not at home till youve begged uberlys pardon in public you know what for he rejoined leaving the horse at that inn is on my conscience said i the squire grumbled a bit suppose he kicks said i and the captain laughed and the squire too and i was in such high spirits i thought of a dozen witty suggestions relative to the seat of the conscience and grieved for a minute at going to the ladies all the better keep him there captain bulsted convoyed me to pretty irisheyed julia rippenger temple had previously made discovery of janet ilchester relating our adventures on different parts of the lawn we both heard that colonel goodwin and his daughter had journeyed down to riversley to smooth the way for my return so my easy conquest of the squire was not at all wonderful nevertheless i maintained my sense of triumph and was assured in my secret heart that i had a singular masterfulness and could when i chose to put it forth compel my grandfather to hold out his hand to my father as he had done to me julia rippenger was a guest at riversley through a visit paid to her by my aunt dorothy in alarm at my absence the intention was to cause the squire a distraction it succeeded for the old man needed lively prattle of a less childish sort than janet ilchesters at his elbow and that young lady though true enough in her fashion was the ardent friend of none but flourishing heads whereas julia finding my name under a cloud at riversley spoke of me i was led to imagine by captain bulsted as a ballad hero a gloriful fellow a darling whose deeds were all pardonablea mere puff of smoke in the splendour of his nature to hear the young lady allude to me in that style he confided to my ear with an ineffable heave of his big chest certain good influences at any rate preserved the squire from threatening to disinherit me colonel goodwin had spoken to him very manfully and wisely as to my relations with my father the squire it was assumed by my aunt and by captain bulsted and julia had undertaken to wink at my fathers claims on my affection all three vehemently entreated me to make no mention of the present of hock to him and not to attempt to bring about an interview concerning the yellow wine i disregarded their advice for i held it to be a point of filial duty and an obligation religiously contracted beneath a cathedral dome so i performed the task of offering the hock stating that it was of ancient birth the squire bunched his features he tutored his temper and said not a word i fancied all was well before i tried the second step captain bulsted rode over to my father who himself generously enjoined the prudent course in accordance with his aforegone precepts he was floated off as he termed it from the inn where he lay stranded to london by i knew not what heavensent gift of money bidding me keep in view the grand career i was to commence at dipwell on arriving at my majority i would have gone with him had he beckoned a finger the fourandtwenty bottles of hock were ranged in a line for the stableboys to cockshy at them under the squires supervision and my enforced attendance just as revolutionary criminals are executed i felt like the survivor of friends who had seen their blood flow he handed me a cheque for the payment of debts incurred in my recent adventures who could help being grateful for it and yet his remorseless spilling of the kindly wine full of mellow recollections of my father and the little princess drove the sense of gratitude out of me chapter xx news of a fresh conquest of my fathers temple went to sea the wonder is that i did not go with him we were both in agreement that adventures were the only things worth living for and we despised english fellows who had seen no place but england i could not bear the long separation from my father that was my reason for not insisting on the squires consent to my becoming a midshipman after passing a brilliant examination temple had the good fortune to join captain bulsteds ship and there my honesthearted friend dismally composed his letter of confession letting me know that he had been untrue to friendship and had proposed to janet ilchester and interchanged vows with her he begged my forgiveness but he did love her sohe hoped i would not mind i sent him a reproachful answer i never cared for him more warmly than when i saw the letter shoot the slope of the postoffice mouth aunt dorothy undertook to communicate assurances of my undying affection for him as for janettemples letter in which he spoke of her avowed preference for oriental presents and declared his intention of accumulating them on his voyages was a harpoon in her side by means of it i worried and terrified her until she was glad to have it all out before the squire what did he do he said that margery her mother was niggardly a girl wanted presents and i did not act up to my duty i ought to buy turkey and tunis to please her if she had a mind for them the further she was flattered the faster she cried she had the face of an old setter with these hideous tears the squire promised her fifty pounds per annum in quarterly payments that she might buy what presents she liked and so tie herself to constancy he said aside to me as if he had a knowledge of the sexyoung ladies must have lots of knickknacks or their eyes ll be caught right and left remember that i should have been delighted to see her caught she talked of love in a ludicrous secondhand way sending me into fits of disgusted laughter on other occasions her lips were not hypocritical and her figure anything but awkward she was a bold plump girl fond of male society heriot enraptured her i believed at the time she would have appointed a year to marry him in had he put the question but too many women were in love with heriot he and i met kiomi on the road to the racecourse on the southdowns the prettiest racecourse in england shut against gipsies a barefooted swarthy girl ran beside our carriage and tossed us flowers he and a friend of his young lord destrier son of the marquis of edbury who knew my father well talked and laughed with her and thought her so very handsome that i likewise began to stare and i suddenly called kiomi she bounded back into the hedge this was our second meeting it would have been a pleasant one had not heriot and destrier pretended all sorts of things about our previous acquaintance neither of us they said had made a bad choice but why had we separated she snatched her hand out of mine with a grin of anger like puss in a fury we had wonderful fun with her they took her to a great house near the racecourse and there assisted by one of the young ladies dressed her in flowing silks and so passed her through the gate of the enclosure interdicted to bare feet there they led her to groups of fashionable ladies and got themselves into pretty scrapes they said she was an indian heriot lost his wagers and called her a witch she replied youll find im one young man and that was the only true thing she spoke of the days to come owing to the hubbub around the two who were guilty of this unmeasured joke upon consequential ladies i had to conduct her to the gate instantly and without a goodbye she scrambled up her skirts and ran at strides across the road and through the wood out of sight she won her dress and a piece of jewelry with heriot i went on a sad expedition the same i had set out upon with temple this time i saw my father behind those high red walls once so mysterious and terrible to me heriot made light of prisons for debt he insisted for my consolation that they had but a temporary dishonourable signification very estimable gentlemen as well as scamps inhabited them he said the impression produced by my visitthe feasting among ruined men who believed in good luck the more the lower they fell from it and their fearful admiration of my imprisoned father was as if i had drunk a stupefying liquor i was unable clearly to reflect on it daily afterwards until i released him i made journeys to usurers to get a loan on the faith of the reversion of my mothers estate heriot like the real friend he was helped me with his name to the bond when my father stood free i had the proudest heart alive and as soon as we had parted the most amazed for a long while for years the thought of him was haunted by racketballs and bearded men in their shirtsleeves a scene sickening to ones pride yet it had grown impossible for me to think of him without pride i delighted to hear him we were happy when we were together and moreover he swore to me on his honour in mrs waddys presence that he and the constable would henceforth keep an even pace his exuberant cheerfulness and charming playfulness were always fascinating his visions of our glorious future enchained me how it was that something precious had gone out of my life i could not comprehend julia rippengers marriage with captain bulsted was an agreeable distraction unfortunately for my peace of mind she went to the altar poignantly pale my aunt dorothy settled the match she had schemed it her silence and halfdowncast look seemed to confess for the sake of her own repose but neither to her nor to others did that come of it i wrote a plain warning of the approaching catastrophe to heriot and received his reply after it was over to this effect in my regiment we have a tolerable knowledge of women they like change old richie and we must be content to let them take their twenty shillings for a sovereign i myself prefer the navy to the army i have no right to complain once she swore one thing now she has sworn another we will hope the lady will stick to her choice and not seek smaller change i could not forgive coppers that s quoting your dad i have no wish to see the uxorious object though you praise him his habit of falling under the table is middling oldfashioned but she may like him the better or she may cure him whatever she is as a woman she was a very nice girl to enliven the atmosphere of the switch i sometimes look at a portrait i have of j r which i fancy mrs william bulsted has no right to demand of me but supposing her husband thinks he has why then i must consult my brother officers we want a war old richie and i wish you were sitting at our mess and not mooning about girls and women i presumed from this that heriots passion for julia was extinct aunt dorothy disapproved of his tone which i thought admirably philosophical and coxcombically imitable an expression of the sort of thing i should feel on hearing of janet ilchesters nuptials the daring and success of that foreign adventure of mine had with the aid of colonel and clara goodwin convinced the squire of the folly of standing between me and him i loved it was considered the best sign possible that he should take me down on an inspection of his various estates and his great coalmine and introduce me as the heir who would soon relieve him of the task perhaps he thought the smell of wealth a promising cure for such fits of insubordination as i had exhibited my occasional absences on my own account were winked at on my return the squire was sour and snappish i cheerful and complaisant i grew cold and he solicitous he would drink my health with a challenge to heartiness and i drank to him heartily and he relapsed to a fit of sulks informing me that in his time young men knew when they were well off and asking me whether i was up to any young mens villanies had any concealed debts perchance because if sooh he knew the ways of youngsters especially when they fell into bad hands the list of bad titles rumbled on in an underbreath like cowardly thunderwell to cut the matter short because if so his chequebook was at my service didnt i know that eh not being immediately distressed by debt i did not exhibit the gush of gratitude and my sedate thank you sir confused his appeal for some sentimental show of affection i am sure the poor old man suffered pangs of jealousy i could even at times see into his breast and pity him he wanted little more than to be managed but a youth when he perceives absurdity in opposition to him chafes at it as much as if he were unaware that it is laughable had the squire talked to me in those days seriously and fairly of my fathers character i should have abandoned my system of defence to plead for him as before a judge by that time i had gained the knowledge that my father was totally of a different construction from other men i wished the squire to own simply to his loveable nature i could have told him women did without citing my dear aunt dorothy or so humble a creature as the devoted mrs waddy he had sincere friends among women who esteemed him and were staunch adherents to his cause and if the widow of the city knight lady sampleman aimed openly at being something more she was not the less his friend nor was it only his powerful animation generosity and grace that won them there occurred when i was a little past twenty already much in his confidence one of those strange crucial events which try a man publicly and bring out whatever can be said for and against him a young welsh heiress fell in love with him she was i think seven or eight months younger than myself a handsome intelligent highspirited girl rather wanting in polish and perhaps in the protecting sense of decorum she was wellborn of courseshe was welsh she was really wellbred too though somewhat brusque the young lady fell hopelessly in love with my father at bath she gave out that he was not to be for one moment accused of having encouraged her by secret addresses it was her unsolicited avowalthought by my aunt dorothy immodest not by methat she preferred him to all living men her name was anna penrhys the squire one morning received a letter from her family requesting him to furnish them with information as to the antecedents of a gentleman calling himself augustus fitzgeorge frederick william richmond guelph roy for purposes which would they assured him warrant the inquiry he was for throwing the letter aside shouting that he thanked his god he was unacquainted with anybody on earth with such an infernal list of names as that roy who knew anything of roy it happens to be my fathers present name said i it sounds to me like the name of one of those blackguard adventurers who creep into families to catch the fools pursued the squire not hearing me with his eyes the letter at least must be answered my aunt dorothy said it shall be answered the squire worked himself up to roar he wrote a reply the contents of which i could guess at from my aunts refusal to let me be present at the discussion of it the letter despatched was written by her with his signature her eyes glittered for a whole day then came a statement of the young ladys case from bath look at that look at that cried the squire and went on look at that in a muffled way there was a touch of dignity in his unforced anger my aunt winced displeasingly to my sight i see nothing to astonish one nothing to astonish one the squire set his mouth in imitation of her you see nothing to astonish one well maam when a man grows old enough to be a grandfather i do see something astonishing in a child of nineteenby george its out o nature but you women like monstrosities oh i understand heres an heiress to fifteen thousand a year its not astonishing if every ruined gambler and scapegrace in the kingdoms hunting her hot no no thats not astonishing i suppose she has her money in a coal mine the squire had some of his in a coalmine my mother once had it was the delivery of a blow at my father signifying that he had the scent for this description of wealth i left the room the squire then affected that my presence had constrained him by bellowing out epithets easy for me to hear in the hall and out on the terrace he vowed by solemn oath he was determined to save this girl from ruin my aunts speech was brief i was summoned to bath by my father in a curious peremptory tone implying the utmost urgent need of me i handed the letter to the squire at breakfast saying you must spare me for a week or so sir he spread the letter flat with his knife and turned it over with his fork harry said he halfkindly and choking youre better out of it im the best friend he could have by him sir youre the best tool he could have handy for youre a gentleman i hope i shant offend you grandfather but i must go dont you see harry richmond youre in for an infernal marriage ceremony there the young lady is not of age interposed my aunt eh an infernal elopement then its clear the girls madheads cracked as a cocoanut bowled by a monkey brains nowhere harry youre not a greenhorn you dont suspect youre called down there to stop it do you you jump plump into a furious lot of the girls relatives you might as well take a header into a leechpond come youre a man think for yourself dont have this affair on your conscience boy i tell you harry richmond im against your going you go against my will you offend me sir you drag my name and blood into the mire shes welsh is she those welsh are addlepated every one poor girl he threw a horrible tremour into his accent of pity my aunt expressed her view mildly that i was sent for to help cure the young lady of her delusion and take her himself cried the squire harry you wouldnt go and do that why the law man the lawthe whole country d be up about it youll be stuck in a coloured caricature he was really alarmed lest this should be one of the consequences of my going and described some of the scourging caricatures of his day with an intense appreciation of their awfulness as engines of the moral sense of the public i went nevertheless chapter xxi a promenade in bath i found my father at his hotel sitting with his friend jorian dewitt whom i had met once before and thought clever he was an excaptain of dragoons a martyr to gout and addicted to burgundy which necessitated his resorting to the waters causing him as he said between his appetites and the penance he paid for them to lead the life of a pendulum my father was in a tempered gay mood examining a couple of the county newspapers one abused him virulently he was supported by the other after embracing me he desired me to listen while he read out opposing sentences from the columns of these eminent journals the person calling himself roy whose monstrously absurd pretensions are supposed to be embodied in this selfdubbed surname the celebrated and courtly mr richmond roy known no less by the fascination of his manners than by his romantic history has very soon succeeded in making himself the talk of the town has latterly become the theme of our teatables which is always the adventurers privilege through no fault of his own that we may throw light on the blushing aspirations of a crowsconced cupid it will be as well to recall the antecedents of this if no worse preposterous imitation buck of the old school suffice it without seeking to draw the veil from those affecting chapters of his earlier career which kindled for him the enthusiastic sympathy of all classes of his countrymen that he is not yet free from a tender form of persecution we think we are justified in entitling him the perkin warbeck of society reference might be made to mythological heroes hereat i cried out mercy captain dewitt stretched nursing a leg removed his silk handkerchief from his face to murmur the bass stedfastly drowns the treble if this is meant for harmony my father rang up the landlord and said to him the choicest of your cellar at dinner today mr lumley and mind you i am your guest and i exercise my right of compelling you to sit down with us and assist in consuming a doubtful quality of wine we dine four lay for five if your conscience is bad and i excuse you the man smirked he ventured to say he had never been so tempted to supply an inferior article my father smiled on him you invite our editorial advocate said captain dewitt our adversary said my father i protested i would not sit at table with him but he assured me he believed his advocate and his adversary to be one and the same and referred me to the collated sentences the man must earn his bread richie boy to tell truth it is the advocate i wish to rebuke and to praise the adversary it will confound him it does me said dewitt you perceive jorian a policy in dining these men of the press now and occasionally considering their growing power do you not ay ay its a great gossiping machine mon roy i prefer to let it spout i crave your permission to invite him in complimentary terms cousin jorian he is in the town remember it is for the good of the nation that he and his like should have the opportunity of studying good society as to myself personally i give him carte blanche to fire his shots at me near the fashionable hour of the afternoon my father took my arm captain dewitt a stick and we walked into the throng and buzz whenever you are to quote our advocate the theme of teatables richie said my father walk through the crowd it will wash you it is doing us the honour to observe us we in turn discover an interest in its general countenance he was received as we passed with much staring here and there a lifting of hats and some blunt nodding that incensed me but he feeling me bristle squeezed my hand and talked of the scene and ever and anon gathered a line of heads and shed an indulgent bow along them so on to the casino not once did he offend my taste and make my acute sense of selfrespect shiver by appearing grateful for a recognition or anxious to court it though the curtest salute met his acknowledgement the interior of the casino seemed more hostile i remarked it to him a trifle more eyeglassy he murmured he was quite at his easy there we walk up and down my son he said in answer to a question of mine because there are very few who can even walking is an art and if nobody does the place is dull the place is pretty well supplied with newspapers said captain dewitt and dowagers friend jorian they are cousins tis the fashion to have our tattle done by machinery they have their opportunity to compare the portrait with the original come invent some scandal for us let us make this place our social exchange i warrant a good bold piece of invention will fit them too some of them madammy father bowed low to the beckoning of a fan i trust your ladyship did not chance to overhear that last remark i made the lady replied i should have shut my eyes if i had i called you to tell me who is the young man for twenty years i have lived in the proud belief that he is my son i would not disturb it for the world she did me the honour to inspect me from the lowest waistcoat button to the eyebrows bring him to me tonight captain dewitt you have forsaken my whisttables purely temporary fits of unworthiness my lady in english gout not gout in the conscience i trust said my father oh thats curable laughed the captain you men of repartee would be nothing without your wickedness the lady observed man was supposed to be incomplete captain dewitt affected a murmur she nodded yes yes and lifted eyes on my father so you have not given up going to church he bent and spoke low she humphed her lips very well i will see it must be a night in the early part of the week after next then i really dont know why i should serve you but i like your courage i cannot consent to accept your ladyships favour on account of one single virtue said he drooping she waved him to move forward during this frothy dialogue i could see that the ear of the assembly had been caught by the sound of it that my father informed me is the great lady wilts now you will notice a curious thing lady wilts is not so old but that as our jorian here says of her she is marriageable hence richie she is a queen to make the masculine knee knock the ground i fear the same is not to be said of her rival lady denewdney whom our good jorian compares to an antiquated fledgeling emerging with effort from a nest of ill construction and worse cement she is rich she is sharp she uses her quill she is emphatically not marriageable bath might still accept her as a rival queen only she is always behindhand in seizing an occasion now you will catch sight of her fan working in a minute she is envious and imitative it would be undoubtedly better policy on her part to continue to cut me she cannot she is beginning to rustle like decembers oaks if lady wilts has me why she must we refrain from noticing her until we have turned twice ay richie there is this use in adversity it teaches one to play sword and target with etiquette and retenue better than any crowned king in europe for me now to cross to her summons immediately would be a gross breach of homage to lady wilts who was inspired to be the first to break through the fence of scandal environing me but i must still show that i am independent these people must not suppose that i have to cling to a party let them take sides i am on fair terms with both the rivals i show just such a nuance of a distinction in my treatment of them just suchenough i mean to make the flattered one warm to me and t other be jealous of her ay richie these things are trivial things beyond the grave but here are we my boy and by the way i suspect the great campaign of my life is opening captain dewitt said that if so it would be the tenth to his certain knowledge not great campaign my father insisted mere skirmishes before this they conversed in humorous undertones each in turn seeming to turn over the earth of some amusing reminiscence so rapt that as far as regarded their perception of it the assembly might have been nowhere perhaps consequently they became observed with all but undivided attention my fathers hand was on my shoulder his head toward captain dewitt instead of subduing his voice he gave it a moderate pitch at which it was not intrusive and was musical to my ear charming especially when he continued talking through his soft laughter like a hunter that would in good humour press for his game through links of waternymphs lady denewdneys fan took to beating time meditatively two or three times she kept it elevated and in vain the flow of their interchangeing speech was uninterrupted at last my father bowed to her from a distance she signalled his eyelids pleaded short sight awakening to the apprehension of a pleasant fact the fan tapped and he halted his march leaning scarce perceptibly in her direction the fan showed distress thereupon his voice subsided in his conversation with a concluding flash of animation across his features like a brook that comes to the leap on a descent and he left us captain dewitt and i were led by a common attraction to the portico the truth being that we neither of us could pace easily nor talk with perfect abandonment under eyefire any longer look said he to me pointing at the equipages and equestrians youll see a sight like this in dozensdozens of our cities and towns the wealth of this country is frightful my reply addressed at the same time mentally to temple at sea was well as long as we have the handsomest women i dont care captain dewitt was not so sure that we had the provencal women the women of a part of south germany and certain favoured spots of italy might challenge us he thought this was a point i could argue on or i should rather say take up the cudgels for i deemed such opinions treason to ones country and an outrage to common sense and i embarked in controversy with the singleminded intention of knocking down the man who held them he accepted his thrashing complacently now here comes a young lady on horseback he said do you spy her dark hair thick eyebrows rides well followed by a groom is she a beauty in the heat of patriotism i declared she was handsome and repeated it though i experienced a twinge of remorse like what i should have felt had i given minerva the apple instead of venus oh he commented and stepped down to the road to meet her beginning in my hearing i am the bearer of a compliment her thick eyebrows stood in a knot then she glanced at me and hung pensive she had not to wait a minute before my father came to her side i knew you would face them she said he threw back his head like a swimmer tossing spray from his locks you have read the paper he asked you have horsewhipped the writer she rejoined oh the poor penster nay we cant pretend to pity him could we condescend to offer him satisfaction would he dare to demand it we will lay the case before lady wilts tonight you are there tonight at lady denewdneys tomorrow nightif i may indulge a hope both oh bravo bravo tell me nothing more just now how did you manage it i must have a gallop yes i shall be at both be sure of that my father introduced me let me present to your notice my son harry lepel richmond miss penrhys she touched my fingers and nodded at me speaking to him he has a boys taste i hear he esteems me moderately wellfavoured an inherited error certain to increase with age now you have started me she exclaimed and lashed the flanks of her horse we had evidently been enacting a part deeply interesting to the population of bath for the heads of all the strolling groups were bent on us and when miss penrhys cantered away down dropped eyeglasses and the promenade returned to activity i fancied i perceived that my father was greeted more cordially on his way back to the hotel you do well richie he observed in preserving your composure until you have something to say wait for your opening it will come and the right word will come with it the main things are to be able to stand well walk well and look with an eye at home in its socket i put you my hand on any man or woman born of high bloodnot a brazen eyeof the two extremes i prefer the beaten spaniel sortblindfold me but i put you my hand on them as to repartee you must have it wait for that too do not he groaned do not force it bless my soul what is there in the world so bad and rising to the upper notes of his groan ignorance density total imbecility is better i would rather any day of my life sit and carve for gueststhe grossest of human trials a detestable dinner than be doomed to hear some wretched fellowand you hear the old as well as the youngexcruciate feelings which where they exist cannot but be exquisitely delicate goodness gracious me to see the man pumping up his wit for me my visage is of an unalterable gravity whenever i am present at one of these exhibitions i care not if i offend let them say i wish to revolutionize societyi declare to you richie boy delightful to my heart though i find your keen stroke of repartee still your fellow who takes the thrust gracefully knows when hes traversed by a masterstroke and yields sign of it instead of plunging like a spitted buffalo and asking us to admire his agilityyou follow mei say i hold that manand i delight vastly in ready wit it is the wine of languagei regard that man as the superior being true he is not so entertaining my father pressed on my arm to intimate with a cavernous significance of eyebrow that captain dewitt had the gift of repartee in perfection jorian said he will you wager our editor declines to dine with us the answer struck me as only passable i think it was when rats smell death in toasted cheese captain dewitt sprang up the staircase of our hotel to his bedroom i should not have forced him my father mused jorian dewitt has at times brilliant genius richiein the way of rejoinders i mean this is his happy momenthis one hours dressing for dinner i have watched him he most thoroughly enjoys it i am myself a quick or slow dresser as the case may be but to watch jorian you cannot help entering into his enjoyment of it he will have his window with a view of the sunset there is his fire his warmed linen and his shirtstuds his bath his choice of a dozen things he will or will not wear the landlords or hosts menu is up against the lookingglass and the extremely handsome miniature likeness of his wife who is in the madhouse by a celebrated painter i forget his name jorian calls this new birthyou catch his idea he throws off the old and is on with the new with a highly hopeful anticipation his valet is a scoundrel but never fails in extracting the menu from the cook wherever he may be and in fine is too attentive to the hours devotion to be discarded poor jorian i know no man i pity so much i conceived him i confessed hardly pitiable though not enviable he has but six hundred a year and a passion for burgundy said my father we were four at table the editor came and his timidity soon wore off in the warmth of hospitality he appeared a kind exciteable little man glad of his dinner from the first and in due time proud of his entertainer his response to the toast of the fourth estate was an apology for its behaviour to my father he regretted it he regretted it a vinous speech my father heard him out addressing him subsequently i would not interrupt you in the delivery of your sentiments he said i must however man to man candidly tell you i should have wished to arrest your expressions of regret they convey to my mind an idea that on receipt of my letter of invitation you attributed to me a design to corrupt you protest nothing i beg editors are human after all now my object is that as you write of me you should have some knowledge of me and i naturally am interested in one who does me so much honour the facts of my life are at your disposal for publication and comment simply i entreat you say this one thing of me i seek for justice but i never complain of my fortunes providence decidesthat might be the motto engraven on my heart nay i may risk declaring it is in the end i shall be righted meanwhile you contribute to my happiness by favouring me with your society ah sir replied the little man were all our great people like you in the countrythe provincesthey treat the representatives of the fourth estate as the squires a couple of generations back used to treat the parsons what have you got a place at their tables inquired captain dewitt no i cannot say thatnot even below the salt mr richmondmr roy you may not be aware of it i am the proprietor of the opposition journals in this county i tell you in confidence one by itself would not pay and i am a printer sir and it is on my conscience to tell you i have in the course of business been compelled this very morning to receive orders for the printing of various squibs and i much fear scurrilous things my father pacified him you will do your duty to your family mr hickson deeply moved the little man pulled out proofsheets and slips even now at the eleventh hour he urged there is time to correct any glaring falsehoods insults what not my father accepted the copy of proofs not a wordnot a line you spoke of the eleventh hour mr hickson if we are at all near the eleventh i must be on my way to make my bow to lady wilts or is it lady denewdneys tonight no tomorrow night a light of satisfaction came over mr hicksons face at the mention of my fathers visiting both these sovereign ladies as soon as we were rid of him captain dewitt exclaimed if thats the fourth estate whats the realm the estate pleaded my father is here in its infancyon all fours prehensile egad it has the vices of the other three besides its own do you mean that by putting it on all fours jorian i have noticed that when you are malignant you are not witty we have to thank the man for not subjecting us to a pledge of secresy my lady wilts will find the proofs amusing and mark i do not examine their contents before submitting them to her inspection you will testify to the fact i was unaware that my father played a masterstroke in handing these proofsheets publicly to lady wilts for her perusal the incident of the evening was the display of her character shown by miss penrhys in positively declining to quit the house until she likewise had cast her eye on them one of her aunts wept their carriage was kept waiting an hour you ask too much of me i cannot turn her out lady wilts said to her uncle and aside to my father you will have to marry her in heavens name keep me from marriage my lady i heard him reply there was sincerity in his tone when he said that chapter xxii conclusion of the bath episode the friends of miss penrhys were ill advised in trying to cry down a man like my father active persecution was the breath of life to him when untroubled he was apt to let both his ambition and his dignity slumber the squibs and scandal set afloat concerning him armed his wit nerved his temper touched him with the spirit of enterprise he became a new creature i lost sight of certain characteristics which i had begun to ponder over critically i believed with all my heart that circumstances were blameable for much that did not quite please me upon the question of his magnanimity as well as of his courage there could not be two opinions he would neither retort nor defend himself i perceived some grandeur in his conduct without however appreciating it cordially as i did a refinement of discretion about him that kept him from brushing good taste while launched in ostentatious displays he had a fine tact and a keen intuition he may have thought it necessary to throw a little dust in my eyes but i doubt his having done it for he had only as he knew to make me jealous to blind me to his faults utterly and he refrained in his allusions to the young lady he was apologetic affectionate one might have fancied oneself listening to a gracious judge who had well weighed her case and exculpated her from other excesses than that of a generous folly jorian dewitt a competent critic pronounced his behaviour consummate at all points for my behoof he hinted antecedent reverses to the picture meditating upon which i traced them to the fatal want of money and that i might be able to fortify him in case of need i took my own counsel and wrote to my aunt for the loan of as large a sum as she could afford to send her eagerness for news of our doings was insatiable you do not describe her she replied not naming miss penrhys and again i can form no image of her your accounts of her are confusing tell me earnestly do you like her she must be very wilful but is she really nice i want to know how she appears to my harrys mind my father borrowed these letters and returning them to me said a good soul the best of women therethere is a treasure lost his forehead was clouded in speaking he recommended me to assure my aunt that she would never have to take a family interest in miss penrhys but this was not deemed perfectly satisfactory at riversley my aunt wrote am i to understand that you harry raise objections to her think first whether she is in herself objectionable she is rich she may be prudent she may be a forethoughtful person she may not be able to support a bitter shock of grief she may be one who can help she may not be one whose heart will bear it put your own feelings aside my dearest our duties cannot ever be clear to us until we do it is possible for headstrong wilfulness and secret tenderness to go together think whether she is capable of sacrifice before you compel her to it do not inflict misery wantonly one would like to see her harry i brood on your future that is why i seem to you preternaturally anxious about you she seemed to me preternaturally anxious about miss penrhys my father listened in silence to my flippant satire on womens letters he answered after a pause our jorian says that womens letters must be read like anagrams to put it familiarly they are like a childs field of hopscotch you may have noticed the urchins at their game a bit of tile and a variety of compartments to pass it through to the base hopping or no richie pooh tis an unworthy comparison this hopscotch i mean laddie they write in zigzags and so will you when your heart trumpets in your ear tell her tell that dear noble good womansay we are happy you and i and alone and shall be and do me the favourshe loves you my son address her sometimesshe has been itcall her mother she will like it she deservesnothing shall supplant her he lost his voice she sent me three hundred pounds she must have supposed the occasion pressing thus fortified against paternal improvidence i expended a hundred in the purchase of a horse and staked the remainder on him in a match and was beaten disgusted with the horse i sold him for half his purchasemoney and with that sum paid a bill to maintain my fathers credit in the town figuratively speaking i looked at my hands as astonished as i had been when the poor little rascal in the street snatched my cake and gave me the vision of him gorging it in the flurried alley of the london crowd money goes i remarked that is the general experience of the nature of money said my father freshly but nevertheless you will be surprised to find how extraordinarily few are the people to make allowance for particular cases it plays the trick with everybody and almost nobody lets it stand as a plea for the individual here is jorian and you my son and perhaps your aunt dorothy and upon my word i think i have numbered all i knowor ay sukey sampleman i should not omit her in an honourable listand that makes positively all i know who would commiserate a man touched on the shoulder by a sheriffs officernot that such an indignity is any longer done to me i hope we have seen the last of shylocks greatgrandnephew said i emphatically merely to give you the instance richie ay i hope so i hope so but it is the nature of money that you never can tell if the boardings sound once be dependent upon it but this is talk for tradesmen thinking it so myself i had not attempted to discover the source of my fathers income such as it was it was paid halfyearly and spent within a month of the receipt for the most signal proof possible of its shameful insufficiency thus ten months of the year at least he lived protesting and many with him compulsorily for two months he was a brilliant man i penetrated his mystery enough to abstain from questioning him and enough to determine that on my coming of age he should cease to be a pensioner petitioner and adventurer he aimed at a manifest absurdity in the meantime after the lesson i had received as to the nature of money i saw with some alarm my father preparing to dig a great pit for it he had no doubt performed wonders despite of scandal and tattle and the deadly report of a penniless fortunehunter having fascinated the young heiress he commanded an entrance to the receptions of both the rival ladies dominant these ladies lady wilts and lady denewdney who moved each in her select halfcircle and could heretofore be induced by none to meet in a common centre had pledged themselves to honour with their presence a ball he proposed to give to the choice world here assembled on a certain illuminated day of the calendar so i have now possession of bath richie said he twinkling to propitiate me lest i should suspect him of valuing his achievements highly he had he continued promised hickson of the fourth estate that he would before leaving the place do his utmost to revive the ancient glories of bath bath had once set the fashion to the kingdom why not again i might have asked him why at all or why at his expense but his lead was irresistible captain dewitt and his valet and i and a score of ladies scores of tradesmen were rushing reluctant or not on a torrent my part was to show that i was an athlete and primarily that i could fence and shoot it will do no harm to let it be known said dewitt he sat writing letters incessantly my father made the tour of his fair stewardesses from noon to three after receiving in audience his jewellers linendrapers carpenters confectioners from nine in the morning till twelve at three oclock business ceased workmen then applying to him for instructions were despatched to the bar of the hotel bearing the recommendation to the barmaid not to supply them refreshment if they had ever in their lives been seen drunk at four he dressed for afternoon parade nor could his enemy have said that he was not the chief voice and eye along his line of march his tall full figure maintained a superior air without insolence and there was a leaping beam in his large blue eyes together with the signification of movement coming to his kindly lips such as hardly ever failed to waken smiles of greeting people smiled and bowed and forgot their curiosity forgot even to be critical while he was in sight i can say this for i was acutely critical of their bearing the atmosphere of the place was never perfectly pleasing to me my attitude of watchful reserve and my reputation as the heir of immense wealth tended possibly to constrain a certain number of the inimical party to be ostensibly civil lady wilts who did me the honour to patronize me almost warmly complimented me on my manner of backing him as if i were the hero but i felt his peculiar charm she partly admitted it making a whimsical mouth saying in allusion to miss penrhys i you know am past twenty at twenty forty is charming at forty twenty where i served him perhaps was in showing my resolution to protect him he had been insulted before my arrival the male relatives of miss penrhys did not repeat the insult they went to lady wilts and groaned over their hard luck in not having the option of fighting me i was in her phrase a new piece on the board and checked them thus if they provoked a challenge from me they brought the destructive odour of powder about the headstrong creatures name i was therefore of use to him so far i leaned indolently across the rails of the promenade while she bent and chattered in his ear and her attendant cousin and cavalier chewed vexation in the form of a young mustachios curl his horse fretted he murmured deep notes and his look was savage but he was bound to wait on her and she would not go until it suited her pleasure she introduced him to meas if conversation could be carried on between two young men feeling themselves simply pieces on the board one giving check and the other chafing under it i need not say that i disliked my situation it was worse when my father took to bowing to her from a distance unobservant of her hands prompt pull at the reins as soon as she saw him lady wilts had assumed the right of a woman still possessing attractions to exert her influence with him on behalf of the family for i had done my best to convince her that he entertained no serious thought of marrying and decidedly would not marry without my approval he acted on her advice to discourage the wilful girl how is it i am so hateful to you miss penrhys accosted me abruptly i fancied she must have gone mad and an interrogative frown was my sole answer oh i hear that you pronounce me everywhere unendurable she continued you are young and you misjudge me in some way and i should be glad if you knew me better byandby in walesare you fond of mountain scenery we might be good friends my temper is not badat least i hope not heaven knows what ones relatives think of one will you visit us i hear you have promised your confidante lady wilts at a dancing party where we met she was thrown on my hands by her ungovernable vehemence and i as i had told lady wilts not being able to understand the liking of twenty for forty fifty would have been nearer the actual mark or sixty offered her no lively sympathy i believe she had requested my father to pay public court to her if captain dewitt was to be trusted she desired him to dance and dance with her exclusively and so confirm and defy the tattle of the town but my father hovered between the dowagers she in consequence declined to dance which was the next worse thing she could do an aunt a miserable woman was on her left on her right she contrived too frequently for my peace of mind to reserve a vacant place for me and she eyed me intently across the room under her persistent brows until perforce i was drawn to her side i had to listen to a repetition of sharp queries and replies and affect a flattered gaiety feeling myself most uncomfortably as captain dewitt who watched us said chip the son of block the father by fixing the son beside her she defeated the fathers scheme of coldness and made it appear a concerted piece of policy even i saw that i saw more than i grasped love for my father was to my mind a natural thing a proof of taste and goodness women might love him but the love of a young girl with the mornings mystery about her and for my progenitora girl as i reflected in the midst of my interjections wellbuilt cleareyed animated clever with soft white hands and pretty feet how could it be she was sombre as a sunken fire until he at last came round to her and then her sudden vivacity was surprising affairs were no further advanced when i had to obey the squires commands and return to riversley missing the night of the grand ball with no profound regret except for my fathers sake he wrote soon after one of his characteristic letters to tell me that the ball had been a success immediately upon this announcement he indulged luxurious reflections as his manner was to have stirred up the old place and given it something to dream of for the next half century is a satisfaction richie i have a kindness for bath i leave it with its factions reconciled its teatables furnished with inexhaustible supplies of the chief thing necessary and the persuasion firmly established in my own bosom that it is impossible to revive the past so we must march with the age and let me add all but every one of the bills happily discharged to please you pray fag at your german if as i myself confess to you have enjoyment of old ways habits customs and ceremonies look to court life it is only in courts that a man may now air a leg and there the women are works of art if you are deficient in calves which my boy thank heaven will never be charged with you are there found out and in fact every deficiency every qualification is at once in patent exhibition at a court i fancy parliament for you still and that is no impediment as a step jorian would have you sit and wallow in ease and buy by the way we might think of it a famous burgundy vineyard for an investment devote the prime of your life to the discovery of a cook your manhood to perfect the creatures educationso forth i imagine you are to get five years of ample gratification a promise hardly to be relied on in the sere leaf and so perish take poor jorian for an example of what the absence of ambition brings men to i treasure jorian i hoard the poor fellow to have him for a lesson to my boy witty and shrewd and a masterly tactician i wager he would have won his spurs on the field of battle you see him now living for one hour of the dayabsolutely twentythree hours of the mans life are chained slaves beasts of burden to the fourandtwentieth so i repeat fag at your german miss penrhys retires to her native wales jorian and i on to london to the continent plinlimmon guard us all i send you our local newspapers that i cut entrechats is false it happens to be a thing i could do and not an englishman in england except myself only i did not do it i did appear in what i was educated to believe was the evening suit of a gentleman and i cannot perceive the immodesty of showing my leg a dress that is not indecent and is becoming to me and is the dress of my fathers i wear and i impose it on the generation of my sex however i dined hickson of the fourth estate jorian considers him hungry enough to eat up his twentieth before he diesi forget the wording of the mot that he might know i was without rancour in the end as originally i had been without any intention of purchasing his allegiance he offered me his columns he wished me luck with the heiress by his gods he swore he worshipped entrechats and held a silk leg the most admirable work of the manufactures sir youre a gentleman says he youre a nobleman sir you re a prince you re a star of the first magnitude cries jorian retract that scum you see nothing large but what you dare to think neighbours you and quarrels the inebriate dog and this is the maker and destroyer of reputations in his day i study hickson as a miraculous engine of the very simplest contrivance he is himself the epitome of a verdict on his period next day he disclaimed in his opposition penny sheet the report of the entrechats and the spectators laughing consumedly and sent me as i had requested him to do the names of his daughters to whom i transmit little comforting presents for if they are nice children such a parent must afflict them cultivate lady wilts you have made an impression she puts you forward as a good specimen of our young men hem madam but my dear boy as i said we cannot revive the past i acknowledge it bath rebukes my last fit of ambition and the experience is very well worth the expense you have a mind richie for discussing outlay upon which i congratulate you so long as you do not overlook equivalents the system of the world is barter varied by robbery show that you have something in hand and you enjoy the satisfaction of knowing that you were not robbed i pledge you my word to iti shall not repeat bath and mark you an heiress is never compromised i am not i hope responsible for every creature caught up in my circle of attraction believe me dear boy i should consult you and another one estimable beyond mortal speech if i had become involvedimpossible no i am free of all fresh chains because of the old ones years will not he sufficient for us when you and i once begin to talk in earnest when i open to resumeso i leave bath with a light conscience mixed with pleasant recollections is the transient regret that you were not a spectator of the meeting of the wilts and denewdney streams jorian compared them to the rhone and thei forget the name of the river below genevadirtyish for there was a transparent difference in the denewdney style of dress and did i choose it i could sit and rule those two factions as despotically as buonaparte his frenchmen ask me what i mean by scaling billows richie i will some day tell you i have done it all my life and here i am but i thank heaven i have a son i love and i can match him against the best on earth and henceforward i live for him to vindicate and right the boy and place him in his legitimate sphere from this time i take to looking exclusively forward and i labour diligently i have energies not to boast darling old son i tell truth i am only happy when my heart is beating near you here comes the mother in me pumping up adieu lebe wohl the germanthe germanmay god in his barmherzigkeittell her i never encouraged the girl have literally nothing to trace a temporary wrinkle on my forehead as regards conscience i say may it please providence to make you a good german scholar by the day of your majority hurrah for it present my humble warm respects to your aunt dorothy i pray to heaven nightly for one of its angels on earth kunst wissenschaft ehre liebe die liebe quick at the german poets frau fraulein i am actually dazzled at the prospect of our future to be candid i no longer see to write gruss dich herzlich from vienna to you next lebe wohl my aunt dorothy sent a glance at the letter while i was folding it evidently thinking my unwillingness to offer it a sign of bad news or fresh complications she spoke of miss penrhys oh thats over said i heiresses soon get consoled she accused me of having picked up a vulgar idea i maintained that it was my fathers it cannot be your fathers said she softly and on affirming that he had uttered it and written it she replied in the same tone more effective than the ordinary language of conviction he does not think it the rage of a youth to prove himself in the right of an argument was insufficient to make me lay the letter out before other eyes than my own and i shrank from exposing it to compassionate gentle eyes that would have pleaded similar allowances to mine for the wildness of the style i should have thanked but despised the intelligence of one who framed my excuses for my father just as the squire by abusing him would have made me a desperate partisan in a minute the vitality of the delusion i cherished was therefore partly extinct not so the love yet the love of him could no longer shake itself free from oppressive shadows out of his circle of attraction books were my resource etext editors bookmarks he would neither retort nor defend himself i laughed louder than was necessary tis the fashion to have our tattle done by machinery
