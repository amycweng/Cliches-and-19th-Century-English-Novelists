chapter xxxvi is conclusive as to the heartlessness of women with brains hymenaeal rumours are those which might be backed to run a victorious race with the tale of evil fortune and clearly for the reason that mans livelier half is ever alert to speed them they travel with an astonishing celerity over the land like flames of the dry beaconfaggots of old time in announcement of the invader or a conquest gathering as they go wherein to say nothing of their vastly wider range they surpass the electric wires mans nuptial half is kindlingly concerned in the launch of a new couple it is the business of the fair sex and man himself very strangely but nature quickens him still lends a not unfavouring eye to the preparations of the matrimonial vessel for its oily descent into the tides where billows will soon be rising captain and mate soon discussing the fateful question of who is commander we consent it appears to hope again for mankind here is another chance or else assuming the happiness of the pair that pomp of ceremonial contrasted with the little windblown candle they carry between them catches at our weaker fibres after so many ships have foundered some keel up like poisoned fish at the first drink of water it is a gallant spectacle let us avow and either the world perpetuating it is heroical or nature incorrigible in the species marriages are unceasing friends do it and enemies the unknown contractors of this engagement or armistice inspire an interest it certainly is both exciting and comforting to hear that man and woman are ready to join in a mutual affirmative say yes together again it sounds like the end of the war the proclamation of the proximate marriage of a young minister of state and the greatest heiress of her day notoriously the young minister of state of a famous book written by the beautiful now writhing woman madly enamoured of himand the heiress whose dowry could purchase a duchy this was a note to make the gossips of england leap from their beds at the midnight hour and wag tongues in the marketplace it did away with the political hubbub over the tonans article and let it noise abroad like nonsense the hon percy dacier espouses miss asper and she rescues him from the snares of a siren he her from the toils of the papists she would have gone over to them she was going when luckily for the protestant faith percy dacier intervened with his proposal town and country buzzed the news and while that dreary league trumpeted about the business of the nation a people suddenly become oriental chattered of nothing but the blissful union to be celebrated in princely state with every musical accessory short of operatic lady wathin was an active agent in this excitement the excellent woman enjoyed marriages of high life which as there is presumably wealth to support them are manifestly under sanction and a marriage that she could consider one of her own contrivance had a delicate flavour of a marriage in the family not quite equal to the seeing a dear daughter of her numerous progeny conducted to the altar but excelling it in the pomp that bids the heavens open she and no other spread the tidings of miss aspers debating upon the step to rome at the very instant of percy daciers declaration of his love and it was a beautiful struggle that of the halfdedicated nun and her deeprooted earthly passion love prevailing she sent word to lady dunstane you know the interest i have always taken in dear constance aspen etc inviting her to come on a visit a week before the end of the month that she might join in the ceremony of a wedding likely to be the grandest of our time pitiful though it was to think of the bridal pair having but eight or ten days at the outside for a honeymoon the beauty of their mutual devotion to duty was urged by lady wathin upon all hearers lady dunstane declined the invitation she waited to hear from her friend and the days went by she could only sorrow for her poor tony divining her state however little of wrong in the circumstances they imposed a silence on her decent mind and no conceivable shape of writing would transmit condolences she waited with a dull heartache by no means grieving at daciers engagement to the heiress until redworth animated her as the bearer of rather startling intelligence indirectly relating to the soul she loved an accident in the street had befallen mr warwick redworth wanted to know whether diana should be told of it though he had no particulars to give and somewhat to his disappointment lady dunstane said she would write she delayed thinking the accident might not be serious and the information of it to diana surely would be so next day at noon her visitor was lady wathin evidently perturbed and anxious to say more than she dared but she received no assistance after beating the air in every direction especially dwelling on the fond reciprocal affection of the two devoted lovers to be united within three days time lady wathin said at last and is it not shocking i talk of a marriage and am appalled by a death that poor man died last night in the hospital i mean poor mr warwick he was recovering getting strong and well and he was knocked down at a streetcrossing and died last night it is a warning to us mr redworth happened to hear of it at his club near which the accident occurred and he called at the hospital mr warwick was then alive said lady dunstane adding well if prevention is better than cure as we hear accidents are the specific for averting the maladies of age which are a certain crop lady wathins eyelids worked and her lips shut fast at the coldhearted remark void of meaning she sighed so ends a life of misery my dear you are compassionate i hope so but indeed i must speak if you will let me i think of the living lady dunstane widened her eyes of mrs warwick she has now the freedom she desired i think of others forgive me but constance asper is to me as a daughter i have perhaps no grounds for any apprehension love so ardent so sincere was never shown by bridegroom elect and it is not extraordinary to those acquainted with dear constance butone may be a worshipped saint and experience defection the terrible stories one hears of a power of fascination almost lady wathin hung for the word infernal said lady dunstane whose brows had been bent inquiringly have no fear the freedom you allude to will not be used to interfere with any entertainment in prospect it was freedom my friend desired now that her jewel is restored to her she is not the person to throw it away be sure and pray drop the subject one may rely you think oh oh this release coming just before the wedding i should hardly suppose the man to be the puppet you depict or indicate it is because menso manyare not puppets that one is conscious of alarm your previous remark said lady dunstane sounded superstitious your present one has an antipodal basis but as for your alarm check it and spare me further my friend has acknowledged powers considering that she does not use them you should learn to respect her lady wathin bowed stiffly she refused to partake of lunch having she said satisfied her conscience by the performance of a duty and arranged with her flyman to catch a train her cousin lady dunstane smiled loftily at everything she uttered and she felt that if a woman like this mrs warwick could put division between bloodrelatives she could do worse and was to be dreaded up to the hour of the nuptials i meant no harm in coming she said at the shaking of hands no no i understand said her hostess you are henhearted over your adopted brood the situation is perceptible and your intention creditable as one of the good women of the world lady wathin in departing was indignant at the tone and dialect of a younger woman not modestly concealing her possession of the larger brain brains in women she both dreaded and detested she believed them to be devilish here were instancesthey had driven poor sir lukin to evil courses and that poor mr warwick straight under the wheels of a cab sir lukins name was trotting in public with a naughty mrs fryargunnetts mrs warwick might still trim her arts to baffle the marriage women with brains moreover are all heartless they have no pity for distress no horror of catastrophes no joy in the happiness of the deserving brains in men advance a household to station but brains in women divide it and are the wrecking of society fortunately lady wathin knew she could rally a powerful moral contingent the aptitude of which for a oneminded cohesion enabled it to crush those fractional daughters of mischief she was a really good woman of the world heading a multitude the same whom you are accustomed to hear exalted lucky in having had a guided girlhood a thickcurtained prudence and in having stock in the moral funds shares in the sentimental tramways wherever the world laid its hoards or ran its lines she was found and forcible enough to be eminent though at fixed hours of the day even as she washed her hands she abjured worldliness a performance that cleansed her if she did not make morality appear loveable to the objects of her dislike it was owing to her want of brains to see the origin nature and right ends of morality but a world yet more deficient than she esteemed her cordially for being a bulwark of the present edifice which looks a solid structure when the microscope is not applied to its components supposing percy dacier a dishonourable tattler as well as an icy lover and that lady wathin through his bride had become privy to the secret between him and diana there is reason to think that she would have held it in terror over the baneful woman but not have persecuted her for she was by no means the active malignant of theatrical plots no she would have charged it upon the possession of brains by women and have had a further motive for inciting the potent dignitary her husband to employ his authority to repress the sexs exercise of those fell weapons hurtful alike to them and all coming near them so extreme was her dread of mrs warwick that she drove from the london railway station to see constance and be reassured by her tranquil aspect sweet constance and her betrothed percy were together examining a missal lady dunstane despatched a few words of the facts to diana she hoped to hear from her rather hoped for the moment not to see her no answer came the great day of the nuptials came and passed she counted on her husbands appearance the next morning as the good gentleman made a point of visiting her to entertain the wife he adored whenever he had a wallet of gossip that would overlay the blank of his absence he had been to the church of the weddinghe did not say with whom all the world was there and he rapturously described the ceremony stating that it set women weeping and caused him to behave like a fool you are impressionable said his wife he murmured something in praise of the institution of marriagewhen celebrated impressively it seemed tony calls the social world the theatre of appetites as we have it at present she said and the world at a wedding is one may reckon in the second act of the hungry tragicomedy yes theres the breakfast sir lukin assented mrs fryargunnett was much more intelligible to him in fact quite so as to her speech emmas heart now yearned to her tony consulting her strength she thought she might journey to london and on the third morning after the dacierasper marriage she started dianas door was open to arthur rhodes when emma reached it have you seen her she asked him his head shook dolefully mrs warwick is unwell she has been working too hard you also im afraid no he could deny that whatever the look of him come to me at copsley soon said she entering to danvers in the passage my mistress is upstairs my lady said danvers she is lying on her bed she is ill she has been lying on her bed ever since since what lady dunstane spoke sharply danvers retrieved her indiscretion since she heard of the accident my lady take my name to her or no i can venture i am not allowed to go in and speak to her you will find the room quite dark my lady and very cold it is her command my mistress will not let me light the fire and she has not eaten or drunk of anything since she will die if you do not persuade her to take nourishment a little for a beginning it wants the beginning emma went upstairs thinking of the enigmatical maid that she must be a good soul after all dianas bedroom door was opened slowly you will not be able to see at first my lady danvers whispered the bed is to the left and a chair i would bring in a candle but it hurts her eyes she forbids it emma stepped in the chill thick air of the unlighted london room was cavernous she almost forgot the beloved of her heart in the thought that a living woman had been lying here more than two days and nights fasting the proof of an uttermost misery revived the circumstances within her to render her friends presence in this desert of darkness credible she found the bed by touch silently and distinguished a dark heap on the bed she heard no breathing she sat and listened then she stretched out her hand and met her tonys it lay open it was the hand of a drowned woman shutters and curtains and the fireless grate gave the room an appalling likeness to the vaults so like to the home of death it seemed that in a few minutes the watcher had lost count of time and kept but a wormy memory of the daylight she dared not speak for some fear of startling for the worse fear of never getting answer tonys hand was lifeless her clasp of it struck no warmth she stung herself with bitter reproaches for having let common mundane sentiments worthy of a lady wathin bar her instant offer of her bosom to the beloved who suffered in this depth of mortal agony tonys love of a man as she should have known would be wrought of the elements of our being when other women named happiness she said life in division death her body lying still upon the bed here was a soul borne onward by the river of death the darkness gave sight after a while like a curtain lifting on a veil the dead light of the underworld tony lay with her face up her underlip dropped straight from head to feet the outline of her face without hue of it could be seen sign of the hapless women that have souls in love hateful love of men emma thought and was moved to feel at the wrist for her darlings pulse he has killed her the thought flashed as with pangs chilling her frame the pressure at the wrist continued insensible of the faintest beat she clasped it trembling in pain to stop an outcry it is emmy said the voice emmas heart sprang to heaven on a rush of thanks my tony she breathed softly she hung for a further proof of life in the motionless body tony she said the answer was at her hand a threadlike return of her clasp it is emmy come to stay with you never to leave you the thin still answer was at her hand a moment the fingers fell away a deep breath was taken twice to say dont talk to me emma retained the hand she was warned not to press it by the deadness following its effort to reply but tony lived she had given proof of life over this little wavering taper in the vaults emma cowered cherishing the hand silently hoping for the voice it came winter it is a cold winter tony my dear will be cold i will light the fire emma lost no time in deciding to seek the matchbox the fire was lit and it flamed it seemed a revival in the room coming back to the bedside she discerned her tonys lacklustre large dark eyes and her hollow cheeks her mouth open to air as to the drawingin of a sword rather as to the releaser than the sustainer her feet were on the rug her maid had placed to cover them emma leaned across the bed to put them to her breast beneath her fur mantle and held them there despite the halfanimate tug of the limbs and the shaft of iciness they sent to her very heart when she had restored them to some warmth she threw aside her bonnet and lying beside tony took her in her arms heaving now and then a deep sigh she kissed her cheek it is emmy kiss her i have no strength emma laid her face on the lips they were cold even the breath between them cold has emmy been long here dear i think so i am with my darling tony moaned the warmth and the love were bringing back her anguish she said i have been happy it is not hard to go emma strained to her tony will wait for her souls own soul to go the two together there was a faint convulsion in the body if i cry i shall go in pain you are in emmys arms my beloved tonys eyes closed for forgetfulness under that sensation a tear ran down from her but the pain was lag and neighboured sleep like the pleasure so passed the short winter day little spoken then emma bethought her of a way of leading tony to take food and she said i shall stay with you i shall send for clothes i am rather hungry dont stir dear i will be mistress of the house she went below to the kitchen where a few words in the ear of a frenchwoman were sufficient to waken immediate comprehension of what was wanted and smart service within ten minutes an appetizing bouillon sent its odour over the bedroom tony days back had said her last to the act of eating but emma sipping at the spoon and expressing satisfaction was a pleasant picture the bouillon smelt pleasantly your servants love you emma said ah poor good souls they crowded up to me to hear of you madame of course at the first word was off to her pots and we english have the habit of calling ourselves the practical peoplethis bouillon is consummatehowever we have the virtues of barbarians we can love and serve for love i never tasted anything so good i could become a glutton do said tony i should be ashamed to drain the bowl all to myself a solitary toper is a horrid creature unless he makes a song of it emmy makes a song of it to me but pledge me is a noble saying when you think of humanitys original hunger for the whole it is there that our civilizing commenced and i am particularly fond of hearing the call it is grandly historic so pledge me tony we two can feed from one spoon it is a closer bond than the loving cup i want you just to taste it and excuse my gluttony tony murmured no the spoon was put to her mouth she sighed to resist the stronger will compelled her to move her lips emma fed her as a child and nature sucked for life the first effect was a gush of tears emma lay with her that night when the patient was the better sleeper but during the night at intervals she had the happiness of feeling tonys hand travelling to make sure of her chapter xxxvii an exhibition of some champions of the stricken lady close upon the hour of ten every morning the fortuitous meeting of two gentlemen at mrs warwicks housedoor was a signal for punctiliously stately greetings the salutation of the raised hat and a bow of the head from a position of military erectness followed by the remark i trust you are well sir to which the reply i am very well sir and trust you are the same was deemed a complimentary fulfilment of their mutual obligation in presence mr sullivan smiths initiative imparted this exercise of formal manners to mr arthur rhodes whose renewed appearance at the minute of his own arrival he viewed as he did not conceal with a disappointed and a reproving eye the inquiry after the state of mrs warwicks health having received its tolerably comforting answer from the footman they left their cards in turn then descended the doorsteps faced for the performance of the salute and departed their contrary ways the pleasing intelligence refreshed them one morning that they would be welcomed by lady dunstane thereupon mr sullivan smith wheeled about to mr arthur rhodes and observed to him sir i might claim by right of seniority to be the foremost of us two in offering my respects to the lady but the way is open to you sir said mr arthur rhodes permit me to defer to your many superior titles to that distinction the honour sir lies rather in the bestowing than in the taking i venture to think sir that though i cannot speak pure castilian i require no lesson from a grandee of spain in acknowledging the dues of my betters i will avow myself conquered sir by your overpowering condescension said mr sullivan smith and i entreat youto ascribe my acceptance of your brief retirement to the urgent character of the business i have at heart he laid his fingers on the panting spot and bowed mr arthur rhodes likewise bowing deferentially fell to rearward if i mistake not said the irish gentleman i am indebted to mr rhodes and we have been joint participators in the hospitality of mrs warwicks table the english gentleman replied it was there that i first had the pleasure of an acquaintance which is graven on my memory as the words of the wise king on tablets of gold and silver mr sullivan smith gravely smiled at the unwonted match he had found in ceremonious humour in saxonland and saying i shall not long detain you mr rhodes he passed through the doorway arthur waited for him pacing up and down for a quarter of an hour when a totally different man reappeared in the same person and was the sullivan smith of the rosy beaming features and princely heartiness he was accosted now my dear boy its your turn to try if you have a chance and good luck go with ye ive said what i could on your behalf for youre one of ten thousand in this country you are mr sullivan smith had solemnified himself to proffer a sober petition within the walls of the newly widowed ladys house namely for nothing less than that sweet ladys now unfettered hand and it had therefore been perfectly natural to him until his performance ended with the destruction of his hopes to deliver himself in the high castilian manner quite unexpected however was the reciprocal loftiness of tone spontaneously adopted by the young english squire for whom in consequence he conceived a cordial relish and as he paced in the footsteps of arthur anxious to quiet his curiosity by hearing how it had fared with one whom he had to suppose the second applicant he kept ejaculating not a bit the fellow cant be saxon and she had a liking for him shes nigh coming of the age when a woman takes to the chicks better he than another if its to be any one for hes got fun in him he carries his own condiments instead of borrowing from the popular castors as is their way over here but i might have known there s always sure to be salt and savour in the man she covers with her wing excepting if you please my dear lady a bad shot you made at a rascal cur no more worthy of you than beelzebub of paradise no matter the daughters of erin must share the fate of their mother isle that their tears may shine in the burst of sun to follow for personal and patriotic motives i would have cheered her and been like a wild ass combed and groomed and tamed by the adorable creature but her friend says there s not a whisk of a chance for me and i must roam the desert kicking up and worshipping the star i hail brightest they know me not who think i cant worship why what were i without my star at best a pickled porker sullivan smith became aware of a ravishing melodiousness in the soliloquy as well as a clean resemblance in the simile he would certainly have proceeded to improvize impassioned verse if he had not seen arthur rhodes on the pavement so heres the boy query the face he wears how kind of you to wait said arthur well call it sympathy for convenience rejoined sullivan smith well and what next you know as much as i do thank heaven she is recovering is that all why what more arthur was jealously inspected you look openhearted my dear boy sullivan smith blew the sound of a reflected ahem excuse me for cornemusing in your company he said but seriously there was only one thing to pardon your hurrying to the ladys door at such a season when the wind tells tales to the world shes down with a cold you know an influenza said arthur the simplicity of the acquiescence was vexatious to a champion desirous of hostilities to vindicate the lady in addition to his anxiety to cloak her sad plight she caught it from contact with one of the inhabitants of this country tis the fate of us irish and were condemned to it for the sin of getting tired of our own i begin to sneeze when i land at holyhead unbutton a waistcoat here in the hope of meeting a heart and youre lucky in escaping a pulmonary attack of no common severity while the dog that infected you scampers off to celebrate his honeymoon mayhap ah but call at her house in shoals the world ll soon be saying its worse than a coughing cold if you came to lead her out of it in triumph the laugh d be with you and the lady well covered d ye understand the allusion to the dogs honeymoon had put arthur rhodes on the track of the darting crackermetaphor i think i do he said she will soon be at copsleylady dunstanes house on the hillsand there we can see her and thats next to the happiness of consolingif only it had been granted shes not an ordinary widow to be caught when the tear of lamentation has opened a practicable path or waterway to the poor nightcapped jewel within so and youre a candid admirer mr rhodes well and ill be one with you for theres not a star in the firmament more deserving of homage than that lady lets walk in the park and talk of her said arthur theres no sweeter subject to me his boyish frankness rejoiced sullivan smith as long as you likenor to me he exclaimed and that ever since i first beheld her on the night of a ball in dublin before i had listened to a word of her speaking and she bore her fathers irish namenone of your warwicks and your but let the cur go barking he cant tell what hes lost perhaps he doesnt care and after inflicting his hydrophobia on her tender fame pooh sir you call it a civilized country where you and i and dozens of others are ready to start up as brothers of the lady to defend her and are paralyzed by the law tis a law theyve instituted for the protection of dirty dogstheir majority i owe more to mrs warwick than to any soul i know said arthur let s hear quoth sullivan smith proceeding shes the arabian nights in person thats sure and shakespeares plays tragic and comic and the book of celtic history and erin incarnatedown with a cold no matter where but we know where it was caught so theres a pretty library for whos to own her now shes enfranchized by circumstances and a poetical figure too he subsided for his companion to rhapsodize arthur was overcharged with feeling and could say only it would be another world to me if i lost her true but what of the lady no praise of mine could do her justice that may be but its negative of yourself and not a portrait of the object hasnt she the brain of socratesor better say minerva on the bust of venus and the remainder of her finished off to an exact resemblance of her patronymic goddess of the bow and quiver she has a wise head and is beautiful and chaste arthur reddened he was prepared to maintain it could not speak it she is to us in this london what the run of water was to theocritus in sicily the nearest to the visibly divine he said and was applauded good and on you go top me a few superlatives on that and i m your echo my friend isnt the seeing and listening to her like sitting under the silvery canopy of a fountain in high summer all the comparisons are yours arthur said enviously mr rhodes you are a poet i believe and all you require to loosen your tongue is a drop of bacchus so if you will do me the extreme honour to dine with me at my club this evening well resume the toast that should never be uttered dry you reprove me justly my friend arthur laughed and accepted the club was named and the hour and some items of the little dinner the birds and the year of the wines it surprised him to meet mr redworth at the table of his host a greater surprise was the partial thaw in redworths bearing toward him but as it was partial and he a youth and poor not even the genial influences of bacchus could lift him to loosen his tongue under the repressing presence of the man he knew to be his censor though sullivan smith encouraged him with praises and opportunities he thought of the many occasions when mrs warwicks art of management had produced a tacit harmony between them she had no peer the dinner failed of the pleasure he had expected from it redworths bluntness killed the flying metaphors and at the end of the entertainment he and sullivan smith were drumming upon politics fancies he has the key of the irish difficulty said the latter clapping hand on his shoulder by way of blessing as they parted at the clubsteps redworth asked arthur rhodes the way he was going and walked beside him i suppose you take exercise dont get colds and that kind of thing he remarked in the old bullying fashion and changed it abruptly i am glad to have met you this evening i hope youll dine with me one day next week have you seen mrs warwick lately she is unwell she has been working too hard said arthur seriously unwell do you mean lady dunstane is at her house and speaks of her recovering ah youve not seen her not yet well goodnight redworth left him and only when moved by gratitude to the lad for his mention of mrs warwicks working too hard as the cause of her illness recollected the promised dinner and the need for having his address he had met sullivan smith accidentally in the morning and accepted the invitation to meet young rhodes because these two of all men living were for the moment dearest to him as diana warwicks true and simple champions and he had intended a perfect cordiality toward them both the end being a semiwrangle with the patriot and a patronizing bluntness with the boy who by the way would hardly think him sincere in the offer of a seat at his table he owned himself incomplete he never could do the thing he meant in the small matters not leading to fortune but they led to happiness redworth was guilty of a sigh for now diana warwick stood free doubly free he was reduced to reflect in a wavering dubiousness her more than inclination for dacier witnessed by him and the shot of the world flying randomly on the subject had struck this cuirassier making light of his armour without causing any change of his habitual fresh countenance as for the scandal it had never shaken his faith in her nature he thought of the passion his heart struck at dianas and whatever might by chance be true in the scandal affected him little if but her heart were at liberty that was the prize he coveted having long read the nature of the woman and wedded his spirit to it she would complete him of course infatuated men argue likewise and scandal does not move them at a glance the lower instincts and the higher spirit appear equally to have the philosophy of overlooking blemishes the difference between appetite and love is shown when a man after years of service can hear and see and admit the possible and still desire in worship knowing that we of earth are begrimed and must be cleansed for presentation daily on our passage through the miry ways but that our souls if flame of a soul shall have come of the agony of flesh are beyond the baser mischances partaking of them indeed but sublimely now redworth believed in the soul of diana for him it burned and it was a celestial radiance about her unquenched by her shifting fortunes her wilfulnesses and it might be errors she was a woman and weak that is not trained for strength she was a soul therefore perpetually pointing to growth in purification he felt it and even discerned it of her if he could not have phrased it the something sovereignty characteristic that aspired in diana enchained him with her or rather with his thought of her soul he understood the right union of women and men from the roots to the flowering heights of that rare graft she gave him comprehension of the meaning of love a word in many mouths not often explained with her wound in his idea of her he perceived it to signify a new start in our existence a finer shoot of the tree stoutly planted in good gross earth the senses running their live sap and the minds companioned and the spirits made one by the wholenatured conjunction in booth a happy prospect for the sons and daughters of earth divinely indicating more than happiness the speeding of us compact of what we are between the ascetic rocks and the sensual whirlpools to the creation of certain nobler races now very dimly imagined singularly enough the man of these feelings was far from being a social rebel his diana conjured them forth in relation to her but was not on his bosom to enlighten him generally his notions of citizenship tolerated the female pharisees as ladies offering us an excellent social concrete where quicksands abound and without quite justifying the lady wathins and constance aspers of the world whose virtues he could set down to accident or to acid blood he considered them supportable and estimable where the mrs fryargunnetts were innumerable threatening to become a majority as they will constantly do while the sisterhood of the chaste are wattled in formalism and throned in sourness thoughts of diana made phantoms of the reputable and their reverse alike he could not choose but think of her she was free and he too and they were as distant as the horizon sail and the aftfloating castaway her passion for dacier might have burnt out her heart and at present he had no claim to visit her dared not intrude he would have nothing to say if he went save to answer questions upon points of business as to which lady dunstane would certainly summon him when he was wanted riding in the park on a frosty morning he came upon sir lukin who looked gloomy and inquired for news of diana warwick saying that his wife had forbidden him to call at her house just yet shes got a cold you know said sir lukin adding confoundedly hard on womeneh obliged to keep up a show and id swear by all thats holy diana warwick hasnt a spot not a spot to reproach herself with i fancy i ought to know women by this time and look here redworth last night that is i mean yesterday evening i broke with a womana lady of my acquaintance you know because she would go on scandalmongering about diana warwick i broke with her i told her id have out any man who abused diana warwick and i broke with her by jove redworth those women can prove spitfires theyve bags of venom under their tongues barleysugar though they lookand thats her colour but i broke with her for good i doubt if i shall ever call on her again and in point of fact i wont mrs fryargunnett was described in the colouring of the lady sir lukin after some further remarks rode on and redworth mused on a moral world that allows a woman of mrs fryargunnetts like to hang on to it and to cast a stone at diana forgetful in his championship that diana was not disallowed a similar licence when he saw emma dunstane some days later she was in her carriage driving as she said to lawyerland for an interview with old mr braddock on her friends affairs he took a seat beside her no tony is not well she replied to his question under the veil of candour she is recovering but sheyou can understandsuffered a shock she is not able to attend to business and certain things have to be done i used to be her man of business redworth observed she speaks of your kind services this is mere matter for lawyers she is recovering you may see her at copsley next week you can come down on wednesdays or saturdays any day tell her i want her opinion upon the state of things it will please her but you will have to describe the state of things emma feared she had said too much she tried candour again for concealment my poor tony has been struck down low i suppose it is like losing a diseased limbshe has her freedom at the cost of a blow to the system she may be trusted for having strength said redworth yes emmas mild monosyllable was presently followed by an exclamation one has to experience the irony of fate to comprehend how cruel it is then she remembered that such language was peculiarly abhorrent to him irony of fate he echoed her i thought you were above that literary jargon and i thought i was or thought it would be put in a dialect practically explicable she answered smiling at the lion roused upon my word he burst out i should like to write a book of fables showing how donkeys get into grinding harness and dogs lose their bones and fools have their sconces cracked and all run jabbering of the irony of fate to escape the annoyance of tracing the causes and what are they nine times out of ten plain want of patience or some debt for indulgence theres a subjectlet some one write fables in illustration of the irony of fate and ill undertake to tackon my grandmothers maxims for a moral to teach of em we prate of that irony when we slink away from the lessonthe rod we conjure and you to talk of fate its the seed we sow individually or collectively im bound up in the prosperity of the country and if the ship is wrecked it ruins my fortune but not me unless im boundup in myself at least i hope thats my case he apologized for intruding mr thomas redworth his hearer looked at him thinking he required a more finely pointed gift of speech for the ironical tongue but relishing the tonic directness of his faculty of reason while she considered that the application of the phrase might be brought home to him so as to render my grandmothers moral a conclusion less comfortingly if quite intelligibly summary and then she thought of tonys piteous instance and thinking with her heart the tears insisted on that bitter irony of the heavens which bestowed the longwithheld and coveted boon when it was empty of value or was but as a handful of spices to a shroud perceiving the moisture in her look redworth understood that it was foolish to talk rationally but on her return to her beloved the real quality of the man had overcome her opposing state of sentiment and she spoke of him with an iteration and throb in the voice that set a singular query whirring round dianas ears her senses were too heavy for a suspicion chapter xxxviii convalescence of a healthy mind distraught from an abandonment that had the last pleasure of life in a willingness to yield it up diana rose with her friends help in some state of fortitude resembling the effort of her feet to bear the weight of her body she plucked her courage out of the dust to which her heart had been scattered and tasked herself to walk as the world does but she was indisposed to compassionate herself in the manner of the burdened world she lashed the creature who could not raise a head like others and made the endurance of torture a support such as the pride of being is to men she would not have seen any similarity to pride in it would have deemed it the reverse it was in fact the painful gathering of the atoms composing pride for she had not only suffered she had done wrongly and when that was acknowledged by the light of her sufferings the wrongdoing appeared gigantic chorussing eulogies of the man she had thought her lover and who was her lover once before the crime against him in the opening of her bosom to emma he was painted a noble figure one of those that romance delights to harass for the sake of ultimately the more exquisitely rewarding he hated treachery she had been guilty of doing what he most hated she glorified him for the incapacity to forgive it was to her mind godlike and her excuses of herself at the first confession she said she had none and sullenly maintained that there was none to exonerate little by little her story was relatedher version of the story for not even as woman to woman friend to greathearted friend pure soul to soul could diana tell of the state of shivering abjection in which dacier had left her on the fatal night of the many causes conducing to it and of the chief that was an unutterable secret bound by all the laws of feminine civilization not to be betrayed her excessive selfabasement and exaltation of him who had struck her down rendered it difficult to be understood and not till emma had revolved it and let it ripen in the mind some days could she perceive with any clearness her tonys motives or mania the very word money thickened the riddle for tony knew that her friends purse was her own to dip in at her pleasure yet she to escape so small an obligation had committed the enormity for which she held the man blameless in spurning her you see what i am emmy diana said what i do not see is that he had grounds for striking so cruelly i proved myself unworthy of him but does a man pretending to love a woman cut at one blow for such a cause the ties uniting her to him unworthiness of that kind is not commonly the capital offence in love tonys deep prostration and her resplendent picture of her judge and executioner kept emma questioning within herself gradually she became enlightened enough to distinguish in the man a known if not common type of the externally soft and polished internally hard and relentless who are equal to the trials of love only as long as favouring circumstances and seemings nurse the fair object of their courtship her thoughts recurred to the madness driving tony to betray the secret and the ascent unhelped to get a survey of it and her and the conditions was mountainous she toiled up but to enter the regions of cloud sure nevertheless that the obscurity was penetrable and excuses to be discovered somewhere having never wanted money herself she was unable perfectly to realize the urgency of the need she began however to comprehend that the very eminent gentleman before whom all human creatures were to bow in humility had for an extended term considerably added to the expenses of tonys household by inciting her to give those little dinners to his political supporters and bringing comrades perpetually to supperparties careless of how it might affect her character and her purse surely an honourable man was bound to her in honour tonys remark i have the reptile in me dear her exaggeration of the act in her resigned despairwas surely no justification for his breaking from her even though he had discovered a vestige of the common reptile to leave her with a stain on her namethere would not have been a question about it if tony had not exalted him so loftily refusing in visible pain to hear him blamed danvers had dressed a bed for lady dunstane in her mistresss chamber where often during the night emma caught a sound of stifled weeping or the long falling breath of wakeful grief one night she asked whether tony would like to have her by her side no dear was the answer in the dark but you know my old pensioners the blind fifer and his wife ive been thinking of them they were paid as they passed down the street yesterday my love yes dear i hope so but he flourishes his tune so absurdly ive been thinking that is the part i have played instead of doing the females duty of handing round the tincup for pennies i wont cry any more she sighed and turned to sleep leaving emma to disburden her heart in tears for it seemed to her that tonys intellect was weakened she not merely abased herself and exalted dacier preposterously she had sunk her intelligence in her sensations a state that she used to decry as the sin of mankind the origin of error and blood strangely too the proposal came from her or the suggestion of it notwithstanding her subjectedness to the nerves that she should show her face in public she said i shall have to run about emmy when i can fancy i am able to rattle up to the old mark at present i feel like a wrestler who has had a fall as soon as the stiffness is over its best to make an appearance for the sake of ones backers though i shall never be in the wrestling ring again that is a good decisionwhen you feel quite yourself dear tony emma replied i dare say i have disgraced my sex but not as they suppose i feel my new self already and can make the poor brute go through fire on behalf of the old what is the taskmerely to drive a face it is not known it will be known but this is a sealed secret nothing is a secret that has been spoken it s in the air and i have to breathe to live by it and i would rather it were out she betrayed him rather that than have them thinkanything they will exclaim how could she i have been unable to answer it to youmy own heart how oh our weakness is the swiftest dog to hunt us we cannot escape it but i have the answer for them that i trust with my whole soul none of them would have done the like none my tony would have taken it to the soul as you do i talk dear if i took it honestly i should be dumb soon dust the moment we begin to speak the guilty creature is running for cover she could not otherwise exist i am sensible of evasion when i open my lips but tony has told me all i think i have but if you excuse my conduct i am certain i have not dear girl accounting for it is not the same as excusing who can account for it i was caught in a whirloh nothing supernatural my weakness which it pleases me to call a madnessshift the ninetyninth when i drove down that night to mr tonans i am certain i had my clear wits but i felt like a bolt i saw things but at too swift a rate for the conscience of them ah let never necessity draw the bow of our weakness it is the soul that is winged to its perdition i remember i was writing a story named the man of two minds i shall sign it by the woman of two natures if ever it is finished capacity for thinking should precede the act of writing it should i do not say that it does capacity for assimilating the public taste and reproducing it is the commonest the stuff is perishable but it pays us for our labour and in so doing saves us from becoming tricksters now i can see that mr redworth had it in that big head of histhe authoress outliving her income he dared not speak why did he not dare would it have checked you i was a shot out of a gun and i am glad he did not stand in my way what power charged the gun is another question dada used to say that it is the devils masterstroke to get us to accuse him so fare ye well old nickie ben my dear i am a black sheep a creature with a spotted reputation i must wash and wash and not with waterwith sulphurflames she sighed i am down there where they burn you should have let me lie and die you were not kind i was going quietly my love cried emma overborne by a despair that she traced to the womans concealment of her bleeding heart you live for me do set your mind on that think of what you are bearing as your debt to emma will you tony bowed her head mechanically but i am in love with king death and must confess it she said that hideous eating you forced on me snatched me from him and i feel that if i had gone i should have been mercifully forgiven by everybody except by me said emma embracing her tony would have left her friend for her last voyage in mourning and my dearest will live to know happiness i have no more belief in it emmy the mistake of the world is to think happiness possible to the senses yes we distil that fine essence through the senses and the act is called the pain of life it is the death of them so much i understand of what our existence must be but i may grieve for having done so little that is the sound grief with hope at the corenot in love with itself and wretchedly mortal as we find self is under every shape it takes especially the chief one name it it is best named amor there was a writhing in the frame of the hearer for she did want love to be respected not shadowed by her misfortune her stillflushed senses protested on behalf of the eternalness of the passion and she was obliged to think emmas cold condemnatory intellect came of the no knowledge of it a letter from mr tonans containing an enclosure was a sharp trial of dianas endurance of the irony of fate she had spoken of the irony in allusion to her freedom now that according to a communication from her lawyers she was independent of the task of writing the letter which paid the price of her misery bruised her heavily read it and tear it all to strips she said in an abhorrence to emma who rejoined shall i go at once and see him can it serve any end but throw it into the fire oh no simulation of virtue there was not i think a stipulated return for what i did but i perceive clearlyi can read only by eventsthat there was an understanding you behold it i went to him to sell it he thanks me says i served the good cause well i have not that consolation if i had thought of the causeof anything high it would have arrested me on the fire with it the letter and square slip were consumed diana watched the blackening papers so they cease their sinning emmy and as long as i am in torment i may hope for grace we talked of the irony it means the pain of fire i spoke of the irony to redworth said emma incidentally of course and he fumed he is really not altogether the mr cuthbert dering of your caricature he is never less than acceptably rational i wont repeat his truisms but he said or i deduced from what he said that a grandmothers maxims would expound the enigma probably the simple is the deep in relation to the mysteries of life said diana whose wits had been pricked to a momentary activity by the letter he behaves wisely so perhaps we are bound to take his words for wisdom much nonsense is talked and written and he is one of the worlds reserves who need no more than enrolling to make a sturdy phalanx of common sense its a pity they are not enlisted and drilled to express themselves she relapsed but neither he nor any of them could understand my case he puts the idea of an irony down to the guilt of impatience tony could there be a keener irony than that a friend of dadas waited patiently for a small fortune and when it arrived he was a wornout man just assisted to go decently to his grave but he may have gained in spirit by his patient waiting oh true we are warmer if we travel on foot sunward but it is a discovery that we are colder if we take to ballooning upward the material good reverses its benefits the more nearly we clasp it all life is a lesson that we live to enjoy but in the spirit i will brood on your saying it is your own saying silly tony as the only things worth saying always are exclaimed emma as she smiled happily to see her friends mind reviving though it was faintly and in the dark chapter xxxix of nature with one of her cultivated daughters and a short excursion in anticlimax a mind that after a long season of oblivion in pain returns to wakefulness without a keen edge for the world is much in danger of souring permanently dianas love of nature saved her from the dire mischance during a two months residence at copsley by stupefying her senses to a state like the barely conscious breathing on the verge of sleep february blew southwest for the pairing of the birds a broad warm wind rolled clouds of every ambiguity of form in magnitude over peeping azure or skimming upon lakes of blue and lightest green or piling the amphitheatre for majestic sunset or sometimes those daughters of the wind flew linked and low semipurple threatening the shower they retained and teaching gloom to rouse a songful nest in the bosom of the viewer sometimes they were april variable to soar with rainskirts and sink with sunshafts or they drenched wood and field for a day and opened on the high southwestern star daughters of the wind but shifty daughters of this wind of the dropping sun they have to be watched to be loved in their transformations diana had arthur rhodes and her faithful leander for walking companions if arthur said such a day would be considered melancholy by london people she thanked him in her heart as a benefactor who had revealed to her things of the deepest the simplest were her food thus does nature restore us by drugging the brain and making her creature confidingly animal for its new growth she imagined herself to have lost the power to think certainly she had not the striving or the wish exercise of her limbs to reach a point of prospect and of her ears and eyes to note what bird had piped what flower was out on the banks and the leaf of what tree it was that lay beneath the budding satiated her daily desires she gathered unknowingly a sheaf of landscapes images keys of dreamed horizons that opened a world to her at any chance breath altering shape or hue a different world from the one of her old ambition her fall had brought her renovatingly to earth and the saving naturalness of the woman recreated her childlike with shrouded recollections of her strange taste of life behind her with a tempered fresh blood to enjoy aimlessly and what would erewhile have been a barrenness to her sensibilities in time the craving was evolved for positive knowledge and shells and stones and weeds were deposited on the librarytable at copsley botanical and geological books comparingly examined emma dunstane always eager to assist for the samples wafted her into the heart of the woods poor sir lukin tried three days of their society and was driven away headlong to clublife he sent down redworth with whom the walks of the zealous inquirers were profitable though diana in acknowledging it to herself reserved a decided preference for her foregone ethereal mood larger and untroubled by the presence of a man the suspicion emma had sown was not excited to an alarming activity but she began to question could the best of men be simplya womans friendwas not long service rather less than a proof of friendship she could be blind when her heart was on fire for another her passion for her liberty however received no ominous warning to look to the defences he was the same blunt speaker and knotted his brows as queerly as ever at arthur in a transparent calculation of how this fellow meant to gain his livelihood she wilfully put it to the credit of arthurs tact that his elder was amiable without denying her debt to the good man for leaving her illness and her appearance unmentioned he forbore even to scan her features dianas wan contemplativeness in which the sparkle of meaning slowly rose to flash as we see a bubble rising from the deeps of crystal waters caught at his heart while he talked his matteroffact but her instinct of a present safety was true she and arthur discoveredand it set her first meditating whether she did know the man so very accurately that he had printed for private circulation when at harrow school a little book a record of his observations in nature lady dunstane was the casual betrayer he shrugged at the nonsense of a boys publishing anybodys publishing he held for a doubtful proof of sanity his excuse was that he had not published opinions let us observe and assist in our small sphere not come mouthing to the footlights we retire diana said for herself and arthur the wise thing is to avoid the position that enforces publishing said he to the discomposure of his raw junior in the fields he was genially helpful commending them to the study of the southwest wind if they wanted to forecast the weather and understand the climate of our country we have no seasons or only a shuffle of them old calendars give seven months of the year to the southwest and thats about the average count on it you may generally reckon what to expect when you dont have the excess for a year or two you are drenched the year following he knew every bird by its flight and its pipe habits tricks hints of sagacity homely with the original human and his remarks on the sensitive life of trees and herbs were a spell to his thirsty hearers something of astronomy he knew but in relation to that science he sank his voice touchingly to diana who felt drawn to kinship with him when he had a pupils tone an allusion by arthur to the poetical work of aratus led to a memorably pleasant evenings discourse upon the long reading of the stars by these our mortal eyes altogether the mind of the practical man became distinguishable to them as that of a plain brother of the poetic diana said of him to arthur he does not supply me with similes he points to the source of them arthur with envy of the man of positive knowledge disguised an unstrung heart in agreeing redworth alluded passingly to the condition of public affairs neither of them replied diana was wondering how one who perused the eternal of nature should lend a thought to the dusty temporary of the world subsequently she reflected that she was asking him to confine his great male appetite to the nibble of bread which nourished her immediate sense of life her reflections were thin as mist coming and going like the mist with no direction upon her brain if they sprang from it when he had gone welcome though arthur had seen him to be she rebounded to a broader and cheerfuller liveliness arthur was flattered by an idea of her casting off incubusa most worthy gentleman and a not perfectly sympathetic associate her eyes had their lost light in them her step was brisker she challenged him to former games of conversation excursions in blank verse here and there as the mood dictated they amused themselves and emma too she revelled in seeing tonys younger face and hearing some of her natural outbursts that dacier never could have been the man for her would have compressed and subjected her and inflicted a further taste of bondage in marriage she was assured she hoped for the day when tony would know it and haply that another whom she little comprehended was her rightful mate march continued southwesterly and grew rainier as redworth had foretold bidding them look for gales and storm and then the change of wind it came after wettings of a couple scorning the refuge of dainty townsfolk under umbrellas and proud of their likeness to dripping wayside wildflowers arthur stayed at copsley for a week of the crisp northeaster and what was it when he had taken his leave that brought tony home from her solitary walk in dejection it could not be her seriously regretting the absence of the youthful companion she had parted with gaily appointing a time for another meeting on the heights and recommending him to repair idle hours with strenuous work the fit passed and was not explained the winds are sharp with memory the hard shrill wind crowed to her senses of an hour on the bleak sands of the french coast the beginning of the curtained misery inscribed as her happiness she was next day prepared for her term in london with emma who promised her to make an expedition at the end of it by way of holiday to see the crossways which mr redworth said was not tenanted you wont go through it like a captive said emma i dont like it dear diana put up a comic mouth the debts we owe ourselves are the hardest to pay that is the discovery of advancing age and i used to imagine it was quite the other way but they are the debts of honour imperative i shall go through it grandly you will see if i am stopped at my first recreancy and turned directly the contrary way i think i have courage you will not fear to meet any one said emma the world and all it contains i am robust eager for the fray an amazon a brazenfaced hussy fear and i have parted i shall not do you discredit besides you intend to have me back here with you and besides again i burn to make a last brave appearance i have not outraged the world dear emmy whatever certain creatures in it may fancy she had come out of her dejectedness with a shrewder view of dacier equally painful for it killed her romance and changed the garden of their companionship in imagination to a waste her clearing intellect prompted it whilst her nature protested and reviled her to uplift him he had loved her i shall die knowing that a man did love me once she said to her widowed heart and set herself blushing and blanching but the thought grew inveterate he could not bear much and in her quick brain it shot up a crop of similitudes for the quality of that mans love she shuddered as at a swift cleaving of cold steel he had not given her a chance he had not replied to her letter written with the pen dipped in her hearts blood he must have gone straight away to the woman he married this after almost justifying the scandalous worldafter she realized her sensations of that night when the housedoor had closed on him her feeling of lost sovereignty degradation feminine danger friendliness and she was unaware and never knew nor did the world ever know what cunning had inspired the frosty cupid to return to her and be warmed by striking a bargain for his weighty secret she knew too well that she was not of the snows which do not melt however high her conceit of herself might place her happily she now stood out of the sun in a bracing temperature polar and her compassion for women was deeply sisterly in tenderness and understanding she spoke of it to emma as her gain i have not seen that you required to suffer to be considerate emma said it is on my conscience that i neglected mary paynham among othersand because you did not take to her emmy the reading of it appears to me that she has neglected you she was not in my confidence and so i construe it as delicacy one never loses by believing the best if one is not duped expectations dupe us not trust the light of every soul burns upward of course most of them are candles in the wind let us allow for atmospheric disturbance now i thank you dear for bringing me back to life i see that i was really a selfish suicide because i feel i have power to do some good and belong to the army when we are beginning to reflect as i do now on a recovered basis of pure health we have the world at the dawn and know we are young in it with great riches great things gained and greater to achieve personally i behold a queer little wriggling worm for myself but as one of the active world i stand high and shapely and the very thought of doing work is like a draught of the desertsprings to me instead of which i have once more to go about presenting my face to vindicate my character mr redworth would admit no irony in that at all events it is anticlimax i forgot to tell you tony you have been proposed for said emma and there was a rush of savage colour over tonys cheeks her apparent apprehensions were relieved by hearing the name of mr sullivan smith my poor dear countryman and he thought me worthy did he some day when we are past his repeating it ill thank him the fact of her smiling happily at the narration of sullivan smiths absurd proposal by mediatrix proved to emma how much her nature thirsted for the smallest support in her selfesteem the second campaign of london was of bad augury at the commencement owing to the ridiculous intervention of a streetorgan that ground its pipes in a sprawling roar of one of the puritani marches just as the carriage was landing them at the door of her house the notes were harsh dissonant drunken interlocked and horribly torn asunder intolerable to ears not keen to extract the tune through dreadful memories diana sat startled and paralyzed the melody crashed a revival of her days with dacier as in gibes and yet it reached to her heart she imagined a providence that was trying her on the threshold striking at her feebleness she had to lock herself in her room for an hour of deadly abandonment to misery resembling the run of poison through her blood before she could bear to lift eyes on her friend to whom subsequently she said emmy there are wounds that cut sharp as the enchanters sword and we dont know we are in halves till some rough old intimate claps us on the back merely to ask us how we are i have to join myself together again as well as i can its done dear but dont notice the cement you will be brave emma petitioned i long to show you i will the meeting with those who could guess a portion of her story did not disconcert her to lady pennon and lady singleby she was the brilliant diana of her nominal luminary issuing from cloud face and tongue she was the same and once in the stream she soon gathered its current topics and scattered her arrowy phrases lady pennon ran about with them declaring that the beautiful speaker if ever down was up and up to her finest mark mrs fryargannett had then become the blazing regnant antisocial star a distresser of domesticity the magnetic attraction in the spirituous flames of that wild snapdragon bowl called the upper class and she was angelically blonde a strawcoloured beauty a lovely wheat sheaf if the head were ripe diana said of her threshed says her fame my dear lady pennon replied otherwise allusive a wheatsheaf of contention for the bread of wind said diana thinking of foolish sir lukin thoughtless of talking to a gossip she would have shot a lighter dart had she meant it to fly and fix proclaim ye classics what minor goddess or primal iris or ate sped straight away on wing to the empty wheatsheafears of the goldenvisaged amabel fryargunnett daughter of demeter in the field to behold of aphrodite in her rosy incendiarism for the many of men filling that pearly concave with a perversion of the uttered speech such as never lady could have repeated nor man if less than a reaping harvester which verily for women to hear is to stamp a substantial damnatory verification upon the delivery of the saying mrs warwick says of you that youre a bundle of straws for everybody and bread for nobody or stranger speculation through what and what number of conduits curious and variously colouring did it reach the fair amabel of the infantincradle smile in that deformation of the original utterance to pursue the thing would be to enter the subtersensual perfumed caverns of a romance of fashionable life with no hope of coming back to light other than by tail of lynx like the great arabian seaman at the last page of the final chapter a prospectively popular narrative indeed and coin to reward it and applause but i am reminded that a story properly closed on the marriage of the heroine constance and her young minister of state has no time for conjuring chemists bouquet of aristocracy to lure the native taste when we have satisfied english sentiment our task is done in every branch of art i hear and it will account to posterity for the condition of the branches those yet wakeful eccentrics interested in such a person as diana to the extent of remaining attentive till the curtain falls demand of me to gatherup the threads concerning her which my gardener sweeping his pile of dead leaves before the storm and night advises me to do speedily but it happens that her resemblance to her sex and species of a civilized period plants the main threads in her bosom rogues and a policeman or a hurried change of front of all the actors are not a part of our slow machinery nor is she to show herself to advantage only those who read her womans blood and character with the head will care for diana of the crossways now that the knot of her history has been unravelled some little love they must have for her likewise and how it can be quickened on behalf of a woman who never sentimentalizes publicly and has no dollydolly compliance and muses on actual life and fatigues with the exercise of brains and is in sooth an alien a princess of her kind and time but a foreign one speaking a language distinct from the mercantile trafficking in ideasthis is the problem for to be true to her one cannot attempt at propitiation she said worse things of the world than that which was conveyed to the boxed ears of mrs fryargunnett accepting the war declared against her a second time she performed the common mental trick in adversity of setting her personally known innocence to lessen her generally unknown errorbut anticipating that this might become known and the other not and feeling that the motives of the acknowledged error had served to guard her from being the culprit of the charge she writhed under she rushed out of a meditation compounded of mind and nerves with derision of the worlds notion of innocence and estimate of error it was a mood lasting through her stay in london and longer to the discomfort of one among her friends and it was worthy of the anticlimax expedition as she called it for the rest her demeanour to the old monster world exacting the servility of her in repayment for its tolerating countenance was faultless emma beheld the introduction to mrs warwick of his bride by mr percy dacier she had watched their approach up the ballroom thinking how differently would redworth and tony have looked differently had it been tony and dacier but emma could not persuade herself of a possible harmony between them save at the cost of tonys expiation of the sin of the greater heart in a performance equivalent to suttee perfectly an english gentleman of the higher order he seemed the effigy of a tombstone one fixed upright and civilly proud of his effigy bride so far emma considered them fitted she perceived his quick eye on her corner of the room necessarily for a man of his breeding without a change of expression an emblem pertaining to her creed was on the heroines neck also dependant at her waist she was white from head to foot a symbol of purity her frail smile appeared deeply studied in purity judging from her look and her reputation emma divined that the man was justly mated with a devious filmy sentimentalist likely to fiddle harmonics on the sensual strings for him at a mad rate in the years to come such fiddling is indeed the peculiar diversion of the opulent of a fatly prosperous people who take it one may concede to them for an inspired elimination of the higher notes of life the very highest that saying of tonys ripened with full significance to emma now not sensualism but sham spiritualism was the meaning and however fine the notes they come skilfully evoked of the underbrute in us reasoning it so she thought it a saying for the penetration of the most polished and deceptive of the later human masks she had besides be it owned a triumph in conjuring a sentence of her friends like a swords edge to meet them for she was boiling angrily at the ironical destiny which had given to those two a beclouding of her beloved whom she could have rebuked in turn for her insane caprice of passion but when her beloved stoodup to greet mrs percy dacier all idea save tremulous admiration of the valiant woman who had been wounded nigh to death passed from emmas mind diana tempered her queenliness to address the favoured lady with smiles and phrases of gentle warmth of goodness of nature and it became a halo rather than a personal eclipse that she cast emma looked at dacier he wore the prescribed conventional air subject in half a minute to a rapid blinking of the eyelids his wife could have been inimically imagined fascinated and dwindling a spot of colour came to her cheeks she likewise began to blink the happy couple bowed proceeding and emma had daciers back for a study we score on that flat slate of man unattractive as it is to hostile observations and unprotected the device we choose her harshest was the positive thought that he had taken the woman best suited to him doubtless he was a man to prize the altarcandle above the lamp of day she fancied the backview of him shrunken and straitened perhaps a mere hostile fancy though it was conceivable that he should desire as little of these meetings as possible eclipses are not courted the specially womanly exultation of emma dunstane in her friends noble attitude seeing how their sex had been struck to the dust for a trifling error easily to be overlooked by a manful lover and had asserted its dignity in physical and moral splendour in selfmastery and benignness was unshared by diana as soon as the business of the expedition was over her orders were issued for the sale of the lease of her house and all it contained i would sell danvers too she said but the creature declines to be treated as merchandize it seems i have a faithful servant very much like my life not quite to my taste the one thing out of the wreckwith my dog before quitting her house for the return to copsley she had to grant mr alexander hepburn posthaste from his caledonia a private interview she came out of it noticeably shattered nothing was related to emma beyond the remark i never knew till this morning the force of no in earnest the weighty little wordwomans native watchdog and guardian if she calls it to her aid in earnesthad encountered and withstood a fiery ancient host astonished at its novel power of resistance emma contented herself with the result were you much supplicated an operatic fourthact said diana by no means feeling so flippantly as she spoke she received while under the impression of this mans honest if primitive ardour of courtship or effort to capture a characteristic letter from westlake choicely phrased containing presumeably an application for her hand in the generous offer of his own her reply to a pursuer of that sort was easy comedy after the barbaric attack refreshed her wits and reliance on her natural fencing weapons to westlake the unwritten no was conveyed in a series of kindly ironic subterfuges that played it like an impish flea across the pages just giving the bloom of the word and rich smiles come to emmas life in reading the dexterous composition which however proved so thoroughly to westlakes taste that a second and a third exercise in the comedy of the negative had to be despatched to him from copsley chapter xl in which we see nature making of a woman a maid again and a thrice whimsical on their way from london after leaving the station the drive through the valley led them past a field where cricketers were at work bowling and batting under a vertical sun not a very comprehensible sight to ladies whose practical tendencies as observers of the other sex incline them to question the gain of such an expenditure of energy the dispersal of the alphabet over a printed page is not less perplexing to the illiterate as soon as emma dunstane discovered the copsley head gamekeeper at one wicket and actually thomas redworth facing him bat in hand she sat up greatly interested sir lukin stopped the carriage at the gate and reminded his wife that it was the day of the year for the men of his estate to encounter a valley eleven redworth like the good fellow he was had come down by appointment in the morning out of london to fill the number required copsley being weak this year eight of their wickets had fallen for a lament able figure of twentynine runs himself cleanbowled the first ball but tom redworth had got fast hold of his wicket and already scored fifty to his bat there grand hit sir lukin cried the ball flying hard at the rails once a cricketer always a cricketer if youve legs to fetch the runs and pullens not doing badly his business is to stick we shall mark them a hundred yet i do hate a score on our side without the two s he accounted for redworths mixed colours by telling the ladies he had lent him his flannel jacket which against black trousers looked odd but not ill gradually the enthusiasm of the booth and bystanders converted the flying of a leather ball into a subject of honourable excitement and why are you doing nothing sir lukin was asked and he explained my stumps are down im married he took his wifes hand prettily diana had a malicious prompting she smothered the wasp and said oh look at that grand hit again oh good good cried sir lukin clapping to it while the longhitoff ran spinning his legs into one for an impossible catch and the batsmen were running and stretching bats and the ball flying away flying back and others after it and still the batsmen running till it seemed that the ball had escaped control and was leading the fielders on a coltish innings of its own defiant of bowlers diana said merrily bravo our side bravo old tom redworth rejoined sir lukin four and a three and capital weather havent we hope we shall have same sort day next month return match my ground ive seen tom redworth scoreold daysover two hundred t his bat and he used to bowl too but bowling wants practice and emmy look at the old fellows lining the booth pipe in mouth and cheering they do enjoy a day like this well have a supper for fifty at copsleysits fun by jove we must have reached up to near the hundred he commissioned a neighbouring boy to hie to the booth for the latest figures and his emissary taught lightning a lesson diana praised the little fellow yes hes a real english boy said emma we ve thousands of em thousands ready to your hand exclaimed sir lukin and a confounded radicalized country he murmured gloomily of lets us be kicked any amount of insult meek as gruel making of the finest army the world has ever seen you saw the papers this morning good heaven how a nation with an atom of selfrespect can go on standing that sort of bullying from foreigners we do were insulted and were threatened and we call for a hymn now then my man what is it the boy had flown back ninetytwo marked sir ninetynine runs one more for the hundred well reckoned and mind youre up at copsley for the return match and tom redworth says they may bite their thumbs to the bonethey dont hurt us i tell him he has no sense of national pride he says were not prepared for war we never are and whose the fault says were a peaceful people but ware who touches us he doesnt feel a kickoh clever snick hurrah for the hundredtwothree no dont force the running you foolsthough they re wild with the ball hanoall right the wicket stood hurrah the heat of the noonday sun compelled the ladies to drive on enthusiasm has the privilege of not knowing monotony said emma he looks well in flannels yes he does diana replied aware of the reddening despite her having spoken so simply i think the chief advantage men have over us is in their amusements their recreations that is the better word diana fanned her cheeks and said she was warm i mean the permanent advantage for you see that age does not affect them tom redworth is not a patriarch my dear well he is what would be called mature he cant be more than thirtytwo or three and that for a man of his constitution means youth well i can imagine him a patriarch playing cricket i should imagine you imagine the possible chances he is the father who would play with his boys and lock up his girls in the nursery diana murmured of the extraordinary heat emma begged her to remember her heterodox views of the education for girls he bats admirably said diana i wish i could bat half as well your batting is with the tongue not so good and a solid bat or bludgeon to defend the poor stumps is surer but there is the difference of cricketwhen your stumps are down you are idle at leisure not a miserable prisoner supposing all marriages miserable to the mind of me said diana and observed emmas rather saddened eyelids for a proof that schemes to rob her of dear liberty were certainly planned they conversed of expeditions to redworths berkshire mansion and to the crossways untenanted at the moment as he had informed emma who fancied it would please tony to pass a night in the house she loved but as he was to be of the party she coldly acquiesced the woman of flesh refuses pliancy when we want it of her and will not until it is her good pleasure be bent to the development called a climax as the puppetwoman mother of fiction and darling of the multitude ever amiably does at a hint of the nuptial chapter diana in addition sustained the weight of brains neither with waxen optics nor with subservient jointings did she go through her pathways of the world her direct individuality rejected the performance of simpleton and her lively blood the warmer for its containment quickened her to penetrate things and natures and if as yet in justness to the loyal male friend she forbore to name him conspirator she read both him and emma whose inner bosom was revealed to her without an effort to see but her characteristic chasteness of mind not coldness of the bloodwhich had supported an arduous conflict past all existing rights closely to depict and which barbed her to pierce to the wishes threatening her freedom deceived her now to think her flaming blushes came of her relentless divination on behalf of her recovered treasure whereby the clear reading of others distracted the view of herself for one may be the cleverest alive and still hoodwinked while blood is young and warm the perpetuity of the contrast presented to her reflections of redworths healthy open practical cheering life and her own freakishly interwinding darkly penetrative simulacrum of a life cheerless as well as useless forced her humiliated consciousness by degrees in spite of pride to the knowledge that she was engaged in a struggle with him and that he was the strongerit might be the worthier she thought him the handsomer he throve to the light of day and she spun a silly web that meshed her in her intricacies her intuition of emmas wishes led to this he was constantly before her she tried to laugh at the image of the concrete cricketer half flannelled and red of face the lucky calculator as she named him to emma who shook her head and sighed the abstract healthful and powerful man able to play besides profitably working defied those poor efforts consequently at once she sent up a bubble to the skies where it became a spheral realm of far too fine an atmosphere for men to breathe in it and thither she transported herself at will whenever the contrast with its accompanying menace of a tyrannic subjugation overshadowed her in the above the kingdom composed of her shattered romance of life and her present aspirings she was free and safe nothing touched her therenothing that redworth did she could not have admitted there her ideal of a hero it was the sublimation of a virgins conception of life better fortified against the enemy she peopled it with souls of the great and pure gave it illimitable horizons dreamy nooks ravishing landscapes melodies of the poets of music higher and morecelestial than the salvatore it was likewise now she could assure herself serenely independent of the horrid bloodemotions living up there she had not a feeling the natural result of this habit of ascending to a superlunary home was the loss of an exact sense of how she was behaving below at the berkshire mansion she wore a supercilious air almost as icy as she accused the place of being emma knew she must have seen in the library a row of her literary ventures exquisitely bound but there was no allusion to the books mary paynhams portrait of mrs warwick hung staring over the fireplace and was criticized as though its occupancy of that position had no significance he thinks she has a streak of genius diana said to emma it may be shown in time emma replied for a comment on the work he should know for the spanish pictures are noble acquisitions they are doubtless good investments he had been foolish enough to say in dianas hearing that he considered the purchase of the berkshire estate a good investment it had not yet a name she suggested various titles for emma to propose the funds or capital towers or dividend manor or railholm blind to the evidence of inflicting pain emma from what she had guess concerning the purchaser of the crossways apprehended a discovery there which might make tonys treatment of him unkinder seeing that she appeared actuated contrariously and only her invalids new happiness in the small excursions she was capable of taking to a definite spot of some homely attractiveness moved her to follow her own proposal for the journey diana pleaded urgently childishly in tone to have arthur rhodes with them so as to be sure of a sympathetic companion for a walk on the downs at the crossways they were soon aware that mr redworths domestics were in attendance to serve them manifestly the house was his property and not much of an investment the principal bedroom her fathers once and her own devoted now to emmas use appalled her with a resemblance to her london room she had noticed some of her furniture at dividend manor and chosen to consider it in the light of a bargain from a purchase at the sale of her goods here was her bed her writing table her chair of authorship desks books ornaments watercolour sketches and the drawingroom was fitted with her brackets and etageres holding every knickknack she had possessed and scattered small bronzes antiques ivory junks quaint ivory figures chinese and japanese bits of porcelain silver incenseurns dozens of dainty sundries she had a shamed curiosity to spy for an omission of one of them all were there the crossways had been turned into a trap her reply to this blunt wooing conspired she felt justifled in thinking between him and emma was emphatic in muteness she treated it as if unobserved at night in bed the scene of his mission from emma to her under this roof barred her customary ascent to her planetary kingdom next day she took arthur after breakfast for a walk on the downs and remained absent till ten minutes before the hour of dinner as to that young gentleman he was near to being caressed in public arthurs opinions his good sayings were quoted his excellent companionship on really poetical walks and perfect sympathy praised to his face challenged by her initiative to a kind of language that threw redworth out he declaimed we pace with some who make young morning stale oh stale as peel of fruit long since consumed she chimed and go they proceeded and they laughed emma smiled a little redworth did the same beneath one of his questioning frownsa sort of fatherly grimace a suspicion that this man when infatuated was able to practise the absurdest benevolence the burlesque of chivalry as a manadmiring sex esteems it stirred very naughty depths of the woman in diana labouring under her perverted mood she put him to proof for the chance of arming her wickedest to despise him arthur was petted consulted cited flattered all round all but caressed she played with a reserve the maturish young woman smitten by an adorable youth and enjoyed doing it because she hoped for a visible effectmore paternal benevolenceand could do it so dispassionately coquettry emma thought was most unworthily shown and it was of the worst description innocent of conspiracy she had seen the array of tonys lost household treasures she wondered at a heartlessness that would not even utter common thanks to the friendly man for the compliment of prizing her portrait and the things she had owned and there seemed an effort to wound him the invalided woman charitable with allowances for her erratic husband could offer none for the woman of a long widowhood that had become a trebly sensitive maidenhood abashed by her knowledge of the world animated by her abounding blood cherishing her new freedom dreading the menacer feeling that though she held the citadel she was daily less sure of its foundations and that her hope of some last romance in life was going for in him shone not a glimpse he appeared to diana as a fatal power attracting her without sympathy benevolently overcoming one of those good men strong men who subdue and do not kindle the enthralment revolted a nature capable of accepting subjection only by burning in return for his moral excellence she gave him the moral sentiments esteem gratitude abstract admiration perfect faith but the man she could not now say she had never been loved and a flood of tenderness rose in her bosom swelling from springs that she had previously reproved with a desperate severity the unhappy unsatisfied yearning to be more than loved to love it was alive out of the wreck of its first trial this the secret of her natural frailty was bitter to her pride chastelyminded as she was it whelmed her and then her comic imagination pictured redworth dramatically making love and to a widow it proved him to be senseless of romance poetic men take aim at maidens his devotedness to a widow was charged against him by the widows shudder at antecedents distasteful to her soul a discolouration of her life she wished to look entirely forward as upon a world washed clear of night not to be cast back on her antecedents by practical wooings or words of love to live spiritually free of the shower at her eyelids attendant on any idea of her loving the woman who talked of the sentimentalists fiddling harmonics herself stressed the material chords in her attempt to escape out of herself and away from her pursuer meanwhile she was as little conscious of what she was doing as of how she appeared arthur went about with the moony air of surcharged sweetness and a speculation on it alternately tiptoe and prostrate more of her intoxicating wine was administered to him in utter thoughtlessness of consequences to one who was but a boy and a friend almost of her own rearing she told emma when leaving the crossways that she had no desire to look on the place again she wondered at mr redworths liking such a solitude in truth the look back on it let her perceive that her husband haunted it and disfigured the man of real generosity as her heart confessed but whom she accused of a lack of prescient delicacy for not knowing she would and must be haunted there blaming him her fountain of colour shot up at a murmur of her unjustness and the poor mans hopes a week later the youth she publicly named her arthur came down to copsley with news of his having been recommended by mr redworth for the post of secretary to an old whig nobleman famous for his patronage of men of letters and besides he expected to inherit he said and gazed in a way to sharpen her instincts the wine he had drunk of late from her flowing vintage was in his eyes they were on their usual rambles out along the heights accept by all means and thank mr redworth said she speeding her tongue to intercept him literature is a good stick and a bad horse indeed i ought to know you can always write i hope you will she stepped fast hearing mrs warwickdiana may i take your hand this was her pretty piece of work why should you if you speak my christian name no you forfeit any pretext and pray dont loiter we are going at the pace of the firm of potter and dawdle and you know they never got their shutters down till it was time to put them up again nimblefooted as she was she pressed ahead too fleetly for amorous eloquence to have a chance she heard diana twice through the rattling of her discourse and flapping of her dress christian names are coin that seem to have an indifferent valuation of the property they claim she said in the copsley garden and as for hands at meeting and parting here is the friendliest you could have only dont look rueful my dear arthur spare me that or i shall blame myself horribly his chance had gone and he composed his face no hope in speaking had nerved him merely the passion to speak diana understood the state and pitied the naturally modest young fellow and chafed at herself as a senseless incendiary who did mischief right and left from seeking to shun the apparently inevitable a sidethought intruded that he would have done his wooing poeticallynot in the burly storm or bullsaxon she apprehended supposing it imperative with her to choose she looked up and the bird of broader wing darkened the whole sky bidding her know that she had no choice emma was requested to make mr redworth acquainted with her story all of itso that this exalted friendship of his may be shaken to a common level he has an unbearably high estimate of me and it hurts me tell him all and more than even you have knownbut for his coming to me on the eve of your passing under the surgeons hands i should have gone flung the world my glove a matter of minutes ten minutes later the train was to start for france at eight and i was awaited i have to thank heaven that the man was one of those who can strike icily tell mr redworth what i say you two converse upon every subject one may be too loftily respectedin my case by and byfor he is a tolerant reader of life and women i thinkwe shall be humdrum friends of the lasting order emmas cheeks were as red as dianas i fancy tom redworth has not much to learn concerning any person he cares for she said you like him i have lost touch of you my dear and ask i like him that i can say he is everything i am not but now i am free the sense of being undeservedly overesteemed imposes fetters and i dont like them i have been called a beauty rightly or other i have had a beautys career and a curious caged beasts life i have found it will you promise me to speak to him and also thank him for helping arthur rhodes to a situation at this the tears fell from her and so enigmatical had she grown to emma that her bosom friend took them for a confessed attachment to the youth dianas wretched emotion shamed her from putting any inquiries whether redworth had been told he came repeatedly and showed no change of face always continuing in the form of huge hovering griffin until an idea instead of the monster bird struck her might she not after all be cowering under imagination the very maidenly idea wakened her womanlinessto reproach her remainder of pride not to see more accurately it was the reason why she resolved against emmas extreme entreaties to take lodgings in the south valley below the heights where she could be independent of fancies and perpetual visitors but near her beloved at any summons of urgency which emma would not habitually send because of the coming of a particular gentleman dresses were left at copsley for dining and sleeping there upon occasion and poor danvers despairing over the riddle of her mistress was condemned to the melancholy descent its my belief she confided to lady dunstanes maid bartlett shell hate men all her life after that mr dacier if women were deceived and the riddle deceived herself there is excuse for a plain man like redworth in not having the slightest clue to the daily shifting feminine maze he beheld the strange thing was that during her maiden time she had never been shifty or flighty invariably limpid and direct chapter xli contains a revelation of the origin of the tigress in diana an afternoon of high summer blazed over london through the citys awning of smoke and the three classes of the population relaxed by the weariful engagement with what to them was a fruitless heat were severally bathing their ideas in dreams of the contrast possible to embrace breezy seas or moors aerial alps cool beer the latter if confessedly the lower comfort is the readier at command and thomas redworth whose perspiring frame was directing his inward vision to fly for solace to a trim new yacht built on his lines beckoning from southampton water had some of the amusement proper to things plucked off the levels in the conversation of a couple of journeymen close ahead of him as he made his way from a quiet street of brokers offices to a city bank one asked the other if he had ever tried any of that cold stuff they were now selling out of barrows with cream his companion answered that he had not got much opinion of stuff of the sort and what was it like well its cheap it aint bad its cooling but it aint refreshing just what i reckoned all that newfangle rubbish without a consultation the conservatives in beverage

knocked at the door of the general conscience and obtained a civil reply from the footman repulsive as the thought was to one still holding to whiggish liberalism though flying various radical kites

their interests and quid rabidae tradis ovile lupae says one of the multitude we may be seeing fangs of wolves where fleeces waxed the state that makes it a vital principle to concern itself with the helpless poor meets instead of waiting for democracy which is a perilous flood but when it is dammed or else in course of time luxurious yachting my friend will encounter other reefs and breakers than briny oceans capital whereat diana warwick aimed her superbest sneer has its instant duties she theorized on the side of poverty and might do so he had no right to be theorizing on the side of riches across st georges channel the cry for humanity in capital was an agony he ought to be there doing not cogitating the post of irish secretary must be won by real service founded on absolute local knowledge yes and sympathy if you like but sympathy is for proving not prating these were the meditations of a man in love veins arteries headpiece in love and constantly brooding at a solitary height over the beautiful coveted object only too bewildered by her multifarious evanescent feminine evasions as of colours on a ruffle water to think of pouncing for he could do nothing to soften nothing that seemed to please her and all the while the motive of her mind impelled him in reflection beyond practicable limits even pointing him to apt quotations either he thought within her thoughts or his own were at her disposal nor was it sufficient for him to be sensible of her influence to restrain the impetus he took from her he had already wedded her morally and much that he did as well as whatever he debated came of diana more than if they had been coupled when his downright practical good sense could have spoken she held him suspended swaying him in that posture and he was not a whit ashamed of it the beloved woman was throned on the very highest of the man furthermore not being encouraged he had his peculiar reason for delay though now he could offer her wealth she had once in his hearing derided the unpleasant hiss of the ungainly english matrons title of mrs there was no harm in the accustomed title to his taste but she disliking it he did the same on her special behalf and the prospect funereally draped of a title sweetersounding to her ears was above his horizon bear in mind that he underwent the reverse of encouragement any small thing to please her was magnified and the anticipation of it nerved the modest hopes of one who deemed himself and any man alive deeply her inferior such was the mood of the lover condemned to hear another malignant scandal defiling the name of the woman he worshipped sir lukin dunstane extremely hurried bumped him on the lower step of the busy bank and said pardon and ha redwarth making money why what are you up to down here he was asked and he answered down to the tower to an officer quartered there not bad quarters but an infernal distance business having cloaked his expedition to the distance with the comprehensive word he repeated it by which he feared he had rendered it too significant and he said no no nothing particular and that caused the secret he contained to swell in his breast rebelliously informing the candid creature of the fact of his hating to lie whereupon thus he poured himself out in the quieter bustle of an alley off the main thoroughfare youre a friend of hers i m sure you care for her reputation you re an old friend of hers and shes my wifes dearest friend and im fond of her too and i ought to be and ought to know and do knowpure strike off my fist if theres a spot on her character and a scoundrel like that fellow wroxeter damnedest rage i ever was inswears down at lockton when she was a girl why redworth i can tell you when diana warwick was a girl redworth stopped him did he

womanhang the woman and she hates diana warwick i cant tell whya regular snakes hate by jove how women carp hate who is the woman said redworth sir lukin complained of the mob at his elbows i dont like mentioning names here a convenient open door of offices invited him to drag his receptacle and possible counsellor into the passage where immediately he bethought him of a postponement of the distinct communication but the vein was too hot i say redworth i wish youd dine with me lets drive up to my clubvery well two words and i warn you i shall call him out and make it appear it s about another woman wholl like nothing so much if i know the jezebel some women are hussies let em be handsome as houris and shes a fireship by heaven she is come youre a friend of my wifes but youre a man

circulate against a lady who has been talked of twiceoh by jove it must be stopped if she has a male friend on earth it must be stopped on the spot redworth eyed sir lukin curiously through his wrath well drive up to your club he said hartswood dines with me this evening to confer rejoined sir lukin will you meet him i cant said redworth i have to see a lady whose affairs i have been attending to in the city and i m engaged for the evening you perceive my good fellow he resumed as they rolled along this is a delicate business you have to consider your wife mrs warwicks name wont come up but another womans will i meet wroxeter at a gamblinghouse he frequents and publicly call him cheatslap his face if need be sure to repeated redworth no stupid pretext will quash the womans name now such

me have your word that you wont take a step positivelyneither you nor colonel hartswood ill see you by appointment at your club redworth looked up over the chimneys we re going to have a storm and a gale i can tell you gale and storm cried sir lukin what has that got to do with it think of something else for a time and that brute of a womandeuced handsome she isif you care for fair women

defend diana warwick so you see for your wifes sake your name cant be hung on a woman of that kind said redworth ill call here the day after tomorrow at three pm sir lukin descended and vainly pressed redworth to run up into his club for refreshment said he roguishly who s the lady the tone threw redworth on his frankness the lady i ve been doing business for in the city is miss paynham i saw her once at copsley goodlooking cleverish she has ability entering his club sir lukin was accosted in the readingroom by a cavalry officer a colonel launay an old harrovian who stood at the window and asked him whether it was not tom redworth in the cab another of the same school standing squared before a sheet of one of the evening newspapers heard the name and joined them saying tom redworth is going to be married some fellow told me hell make a deuced good husband to any womanif its true said sir lukin with miss paynham ringing in his head hes a coldblooded old boy and likes women for their intellects colonel launay hummed in meditative emphasis he stared at vacancy with a tranced eye and turning a similar gaze on sir lukin as if through him burst out oh by george i say what a hugging that woman ll get the cocking of ears and queries of sir lukin put him to the test of his right to the remark for it sounded of occult acquaintance with interesting subterranean facts and there was a communication in brief syllables and the dot language crudely masculine immensely surprised sir lukin exclaimed of course when fellows live quietly and are careful of themselves ah you may think you know a man for years and you dont you dont know more than an inch or two of him why of course tom redworth would be uxoriousthe very man and tell us what has become of the firefly now one never sees her didnt complain very much the contrary both gentlemen were grave believing their knowledge in the subterranean world of a wealthy city to give them a positive cognizance of female humanity and the substance of colonel launays communication had its impressiveness for them well its a turn rightaboutface for me said sir lukin what a world we live in i fancy ive hit on the woman he means to marryhad an idea of another woman once but hes one of your friendly fellows with women thats how it was i took him for a fish great mistake i admit but tom redworth s a man of morals after all and when those men do break loose for a plungeha have you ever boxed with him well he keeps himself in training i can tell you sir lukins round of visits drew him at night to lady singlebys where he sighted the identical young lady of his thoughts miss paynham temporarily a guest of the house and he talked to her of redworth and had the satisfaction to spy a blush a rageing blush which avowal presented her to his view as an exceedingly goodlooking girl so that he began mentally to praise redworth for a manly superiority to small trifles and the worlds tattle you saw him today he said she answered yes he goes down to copsley tomorrow i think not said sir lukin i have it from him she closed her eyelids in speaking he and i have some rather serious business in town serious dont be alarmed not concerning him whom then you have told me so muchi have a right to know not an atom of danger i assure you it concerns mrs warwick said she sir lukin thought the guess extraordinary he preserved an impenetrable air but he had spoken enough to set that giddy head spinning nowhere during the night was mrs fryargannett visible earlier than usual she was riding next day in the row alone for perhaps two minutes and sir lukin passed her formally saluting he could not help the look behind him she sat so bewitchingly on horseback he looked and behold her ridingwhip was raised erect from the elbow it was his horse that wheeled compulsorily he was borne at a short canter to her side your commands the handsome amabel threw him a sombre glance from the corners of her uplifted eyelids and snakish he felt it but her colour and the line of her face went well with sullenness and her arts of fascination cast aside she fascinated him more in seeming homelier girlish if the trial of her beauty of a woman in a temper can bear the strain she has attractive lures indeed irresistible to the amorous idler and when in addition being the guilty person she plays the injured her show of temper on the taking face pitches him into perplexity with his own emotions creating a desire to strike and be stricken howl and set howling which is of the happiest augury for tender reconcilement on the terms of the gentleman on his kneecap youve been doing a pretty thing she said and briefly she named her house and half an hour and flew sir lukin was left to admire the figure of the horsewoman really her figure had an air of vindicating her successfully except for the poison she spat at diana warwick and what pretty thing had he been doing he reviewed dozens of speculations until the impossibility of seizing one determined him to go to mrs fryargunnett at the end of the halfhourjust to see what these women have to say for themselves some big advance drops of redworths thunderstorm drawing gloomily overhead warned him to be quick and get his horse into stables dismounted the sensational man was irresolute suspecting a female trap but curiosity combined with the instinctive turning of his nose in the direction of the ladys house led him thither to an accompaniment of celestial growls which impressed him judging by that naughtygirl face of hers and the womans tongue she had as a likely prelude to the scene to come below chapter xlii the penultimate showing a final struggle for liberty and run into harness the prophet of the storm had forgotten his prediction which however was of small concern to him apart from the ducking he received midway between the valley and the heights of copsley whither he was bound on a mission so serious that according to his custom in such instances he chose to take counsel of his active legs an adviseable course when the brain wants clearing and the heart fortifying dianas face was clearly before him through the deluge now in ogle features the dimple running from her mouth the dark bright eyes and cut of eyelids and nostrils alive under their lightning now inkier whole radiant smile or musefully listening nursing a thought or she was obscured and he felt the face the individuality of it had him by the heart beyond his powers of visioning on his arrival he stood in the hall adrip like one of the trees of the lawn laughing at lady dunstanes anxious exclamations his portmanteau had come and he was expected she hurried out at the first ringing of the bell to greet and reproach him for walking in such weather diana has left me she said when he reappeared in dry clothing we are neighbours she has taken cottagelodgings at selshall about an hours walkone of her wild dreams of independence are you disappointed i am redworth confessed emma coloured she requires an immense deal of humouring at present the fit will wear off only we must wait for it any menace to her precious liberty makes her prickly she is passing the day with the pettigrews who have taken a place near her village for a month she promised to dine and sleep here if she returned in time what is your news nothing the world wags on you have nothing special to tell her nothing he hummed nothing i fancy that she does not know you said you were disappointed its always a pleasure to see her even in her worst moods i find it so oh moods quoth redworth my friend they are to be reckoned with women certainly what i meant was that i dont count them against women good but my meaning was i think i remember your once comparing them and the weather and you spoke of the one point more variable in women you may forestall your storms there is no calculating the effect of a few little words at a wrong season with women i suppose not i have no pretension to a knowledge of the sex emma imagined she had spoken plainly enough if he had immediate designs and she was not sure of that and wished rather to shun his confidences while tony was in her young widowhood revelling in her joy of liberty by and by was her thought perhaps next year she dreaded tonys refusal of the yoke and her ironhardness to the dearest of men proposing it and moreover her further to be apprehended holding to the refusal for the sake of consistency if it was once uttered for her own sake she shrank from hearing intentions that distressing the good man she would have to discountenance his candour in confessing disappointment and his open face his excellent sense too gave her some assurance of his not being foolishly impetuous after he had read to her for an hour as his habit was on evenings and wet days their discussion of this and that in the book lulled any doubts she had of his prudence enough to render it even a dubious point whether she might be speculating upon a wealthy bachelor in the oldfashioned ultrafeminine manner the which she so abhorred that she rejected the idea consequently redworths proposal to walk down to the valley for diana and bring her back struck her as natural when a shaft of western sunshine from a whitened edge of raincloud struck her windows she let him go without an intimated monition or a thought of one thinking simply that her tony would be more likely to come having him for escort those are silly women who are always imagining designs and intrigues and future palpitations in the commonest actions of either sex emma dunstane leaned to the contrast between herself and them danvers was at the house about sunset reporting her mistress to be on her way with mr redworth the maids tale of the dreadful state of the lanes accounted for their tardiness and besides the sunset had been magnificent diana knocked at emmas bedroom door to say outside hurriedly in passing how splendid the sunset had been and beg for an extra five minutes taking full fifteen she swam into the drawingroom lively with kisses on emmas cheeks and excuses referring her misconduct in being late to the seductions of sol in his glory redworth said he had rarely seen so wonderful a sunset the result of their unanimity stirred emmas bosom to matchmaking regrets and the walk of the pair together alone under the propitious laming heavens appeared to her now as an opportunity lost from sisterly sympathy she fancied she could understand tonys libertyloving reluctance she had no comprehension of the backwardness of the man beholding the dear woman handsomer than in her maiden or her married time and sprightlier as well she chatted deliciously and drew redworth to talk his best on his choicer subjects playing over them like a fidewisp determined at once to flounder him and to make him shine her tender esteem for the man was transparent through it all and emma whose evening had gone happily between them said to her in their privacy before parting you seemed to have been inspired by sol my dear you do like him dont you diana vowed she adored him and with a face of laughter in rosy suffusion put sol for redworth redworth for sol but watchful of emmas visage said finally if you mean the mortal man i think him up to almost all your hyperbolesas far as men go and he departed to his nights rest which i hope will be good like a king not to admire him would argue me senseless heartless i do i have reason to and you make him the butt of your ridicule tony no i said like a king and he is one he has to me morally the grandeur of your sol sinking caesar stabbed cato on the swordpoint he is roman spartan imperial english if you like the pick of the land it is an honour to call him friend and i do trust he will choose the pick among us to make her a happy womanif shes for running in harness there i cant say more emma had to be satisfied with it for the present they were astonished at breakfast by seeing sir lukin ride past the windows he entered with the veritable appetite of a cavalier who had ridden from london fasting and why he had come at that early hour he was too hungry to explain the ladies retired to read their letters by the mornings post whereupon sir lukin called to redworth i met that woman in the park yesterday and had to stand a volley i went beating about london for you all the afternoon and evening she swears you rated her like a scullery wench and threatened to ruin wroxeter did you see him she says the storys true in one particular that he did snatch a kiss and got mauled not so much to pay for it but what a ruffian eh i saw him said redworth he s one of the new set of noblemen who take bribes to serve as baits for transactions in the city they help to the ruin of their order or are signs of its decay we wont judge it by him he favoured me with his word of honour that the thing you heard was entirely a misstatement and so forthapologized i suppose he mumbled something a thorough cur he professed his readiness to fight if either of us was not contented he spoke to the wrong man ive half a mind to ride back and have him out for that rascal osculation and the lady unwillingand she a young one a girl under the protection of the house by jove redworth when you come to consider the scoundrels men can be it stirs a fellows bile theres a deal of that sort of villany goingand succeeding sometimes he deserves the whip or a bullet a sermon from lukin dunstane might punish him oh im a sinner i know but go and tell one woman of another woman and that a lie thats beyond me the gradations of the deeps are perhaps measurable to those who are in them the sermons at mepop said sir lukin by the way im coming round to think diana warwick was right when she used to jibe at me for throwing up my commission idleness is the devilor mother of him i manage my estates but the truth is it doesnt occupy my mind your time my mind i say whichever you please youre crusty today redworth let me tell you i thinkand hard too when the fits on me however you did right in stoppingill owna piece of folly and shutting the mouths of those two though it caused me to come in for a regular drencher but a pretty woman in a rightdown termagant passion is good theatre because it cant last at that pace and youre sure of your agreeable tableau not that i trust her ten minutes out of sightor any woman except one or two my wife and diana warwick trust those youve tried old boy diana warwick ought to be taught to thank you though i dont know how its to be done the fact of it is redworth frowned and rose ive done mischief i had no right to mix myself in it im seldom caught off my feet by an impulse but i was i took the fever from you he squared his figure at the window and looked up on a driving sky come lets play open cards tom redworth said sir lukin leaving the table and joining his friend by the window you moral men are doomed to be marrying men always and quite right not that one doesnt hear a roundabout thing or two about you no harm very much the contrary as the world goes but youre the man to marry a wife and if i guess the lady shes a sensible girl and wont be jealous i d swear she only waits for asking then you dont guess the lady said redworth mary paynham the desperate halflaugh greeting the name convinced more than a dozen denials sir lukin kept edging round for a full view of the friend who shunned inspection but is it can it be it must be after all why of course it is but the thing staring us in the face is just what we never see just the husband for herand shes the wife why diana warwick s the very woman of course i remember i used to think so before she was free to wed she is not of that opinion redworth blew a heavy breath and it should be chronicled as a sigh but it was hugely masculine because you didnt attack the moment she was free that s what upset my calculations the sagacious gentleman continued for a vindication of his acuteness then seizing the reply refuses you dont mean to say youre the man to take a refusal and from a green widow in the blush did you see her cheeks when she was peeping at the letter in her hand she colours at half a wordtakes the lift of a finger for hymen coming and lots of fellows are after her i know it from emmy but youre not the man to be refused youre her friendher champion that woman fryargunnett would have it you were the favoured lover and sneered at my talk of old friendship women are always down dead on the facts cant put them off a scent theres the mischief redworth blew again i had no right to be championing mrs warwicks name or the world wont give it at all events im a blundering donkey yes she wishes to keep her liberty and upon my soul im in love with everything she wishes ive got the habit habit be hanged cried sir lukin youre in love with the woman i know a little more of you now mr tom youre a fellow in earnest about what you do youre feeling it now on the rack by heaven though you keep a bold face did she speak positivelysort of feminine of youre the monster not the man or measured little doctors dose of pityworse sign you re not going if youll drive me down in half an hour said redworth give me an hour sir lukin replied and went straight to his wifes blueroom diana was roused from a meditation on a letter she held by the entrance of emma in her bedchamber to whom she said i have here the very craziest bit of writingbut what is disturbing you dear emma sat beside her panting and composing her lips to speak do you love me i throw policy to the winds if only i can batter at you for your heart and find it tony do you love me but dont answer give me your hand you have rejected him he has told you no he is not the man to cry out for a wound he heard in london lukin has had the courage to tell me after his fashiontom redworth heard an old story coming from one of the baser kind of women grossly false he knew i mention only lord wroxeter and lockton he went to man and woman both and had it refuted and stopped their tongues on peril as he of all men is able to do when he wills it observing the quick change in tonys eyes emma exclaimed how you looked disdain when you asked whether he had told me but why are you the handsome tigress to him of all men living the dear fellow dear to me at least since the day he first saw you has worshipped you and striven to serve youand harder than any scriptural service to have the beloved woman to wife i know nothing to compare with it for he is a man of warmth he is one of those rare men of honour who can command their passion who venerate when they love and those are the men that women select for punishment yes you it is to the woman he loves that he cannot show himself as he is because he is at her feet you have managed to stamp your spirit on him and as a consequence he defends you now for flinging him off and now his chief regret is that he has caused his name to be coupled with yours i suppose he had some poor hope seeing you free or else the impulse to protect the woman of his heart and soul was too strong i have seen what he suffered years back at the news of your engagement oh for gods sake dont cried tony tears running over and her dream of freedom her visions of romance drowning it was like the snapping of the branch of an oak when the trunk stands firm emma resumed in her desire to scourge as well as to soften but similes applied to him will strike you as incongruous tony swayed her body for a negative very girlishly and consciously he probably did not woo you in a poetic style or the courtly by prescription again tony swayed she had to hug herself under the stripes and felt as if alone at sea with her dear heavens pelting you have sneered at him for his calculatingto his face and it was when he was comparatively poor that he calculatedto his cost that he dared not ask you to marry a man who could not offer you a tithe of what he considered fit for the peerless woman peerless i admit there he was not wrong but if he had valued you half a grain less he might have won you you talk much of chivalry you conceive a superhuman ideal to which you fit a very indifferent wooden model while the man of all the world the most chivalrous he is a man quite other from what you think him anything but a cuthbert dering or a man of two minds he was in the drawingroom below on the day i received your last maiden letter from the crosswaysnow his property in the hope of making it yours i behaved abominably there interposed tony with a gasp let it pass at any rate that was the prick of a needle not the blow of a sword but marriage dear emmy marriage is marriage to be the end of me what amazing apotheosis have you in prospect and are you steering so particularly well by yourself miserably but i can dream and the thought of a husband cuts me from any dreaming its all dead flat earth at once would you lave rejected him when you were a girl i think so the superior merits of another oh no no no no i might have accepted him and i might not have made him happy i wanted a hero and the jewelled garb and the feather did not suit him no he is not that description of layfigure you have dressed it and gemmed it andmade your discovery here is a true man and if you can find me any of your heroes to match him i will thank you he came on the day i speak of to consult me as to whether with the income he then had well i had to tell him you were engaged the man has never wavered in his love of you since that day he has had to bear something this was an electrical bolt into tonys bosom shaking her from selfpity and shame to remorseful pity of the suffering lover and the tears ran in streams as she said he bore it emmy he bore it she sobbed out and he went on building a fortune and batting whatever he undertakes he does perfectlyapprove of the pattern or not oh i have no doubt he had his nest of wish piping to him all the while only it seems quaint dear quaint and against everything weve been reading of lovers love was his bread and butter her dark eyes showered and to tell you what you do not know of him his way of making love is really she sobbed pretty it it took me by surprise i was expecting a bellow and an assault of horns and if dearyou will say what boardingschool girl have you got with you and i feel myself getting childishif sol in his glory had not been so m majestically m magnificent nor seemed to show me the king kingdom of my dreams i might have stammered the opposite word to the one he heard last night when he took my hand kindly before going to bed i had a fit for dropping on my knees to him i saw him bleed and he held himself right royally i told you he did sol in his moral grandeur how infinitely above the physical monarch is he not emmy what one dislikes is the devotion of all that grandeur to win a widow it should be a maiden princess you feel it so i am sure and here am i as if a maiden princess were i demanding romantic accessories of rubious vapour in the man condescending to implore the widow to wed him but tell me does he know everything of his widow everything i shall not have to go through the frightful chapter he is a man with his eyes awake he knows as much as any husband could require to know said emma adding my darling he trusts you it is the soul of the man that loves you as it is mine you will not tease him promise me give yourself frankly you see it clearly before you i see compulsion my dear what i see is a regiment of proverbs bearing placards instead of guns and each one a taunt at women especially at widows they march they form square they enclose me in the middle and i have their inscriptions to digest read that crazy letter from mary paynham while i am putting on my bonnet i perceive i have been crying like a raw creature in her teens i dont know myself an advantage of the darker complexions is our speedier concealment of the traces emma read miss paynhams letter and returned it with the comment utterly crazy tony said is it not i am to pause before i trifle with a noble heart too long she is to have her happiness in the constant prayer for ours and she is warned by one of those intimations never failing her that he runs a serious danger it reads like a wizards almanack and here homogeneity of sentiment the most perfect is unable to contend with the fatal charm which exercised by an indifferent person must be ascribed to original predestination she should be under the wing of lady wathin there is the mother for such chicks but ill own to you emmy that after the perusal i did ask myself a question as to my likeness of late to the writer i have drivelled i was shuddering over it when you came in i have sentimentalized up to thin smoke and she tells a truth when she says i am not to count social clevernessshe means volubility as a warrant for domineering a capacious intelligence because of the gentlemans modesty agreed i have done it i am contrite i am going into slavery to make amends for presumption banality thy name is marriage your business is to accept life as we have it said emma and tony shrugged she was precipitate in going forth to her commonplace fate and scarcely looked at the man requested by emma to escort her to her cottage after their departure emma fell into laughter at the last words with the kiss of her cheeks here goes old ireland but from her look and from what she had said upstairs emma could believe that the singular sprite of girlishness invading and governing her latterly had yielded place to the woman she loved chapter xliii nuptial chapter and of how a barely willing woman was led to bloom with the nuptial sentiment emma watched them on their way through the park till they rounded the beechwood talking it could be surmised of ordinary matters the face of the gentleman turning at times to his companions which steadily fronted the gale she left the ensuing to a prayer for their good direction with a chuckle at tonys evident feeling of a ludicrous posture and the desperate rush of her agile limbs to have it over but her prayer throbbed almost to a supplication that the wrong done to her beloved by dacierthe wound to her own sisterly pride rankling as an injury to her sex might be cancelled through the union of the woman noble in the sight of god with a more manlike man meanwhile the feet of the couple were going faster than their heads to the end of the journey diana knew she would have to hoist the signal and how the prospect was dumbfoundering she had to think of appeasing her emma redworth for his part actually supposed she had accepted his escorting in proof of the plain friendship offered him overnight what do your birds do in weather like this she said cling to their perches and wait patiently its the bad time with them when you dont hear them chirp of course you foretold the gale oh well it did not require a shepherd or a skipper for that your grand gift will be useful to a yachtsman you like yachting when i have tried my new schooner in the channel she is at your command for as long as you and lady dunstane please so you acknowledge that birdsthings of naturehave their bad time they profit ultimately by the deluge and the wreck nothing on earth is tuckedup in perpetuity except the dead but why should the schooner be at our command i shall be in ireland he could not have said sweeter to her ears or more touching we shall hardly feel safe without the weatherwise on board you may count on my man barnes i have proved him he is up to his work even when hes bilious only in that case occurring about once a fortnight you must leave him to fight it out with the elements i rather like men of action to have a temper i cant say much for a bilious temper the weather today really seemed of that kind she remarked he assented in the shrug mannernot to dissent she might say what she would he helped nowhere to a lead and so quick are the changes of mood at such moments that she was now far from him under the failure of an effort to come near but thoughts of emma pressed the name of the new schooner her name is her picture to me i wanted you to christen her launched without a name i took a liberty needless to ask but she did with whom i named her diana may the goddess of the silver bow and crescent protect her to me the name is ominous of mischance i would commit my fortunes and life he checked his tongue ejaculating omens she had veered straight away from her romantic aspirations to the blunt extreme of thinking that a widow should be wooed in unornamented matter offact as she is wedded with a wilt thou and i will and no decorative illusions downright for the unpoetic creature if you please so she rejected the accompaniment of the silver goddess and high seas for an introduction of the crisis this would be a thunderer on our coasts i had a trial of my sailing powers in the mediterranean as she said it her musings on him then with the contract of her position toward him now fierily brushed her cheeks and she wished him the man to make one snatch at her poor lost small butterfly bit of freedom so that she might suddenly feel in haven at peace with her expectant emma he could have seen the inviting consciousness but he was absurdly watchful lest the flying sprays of border trees should strike her he mentioned his fear and it became an excuse for her seeking protection of her veil it is our natural guardian she said not much against timber said he the worthy creatures anxiety was of the pattern of cavaliers escorting damesan exaggeration of honest zeal a present example of clownish goodness it might seem until entering the larch and firwood along the beaten heights there was a rocking and straining of the shallowrooted trees in a tremendous gust that quite pardoned him for curving his arm in a hoop about her and holding a shoulder in front the veil did her positive service he was honourably scrupulous not to presume a right good unimpulsive gentleman the same that she had always taken him for and liked these firs are not taproots he observed by way of apology her dress volumed and her ribands rattled and chirruped on the verge of the slope i will take your arm here she said redworth received the little hand saying lean to me they descended upon great surges of wind piping and driving every light surfaceatom as foam and they blinked and shook even the man was shaken but their arms were interlinked and they grappled the battering enemy made them one it might mean nothing or everything to him it meant the sheer blissful instant at the foot of the hill he said its harder to keep to the terms of yesterday what were they said she and took his breath more than the fury of the storm had done raise the veil i beg widows do not wear it the look revealed to him was a fugitive of the wilds no longer the glittering shooter of arrows have you changed to me was the signification understood can youfor life do you think you can his poverty in the pleading language melted her what i cannot do my best of friends is to submit to be seated on a throne with you petitioning yes as far as concerns this hand of mine if you hold it worthy of you we will speak of that now tell me the name of the weed trailing along the hedge there he knew it well a common hedgerow weed but the placid diversion baffled him it was clematis he said it drags in the dust when it has no firm arm to cling to i passed it beside you yesterday with a flaunting mind and not a suspicion of a likeness how foolish i was i could volubly sermonize only it should be a young maid to listen forgive me the yesterday you have never to ask you withdraw your handwas i rough no she smiled demurely it must get used to the shackles but my cottage is in sight i have a growing love for the place we will enter it like plain peopleif you think of coming in as she said it she had a slight shock of cowering under eyes tolerably hawkish in their male glitter but her coolness was not disturbed and without any apprehensions she reflected on what has been written of the silly division and war of the sexeswhich two might surely enter on an engagement to live together amiably unvexed by that barbarous old fowl and falcon interlude cool herself she imagined the same of him having good grounds for the delusion so they passed through the cottagegarden and beneath the low porchway into her little sittingroom where she was proceeding to speak composedly of her preference for cottages while untying her bonnetstringsif i had begun my life in a cottagewhen really a big stormwave caught her from shore and whirled her to midsea out of every sensibility but the swimming one of her loss of self in the man you would not have been here was all he said she was up at his heart fastlocked undergoing a change greater than the sea works her thoughts one blush her brain a firefount this was not like being seated on a throne there said he loosening his hug now you belong to me i know you from head to foot after that my darling i could leave you for years and call you wife and be sure of you i could swear it for youmy life on it that s what i think of you dont wonder that i took my chance the firsti have waited truer word was never uttered she owned coming into some harmony with mans kiss on her mouth the man violently metamorphozed to a stranger acting on rights she had given him and who was she to dream of denying them not an idea in her head bound verily to be thankful for such love on hearing that it dated from the night in ireland so in love with you that on my soul your happiness was my marrow whatever you wished anything you chose its reckoned a fools part no its love the love of a womanthe one woman i was like the hand of a clock to the springs i taught this old watchdog of a heart to keep guard and bury the bones you tossed him ignorantly admit said she and could have bitten her tongue for the empty words that provoked would you have flung him nothing and caused a lowering of her eyelids and shamed glimpses of recollections i hear you have again been defending me i told you i think i wished i had begun my girls life in a cottage all that i have had to endure or so it seems to me it may be my way of excusing myselfi know my cunning in that peculiar art i would take my chance of mixing among the highest and the brightest naturally culpably it brings you to me through a muddy channel your husband has full faith in you my own the faith has to be summoned and is buffeted as we were just now on the hill i wish he had taken me from a cottage you pushed for the best society like a fish to its native sea pray say a salmon to the riverheads better redworth laughed joyfully between admiration of the tongue that always outflew him and of the face he reddened by degrees her apter and neater terms of speech helped her to a notion of regaining some steps of her sunken ascendancy under the weight of the novel masculine pressure on her throbbing blood and when he bent to her to take her lords farewell of her after agreeing to go and delight emma with a message her submission and her personal pride were not so much at variance perhaps because her buzzing head had no ideas tell emma you have undertaken to wash the blackamoor as white as she can be she said perversely in her spite at herself for not coming as it were out of the dawn to the man she could consent to wed and he replied i shall tell her my dark girl pleads for a fortnights grace before she and i set sail for the west coast of ireland conjuring a picture that checked any protest against the shortness of timeand emma would surely be his ally they talked of the dublin ball painfully to some of her thoughts but redworth kissed that distant brilliant night as freshly as if no belabouring years rolled in the chasm which led her to conceive partly and wonderingly the nature of a strong mans passion and it subjugated the woman knowing of a contrast the smart of the blow dealt her by him who had fired the passion in her became a burning regret for the loss of that fair fame she had sacrificed to him and could not bring to her truer lover though it was but the outer view of herselfthe worlds view only she was generous and of honest conscience and but for the sake of her truer lover she would mentally have allowed the world to lash and abuse her without a plea of material purity could it be named the naming of it in her clear mind lessened it to accidental by good fortune she was no worseshe said to redworth when finally dismissing him i bring no real disgrace to you my friendto have had this sharp spiritual battle at such a time was proof of honest conscience rarer among women as the world has fashioned them yet than the purity demanded of themhis answer you are my wife rang in her hearing when she sat alone at last she was incapable despite her natures imaginative leap to brightness of choosing any single period auspicious or luminous or flattering since the hour of her first meeting this man rather than the grey light he cast on her promising helpfulness and inspiring a belief in her capacity to help not the salvatore high raptures nor the nights of social applause could appear preferable she strained her shattered wits to try them as for her superlunary sphere it was in fragments and she mused on the singularity considering that she was not deeply enamoured was she so at all the question drove her to embrace the dignity of being reasonableunder emmys guidance for she did not stand firmly alone her story confessed it marriage might be the archway to the road of good service even as our passage through the flesh may lead to the better state she had thoughts of the kind and had them while encouraging herself to deplore the adieu to her little muskscented sittingroom where a modest freedom breathed and her individuality had seemed pointing to a straighter growth she nodded subsequently to the truth of her happy emmas remark you were created for the world tony a woman of blood and imagination in the warring world without a mate whom she can revere subscribes to a likeness with those independent minor realms between greedy mighty neighbours which conspire and undermine when they do not openly threaten to devour so then this union the return to the wedding yoke received sanction of greytoned reason she was not enamoured she could say it to herself she had however been surprised both by the man and her unprotesting submission surprised and warmed unaccountably warmed clearness of mind in the woman chaste by nature however little ignorant it allowed her to be in the general review of herself could not compass the immediately personal with its acknowledgement of her subserviency to touch and pressureand more stranger her readiness to kindle she left it unexplained unconsciously the image of dacier was effaced looking backward her heart was moved to her longconstant lover with most pitying tender wondermentstormy man as her threatened senses told her that he was looking at him she had to mask her being abashed and mastered and looking forward her soul fell in prayer for this true mans never repenting of his choice sure of her now mr thomas redworth had returned to the station of the courtier and her feminine sovereignty was not ruffled to make her feel too feminine another revelation was his playful talk when they were more closely intimate he had his humour as well as his hearty relish of hers if all englishmen were like him she chimed with emma dunstanes eulogies under the influence my dear the latter replied we should simply march over the four quarters and be blessed by the nations only avoid your trick of dashing headlong to the other extreme he has his faults tell me of them diana cooed for an answer do i want the flavour a girl would be satisfied with superhuman excellence a widow asks for feature to my thinking the case is that if it is a widow who sees the superhuman excellence in a man she may be very well contented to cross the bridge with him rejoined emma suppose the bridge to break and for her to fall into the water he rescuing herthen perhaps but it has been happening but piecemeal in extension so slowly i go to him a derelict bearing a story of the sea empty of ideas i remember sailing out of harbour passably well freighted for commerce when tom redworth has had command of the derelict a week i should like to see her the mention of that positive captaincy drowned diana in morning colours she was dominated physically and morally submissively too what she craved in the absence of the public whiteness which could have caused her to rejoice in herself as a noble gift was the spring of enthusiasm emma touched a quivering chord of pride with her hint at the good augury and foreshadowing of the larger union in the irishwomans bestowal of her hand on the openminded englishman she had learned to trust the aureole glimmered transiently she could neither think highly of the woman about to be wedded nor poetically of the man nor therefore rosily of the ceremony nor other than vacuously of life and yet as she avowed to emma she had gathered the three rarest good things of life a faithful friend a faithful lover a faithful servant the two latter exposing an unimagined quality of emotion danvers on the night of the great day for redworth had undressed her with trembling fingers and her mistress was led to the knowledge that the maid had always been all eye and on reflection to admit that it came of a sympathy she did not share but when celtic brains are reflective on their emotional vessel they shoot direct as the arrow of logic dianas glance at the years behind lighted every moving figure to a shrewd transparency herself among them she was driven to the conclusion that the granting of any of her hearts wild wishes in those days would have lowered heror frozen dacier was a coldly luminous image still a tolling name no longer conceivably her mate recollection rocked not she the politician and citizen was admired she read the manmore to her own discredit than to his but she read him and if that is done by the one of two lovers who was true to love it is the god of the passion pronouncing a final release from the shadow of his chains three days antecedent to her marriage she went down the hill over her cottage chimneys with redworth after hearing him praise and cite to emma dunstane sentences of a mornings report of a speech delivered by dacier to his constituents she alluded to it that she might air her power of speaking of the man coolly to him or else for the sake of stirring afresh some sentiment he had roused and he repeated his high opinion of the orators political wisdom whereby was revived in her memory a certain reprehensible view belonging to her period of mockgirlish naughtinesstoo vileas to his paternal benevolence now to clear vision the loftiest manliness what did she do she was irish therefore intuitively decorous in amatory challenges and interchanges but she was an impulsive woman and foliage was thick around only a few small birds and heaven seeing and penitence and admiration sprang the impulse it had to be this or a burst of weepingshe put a kiss upon his arm she had omitted to think that she was dealing with a lover a man of smothered fire who would be electrically alive to the act through a coatsleeve redworth had his impulse he kept it undershe felt the big breath he drew in imagination began busily building a nest for him and enthusiasm was not sluggish to make a home of it the impulse of each had wedded in expression and repression her sensibility told her of the stronger she rose on the morning of her marriage day with his favourite planxty kelly at her lips a natural bubble of the notes emma drove down to the cottage to breakfast and superintend her brides adornment as to which diana had spoken slightingly as well as of the ceremony and the institution and this life itselfshe would be married out of her cottage a widow a cottager a woman under a cloud yes a sober person taking at last a right practical step to please her two best friends the change was marked she wished to hide it wished to confide it emma was asked how is he this morning and at the answer describing his fresh and spirited looks and his kind ways with arthur rhodes and his fun with sullivan smith and the satisfaction with the bridegroom declared by lord larrian invalided from his rock and unexpectingly informed of the wedding diana forgot that she had kissed her and this time pressed her lips in a manner to convey the secret bridally he has a lovely day and bride said emma if you two think so i should like to agree with my dear old lord and bless him for the prize he takes though it feels itself at present rather like a christmas bonbona piece of sugar in the wrap of a rhymed motto he is kind to arthur you say like a cordial elder brother dear love i have it at heart that i was harsh upon mary paynham for her letter she meant welland i fear she suffers and it may have been a bit my fault blind that i was when you say cordial elder brother you make him appear beautiful to me the worst of that is one becomes aware of the inability to match him read with his eyes when you meet him this morning my tony the secret was being clearly perceived by emma whose pride in assisting to dress the beautiful creature for her marriagewith the man of men had a tinge from the hymenaeal brand exulting over dacier and in the compensation coming to her beloved for her first luckless footing on this road how does he go down to the church said diana he walks down lukin and his chief drive he walks with your arthur and mr sullivan smith he is on his way now diana looked through the window in the direction of the hill that is so like him to walk to his wedding emma took the place of danvers in the office of the robing for the maid as her mistress managed to hint was too steeped in the colour of the occasion to be exactly tasteful and had the art no doubt through sympathy of charging permissible common words with explosive meanings she was in an amorous palpitation of the reflected state after several knockings and enterings of the bedchamberdoor she came hurriedly to say and your pillow maam i had almost forgotten it a question that caused her mistress to drop the gaze of a moan on emma with patience trembling diana preferred a hard pillow and usually carried her own about take it she had to reply the friends embraced before descending to step into the fateful carriage and tell me emma said are not your views of life brighter today too dazzled to know it may be a lamp close to the eyes or a radiance of sun i hope they are you are beginning to think hopefully again who can really think and not think hopefully you were in my mind last night and you brought a little boat to sail me past despondency of life and the fear of extinction when we despair or discolour things it is our senses in revolt and they have made the sovereign brain their drudge i heard you whisper with your very breath in my ear there is nothing the body suffers that the soul may not profit by that is emmas history with that i sail into the dark it is my promise of the immortal teaches me to see immortality for us it comes from you my emmy if not a great saying it was in the heart of deep thoughts proof to emma that her tonys mind had resumed its old clear highaiming activity therefore that her nature was working sanely and that she accepted her happiness and bore love for a dower to her husband no blushing confession of the womans love of the man would have told her so much as the return to mental harmony with the laws of life shown in her darlings pellucid little sentence she revolved it long after the day of the wedding to emma constantly on the dark decline of the unillumined verge between the two worlds those words were a radiance and a nourishment had they waned she would have trimmed them to feed her during her soulsisters absence they shone to her of their vitality she was lying along her sofa facing her southwestern window one afternoon of late november expecting tony from her lengthened honeymoon trip while a sunset in the van of frost not without celestial musical reminders of tonys husband began to deepen and as her friend was coming she mused on the scenes of her friends departure and how tony issuing from her cottage porch had betrayed her feelings in the language of her sex by stooping to lift above her head and kiss the smallest of her landladys children ranged up the garden path to bid her farewell over their strewing of flowersand of her murmur to tony entering the churchyard among the gravemounds old ireland wont repent it and tonys rejoinder at the sight of the bridegroom advancing beaming a singular transformation of old englandand how having numberless ready sources of
