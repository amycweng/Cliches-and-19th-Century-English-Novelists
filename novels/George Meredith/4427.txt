my gentleman on the road vii mother and son chapter i above buttons long after the hours when tradesmen are in the habit of commencing business the shutters of a certain shop in the town of lymport on the sea remained significantly closed and it became known that death had taken mr melchisedec harrington and struck one off the list of living tailors the demise of a respectable member of this class does not ordinarily create a profound sensation he dies and his equals debate who is to be his successor while the rest of them who have come in contact with him very probably hear nothing of his great launch and final adieu till the winding up of cash accounts on which occasions we may augur that he is not often blessed by one or other of the two great parties who subdivide this universe in the case of mr melchisedec it was otherwise this had been a grand man despite his calling and in the teeth of opprobrious epithets against his craft to be both generally blamed and generally liked evinces a peculiar construction of mortal mr melchisedec whom people in private called the great mel had been at once the sad dog of lymport and the pride of the town he was a tailor and he kept horses he was a tailor and he had gallant adventures he was a tailor and he shook hands with his customers finally he was a tradesman and he never was known to have sent in a bill such a personage comes but once in a generation and when he goes men miss the man as well as their money that he was dead there could be no doubt kilne the publican opposite had seen sally one of the domestic servants come out of the house in the early morning and rush up the street to the doctor's tossing her hands and she not disinclined to dilute her grief had on her return related that her master was then at his last gasp and had refused in so many words to swallow the doctor 'i won't swallow the doctor he says i won't swallow the doctor' sally moaned 'i never touched him he says and i never will' kilne angrily declared that in his opinion a man who rejected medicine in extremity ought to have it forced down his throat and considering that the invalid was pretty deeply in kilne's debt it naturally assumed the form of a dishonest act on his part but sally scornfully dared any one to lay hand on her master even for his own good 'for' said she 'he's got his eyes awake though he do lie so helpless he marks ye' 'ah ah' kilne sniffed the air sally then rushed back to her duties 'now there 's a man' kilne stuck his hands in his pockets and began his meditation which however was cut short by the approach of his neighbour barnes the butcher to whom he confided what he had heard and who ejaculated professionally 'obstinate as a pig' as they stood together they beheld sally a figure of telegraph at one of the windows implying that all was just over 'amen' said barnes as to a matter of fact affair some minutes after the two were joined by grossby the confectioner who listened to the news and observed 'just like him i'd have sworn he'd never take doctor's stuff' and nodding at kilne 'liked his medicine best eh' 'had a hem good lot of it' muttered kilne with a suddenly serious brow 'how does he stand on your books' asked barnes kilne shouldered round crying 'who the deuce is to know' 'i don't' grossby sighed 'in he comes with his good morning grossby fine day for the hunt grossby and a ten pound note have the kindness to put that down in my favour grossby and just as i am going to say look here this won't do he has me by the collar and there's one of the regiments going to give a supper party which he's to order or the admiral's wife wants the receipt for that pie or in comes my wife and there's no talking of business then though she may have been bothering about his account all the night beforehand something or other and so we run on' 'what i want to know' said barnes the butcher 'is where he got his tenners from' kilne shook a sagacious head 'no knowing' 'i suppose we shall get something out of the fire' barnes suggested 'that depends' answered the emphatic kilne 'but you know if the widow carries on the business' said grossby 'there's no reason why we shouldn't get it all eh' 'there ain't two that can make clothes for nothing and make a profit out of it' said kilne 'that young chap in portugal' added barnes 'he won't take to tailoring when he comes home d' ye think he will' kilne muttered 'can't say ' and grossby a kindly creature in his way albeit a creditor reverting to the first subject of their discourse ejaculated 'but what a one he was eh' 'fine to look on' kilne assented 'well he was like a marquis' said barnes here the three regarded each other and laughed though not loudly they instantly checked that unseemliness and kilne as one who rises from the depths of a calculation with the sum in his head spoke quite in a different voice 'well what do you say gentlemen shall we adjourn no use standing here' by the invitation to adjourn it was well understood by the committee kilne addressed that they were invited to pass his threshold and partake of a morning draught barnes the butcher had no objection whatever and if grossby a man of milder make entertained any the occasion and common interests to be discussed advised him to waive them in single file these mourners entered the publican's house where kilne after summoning them from behind the bar on the important question what it should be and receiving first perfect acquiescence in his views as to what it should be and then feeble suggestions of the drink best befitting that early hour and the speaker's particular constitution poured out a toothful to each and one to himself 'here's to him poor fellow' said kilne and was deliberately echoed twice 'now it wasn't that' kilne pursued pointing to the bottle in the midst of a smacking of lips 'that wasn't what got him into difficulties it was expensive luckshries it was being above his condition horses what's a tradesman got to do with horses unless he's retired then he's a gentleman and can do as he likes it's no use trying to be a gentleman if you can't pay for it it always ends bad why there was he consorting with gentlefolks gay as a lark who has to pay for it' kilne's fellow victims maintained a rather doleful tributary silence 'i'm not saying anything against him now' the publican further observed 'it 's too late and there i'm sorry he's gone for one he was as kind a hearted a man as ever breathed and there perhaps it was just as much my fault i couldn't say no to him dash me if i could' lymport was a prosperous town and in prosperity the much despised british tradesman is not a harsh he is really a well disposed easy soul and requires but management manner occasional instalments just to freshen the account and a surety that he who debits is on the spot to be a right royal king of credit only the account must never drivel 'stare aut crescere' appears to be his feeling on that point and the departed mr melchisedec undoubtedly understood him there for the running on of the account looked deplorable and extraordinary now that mr melchisedec was no longer in a position to run on with it and it was precisely his doing so which had prevented it from being brought to a summary close long before both barnes the butcher and grossby the confectioner confessed that they too found it hard ever to say 'no' to him and speaking broadly never could 'except once'said barnes 'when he wanted me to let him have a ox to roast whole out on the common for the battle of waterloo i stood out against him on that no no says i i'll joint him for ye mr harrington you shall have him in joints and eat him at home ha ha' 'just like him' said grossby with true enjoyment of the princely disposition that had dictated the patriotic order 'oh there' kilne emphasized pushing out his arm across the bar as much as to say that in anything of such a kind the great mel never had a rival 'that marquis affair changed him a bit' said barnes 'perhaps it did for a time' said kilne 'what's in the grain you know he couldn't change he would be a gentleman and nothing 'd stop him' 'and i shouldn't wonder but what that young chap out in portugal 'll want to be one too though he didn't bid fair to be so fine a man as his father' 'more of a scholar' remarked kilne 'that i call his worst fault shilly shallying about that young chap i mean his' kilne stretched a finger toward the dead man's house 'first the young chap's to be sent into the navy then it's the army then he's to be a judge and sit on criminals then he goes out to his sister in portugal and now there's nothing but a tailor open to him as i see if we're to get our money' 'ah and he hasn't got too much spirit to work to pay his father's debts' added barnes 'there's a business there to make any man's fortune properly directed i say but i suppose like father like son he'll becoming the marquis too he went to a gentleman's school and he's had foreign training i don't know what to think about it his sisters over there they were fine women' 'oh a fine family every one of 'em and married well' exclaimed the publican 'i never had the exact rights of that marquis affair' said grossby and remembering that he had previously laughed knowingly when it was alluded to pursued 'of course i heard of it at the time but how did he behave when he was blown upon' barnes undertook to explain but kilne who relished the narrative quite as well and was readier said 'look here i 'll tell you i had it from his own mouth one night when he wasn't not quite himself he was coming down king william street where he stabled his horse you know and i met him he'd been dining out somewhere out over fallow field i think it was and he sings out to me ah kilne my good fellow and i wishing to be equal with him says a fine night my lord and he draws himself up he smelt of good company says he kilne i'm not a lord as you know and you have no excuse for mistaking me for one sir so i pretended i had mistaken him and then he tucked his arm under mine and said you're no worse than your betters kilne they took me for one at squire uplift's to night but a man who wishes to pass off for more than he is kilne and impose upon people he says he's contemptible kilne contemptible so that you know set me thinking about bath and the marquis and i couldn't help smiling to myself and just let slip a question whether he had enlightened them a bit kilne said he you're an honest man and a neighbour and i'll tell you what happened the squire he says likes my company and i like his table now the squire 'd never do a dirty action but the squire's nephew mr george uplift he can't forget that i earn my money and once or twice i have had to correct him and i'll wager mel did it too well he goes on there was admiral sir jackson racial and his lady at dinner squire falco of bursted lady barrington admiral combleman our admiral that was 'mr this and that' i forget their names and other ladies and gentlemen whose acquaintance i was not honoured with you know his way of talking and there was a goose on the table he says and looking stern at me don't laugh yet says he like thunder well he goes on mr george caught my eye across the table and said so as not to be heard by his uncle 'if that bird was rampant you would see your own arms marquis' and mel replied quietly for him to hear and as that bird is couchant mr george you had better look to your sauce couchant means squatting you know that's heraldry well that wasn't bad sparring of mel's but bless you he was never taken aback and the gentlefolks was glad enough to get him to sit down amongst 'em so says mr george i know you're a fire eater marquis and his dander was up for he began marquising mel and doing the mock polite at such a rate that by and by one of the ladies who didn't know mel called him my lord and his lordship and says mel i merely bowed to her and took no notice so that passed off and there sits mel telling his anecdotes as grand as a king and by and by young mr george who hadn't forgiven mel and had been pulling at the bottle pretty well he sings out it 's michaelmas the death of the goose and i should like to drink the marquis's health and he drank it solemn but as far as i can make out the women part of the company was a little in the dark so mel waited till there was a sort of a pause and then speaks rather loud to the admiral by the way sir jackson may i ask you has the title of marquis anything to do with tailoring now mel was a great favourite with the admiral and with his lady too they say and the admiral played into his hands you see and says he i 'm not aware that it has mr harrington and he begged for to know why he asked the question called him mister you understand so mel said and i can see him now right out from his chest he spoke with his head up when i was a younger man i had the good taste to be fond of good society and the bad taste to wish to appear different from what i was in it that's mel speaking everybody was listening so he goes on i was in the habit of going to bath in the season and consorting with the gentlemen i met there on terms of equality and for some reason that i am quite guiltless of says mel the hotel people gave out that i was a marquis in disguise and upon my honour ladies and gentlemen i was young then and a fool i could not help imagining i looked the thing at all events i took upon myself to act the part and with some success and considerable gratification for in my opinion says mel no real marquis ever enjoyed his title so much as i did one day i was in my shop no main street lymport and a gentleman came in to order his outfit i received his directions when suddenly he started back stared at me and exclaimed 'my dear marquis i trust you will pardon me for having addressed you with so much familiarity' i recognized in him one of my bath acquaintances that circumstance ladies and gentlemen has been a lesson to me since that time i have never allowed a false impression with regard to my position to exist i desire says mel smiling to have my exact measure taken everywhere and if the michaelmas bird is to be associated with me i am sure i have no objection all i can say is that i cannot justify it by letters patent of nobility that's how mel put it do you think they thought worse of him i warrant you he came out of it in flying colours gentlefolks like straight forwardness in their inferiors that's what they do ah' said kilne meditatively 'i see him now walking across the street in the moonlight after he 'd told me that a fine figure of a man and there ain't many marquises to match him' to this barnes and grossby not insensible to the merits of the recital they had just given ear to agreed and with a common voice of praise in the mouths of his creditors the dead man's requiem was sounded chapter ii the heritage of the son toward evening a carriage drove up to the door of the muted house and the card of lady racial bearing a hurried line in pencil was handed to the widow it was when you looked upon her that you began to comprehend how great was the personal splendour of the husband who could eclipse such a woman mrs harrington was a tall and a stately dame dressed in the high waists of the matrons of that period with a light shawl drawn close over her shoulders and bosom she carried her head well and her pale firm features with the cast of immediate affliction on them had much dignity dignity of an unrelenting physical order which need not express any remarkable pride of spirit the family gossips who on both sides were vain of this rare couple and would always descant on their beauty even when they had occasion to slander their characters said to distinguish them that henrietta maria had a port and melchisedec a presence and that the union of a port and a presence and such a port and such a presence was so uncommon that you might search england through and you would not find another not even in the highest ranks of society there lies some subtle distinction here due to the minute perceptions which compel the gossips of a family to coin phrases that shall express the nicest shades of a domestic difference by a port one may understand them to indicate something unsympathetically impressive whereas a presence would seem to be a thing that directs the most affable appeal to our poor human weaknesses his majesty king george iv for instance possessed a port beau brummel wielded a presence many it is true take a presence to mean no more than a shirt frill and interpret a port as the art of walking erect but this is to look upon language too narrowly on a more intimate acquaintance with the couple you acknowledge the aptness of the fine distinction by birth mrs harrington had claims to rank as a gentlewoman that is her father was a lawyer of lymport the lawyer however since we must descend the genealogical tree was known to have married his cook who was the lady's mother now mr melchisedec was mysterious concerning his origin and in his cups talked largely and wisely of a great welsh family issuing from a line of princes and it is certain that he knew enough of their history to have instructed them on particular points of it he never could think that his wife had done him any honour in espousing him nor was she the woman to tell him so she had married him for love rejecting various suitors squire uplift among them in his favour subsequently she had committed the profound connubial error of transferring her affections or her thoughts from him to his business which indeed was much in want of a mate and while he squandered the guineas she patiently picked up the pence they had not lived unhappily he was constantly courteous to her but to see the port at that sordid work considerably ruffled the presence put as it were the peculiar division between them and to behave toward her as the same woman who had attracted his youthful ardours was a task for his magnificent mind and may have ranked with him as an indemnity for his general conduct if his reflections ever stretched so far the townspeople of lymport were correct in saying that his wife and his wife alone had as they termed it kept him together nevertheless now that he was dead and could no longer be kept together they entirely forgot their respect for her in the outburst of their secret admiration for the popular man such is the constitution of the inhabitants of this dear island of britain so falsely accused by the great napoleon of being a nation of shopkeepers here let any one proclaim himself above buttons and act on the assumption his fellows with one accord hoist him on their heads and bear him aloft sweating and groaning and cursing but proud of him and if he can contrive or has any good wife at home to help him to die without going to the dogs they are one may say unanimous in crying out the same eulogistic funeral oration as that commenced by kilne the publican when he was interrupted by barnes the butcher 'now there's a man ' mrs harrington was sitting in her parlour with one of her married nieces mrs fiske and on reading lady racial's card she gave word for her to be shown up into the drawing room it was customary among mrs harrington's female relatives who one and all abused and adored the great mel to attribute his shortcomings pointedly to the ladies which was as much as if their jealous generous hearts had said that he was sinful but that it was not his fault mrs fiske caught the card from her aunt read the superscription and exclaimed 'the idea at least she might have had the decency she never set her foot in the house before and right enough too what can she want now i decidedly would refuse to see her aunt' the widow's reply was simply 'don't be a fool ann' rising she said 'here take poor jacko and comfort him till i come back' jacko was a middle sized south american monkey and had been a pet of her husband's he was supposed to be mourning now with the rest of the family mrs fiske received him on a shrinking lap and had found time to correct one of his indiscretions before she could sigh and say in the rear of her aunt's retreating figure 'i certainly never would let myself down so' but mrs harrington took her own counsel and jacko was of her persuasion for he quickly released himself from mrs fiske's dispassionate embrace and was slinging his body up the balusters after his mistress 'mrs harrington' said lady racial very sweetly swimming to meet her as she entered the room 'i have intruded upon you i fear in venturing to call upon you at such a time' the widow bowed to her and begged her to be seated lady racial was an exquisitely silken dame in whose face a winning smile was cut and she was still sufficiently youthful not to be accused of wearing a flower too artificial 'it was so sudden so sad' she continued 'we esteemed him so much i thought you might be in need of sympathy and hoped i might dear mrs harrington can you bear to speak of it' 'i can tell you anything you wish to hear my lady' the widow replied lady racial had expected to meet a woman much more like what she conceived a tradesman's wife would be and the grave reception of her proffer of sympathy slightly confused her she said 'i should not have come at least not so early but sir jackson my husband thought and indeed i imagined you have a son mrs harrington i think his name is ' 'evan my lady' 'evan it was of him we have been speaking i imagined that is we thought sir jackson might you will be writing to him and will let him know we will use our best efforts to assist him in obtaining some position worthy of his superior to something that will secure him from the harassing embarrassments of an uncongenial employment' the widow listened to this tender allusion to the shears without a smile of gratitude she replied 'i hope my son will return in time to bury his father and he will thank you himself my lady' 'he has no taste for a for anything in the shape of trade has he mrs harrington' 'i am afraid not my lady' 'any position a situation that of a clerk even would be so much better for him' the widow remained impassive 'and many young gentlemen i know who are clerks and are enabled to live comfortably and make a modest appearance in society and your son mrs harrington he would find it surely an improvement upon many would think it a step for him' 'i am bound to thank you for the interest you take in my son my lady' 'does it not quite suit your views mrs harrington' lady racial was surprised at the widow's manner 'if my son had only to think of himself my lady' 'oh but of course' the lady understood her now 'of course you cannot suppose mrs harrington but that i should anticipate he would have you to live with him and behave to you in every way as a dutiful son surely 'a clerk's income is not very large my lady' 'no but enough as i have said and with the management you would bring mrs harrington to produce a modest respectable maintenance my respect for your husband mrs harrington makes me anxious to press my services upon you' lady racial could not avoid feeling hurt at the widow's want of common gratitude 'a clerk's income would not be more than l a year my lady' 'to begin with no certainly not more' the lady was growing brief 'if my son puts by the half of that yearly he can hardly support himself and his mother my lady' 'half of that yearly mrs harrington' 'he would have to do so and be saddled till he dies my lady' 'i really cannot see why' lady racial had a notion of some excessive niggardly thrift in the widow which was arousing symptoms of disgust mrs harrington quietly said 'there are his father's debts to pay my lady' 'his father's debts' 'under l but above l my lady' 'five thousand pounds mrs harrington' the lady's delicately gloved hand gently rose and fell 'and this poor young man 'she pursued 'my son will have to pay it my lady' for a moment the lady had not a word to instance presently she remarked 'but mrs harrington he is surely under no legal obligation' 'he is only under the obligation not to cast disrespect on his father's memory my lady and to be honest while he can' 'but mrs harrington surely what can the poor young man do' 'he will pay it my lady' 'but how mrs harrington' 'there is his father's business my lady' his father's business then must the young man become a tradesman in order to show respect for his father preposterous that was the lady's natural inward exclamation she said rather shrewdly for one who knew nothing of such things 'but a business which produces debts so enormous mrs harrington' the widow replied 'my son will have to conduct it in a different way it would be a very good business conducted properly my lady' 'but if he has no taste for it mrs harrington if he is altogether superior to it' for the first time during the interview the widow's inflexible countenance was mildly moved though not to any mild expression 'my son will have not to consult his tastes' she observed and seeing the lady after a short silence quit her seat she rose likewise and touched the fingers of the hand held forth to her bowing 'you will pardon the interest i take in your son' said lady racial 'i hope indeed that his relatives and friends will procure him the means of satisfying the demands made upon him' 'he would still have to pay them my lady' was the widow's answer 'poor young man indeed i pity him' sighed her visitor 'you have hitherto used no efforts to persuade him to take such a step mrs harrington' 'i have written to mr goren who was my husband's fellow apprentice in london my lady and he is willing to instruct him in cutting and measuring and keeping accounts' certain words in this speech were obnoxious to the fine ear of lady racial and she relinquished the subject 'your husband mrs harrington i should so much have wished he did not pass away in in pain' 'he died very calmly my lady' 'it is so terrible so disfiguring sometimes one dreads to see one can hardly distinguish i have known cases where death was dreadful but a peaceful death is very beautiful there is nothing shocking to the mind it suggests heaven it seems a fulfilment of our prayers' 'would your ladyship like to look upon him' said the widow lady racial betrayed a sudden gleam at having her desire thus intuitively fathomed 'for one moment mrs harrington we esteemed him so much may i' the widow responded by opening the door and leading her into the chamber where the dead man lay at that period when threats of invasion had formerly stirred up the military fire of us islanders the great mel as if to show the great napoleon what character of being a british shopkeeper really was had by remarkable favour obtained a lieutenancy of militia dragoons in the uniform of which he had revelled and perhaps for the only time in his life felt that circumstances had suited him with a perfect fit however that may be his solemn final commands to his wife henrietta maria on whom he could count for absolute obedience in such matters had been that as soon as the breath had left his body he should be taken from his bed washed perfumed powdered and in that uniform dressed and laid out with directions that he should be so buried at the expiration of three days that havoc in his features might be hidden from men in this array lady racial beheld him the curtains of the bed were drawn aside the beams of evening fell soft through the blinds of the room and cast a subdued light on the figure of the vanquished warrior the presence dumb now for evermore was sadly illumined for its last exhibition but one who looked closely might have seen that time had somewhat spoiled that perfect fit which had aforetime been his pride and now that the lofty spirit had departed there had been extreme difficulty in persuading the sullen excess of clay to conform to the dimensions of those garments the upper part of the chest alone would bear its buttons and across one portion of the lower limbs an ancient seam had started recalling an incident to them who had known him in his brief hour of glory for one night as he was riding home from fallow field and just entering the gates of the town a mounted trooper spurred furiously past and slashing out at him gashed his thigh mrs melchisedec found him lying at his door in a not unwonted way carried him up stairs in her arms as she had done many a time before and did not perceive his condition till she saw the blood on her gown the cowardly assailant was never discovered but mel was both gallant and had in his military career the reputation of being a martinet hence divers causes were suspected the wound failed not to mend the trousers were repaired peace about the same time was made and the affair passed over looking on the fine head and face lady racial saw nothing of this she had not looked long before she found covert employment for her handkerchief the widow standing beside her did not weep or reply to her whispered excuses at emotion gazing down on his mortal length with a sort of benignant friendliness aloof as one whose duties to that form of flesh were well nigh done at the feet of his master jacko the monkey had jumped up and was there squatted with his legs crossed very like a tailor the imitative wretch had got a towel and as often as lady racial's handkerchief travelled to her eyes jacko's peery face was hidden and you saw his lithe skinny body doing grief's convulsions till tired of this amusement he obtained possession of the warrior's helmet from a small round table on one side of the bed a calque of the barbarous military georgian form with a huge knob of horse hair projecting over the peak and under this trying to adapt it to his rogue's head the tricksy image of death extinguished himself all was very silent in the room then the widow quietly disengaged jacko and taking him up went to the door and deposited him outside during her momentary absence lady racial had time to touch the dead man's forehead with her lips unseen chapter iii the daughters of the shears three daughters and a son were left to the world by mr melchisedec love well endowed had already claimed to provide for the daughters first in the shape of a lean marine subaltern whose days of obscuration had now passed and who had come to be a major of that corps secondly presenting his addresses as a brewer of distinction thirdly and for a climax as a portuguese count no other than the senor silva diaz conde de saldar and this match did seem a far more resplendent one than that of the two elder sisters with major strike and mr andrew cogglesby but the rays of neither fell visibly on lymport these escaped eurydices never reappeared after being once fairly caught away from the gloomy realms of dis otherwise trade all three persons of singular beauty a certain refinement some port and some presence hereditarily combined they feared the clutch of that fell king and performed the widest possible circles around him not one of them ever approached the house of her parents they were dutiful and loving children and wrote frequently but of course they had to consider their new position and their husbands and their husbands' families and the world and what it would say if to it the dreaded rumour should penetrate lymport gossips as numerous as in other parts declared that the foreign nobleman would rave in an extraordinary manner and do things after the outlandish fashion of his country for from him there was no doubt the shop had been most successfully veiled and he knew not of pluto's close relationship to his lovely spouse the marriages had happened in this way balls are given in country towns where the graces of tradesmen's daughters may be witnessed and admired at leisure by other than tradesmen by occasional country gentlemen of the neighbourhood with light minds and also by small officers subalterns wishing to do tender execution upon man's fair enemy and to find a distraction for their legs the classes of our social fabric have here and there slight connecting links and provincial public balls are one of these they are dangerous for cupid is no respecter of class prejudice and if you are the son of a retired tea merchant or of a village doctor or of a half pay captain or of anything superior and visit one of them you are as likely to receive his shot as any shopboy even masquerading lords at such places have been known to be slain outright and although society allows to its highest and dearest to save the honour of their families and heal their anguish by indecorous compromise you if you are a trifle below that mark must not expect it you must absolutely give yourself for what you hope to get dreadful as it sounds to philosophic ears you must marry this having danced with caroline harrington the gallant lieutenant strike determined to do nor when he became aware of her father's occupation did he shrink from his resolve after a month's hard courtship he married her straight out of her father's house that he may have all the credit due to him it must be admitted that he did not once compare or possibly permit himself to reflect on the dissimilarity in their respective ranks and the step he had taken downward till they were man and wife and then not in any great degree before fortune had given him his majority an advance the good soldier frankly told his wife he did not owe to her if we may be permitted to suppose the colonel of a regiment on friendly terms with one of his corporals we have an estimate of the domestic life of major and mrs strike among the garrison males his comrades he passed for a disgustingly jealous brute the ladies in their pretty language signalized him as a 'finick' now having achieved so capital a marriage caroline worthy creature was anxious that her sisters should not be less happy and would have them to visit her in spite of her husband's protests 'there can be no danger' she said for she was in fresh quarters far from the nest of contagion the lieutenant himself ungrudgingly declared that looking on the ladies no one for an instant could suspect and he saw many young fellows ready to be as great fools as he had been another voluntary confession he made to his wife for the candour of which she thanked him and pointed out that it seemed to run in the family inasmuch as mr andrew cogglesby his rich relative had seen and had proposed for harriet the lieutenant flatly said he would never allow it in fact he had hitherto concealed the non presentable portion of his folly very satisfactorily from all save the mess room and mr andrew's passion was a severe dilemma to him it need scarcely be told that his wife fortified by the fervid brewer defeated him utterly what was more she induced him to be an accomplice in deception for though the lieutenant protested that he washed his hands of it and that it was a fraud and a snare he certainly did not avow the condition of his wife's parents to mr andrew but alluded to them in passing as 'the country people' he supposed 'the country people' must be asked he said the brewer offered to go down to them but the lieutenant drew an unpleasant picture of the country people and his wife became so grave at the proposal that mr andrew said he wanted to marry the lady and not the 'country people' and if she would have him there he was there he was behaving with a particular and sagacious kindness to the raw lieutenant since harriet's arrival if the lieutenant sent her away mr andrew would infallibly pursue her and light on a discovery twice cursed by love twice the victim of tailordom our excellent marine gave away harriet harrington in marriage to mr andrew cogglesby thus joy clapped hands a second time and horror deepened its shadows from higher ground it was natural that the remaining sister should take a bolder flight of the loves of the fair louisa harrington and the foreign count and how she first encountered him in the brewer's saloons and how she being a humorous person laughed at his 'loaf' for her and wore the colours that pleased him and kindled and soothed his jealousy little is known beyond the fact that she espoused the count under the auspices of the affluent brewer and engaged that her children should be brought up in the faith of the catholic church which lymport gossips called paying the devil for her pride the three sisters gloriously rescued by their own charms had now to think of their one young brother how to make him a gentleman that was their problem preserve him from tailordom from all contact with trade they must otherwise they would be perpetually linked to the horrid thing they hoped to outlive and bury a cousin of mr melchisedec's had risen to be an admiral and a knight for valiant action in the old war when men could rise him they besought to take charge of the youth and make a distinguished seaman of him he courteously declined they then attacked the married marine navy or army being quite indifferent to them as long as they could win for their brother the badge of one service 'when he is a gentleman at once' they said like those who see the end of their labours strike basely pretended to second them it would have been delightful to him of course to have the tailor's son messing at the same table and claiming him when he pleased with a familiar 'ah brother' and prating of their relationship everywhere strike had been a fool in revenge for it he laid out for himself a masterly career of consequent wisdom the brewer uxorious andrew cogglesby might and would have bought the commission strike laughed at the idea of giving money for what could be got for nothing he told them to wait in the meantime evan a lad of seventeen spent the hours not devoted to his positive profession that of gentleman in the offices of the brewery toying with big books and balances which he despised with the combined zeal of the sucking soldier and emancipated tailor two years passed in attendance on the astute brother in law to whom fortune now beckoned to come to her and gather his laurels from the pig tails about the same time the countess sailed over from lisbon on a visit to her sister harriet in reality it was whispered in the cogglesby saloons on a diplomatic mission from the court of lisbon but that could not be made ostensible the countess narrowly examined evan whose steady advance in his profession both her sisters praised 'yes' said the countess in a languid alien accent 'he has something of his father's carriage something something of his delivery his readiness' it was a remarkable thing that these ladies thought no man on earth like their father and always cited him as the example of a perfect gentleman and yet they buried him with one mind and each mounted guard over his sepulchre to secure his ghost from an airing 'he can walk my dears certainly and talk a little tete a tete i do not say i should think there he would be a stick all you english are but what sort of a bow has he got i ask you how does he enter a room and then his smile his laugh he laughs like a horse absolutely there's no music in his smile oh you should see a portuguese nobleman smile o mio deus honeyed my dears but evan has it not none of you english have you go so' the countess pressed a thumb and finger to the sides of her mouth and set her sisters laughing 'i assure you no better not a bit i faint in your society i ask myself where am i among what boors have i fallen but evan is no worse than the rest of you i acknowledge that if he knew how to dress his shoulders properly and to direct his eyes oh the eyes you should see how a portuguese nobleman can use his eyes soul my dears soul can any of you look the unutterable without being absurd you look so' and the countess hung her jaw under heavily vacuous orbits something as a sheep might yawn 'but i acknowledge that evan is no worse than the rest of you' she repeated 'if he understood at all the management of his eyes and mouth but that's what he cannot possibly learn in england not possibly as for your poor husband harriet one really has to remember his excellent qualities to forgive him poor man and that stiff bandbox of a man of yours caroline' addressing the wife of the marine 'he looks as if he were all angles and sections and were taken to pieces every night and put together in the morning he may be a good soldier good anything you will but diacho to be married to that he is not civilized none of you english are you have no place in the drawing room you are like so many intrusive oxen absolutely one of your men trod on my toe the other night and what do you think the creature did jerks back then the half of him forward i thought he was going to break in two then grins and grunts oh 'm sure beg pardon 'm sure i don't know whether he didn't say marm' the countess lifted her hands and fell away in laughing horror when her humour or her feelings generally were a little excited she spoke her vernacular as her sisters did but immediately subsided into the deliberate delicately syllabled drawl 'now that happened to me once at one of our great balls' she pursued 'i had on one side of me the duchesse eugenia de formosa de fontandigua on the other sat the countess de pel a widow and we were talking of the ices that evening eugenia you must know my dears was in love with the count belmarana i was her sole confidante the countess de pel a horrible creature oh she was the duchess's determined enemy would have stabbed her for belmarana one of the most beautiful men adored by every woman so we talked ices eugenic and myself quite comfortably and that horrible de pel had no idea in life eugenia had just said this ice sickens me i do not taste the flavour of the vanille i answered it is here it must it cannot but be here you love the flavour of the vanille with her exquisite smile i see her now saying too well it is necessary to me i live on it when up he came in his eagerness his foot just effleured my robe oh i never shall forget in an instant he was down on one knee it was so momentary that none saw it but we three and done with ineffable grace pardon he said in his sweet portuguese pardon looking up the handsomest man i ever beheld and when i think of that odious wretch the other night with his oh 'm sure beg pardon 'm sure 'pon my honour i could have kicked him i could indeed' here the countess laughed out but relapsed into 'alas that belmarana should have betrayed that beautiful trusting creature to de pel such scandal a duel the duke was wounded for a whole year eugenia did not dare to appear at court but had to remain immured in her country house where she heard that belmarana had married de pel it was for her money of course rich as croesus and as wicked as the black man below as dear papa used to say by the way weren't we talking of evan ah yes' and so forth the countess was immensely admired and though her sisters said that she was 'foreignized' overmuch they clung to her desperately she seemed so entirely to have eclipsed tailordom or 'demogorgon' as the countess was pleased to call it who could suppose this grand mannered lady with her coroneted anecdotes and delicious breeding the daughter of that thing it was not possible to suppose it it seemed to defy the fact itself they congratulated her on her complete escape from demogorgon the countess smiled on them with a lovely sorrow 'safe from the whisper my dears the ceaseless dread if you knew what i have to endure i sometimes envy you 'pon my honour i sometimes wish i had married a fishmonger silva indeed is a most excellent husband polished such polish as you know not of in england he has a way a wriggle with his shoulders in company i cannot describe it to you so slight so elegant and he is all that a woman could desire but who could be safe in any part of the earth my dears while papa will go about so and behave so extraordinarily i was at dinner at your english embassy a month ago and there was admiral combleman then on the station off lisbon sir jackson racial's friend who was the admiral at lymport formerly i knew him at once and thought oh what shall i do my heart was like a lump of lead i would have given worlds that we might one of us have smothered the other i had to sit beside him it always happens thank heaven he did not identify me and then he told an anecdote of papa it was the dreadful old bath story i thought i should have died i could not but fancy the admiral suspected was it not natural and what do you think i had the audacity to do i asked him coolly whether the mr harrington he mentioned was not the son of sir abraham harrington of torquay the gentleman who lost his yacht in the lisbon waters last year i brought it on myself gentleman ma'am ma'am says the horrid old creature laughing gentleman he's a i cannot speak it i choke and then he began praising papa diacho what i suffered but you know i can keep my countenance if i perish i am a harrington as much as any of us' and the countess looked superb in the pride with which she said she was what she would have given her hand not to be but few feelings are single on this globe and junction of sentiments need not imply unity in our yeasty compositions 'after it was over my supplice' continued the countess 'i was questioned by all the ladies i mean our ladies not your english they wanted to know how i could be so civil to that intolerable man i gained a deal of credit my dears i laid it all on diplomacy' the countess laughed bitterly 'diplomacy bears the burden of it all i pretended that combleman could be useful to silva oh what hypocrites we all are mio deus' the ladies listening could not gainsay this favourite claim of universal brotherhood among the select who wear masks instead of faces with regard to evan the countess had far outstripped her sisters in her views a gentleman she had discovered must have one of two things a title or money he might have all the breeding in the world he might be as good as an angel but without a title or money he was under eclipse almost total on a gentleman the sun must shine now evan had no title no money the clouds were thick above the youth to gain a title he would have to scale aged mountains there was one break in his firmament through which the radiant luminary might be assisted to cast its beams on him still young that divine portal was matrimony if he could but make a rich marriage he would blaze transfigured all would be well and why should not evan marry an heiress as well as another 'i know a young creature who would exactly suit him' said the countess 'she is related to the embassy and is in lisbon now a charming child just sixteen dios how the men rave about her and she isn't a beauty there's the wonder and she is a little too gauche too english in her habits and ways of thinking likes to be admired of course but doesn't know yet how to set about getting it she rather scandalizes our ladies but when you know her she will have they say a hundred 'thousand pounds in her own right rose jocelyn the daughter of sir franks and that eccentric lady jocelyn she is with her uncle melville the celebrated diplomate though to tell you the truth we turn him round our fingers and spin him as the boys used to do the cockchafers i cannot forget our old fallow field school life you see my dears well rose jocelyn would just suit evan she is just of an age to receive an impression and i would take care she did instance me a case where i have failed 'or there is the portuguese widow the rostral she's thirty certainly but she possesses millions estates all over the kingdom and the sweetest creature but no evan would be out of the way there certainly but our women are very nice they have the dearest sweetest ways but i would rather evan did not marry one of them and then there 's the religion' this was a sore of the countess's own and she dropped a tear in coming across it 'no my dears it shall be rose jocelyn' she concluded 'i will take evan over with me and see that he has opportunities it shall be rose and then i can call her mine for in verity i love the child' it is not my part to dispute the countess's love for miss jocelyn and i have only to add that evan unaware of the soft training he was to undergo and the brilliant chance in store for him offered no impediment to the proposition that he should journey to portugal with his sister whose subtlest flattery was to tell him that she should not be ashamed to own him there and ultimately furnished with cash for the trip by the remonstrating brewer went so these parcae daughters of the shears arranged and settled the young man's fate his task was to learn the management of his mouth how to dress his shoulders properly and to direct his eyes rare qualities in man or woman i assure you the management of the mouth being especially admirable and correspondingly difficult these achieved he was to place his battery in position and win the heart and hand of an heiress our comedy opens with his return from portugal in company with miss rose the heiress the honourable melville jocelyn the diplomate and the count and countess de saldar refugees out of that explosive little kingdom chapter iv on board the jocasta from the tagus to the thames the government sloop of war jocasta had made a prosperous voyage bearing that precious freight a removed diplomatist and his family for whose uses let a sufficient vindication be found in the exercise he affords our crews in the science of seamanship she entered our noble river somewhat early on a fine july morning early as it was two young people who had nothing to do with the trimming or guiding of the vessel stood on deck and watched the double shore beginning to embrace them more and more closely as they sailed onward one a young lady very young in manner wore a black felt hat with a floating scarlet feather and was clad about the shoulders in a mantle of foreign style and pattern the other you might have taken for a wandering don were such an object ever known so simply he assumed the dusky sombrero and dangling cloak of which one fold was flung across his breast and drooped behind him the line of an adolescent dark moustache ran along his lip and only at intervals could you see that his eyes were blue and of the land he was nearing for the youth was meditative and held his head much down the young lady on the contrary permitted an open inspection of her countenance and seemed for the moment at least to be neither caring nor thinking of what kind of judgement would be passed on her her pretty nose was up sniffing the still salt breeze with vivacious delight 'oh' she cried clapping her hands 'there goes a dear old english gull how i have wished to see him i haven't seen one for two years and seven months when i 'm at home i 'll leave my window open all night just to hear the rooks when they wake in the morning there goes another' she tossed up her nose again exclaiming 'i 'm sure i smell england nearer and nearer i smell the fields and the cows in them i'd have given anything to be a dairy maid for half an hour i used to lie and pant in that stifling air among those stupid people and wonder why anybody ever left england aren't you glad to come back' this time the fair speaker lent her eyes to the question and shut her lips sweet cold chaste lips she had a mouth that had not yet dreamed of kisses and most honest eyes the young man felt that they were not to be satisfied by his own and after seeking to fill them with a doleful look which was immediately succeeded by one of superhuman indifference he answered 'yes we shall soon have to part' and commenced tapping with his foot the cheerful martyr's march speech that has to be hauled from the depths usually betrays the effort listening an instant to catch the import of this cavernous gasp upon the brink of sound the girl said 'part what do you mean' apparently it required a yet vaster effort to pronounce an explanation the doleful look the superhuman indifference were repeated in due order sound a little more distinct uttered the words 'we cannot be as we have been in england' and then the cheerful martyr took a few steps farther 'why you don't mean to say you're going to give me up and not be friends with me because we've come back to england' cried the girl in a rapid breath eyeing him seriously most conscientiously he did not mean it but he replied with the quietest negative 'no' she mimicked him 'why do you say no like that why are you so mysterious evan won't you promise me to come and stop with us for weeks haven't you said we would ride and hunt and fish together and read books and do all sorts of things' he replied with the quietest affirmative 'yes what does yes mean' she lifted her chest to shake out the dead alive monosyllable as he had done 'why are you so singular this morning evan have i offended you you are so touchy' the slur on his reputation for sensitiveness induced the young man to attempt being more explicit 'i mean' he said hesitating 'why we must part we shall not see each other every day nothing more than that' and away went the cheerful martyr in sublimest mood 'oh and that makes you sorry' a shade of archness was in her voice the girl waited as if to collect something in her mind and was now a patronizing woman 'why you dear sentimental boy you don't suppose we could see each other every day for ever' it was perhaps the cruelest question that could have been addressed to the sentimental boy from her mouth but he was a cheerful martyr 'you dear don doloroso' she resumed 'i declare if you are not just like those young portugals this morning and over there you were such a dear english fellow and that's why i liked you so much do change do please be lively and yourself again or mind i'll call you don doloroso and that shall be your name in england see there that's that's what's the name of that place hoy mr skerne' she hailed the boatswain passing 'do tell me the name of that place' mr skerne righted about to satisfy her minutely and then coming up to evan he touched his hat and said 'i mayn't have another opportunity we shall be busy up there of thankin' you again sir for what you did for my poor drunken brother bill and you may take my word i won't forget it sir if he does and i suppose he'll be drowning his memory just as he was near drowning himself' evan muttered something grimaced civilly and turned away the girl's observant brows were moved to a faintly critical frown and nodding intelligently to the boatswain's remark that the young gentleman did not seem quite himself now that he was nearing home she went up to evan and said 'i'm going to give you a lesson in manners to be quits with you listen sir why did you turn away so ungraciously from mr skerne while he was thanking you for having saved his brother's life now there's where you're too english can't you bear to be thanked' 'i don't want to be thanked because i can swim' said evan 'but it is not that oh how you trifle' she cried 'there's nothing vexes me so much as that way you have wouldn't my eyes have sparkled if anybody had come up to me to thank me for such a thing i would let them know how glad i was to have done such a thing doesn't it make them happier dear evan' 'my dear miss jocelyn' 'what' the honest grey eyes fixed on him narrowed their enlarged lids she gazed before her on the deck saying 'i'm sure i can't understand you i suppose it's because i'm a girl and i never shall till i'm a woman heigho' a youth who is engaged in the occupation of eating his heart cannot shine to advantage and is as much a burden to himself as he is an enigma to others evan felt this but he could do nothing and say nothing so he retired deeper into the folds of the don and remained picturesque and scarcely pleasant they were relieved by a summons to breakfast from below she brightened and laughed 'now what will you wager me evan that the countess doesn't begin sweet child how does she this morning blooming when she kisses me' her capital imitation of his sister's manner constrained him to join in her laugh and he said 'i'll back against that i get three fingers from your uncle and morrow young sir' down they ran together laughing and sure enough the identical words of the respective greetings were employed which they had to enjoy with all the discretion they could muster rose went round the table to her little cousin alec aged seven kissed his reluctant cheek and sat beside him announcing a sea appetite and great capabilities while evan silently broke bread the count de saldar a diminutive tawny man just a head and neck above the tablecloth sat sipping chocolate and fingering dry toast which he would now and then dip in jelly and suck with placidity in the intervals of a curt exchange of french with the wife of the hon melville a ringleted english lady or of portuguese with the countess who likewise sipped chocolate and fingered dry toast and was mournfully melodious the hon melville as became a tall islander carved beef and ate of it like a ruler of men beautiful to see was the compassionate sympathy of the countess's face when rose offered her plate for a portion of the world subjugating viand as who should say 'sweet child thou knowest not yet of sorrows thou canst ballast thy stomach with beef' in any other than an heiress she would probably have thought 'this is indeed a disgusting little animal and most unfeminine conduct' rose unconscious of praise or blame rivalled her uncle in enjoyment of the fare and talked of her delight in seeing england again and anything that belonged to her native land mrs melville perceived that it pained the refugee countess and gave her the glance intelligible but the countess never missed glances or failed to interpret them she said 'let her i love to hear the sweet child's prattle' 'it was fortunate' she addressed the diplomatist 'that we touched at southampton and procured fresh provision' 'very lucky for us' said he glaring shrewdly between a mouthful the count heard the word 'southampton' and wished to know how it was comprised a passage of portuguese ensued and then the countess said 'silva you know desired to relinquish the vessel at southampton he does not comprehend the word expense but' she shook a dumb alas 'i must think of that for him now' 'oh always avoid expense' said the hon melville accustomed to be paid for by his country 'at what time shall we arrive may i ask do you think' the countess gently inquired the watch of a man who had his eye on time was pulled out and she was told it might be two hours before dark another reckoning keenly balanced informed the company that the day's papers could be expected on board somewhere about three o'clock in the afternoon 'and then' said the hon melville nodding general gratulation 'we shall know how the world wags' how it had been wagging the countess's straining eyes under closed eyelids were eloquent of 'too late i fear me to wait upon lord livelyston to night' she suggested 'to night' the hon melville gazed blank astonishment at the notion 'oh certainly too late tonight a hum i think madam you had better not be in too great a hurry to see him repose a little recover your fatigue' 'oh ' exclaimed the countess with a beam of utter confidence in him 'i shall be too happy to place myself in your hands believe me' this was scarcely more to the taste of the diplomatist he put up his mouth and said blandly 'i fear you know madam i must warn you beforehand i personally am but an insignificant unit over here you know i personally can't guarantee much assistance to you not positive what i can do of course very happy' and he fell to again upon the beef 'not so very insignificant' said the countess smiling as at a softly radiant conception of him 'have to bob and bow like the rest of them over here' he added proof against the flattery 'but that you will not forsake silva i am convinced' said the countess and paying little heed to his brief 'oh what i can do' continued 'for over here in england we are almost friendless my relations such as are left of them are not in high place' she turned to mrs melville and renewed the confession with a proud humility 'truly i have not a distant cousin in the cabinet' mrs melville met her sad smile and returned it as one who understood its entire import 'my brother in law my sister i think you know married a a brewer he is rich but well such was her taste my brother in law is indeed in parliament and he ' 'very little use seeing he votes with the opposite party' the diplomatist interrupted her 'ah but he will not' said the countess serenely 'i can trust with confidence that if it is for silva's interest he will assuredly so dispose of his influence as to suit the desiderations of his family and not in any way oppose his opinions to the powers that would willingly stoop to serve us' it was impossible for the hon melville to withhold a slight grimace at his beef when he heard this extremely alienized idea of the nature of a member of the parliament of great britain he allowed her to enjoy her delusion as she pursued 'no so much we could offer in repayment it is little but this in verity is a case silva's wrongs have only to be known in england and i am most assured that the english people will not permit it in the days of his prosperity silva was a friend to england and england should not should not forget it now had we money but of that arm our enemies have deprived us and i fear without it we cannot hope to have the justice of our cause pleaded in the english papers mr redner you know the correspondent in lisbon is a sworn foe to silva and why but because i would not procure him an invitation to court the man was so horridly vulgar his gloves were never clean i had to hold a bouquet to my nose when i talked to him that you say was my fault truly so but what woman can be civil to a low bred pretentious offensive man' mrs melville again appealed to smiled perfect sympathy and said to account for his character 'yes he is the son of a small shopkeeper of some kind in southampton i hear' 'a very good fellow in his way' said her husband 'oh i can't bear that class of people' rose exclaimed 'i always keep out of their way you can always tell them' the countess smiled considerate approbation of her exclusiveness and discernment so sweet a smile 'you were on deck early my dear' she asked evan rather abruptly master alec answered for him 'yes he was and so was rose they made an appointment just as they used to do under the oranges' 'children' the countess smiled to mrs melville 'they always whisper when i'm by' alec appended 'children' the countess's sweetened visage entreated mrs melville to re echo but that lady thought it best for the moment to direct rose to look to her packing now that she had done breakfast 'and i will take a walk with my brother on deck' said the countess 'silva is too harassed for converse' the parties were thus divided the silent count was left to meditate on his wrongs in the saloon and the diplomatist alone with his lady thought fit to say to her shortly 'perhaps it would be as well to draw away from these people a little we 've done as much as we could for them in bringing them over here they may be trying to compromise us that woman's absurd she 's ashamed of the brewer and yet she wants to sell him or wants us to buy him ha i think she wants us to send a couple of frigates and threaten bombardment of the capital if they don't take her husband back and receive him with honours' 'perhaps it would be as well' said mrs melville 'rose's invitation to him goes for nothing' 'rose inviting the count down to hampshire' the diplomatist's brows were lifted 'no i mean the other' said the diplomatist's wife 'oh the young fellow very good young fellow gentlemanly no harm in him' 'perhaps not' said the diplomatist's wife 'you don't suppose he expects us to keep him on or provide for him over here eh' the diplomatist's wife informed him that such was not her thought that he did not understand and that it did not matter and as soon as the hon melville saw that she was brooding something essentially feminine and which had no relationship to the great game of public life curiosity was extinguished in him on deck the countess paced with evan and was for a time pleasantly diverted by the admiration she could without looking perceive that her sorrow subdued graces had aroused in the breast of a susceptible naval lieutenant at last she spoke 'my dear remember this your last word to mr jocelyn will be i will do myself the honour to call upon my benefactor early to rose you will say be assured miss jocelyn miss jocelyn i shall not fail in hastening to pay my respects to your family in hampshire you will remember to do it in the exact form i speak it' evan laughed 'what call him benefactor to his face i couldn't do it' 'ah my child' 'besides he isn't a benefactor at all his private secretary died and i stepped in to fill the post because nobody else was handy' 'and tell me of her who pushed you forward evan' 'my dear sister i'm sure i'm not ungrateful' 'no but headstrong opinionated now these people will endeavour oh i have seen it in a thousand little things they wish to shake us off now if you will but do as i indicate put your faith in an older head evan it is your only chance of society in england for your brother in law i ask you what sort of people will you meet at the cogglesbys now and then a nobleman very much out of his element in short you have fed upon a diet which will make you to distinguish and painfully to know the difference indeed yes you are looking about for rose it depends upon your behaviour now whether you are to see her at all in england do you forget you wished once to inform her of your origin think of her words at the breakfast this morning' the countess imagined she had produced an impression evan said 'yes and i should have liked to have told her this morning that i'm myself nothing more than the son of a ' 'stop cried his sister glancing about in horror the admiring lieutenant met her eye blandishingly she smiled on him 'most beautiful weather for a welcome to dear england' and passed with majesty 'boy' she resumed 'are you mad' 'i hate being such a hypocrite madam' 'then you do not love her evan' this may have been dubious logic but it resulted from a clear sequence of ideas in the lady's head evan did not contest it 'and assuredly you will lose her evan think of my troubles i have to intrigue for silva i look to your future i smile oh heaven how do i not smile when things are spoken that pierce my heart this morning at the breakfast' evan took her hand and patted it 'what is your pity' she sighed 'if it had not been for you my dear sister i should never have held my tongue' 'you are not a harrington you are a dawley' she exclaimed indignantly evan received the accusation of possessing more of his mother's spirit than his father's in silence 'you would not have held your tongue' she said with fervid severity 'and you would have betrayed yourself and you would have said you were that and you in that costume why goodness gracious could you bear to appear so ridiculous' the poor young man involuntarily surveyed his person the pains of an impostor seized him the deplorable image of the don making confession became present to his mind it was a clever stroke of this female intriguer she saw him redden grievously and blink his eyes and not wishing to probe him so that he would feel intolerable disgust at his imprisonment in the don she continued 'but you have the sense to see your duties evan you have an excellent sense in the main no one would dream to see you you did not i must say you did not make enough of your gallantry a portuguese who had saved a man's life evan would he have been so boorish you behaved as if it was a matter of course that you should go overboard after anybody in your clothes on a dark night so then the jocelyns took it i barely heard one compliment to you and rose what an effect it should have had on her but owing to your manner i do believe the girl thinks it nothing but your ordinary business to go overboard after anybody in your clothes on a dark night 'pon my honour i believe she expects to see you always dripping' the countess uttered a burst of hysterical humour 'so you miss your credit that inebriated sailor should really have been gold to you be not so young and thoughtless' the countess then proceeded to tell him how foolishly he had let slip his great opportunity a portuguese would have fixed the young lady long before by tender moonlight in captivating language beneath the umbrageous orange groves a portuguese would have accurately calculated the effect of the perfume of the blossom on her sensitive nostrils and know the exact moment when to kneel and declare his passion sonorously 'yes' said evan 'one of them did she told me' 'she told you and you what did you do' 'laughed at him with her to be sure' 'laughed at him she told you and you helped her to laugh at love have you no perceptions why did she tell you' 'because she thought him such a fool i suppose' 'you never will know a woman' said the countess with contempt much of his worldly sister at a time was more than evan could bear accustomed to the symptoms of restiveness she finished her discourse enjoyed a quiet parade up and down under the gaze of the lieutenant and could find leisure to note whether she at all struck the inferior seamen even while her mind was absorbed by the multiform troubles and anxieties for which she took such innocent indemnification the appearance of the hon melville jocelyn on deck and without his wife recalled her to business it is a peculiarity of female diplomatists that they fear none save their own sex men they regard as their natural prey in women they see rival hunters using their own weapons the countess smiled a slowly kindling smile up to him set her brother adrift and delicately linked herself to evan's benefactor 'i have been thinking' she said 'knowing your kind and most considerate attentions that we may compromise you in england' he at once assured her he hoped not he thought not at all 'the idea is due to my brother' she went on 'for i women know so little and most guiltlessly should we have done so my brother perhaps does not think of us foremost but his argument i can distinguish i can see that were you openly to plead silva's cause you might bring yourself into odium mr jocelyn and heaven knows i would not that may i then ask that in england we may be simply upon the same footing of private friendship' the diplomatist looked into her uplifted visage that had all the sugary sparkles of a crystallized preserved fruit of the portugal clime and observed confidentially that with every willingness in the world to serve her he did think it would possibly be better for a time to be upon that footing apart from political considerations 'i was very sure my brother would apprehend your views' said the countess 'he poor boy his career is closed he must sink into a different sphere he will greatly miss the intercourse with you and your sweet family' further relieved the diplomatist delivered a high opinion of the young gentleman his abilities and his conduct and trusted he should see him frequently by an apparent sacrifice the lady thus obtained what she wanted near the hour speculated on by the diplomatist the papers came on board and he unaware how he had been manoeuvred for lack of a wife at his elbow was quickly engaged in appeasing the great british hunger for news second only to that for beef it seems and equally acceptable salted when it cannot be had fresh leaving the devotee of statecraft with his legs crossed and his face wearing the cognizant air of one whose head is above the waters of events to enjoy the mighty meal of fresh and salted at discretion the countess dived below meantime the jocasta as smoothly as before she was ignorant of how the world wagged slipped up the river with the tide and the sun hung red behind the forest of masts burnishing a broad length of the serpentine haven of the nations of the earth a young englishman returning home can hardly look on this scene without some pride of kinship evan stood at the fore part of the vessel rose in quiet english attire had escaped from her aunt to join him singing in his ears to spur his senses 'isn't it beautiful isn't it beautiful dear old england' 'what do you find so beautiful' he asked 'oh you dull fellow why the ships and the houses and the smoke to be sure' 'the ships why i thought you despised trade mademoiselle' 'and so i do that is not trade but tradesmen of course i mean shopkeepers' 'it's they who send the ships to and fro and make the picture that pleases you nevertheless' 'do they' said she indifferently and then with a sort of fervour 'why do you always grow so cold to me whenever we get on this subject' 'i cold' evan responded the incessant fears of his diplomatic sister had succeeded in making him painfully jealous of this subject he turned it off 'why our feelings are just the same do you know what i was thinking when you came up i was thinking that i hoped i might never disgrace the name of an englishman' 'now that's noble' cried the girl 'and i'm sure you never will of an english gentleman evan i like that better' 'would your rather be called a true english lady than a true english woman rose' 'don't think i would my dear' she answered pertly 'but gentleman always means more than man to me' 'and what's a gentleman mademoiselle' 'can't tell you don doloroso something you are sir' she added surveying him evan sucked the bitter and the sweet of her explanation his sister in her anxiety to put him on his guard had not beguiled him to forget his real state his sister the diplomatist and his lady the refugee count with ladies' maids servants and luggage were now on the main deck and master alec who was as good as a newspaper correspondent for private conversations put an end to the colloquy of the young people they were all assembled in a circle when the vessel came to her moorings the diplomatist glutted with news and thirsting for confirmations the count dumb courteous and quick eyed the honourable lady complacent in the consciousness of boxes well packed the countess breathing mellifluous long drawn adieux that should provoke invitations evan and rose regarded each other the boat to convey them on shore was being lowered and they were preparing to move forward just then the vessel was boarded by a stranger 'is that one of the creatures of your customs i did imagine we were safe from them' exclaimed the countess the diplomatist laughingly requested her to save herself anxiety on that score while under his wing but she had drawn attention to the intruder who was seen addressing one of the midshipmen he was a man in a long brown coat and loose white neckcloth spectacles on nose which he wore considerably below the bridge and peered over as if their main use were to sight his eye a beaver hat with broadish brim on his head a man of no station it was evident to the ladies at once and they would have taken no further notice of him had he not been seen stepping toward them in the rear of the young midshipman the latter came to evan and said 'a fellow of the name of goren wants you says there's something the matter at home' evan advanced and bowed stiffly mr goren held out his hand 'you don't remember me young man i cut out your first suit for you when you were breeched though yes ah your poor father wouldn't put his hand to it goren' embarrassed and not quite alive to the chapter of facts this name should have opened to him evan bowed again 'goren' continued the possessor of the name he had a cracked voice that when he spoke a word of two syllables commenced with a lugubrious crow and ended in what one might have taken for a curious question 'it is a bad business brings me young man i 'm not the best messenger for such tidings it's a black suit young man it's your father' the diplomatist and his lady gradually edged back but rose remained beside the countess who breathed quick and seemed to have lost her self command thinking he was apprehended mr goren said 'i 'm going down to night to take care of the shop he 's to be buried in his old uniform you had better come with me by the night coach if you would see the last of him young man' breaking an odd pause that had fallen the countess cried aloud suddenly 'in his uniform' mr goren felt his arm seized and his legs hurrying him some paces into isolation 'thanks thanks' was murmured in his ear 'not a word more evan cannot bear it oh you are good to have come and we are grateful my father my father' she had to tighten her hand and wrist against her bosom to keep herself up she had to reckon in a glance how much rose had heard or divined she had to mark whether the count had understood a syllable she had to whisper to evan to hasten away with the horrible man she had to enliven his stunned senses and calm her own and with mournful images of her father in her brain the female spartan had to turn to rose and speculate on the girl's reflective brows while she said as over a distant relative sadly but without distraction 'a death in the family' and preserved herself from weeping her heart out that none might guess the thing who did not positively know it evan touched the hand of rose without meeting her eyes he was soon cast off in mr goren's boat then the countess murmured final adieux twilight under her lids but yet a smile stately affectionate almost genial rose her sweet rose she must kiss she could have slapped rose for appearing so reserved and cold she hugged rose as to hug oblivion of the last few minutes into her the girl leant her cheek and bore the embrace looking on her with a kind of wonder only when alone with the count in the brewer's carriage awaiting her on shore did the lady give a natural course to her grief well knowing that her silva would attribute it to the darkness of their common exile she wept but in the excess of her misery two words of strangely opposite signification pronounced by mr goren two words that were at once poison and antidote sang in her brain two words that painted her dead father from head to foot his nature and his fortune these were the shop and the uniform oh what would she not have given to have seen and bestowed on her beloved father one last kiss oh how she hoped that her inspired echo of uniform on board the jocasta had drowned the memory eclipsed the meaning of that fatal utterance of shop chapter v the family and the funeral it was the evening of the second day since the arrival of the black letter in london from lymport and the wife of the brewer and the wife of the major sat dropping tears into one another's laps in expectation of their sister the countess mr andrew cogglesby had not yet returned from his office the gallant major had gone forth to dine with general sir george frebuter the head of the marines of his time it would have been difficult for the major he informed his wife to send in an excuse to the general for non attendance without entering into particulars and that he should tell the general he could not dine with him because of the sudden decease of a tailor was as he let his wife understand and requested her to perceive quite out of the question so he dressed himself carefully and though peremptory with his wife concerning his linen and requiring natural services from her in the button department and a casual expression of contentment as to his ultimate make up he left her that day without any final injunctions to occupy her mind and she was at liberty to weep if she pleased a privilege she did not enjoy undisturbed when he was present for the warrior hated that weakness and did not care to hide his contempt for it of the three sisters the wife of the major was oddly enough the one who was least inveterately solicitous of concealing the fact of her parentage reticence of course she had to study with the rest the major was a walking book of reticence and the observances he professed also in company with herself alone to have had much trouble in drilling her to mark and properly preserve them she had no desire to speak of her birthplace but for some reason or other she did not share her hero's rather petulant anxiety to keep the curtain nailed down on that part of her life which preceded her entry into the ranks of the royal marines some might have thought that those fair large blue eyes of hers wandered now and then in pleasant unambitious walks behind the curtain and toyed with little flowers of palest memory utterly tasteless totally wanting in discernment not to say gratitude the major could not presume her to be and yet his wits perceived that her answers and the conduct she shaped in accordance with his repeated protests and long reaching apprehensions of what he called danger betrayed acquiescent obedience more than the connubial sympathy due to him danger on the field the major knew not of he did not scruple to name the word in relation to his wife for as he told her should he some day as in the chapter of accidents might occur sally into the street a knight companion of the bath and become known to men as sir maxwell strike it would be decidedly disagreeable for him to be blown upon by a wind from lymport moreover she was the mother of a son the major pointed out to her the duty she owed her offspring certainly the protecting aegis of his rank and title would be over the lad but she might depend upon it any indiscretion of hers would damage him in his future career the major assured her young maxwell must be considered for all this the mother and wife when the black letter found them in the morning at breakfast had burst into a fit of grief and faltered that she wept for a father mrs andrew to whom the letter was addressed had simply held the letter to her in a trembling hand the major compared their behaviour with marked encomiums of mrs andrew now this lady and her husband were in obverse relative positions the brewer had no will but his harriet's his esteem for her combined the constitutional feelings of an insignificantly built little man for a majestic woman and those of a worthy soul for the wife of his bosom possessing or possessed by her the good brewer was perfectly happy she it might be thought under these circumstances would not have minded much his hearing what he might hear it happened however that she was as jealous of the winds of lymport as the major himself as vigilant in debarring them from access to the brewery as now the countess could have been we are not dissecting human nature suffice it therefore from a mere glance at the surface to say that just as moneyed men are careful of their coin women who have all the advantages in a conjunction are miserly in keeping them and shudder to think that one thing remains hidden which the world they move in might put down pityingly in favour of their spouse even though to the little man 'twere naught she assumed that a revelation would diminish her moral stature and certainly it would not increase that of her husband so no good could come of it besides andrew knew his whole conduct was a tacit admission that she had condescended in giving him her hand the features of their union might not be changed altogether by a revelation but it would be a shock to her consequently harriet tenderly rebuked caroline for her outcry at the breakfast table and caroline the elder sister who had not since marriage grown in so free an air excused herself humbly and the two were weeping when the countess joined them and related what she had just undergone hearing of caroline's misdemeanour however louisa's eyes rolled aloft in a paroxysm of tribulation it was nothing to caroline it was comparatively nothing to harriet but the count knew not louisa had a father believed that her parents had long ago been wiped out and the count was by nature inquisitive and if he once cherished a suspicion he was restless he was pointed in his inquiries he was pertinacious in following out a clue there never would be peace with him and then as they were secure in their privacy louisa cried aloud for her father her beloved father harriet wept silently caroline alone expressed regret that she had not set eyes on him from the day she became a wife 'how could we dear' the countess pathetically asked under drowning lids 'papa did not wish it' sobbed mrs andrew 'i never shall forgive myself' said the wife of the major drying her cheeks perhaps it was not herself whom she felt she never could forgive ah the man their father was incomparable melchisedec he might well be called so generous so lordly when the rain of tears would subside for a moment one would relate an anecdote or childish reminiscence of him and provoke a more violent outburst 'never among the nobles of any land never have i seen one like him' exclaimed the countess and immediately requested harriet to tell her how it would be possible to stop andrew's tongue in silva's presence 'at present you know my dear they may talk as much as they like they can't understand one another one bit' mrs cogglesby comforted her by the assurance that andrew had received an intimation of her wish for silence everywhere and toward everybody and that he might be reckoned upon to respect it without demanding a reason for the restriction in other days caroline and louisa had a little looked down on harriet's alliance with a dumpy man a brewer and had always kind christian compassion for him if his name were mentioned they seemed now by their silence to have a happier estimate of andrew's qualities while the three sisters sat mingling their sorrows and alarms their young brother was making his way to the house as he knocked at the door he heard his name pronounced behind him and had no difficulty in recognizing the worthy brewer 'what van my boy how are you quite a foreigner by george what a hat' mr andrew bounced back two or three steps to regard the dusky sombrero 'how do you do sir' said evan 'sir to you' mr andrew briskly replied 'don't they teach you to give your fist in portugal eh i'll sir you wait till i'm sir andrew and then sir away you do speak english still van eh quite jolly my boy' mr andrew rubbed his hands to express that state in himself suddenly he stopped blinked queerly at evan grew pensive and said 'bless my soul i forgot' the door opened mr andrew took evan's arm murmured a 'hush' and trod gently along the passage to his library 'we're safe here' he said 'there there's something the matter up stairs the women are upset about something harriet ' mr andrew hesitated and branched off 'you 've heard we 've got a new baby' evan congratulated him but another inquiry was in mr andrew's aspect and evan's calm sad manner answered it 'yes' mr andrew shook his head dolefully 'a splendid little chap a rare little chap a we can't help these things van they will happen sit down my boy' mr andrew again interrogated evan with his eyes 'my father is dead' said evan 'yes' mr andrew nodded and glanced quickly at the ceiling as if to make sure that none listened overhead 'my parliamentary duties will soon be over for the season' he added aloud pursuing in an under breath 'going down to night van' 'he is to be buried to morrow' said evan 'then of course you go yes quite right love your father and mother always love your father and mother old tom and i never knew ours tom's quite well same as ever i'll' he rang the bell 'have my chop in here with you you must try and eat a bit van here we are and there we go old tom's wandering for one of his weeks you'll see him some day he ain't like me no dinner to day i suppose charles' this was addressed to the footman he announced 'dinner to day at half past six as usual sir' bowed and retired mr andrew pored on the floor and rubbed his hair back on his head 'an odd world' was his remark evan lifted up his face to sigh 'i 'm almost sick of it' 'damn appearances' cried mr andrew jumping on his legs the action cooled him 'i 'm sorry i swore' he said 'bad habit the major's here you know that' and he assumed the major's voice and strutted in imitation of the stalwart marine 'major a strike of the royal marines returned from china covered with glory a hero van we can't expect him to be much of a mourner and we shan't have him to dine with us to day that's something' he sank his voice 'i hope the widow 'll bear it' 'i hope to god my mother is well' evan groaned 'that'll do' said mr andrew 'don't say any more' as he spoke he clapped evan kindly on the back a message was brought from the ladies requiring evan to wait on them he returned after some minutes 'how do you think harriet's looking' asked mr andrew and not waiting for an answer whispered 'are they going down to the funeral my boy' evan's brow was dark as he replied 'they are not decided' 'won't harriet go' 'she is not going she thinks not' 'and the countess louisa's upstairs eh will she go' 'she cannot leave the count she thinks not' 'won't caroline go caroline can go she he i mean caroline can go' 'the major objects she wishes to' mr andrew struck out his arm and uttered 'the major' a compromise for a loud anathema but the compromise was vain for he sinned again in an explosion against appearances 'i'm a brewer van do you think i'm ashamed of it not while i brew good beer my boy not while i brew good beer they don't think worse of me in the house for it it isn't ungentlemanly to brew good beer van but what's the use of talking' mr andrew sat down and murmured 'poor girl poor girl' the allusion was to his wife for presently he said 'i can't see why harriet can't go what's to prevent her' evan gazed at him steadily death's levelling influence was in evan's mind he was ready to say why and fully mr andrew arrested him with a sharp 'never mind harriet does as she likes i'm accustomed to hem what she does is best after all she doesn't interfere with my business nor i with hers man and wife' pausing a moment or so mr andrew intimated that they had better be dressing for dinner with his hand on the door which he kept closed he said in a businesslike way 'you know van as for me i should be very willing only too happy to go down and pay all the respect i could' he became confused and shot his head from side to side looking anywhere but at evan 'happy now and to morrow to do anything in my power if harriet follow the funeral one of the family anything i could do but a we 'd better be dressing for dinner' and out the enigmatic little man went evan partly divined him then but at dinner his behaviour was perplexing he was too cheerful he pledged the count he would have the portuguese for this and that and make anglican efforts to repeat it and laugh at his failures he would not see that there was a father dead at a table of actors mr andrew overdid his part and was the worst his wife could not help thinking him a heartless little man the poor show had its term the ladies fled to the boudoir sacred to grief evan was whispered that he was to join them when he might without seeming mysterious to the count before he reached them they had talked tearfully over the clothes he should wear at lymport agreeing that his present foreign apparel being black would be suitable and would serve almost as disguise to the inhabitants at large and as evan had no english wear and there was no time to procure any for him that was well they arranged exactly how long he should stay at lymport whom he should visit the manner he should adopt toward the different inhabitants by all means he was to avoid the approach of the gentry for hours evan in a trance half stupefied had to listen to the countess's directions how he was to comport himself in lymport 'show that you have descended among them dear van but are not of them our beautiful noble english poet expresses it so you have come to pay the last mortal duties which they will respect if they are not brutes and attempt no familiarities allow none gently but firmly imitate silva you remember at dona risbonda's ball when he met the comte de dartigues and knew he was to be in disgrace with his court on the morrow oh the exquisite shade of difference in silva's behaviour towards the comte so finely delicately perceptible to the comte and not a soul saw it but that wretched frenchman he came to me madame he said is a question permitted i replied as many as you please m le comte but no answers promised he said may i ask if the courier has yet come in nay m le comte i replied this is diplomacy inquire of me or better give me an opinion on the new glace silk from paris madame said he bowing i hope paris may send me aught so good or that i shall grace half so well i smiled you shall not be single in your hopes m le comte the gift would be base that you did not embellish he lifted his hands french fashion madame it is that i have received the gift indeed m le comte even now from the count de saldar your husband i looked most innocently from my husband m le comte from him madame a portrait an ambassador without his coat the portrait was a finished performance i said and may one beg the permission to inspect it mais said he laughing were it you alone it would be a privilege to me i had to check him believe me m le comte that when i look upon it my praise of the artist will be extinguished by my pity for the subject he should have stopped there but you cannot have the last word with a frenchman not even a woman fortunately the queen just then made her entry into the saloon and his mot on the charity of our sex was lost we bowed mutually and were separated' the countess employed her handkerchief 'yes dear van that is how you should behave imply things with dearest mama of course you are the dutiful son alas you must stand for son and daughters mama has so much sense she will understand how sadly we are placed but in a week i will come to her for a day and bring you back' so much his sister louisa his sister harriet offered him her house for a home in london thence to project his new career his sister caroline sought a word with him in private but only to weep bitterly in his arms and utter a faint moan of regret at marriages in general he loved this beautiful creature the best of his three sisters partly it may be because he despised her superior officer and tried with a few smothered words to induce her to accompany him but she only shook her fair locks and moaned afresh mr andrew in the farewell squeeze of the hand at the street door asked him if he wanted anything he negatived the requirement of anything whatever with an air of careless decision though he was aware that his purse barely contained more than would take him the distance but the instincts of this amateur gentleman were very fine and sensitive on questions of money his family had never known him beg for a shilling or admit his necessity for a penny nor could he be made to accept money unless it was thrust into his pocket somehow his sisters had forgotten this peculiarity of his harriet only remembered it when too late 'but i dare say andrew has supplied him' she said andrew being interrogated informed her what had passed between them 'and you think a harrington would confess he wanted money' was her scornful exclamation 'evan would walk he would die rather it was treating him like a mendicant' andrew had to shrink in his brewer's skin by some fatality all who were doomed to sit and listen to the countess de saldar were sure to be behindhand in an appointment when the young man arrived at the coach office he was politely informed that the vehicle in which a seat had been secured for him was in close alliance with time and tide and being under the same rigid laws could not possibly have waited for him albeit it had stretched a point to the extent of a pair of minutes at the urgent solicitation of a passenger 'a gentleman who speaks so sir' said a volunteer mimic of the office crowing and questioning from his throat in goren's manner 'yok yok that was how he spoke sir' evan reddened for it brought the scene on board the jocasta vividly to his mind the heavier business obliterated it he took counsel with the clerks of the office and eventually the volunteer mimic conducted him to certain livery stables where evan like one accustomed to command ordered a chariot to pursue the coach received a touch of the hat for a lordly fee and was soon rolling out of london chapter vi my gentleman on the road the postillion had every reason to believe that he carried a real gentleman behind him in other words a purse long and liberal he judged by all the points he knew of a firm voice a brief commanding style an apparent indifference to expense and the inexplicable minor characteristics such as polished boots and a striking wristband and so forth which will show a creature accustomed to step over the heads of men he had therefore no particular anxiety to part company and jogged easily on the white highway beneath a moon that walked high and small over marble clouds evan reclined in the chariot revolving his sensations in another mood he would have called them thoughts perhaps and marvelled at their immensity the theme was love and death one might have supposed from his occasional mutterings at the pace regulated by the postillion that he was burning with anxiety to catch the flying coach he had forgotten it forgotten that he was giving chase to anything a pair of wondering feminine eyes pursued him and made him fret for the miles to throw a thicker veil between him and them the serious level brows of rose haunted the poor youth and reflecting whither he was tending and to what sight he had shadowy touches of the holiness there is in death from which came a conflict between the imaged phantoms of his father and of rose and he sided against his love with some bitterness his sisters weeping for their father and holding aloof from his ashes evan swept from his mind he called up the man his father was the kindliness the readiness the gallant gaiety of the great mel youths are fascinated by the barbarian virtues and to evan under present influences his father was a pattern of manhood he asked himself was it infamous to earn one's bread and answered it very strongly in his father's favour the great mel's creditors were not by to show him another feature of the case hitherto in passive obedience to the indoctrination of the countess evan had looked on tailors as the proscribed race of modern society he had pitied his father as a man superior to his fate but despite the fitfully honest promptings with rose tempting to him because of the wondrous chivalry they argued and at bottom false probably as the hypocrisy they affected to combat he had been by no means sorry that the world saw not the spot on himself other sensations beset him now since such a man was banned by the world which was to be despised the clear result of evan's solitary musing was to cast a sort of halo over tailordom death stood over the pale dead man his father and dared the world to sneer at him by a singular caprice of fancy evan had no sooner grasped this image than it was suggested that he might as well inspect his purse and see how much money he was master of are you impatient with this young man he has little character for the moment most youths are like pope's women they have no character at all and indeed a character that does not wait for circumstances to shape it is of small worth in the race that must be run to be set too early is to take the work out of the hands of the sculptor who fashions men happily a youth is always at school and if he was shut up and without mark two or three hours ago he will have something to show you now as i have seen blooming seaflowers and other graduated organisms when left undisturbed to their own action where the fates have designed that he shall present his figure in a story this is sure to happen to the postillion evan was indebted for one of his first lessons about an hour after midnight pastoral stillness and the moon begat in the postillion desire for a pipe daylight prohibits the dream of it to mounted postillions at night the question is more human and allows appeal the moon smiles assentingly and smokers know that she really lends herself to the enjoyment of tobacco the postillion could remember gentlemen who did not object who had even given him cigars turning round to see if haply the present inmate of the chariot might be smoking he observed a head extended from the window 'how far are we' was inquired the postillion numbered the milestones passed 'do you see anything of the coach' 'can't say as i do sir' he was commanded to stop evan jumped out 'i don't think i'll take you any farther' he said the postillion laughed to scorn the notion of his caring how far he went with a pipe in his mouth he insinuatingly remarked he could jog on all night and throw sleep to the dogs fresh horses at hillford fresh at fallow field and the gentleman himself would reach lymport fresh in the morning 'no no i won't take you any farther' evan repeated 'but what do it matter sir' urged the postillion 'i'd rather go on as i am i a made no arrangement to take you the whole way' 'oh' cried the postillion 'don't you go troublin' yourself about that sir master knows it 's touch and go about catchin' the coach i'm all right' so infatuated was the fellow in the belief that he was dealing with a perfect gentleman an easy pocket now you would not suppose that one who presumes he has sufficient would find a difficulty in asking how much he has to pay with an effort indifferently masked evan blurted 'by the way tell me how much what is the charge for the distance we've come' there are gentlemen screws there are conscientious gentlemen they calculate and remonstrating or not they pay the postillion would rather have had to do with the gentleman royal who is above base computation but he knew the humanity in the class he served and with his conception of evan only partially dimmed he remarked 'oh h h that won't hurt you sir jump along in settle that by and by' but when my gentleman stood fast and renewed the demand to know the exact charge for the distance already traversed the postillion dismounted glanced him over and speculated with his fingers tipping up his hat meantime evan drew out his purse a long one certainly but limp out of this drowned looking wretch the last spark of life was taken by the sum the postillion ventured to name and if paying your utmost farthing without examination of the charge and cheerfully stepping out to walk fifty miles penniless constituted a postillion's gentleman evan would have passed the test the sight of poverty however provokes familiar feelings in poor men if you have not had occasion to show them you possess particular qualities the postillion's eye was more on the purse than on the sum it surrendered 'there' said evan 'i shall walk good night' and he flung his cloak to step forward 'stop a bit sir' arrested him the postillion rallied up sideways with an assumption of genial respect 'i didn't calc'late myself in that there amount' were these words think you of a character to strike a young man hard on the breast send the blood to his head and set up in his heart a derisive chorus my gentleman could pay his money and keep his footing gallantly but to be asked for a penny beyond what he possessed to be seen beggared and to be claimed a debtor aleck pride was the one developed faculty of evan's nature the fates who mould us always work from the main spring i will not say that the postillion stripped off the mask for him at that instant completely but he gave him the first true glimpse of his condition from the vague sense of being an impostor evan awoke to the clear fact that he was likewise a fool it was impossible for him to deny the man's claim and he would not have done it if he could acceding tacitly he squeezed the ends of his purse in his pocket and with a 'let me see' tried his waistcoat not too impetuously for he was careful of betraying the horrid emptiness till he was certain that the powers who wait on gentlemen had utterly forsaken him they had not he discovered a small coin under ordinary circumstances not contemptible but he did not stay to reflect and was guilty of the error of offering it to the postillion the latter peered at it in the centre of his palm gazed queerly in the gentleman's face and then lifting the spit of silver for the disdain of his mistress the moon he drew a long breath of regret at the original mistake he had committed and said 'that's what you're goin' to give me for my night's work' the powers who wait on gentlemen had only helped the pretending youth to try him a rejection of the demand would have been infinitely wiser and better than this paltry compromise the postillion would have fought it he would not have despised his fare how much it cost the poor pretender to reply 'it 's the last farthing i have my man' the postillion could not know 'a scabby sixpence' the postillion continued his question 'you heard what i said' evan remarked the postillion drew another deep breath and holding out the coin at arm's length 'well sir ' he observed as one whom mental conflict has brought to the philosophy of the case 'now was we to change places i couldn't a' done it i couldn't a' done it' he reiterated pausing emphatically 'take it sir' he magnanimously resumed 'take it you rides when you can and you walks when you must lord forbid i should rob such a gentleman as you' one who feels a death is for the hour lifted above the satire of postillions a good genius prompted evan to avoid the silly squabble that might have ensued and made him ridiculous he took the money quietly saying 'thank you' not to lose his vantage the postillion though a little staggered by the move rejoined 'don't mention it' evan then said 'good night my man i won't wish for your sake that we changed places you would have to walk fifty miles to be in time for your father's funeral good night' 'you are it to look at' was the postillion's comment seeing my gentleman depart with great strides he did not speak offensively rather it seemed to appease his conscience for the original mistake he had committed for subsequently came 'my oath on it i don't get took in again by a squash hat in a hurry ' unaware of the ban he had by a sixpenny stamp put upon an unoffending class evan went ahead hearing the wheels of the chariot still dragging the road in his rear the postillion was in a dissatisfied state of mind he had asked and received more than his due but in the matter of his sweet self he had been choused as he termed it and my gentleman had baffled him he could not quite tell how but he had been got the better of his sarcasms had not stuck and returned to rankle in the bosom of their author as a jew therefore may eye an erewhile bondsman who has paid the bill but stands out against excess of interest on legal grounds the postillion regarded evan of whom he was now abreast eager for a controversy 'fine night' said the postillion to begin and was answered by a short assent 'lateish for a poor man to be out don't you think sir eh' 'i ought to think so' said evan mastering the shrewd unpleasantness he felt in the colloquy forced on him 'oh you you're a gentleman' the postillion ejaculated 'you see i have no money' 'feel it too sir' 'i am sorry you should be the victim' 'victim' the postillion seized on an objectionable word 'i ain't no victim unless you was up to a joke with me sir just now was that the game' evan informed him that he never played jokes with money or on men 'cause it looks like it sir to go to offer a poor chap sixpence' the postillion laughed hollow from the end of his lungs 'sixpence for a night's work it is a joke if you don't mean it for one why do you know sir i could go there i don't care where it is i could go before any magistrate livin' and he'd make ye pay it's a charge as custom is and he'd make ye pay or p'rhaps you're a goin' on my generosity and 'll say he gev back that sixpence well i shouldn't a' thought a gentleman'd make that his defence before a magistrate but there my man if it makes ye happy keep it but you take my advice sir when you hires a chariot see you've got the shiners and don't you go never again offerin' a sixpence to a poor man for a night's work they don't like it it hurts their feelin's don't you forget that sir lay that up in your mind' now the postillion having thus relieved himself jeeringly asked permission to smoke a pipe to which evan said 'pray smoke if it pleases you' and the postillion hardly mollified added 'the baccy's paid for' and smoked as will sometimes happen the feelings of the man who had spoken out and behaved doubtfully grew gentle and christian whereas those of the man whose bearing under the trial had been irreproachable were much the reverse the postillion smoked he was a lord on his horse he beheld my gentleman trudging in the dust awhile he enjoyed the contrast dividing his attention between the footfarer and moon to have had the last word is always a great thing and to have given my gentleman a lecture because he shunned a dispute also counts and then there was the poor young fellow trudging to his father's funeral the postillion chose to remember that now in reality he allowed he had not very much to complain of and my gentleman's courteous avoidance of provocation the apparent fact that he the postillion had humbled him and got the better of him equally it may be acted on his fine english spirit i should not like to leave out the tobacco in this good change that was wrought in him however he presently astonished evan by pulling up his horses and crying that he was on his way to hillford to bait and saw no reason why he should not take a lift that part of the road at all events evan thanked him briefly but declined and paced on with his head bent 'it won't cost you nothing not a sixpence' the postillion sang out pursuing him 'come sir be a man i ain't a hintin' at anything jump in' evan again declined and looked out for a side path to escape the fellow whose bounty was worse to him than his abuse and whose mention of the sixpence was unlucky 'dash it' cried the postillion 'you're going down to a funeral i think you said your father's sir you may as well try and get there respectable as far as i go it's one to me whether you're in or out the horses won't feel it and i do wish you'd take a lift and welcome it's because you're too much of a gentleman to be beholden to a poor man i suppose' evan's young pride may have had a little of that base mixture in it and certainly he would have preferred that the invitation had not been made to him but he was capable of appreciating what the rejection of a piece of friendliness involved and as he saw that the man was sincere he did violence to himself and said 'very well then i'll jump in' the postillion was off his horse in a twinkling and trotted his bandy legs to undo the door as to a gentleman who paid this act of service evan valued 'suppose i were to ask you to take the sixpence now' he said turning round with one foot on the step 'well sir' the postillion sent his hat aside to answer 'i don't want it i'd rather not have it but there i'll take it dash the sixpence and we'll cry quits' evan surprised and pleased with him dropped the bit of money in his hand saying 'it will fill a pipe for you while you 're smoking it think of me as in your debt you're the only man i ever owed a penny to' the postillion put it in a side pocket apart and observed 'a sixpence kindly meant is worth any crown piece that's grudged that it is in you jump sir it's a jolly night' thus may one not a conscious sage play the right tune on this human nature of ours by forbearance put it in the wrong and then by not refusing the burden of an obligation confer something better the instrument is simpler than we are taught to fancy but it was doubtless owing to a strong emotion in his soul as well as to the stuff he was made of that the youth behaved as he did we are now and then above our own actions seldom on a level with them evan i dare say was long in learning to draw any gratification from the fact that he had achieved without money the unparalleled conquest of a man perhaps he never knew what immediate influence on his fortune this episode effected at hillford they went their different ways the postillion wished him good speed and evan shook his hand he did so rather abruptly for the postillion was fumbling at his pocket and evidently rounding about a proposal in his mind my gentleman has now the road to himself money is the clothing of a gentleman he may wear it well or ill some you will mark carry great quantities of it gracefully some with a stinted supply present a decent appearance very few i imagine will bear inspection who are absolutely stripped of it all save the shameless are toiling to escape that trial my gentleman treading the white highway across the solitary heaths that swell far and wide to the moon is by the postillion who has seen him pronounced no sham nor do i think the opinion of any man worthless who has had the postillion's authority for speaking but it is i am told a finer test to embellish much gentleman apparel than to walk with dignity totally unadorned this simply tries the soundness of our faculties that tempts them in erratic directions it is the difference between active and passive excellence as there is hardly any situation however so interesting to reflect upon as that of a man without a penny in his pocket and a gizzard full of pride we will leave mr evan harrington to what fresh adventures may befall him walking toward the funeral plumes of the firs under the soft midsummer flush westward where his father lies chapter vii mother and son rare as epic song is the man who is thorough in what he does and happily so for in life he subjugates us and he makes us bondsmen to his ashes it was in the order of things that the great mel should be borne to his final resting place by a troop of creditors you have seen since the occasion demands a pompous simile clouds that all day cling about the sun and in seeking to obscure him are compelled to blaze in his livery at fall of night they break from him illumined hang mournfully above him and wear his natural glories long after he is gone thus then these worthy fellows faithful to him to the dust fulfilled mel's triumphant passage amongst them and closed his career to regale them when they returned mrs mel whose mind was not intent on greatness was occupied in spreading meat and wine mrs fiske assisted her as well as she could seeing that one hand was entirely engaged by her handkerchief she had already stumbled and dropped a glass which had brought on her sharp condemnation from her aunt who bade her sit down or go upstairs to have her cry out and then return to be serviceable 'oh i can't help it' sobbed mrs fiske 'that he should be carried away and none of his children to see him the last time i can understand louisa and harriet too perhaps but why could not caroline and that they should be too fine ladies to let their brother come and bury his father oh it does seem ' mrs fiske fell into a chair and surrendered to grief 'where is the cold tongue' said mrs mel to sally the maid in a brief under voice 'please mum jacko ' 'he must be whipped you are a careless slut' 'please i can't think of everybody and everything and poor master ' sally plumped on a seat and took sanctuary under her apron mrs mel glanced at the pair continuing her labour 'oh aunt aunt' cried mrs fiske 'why didn't you put it off for another day to give evan a chance' 'master 'd have kept another two days he would' whimpered sally 'oh aunt to think ' cried mrs fiske 'and his coffin not bearin' of his spurs' whimpered sally mrs mel interrupted them by commanding sally to go to the drawing room and ask a lady there of the name of mrs wishaw whether she would like to have some lunch sent up to her mrs fiske was requested to put towels in evan's bedroom 'yes aunt if you're not infatuated' said mrs fiske as she prepared to obey while sally seeing that her public exhibition of sorrow and sympathy could be indulged but an instant longer unwound herself for a violent paroxysm blurting between stops 'if he'd ony've gone to his last bed comfortable if he'd ony 've been that decent as not for to go to his last bed with his clothes on if he'd ony've had a comfortable sheet it makes a woman feel cold to think of him full dressed there as if he was goin' to be a soldier on the day o' judgement' to let people speak was a maxim of mrs mel's and a wise one for any form of society when emotions are very much on the surface she continued her arrangements quietly and having counted the number of plates and glasses and told off the guests on her fingers she sat down to await them the first one who entered the room was her son 'you have come' said mrs mel flushing slightly but otherwise outwardly calm 'you didn't suppose i should stay away from you mother' evan kissed her cheek 'i knew you would not' mrs mel examined him with those eyes of hers that compassed objects in a single glance she drew her finger on each side of her upper lip and half smiled saying 'that won't do here' 'what' asked evan and proceeded immediately to make inquiries about her health which she satisfied with a nod 'you saw him lowered van' 'yes mother' 'then go and wash yourself for you are dirty and then come and take your place at the head of the table' 'must i sit here mother' 'without a doubt you must you know your room quick' in this manner their first interview passed mrs fiske rushed in to exclaim 'so you were right aunt he has come i met him on the stairs oh how like dear uncle mel he looks in the militia with that moustache i just remember him as a child and oh what a gentleman he is' at the end of the sentence mrs mel's face suddenly darkened she said in a deep voice 'don't dare to talk that nonsense before him ann' mrs fiske looked astonished 'what have i done aunt' 'he shan't be ruined by a parcel of fools' said mrs mel 'there go women have no place here' 'how the wretches can force themselves to touch a morsel after this morning' mrs fiske exclaimed glancing at the table 'men must eat' said mrs mel the mourners were heard gathering outside the door mrs fiske escaped into the kitchen mrs mel admitted them into the parlour bowing much above the level of many of the heads that passed her assembled were messrs barnes kilne and grossby whom we know mr doubleday the ironmonger mr joyce the grocer mr perkins commonly called lawyer perkins mr welbeck the pier master of lymport bartholomew fiske mr coxwell a fallow field maltster brewer and farmer creditors of various dimensions all of them mr goren coming last behind his spectacles 'my son will be with you directly to preside' said mrs mel 'accept my thanks for the respect you have shown my husband i wish you good morning' 'morning ma'am' answered several voices and mrs mel retired the mourners then set to work to relieve their hats of the appendages of crape an undertaker's man took possession of the long black cloaks the gloves were generally pocketed 'that's my second black pair this year' said joyce 'they'll last a time to come i don't need to buy gloves while neighbours pop off' 'undertakers' gloves seem to me as if they're made for mutton fists' remarked welbeck upon which kilne nudged barnes the butcher with a sharp 'aha' and barnes observed 'oh i never wear 'em they does for my boys on sundays i smoke a pipe at home' the fallow field farmer held his length of crape aloft and inquired 'what shall do with this' 'oh you keep it' said one or two coxwell rubbed his chin 'don't like to rob the widder' 'what's left goes to the undertaker' asked grossby 'to be sure' said barnes and kilne added 'it's a job' lawyer perkins ejaculating confidently 'perquisites of office gentlemen perquisites of office' which settled the dispute and appeased every conscience a survey of the table ensued the mourners felt hunger or else thirst but had not it appeared amalgamated the two appetites as yet thirst was the predominant declaration and grossby after an examination of the decanters unctuously deduced the fact which he announced that port and sherry were present 'try the port' said kilne 'good' barnes inquired a very intelligent 'i ought to know' with a reserve of regret at the extension of his intimacy with the particular vintage under that roof was winked by kilne lawyer perkins touched the arm of a mourner about to be experimental on kilne's port 'i think we had better wait till young mr harrington takes the table don't you see' 'yes ah' croaked goren 'the head of the family as the saying goes' 'i suppose we shan't go into business to day' joyce carelessly observed lawyer perkins answered 'no you can't expect it mr harrington has led me to anticipate that he will appoint a day don't you see' 'oh i see' returned joyce 'i ain't in such a hurry what's he doing' doubleday whose propensities were waggish suggested 'shaving' but half ashamed of it since the joke missed fell to as if he were soaping his face and had some trouble to contract his jaw the delay in evan's attendance on the guests of the house was caused by the fact that mrs mel had lain in wait for him descending to warn him that he must treat them with no supercilious civility and to tell him partly the reason why on hearing the potential relations in which they stood toward the estate of his father evan hastily and with the assurance of a son of fortune said they should be paid 'that's what they would like to hear' said mrs mel 'you may just mention it when they're going to leave say you will fix a day to meet them' 'every farthing' pursued evan on whom the tidings were beginning to operate 'what debts my poor father' 'and a thumping sum van you will open your eyes wider' 'but it shall be paid mother it shall be paid debts i hate them i'd slave night and day to pay them' mrs mel spoke in a more positive tense 'and so will i van now go' it mattered little to her what sort of effect on his demeanour her revelation produced so long as the resolve she sought to bring him to was nailed in his mind and she was a woman to knock and knock again till it was firmly fixed there with a strong purpose and no plans there were few who could resist what in her circle she willed not even a youth who would gaily have marched to the scaffold rather than stand behind a counter a purpose wedded to plans may easily suffer shipwreck but an unfettered purpose that moulds circumstances as they arise masters us and is terrible character melts to it like metal in the steady furnace the projector of plots is but a miserable gambler and votary of chances of a far higher quality is the will that can subdue itself to wait and lay no petty traps for opportunity poets may fable of such a will that it makes the very heavens conform to it or i may add what is almost equal thereto one who would be a gentleman to consent to be a tailor the only person who ever held in his course against mrs mel was mel her husband but with him she was under the physical fascination of her youth and it never left her in her heart she barely blamed him what he did she took among other inevitable matters the door closed upon evan and waiting at the foot of the stairs a minute to hear how he was received mrs mel went to the kitchen and called the name of dandy which brought out an ill built low browed small man in a baggy suit of black who hopped up to her with a surly salute dandy was a bird mrs mel had herself brought down and she had for him something of a sportsman's regard for his victim dandy was the cleaner of boots and runner of errands in the household of melchisedec having originally entered it on a dark night by the cellar mrs mel on that occasion was sleeping in her dressing gown to be ready to give the gallant night hawk her husband the service he might require on his return to the nest hearing a suspicious noise below she rose and deliberately loaded a pair of horse pistols weapons mel had worn in his holsters in the heroic days gone and with these she stepped downstairs straight to the cellar carrying a lantern at her girdle she could not only load but present and fire dandy was foremost in stating that she called him forth steadily three times before the pistol was discharged he admitted that he was frightened and incapable of speech at the apparition of the tall terrific woman after the third time of asking he had the ball lodged in his leg and fell mrs mel was in the habit of bearing heavier weights than dandy she made no ado about lugging him to a chamber where with her own hands for this woman had some slight knowledge of surgery and was great in herbs and drugs she dressed his wound and put him to bed crying contempt ever present in dandy's memory at such a poor creature undertaking the work of housebreaker taught that he really was a poor creature for the work dandy his nursing over begged to be allowed to stop and wait on mrs mel and she who had like many strong natures a share of pity for the objects she despised did not cast him out a jerk in his gait owing to the bit of lead mrs mel had dropped into him and a little perhaps to her self satisfied essay in surgical science on his person earned him the name he went by when her neighbours remonstrated with her for housing a reprobate mrs mel would say 'dandy is well fed and well physicked there's no harm in dandy' by which she may have meant that the food won his gratitude and the physic reduced his humours she had observed human nature at any rate dandy was her creature and the great mel himself rallied her about her squire 'when were you drunk last was mrs mel's address to dandy as he stood waiting for orders he replied to it in an altogether injured way 'there now you've been and called me away from my dinner to ask me that why when i had the last chance to be sure' 'and you were at dinner in your new black suit' 'well' growled dandy 'i borrowed sally's apron seems i can't please ye' mrs mel neither enjoined nor cared for outward forms of respect where she was sure of complete subserviency if dandy went beyond the limits she gave him an extra dose up to the limits he might talk as he pleased in accordance with mrs mel's maxim that it was a necessary relief to all talking creatures 'now take off your apron' she said 'and wash your hands dirty pig and go and wait at table in there' she pointed to the parlour door 'come straight to me when everybody has left' 'well there i am with the bottles again' returned dandy 'it 's your fault this time mind i'll come as straight as i can' dandy turned away to perform her bidding and mrs mel ascended to the drawing room to sit with mrs wishaw who was as she told all who chose to hear an old flame of mel's and was besides what mrs mel thought more of the wife of mel's principal creditor a wholesale dealer in cloth resident in london the conviviality of the mourners did not disturb the house still men who are not accustomed to see the colour of wine every day will sit and enjoy it even upon solemn occasions and the longer they sit the more they forget the matter that has brought them together pleading their wives and shops however they released evan from his miserable office late in the afternoon his mother came down to him and saying 'i see how you did the journey you walked it' told him to follow her 'yes mother' evan yawned 'i walked part of the way i met a fellow in a gig about ten miles out of fallow field and he gave me a lift to flatsham i just reached lymport in time thank heaven i wouldn't have missed that by the way i've satisfied these men' 'oh' said mrs mel 'they wanted one or two of them what a penance it is to have to sit among those people an hour they wanted to ask me about the business but i silenced them i told them to meet me here this day week' mrs mel again said 'oh' and pushing into one of the upper rooms 'here's your bedroom van just as you left it' 'ah so it is' muttered evan eyeing a print 'the douglas and the percy he took the dead man by the hand what an age it seems since i last saw that there's sir hugh montgomery on horseback he hasn't moved don't you remember my father calling it the battle of tit for tat gallant percy i know he wished he had lived in those days of knights and battles' 'it does not much signify whom one has to make clothes for' observed mrs mel her son happily did not mark her 'i think we neither of us were made for the days of pence and pounds' he continued 'now mother sit down and talk to me about him did he mention me did he give me his blessing i hope he did not suffer i'd have given anything to press his hand' and looking wistfully at the percy lifting the hand of douglas dead evan's eyes filled with big tears 'he suffered very little' returned mrs mel 'and his last words were about you' 'what were they' evan burst out 'i will tell you another time now undress and go to bed when i talk to you van i want a cool head to listen you do nothing but yawn yard measures' the mouth of the weary youth instinctively snapped short the abhorred emblem 'here i will help you van' in spite of his remonstrances and petitions for talk she took off his coat and waistcoat contemptuously criticizing the cloth of foreign tailors and their absurd cut 'have you heard from louisa' asked evan 'yes yes about your sisters by and by now be good and go to bed' she still treated him like a boy whom she was going to force to the resolution of a man dandy's sleeping room was on the same floor as evan's thither when she had quitted her son she directed her steps she had heard dandy tumble up stairs the moment his duties were over and knew what to expect when the bottles had been in his way for drink made dandy savage and a terror to himself it was her command to him that when he happened to come across liquor he should immediately seek his bedroom and bolt the door and dandy had got the habit of obeying her on this occasion he was vindictive against her seeing that she had delivered him over to his enemy with malice prepense a good deal of knocking and summoning of dandy by name was required before she was admitted and the sight of her did not delight him as he testified 'i 'm drunk' he bawled 'will that do for ye' mrs mel stood with her two hands crossed above her apron string noting his sullen lurking eye with the calm of a tamer of beasts 'you go out of the room i'm drunk' dandy repeated and pitched forward on the bed post in the middle of an oath she understood that it was pure kindness on dandy's part to bid her go and be out of his reach and therefore on his becoming so abusive as to be menacing she without a shade of anger and in the most unruffled manner administered to him the remedy she had reserved in the shape of a smart box on the ear which sent him flat to the floor he rose after two or three efforts quite subdued 'now dandy sit on the edge of the bed' dandy sat on the extreme edge and mrs mel pursued 'now dandy tell me what your master said at the table' 'talked at 'em like a lord he did' said dandy stupidly consoling the boxed ear 'what were his words' dandy's peculiarity was that he never remembered anything save when drunk and mrs mel's dose had rather sobered him by degrees scratching at his head haltingly he gave the context 'gentlemen i hear for the first time you've claims against my poor father nobody shall ever say he died and any man was the worse for it i'll meet you next week and i'll bind myself by law here's lawyer perkins no mr perkins i'll pay off every penny gentlemen look upon me as your debtor and not my father' delivering this with tolerable steadiness dandy asked 'will that do' 'that will do' said mrs mel 'i'll send you up some tea presently lie down dandy' the house was dark and silent when evan refreshed by his rest descended to seek his mother she was sitting alone in the parlour with a tenderness which mrs mel permitted rather than encouraged evan put his arm round her neck and kissed her many times one of the symptoms of heavy sorrow a longing for the signs of love made evan fondle his mother and bend over her yearningly mrs mel said once 'dear van good boy' and quietly sat through his caresses 'sitting up for me mother' he whispered 'yes van we may as well have our talk out' 'ah' he took a chair close by her side 'tell me my father's last words' 'he said he hoped you would never be a tailor' evan's forehead wrinkled up 'there's not much fear of that then' his mother turned her face on him and examined him with a rigorous placidity all her features seeming to bear down on him evan did not like the look 'you object to trade van' 'yes decidedly mother hate it but that's not what i want to talk to you about didn't my father speak of me much' 'he desired that you should wear his militia sword if you got a commission' 'i have rather given up hope of the army' said evan mrs mel requested him to tell her what a colonel's full pay amounted to and again the number of years it required on a rough calculation to attain that grade in reply to his statement she observed 'a tailor might realize twice the sum in a quarter of the time' 'what if he does double or treble' cried evan impetuously and to avoid the theme and cast off the bad impression it produced on him he rubbed his hands and said 'i want to talk to you about my prospects mother' 'what are they' mrs mel inquired the severity of her mien and sceptical coldness of her speech caused him to inspect them suddenly as if she had lent him her eyes he put them by till the gold should recover its natural shine saying 'by the way mother i 've written the half of a history of portugal' 'have you' said mrs mel 'for louisa' 'no mother of course not to sell it albuquerque what a splendid fellow he was' informing him that he knew she abominated foreign names she said 'and your prospects are writing histories of portugal' 'no mother i was going to tell you i expect a government appointment mr jocelyn likes my work i think he likes me you know i was his private secretary for ten months' 'you write a good hand' his mother interposed 'and i'm certain i was born for diplomacy' 'for an easy chair and an ink dish before you and lacqueys behind what's to be your income van' evan carelessly remarked that he must wait and see 'a very proper thing to do' said mrs mel for now that she had fixed him to some explanation of his prospects she could condescend in her stiff way to banter slightly touched by it evan pursued half laughing as men do who wish to propitiate common sense on behalf of what seems tolerably absurd 'it 's not the immediate income you know mother one thinks of one's future in the diplomatic service as louisa says you come to be known to ministers gradually i mean that is they hear of you and if you show you have some capacity louisa wants me to throw it up in time and stand for parliament andrew she thinks would be glad to help me to his seat once in parliament and known to ministers you your career is open to you' in justice to mr evan harrington it must be said he built up this extraordinary card castle to dazzle his mother's mind he had lost his right grasp of her character for the moment because of an undefined suspicion of something she intended and which sent him himself to take refuge in those flimsy structures while the very altitude he reached beguiled his imagination and made him hope to impress hers mrs mel dealt it one fillip 'and in the meantime how are you to live and pay the creditors' though evan answered cheerfully 'oh they will wait and i can live on anything' he was nevertheless floundering on the ground amid the ruins of the superb edifice and his mother upright and rigid continuing 'you can live on anything and they will wait and call your father a rogue' he started grievously bitten by one of the serpents of earth 'good heaven mother what are you saying' 'that they will call your father a rogue and will have a right to' said the relentless woman 'not while i live' evan exclaimed 'you may stop one mouth with your fist but you won't stop a dozen van' evan jumped up and walked the room 'what am i to do' he cried 'i will pay everything i will bind myself to pay every farthing what more can i possibly do' 'make the money' said mrs mel's deep voice evan faced her 'my dear mother you are very unjust and inconsiderate i have been working and doing my best i promise what do the debts amount to' 'something like l in all van' 'very well' youth is not alarmed by the sound of big sums 'very well i will pay it' evan looked as proud as if he had just clapped down the full amount on the table 'out of the history of portugal half written and the prospect of a government appointment' mrs mel raised her eyelids to him 'in time in time mother' 'mention your proposal to the creditors when you meet them this day week' she said neither of them spoke for several minutes then evan came close to her saying 'what is it you want of me mother' 'i want nothing van i can support myself' 'but what would you have me do mother' 'be honest do your duty and don't be a fool about it' 'i will try' he rejoined 'you tell me to make the money where and how can i make it i am perfectly willing to work' 'in this house' said mrs mel and as this was pretty clear speaking she stood up to lend her figure to it 'here' faltered evan 'what be a ' 'tailor' the word did not sting her tongue 'i oh that's quite impossible' said evan and visions of leprosy and rose shrinking her skirts from contact with him shadowed out and away in his mind 'understand your choice' mrs mel imperiously spoke 'what are brains given you for to be played the fool with by idiots and women you have l to pay to save your father from being called a rogue you can only make the money in one way which is open to you this business might produce a thousand pounds a year and more in seven or eight years you may clear your father's name and live better all the time than many of your bankrupt gentlemen you have told the creditors you will pay them do you think they're gaping fools to be satisfied by a history of portugal if you refuse to take the business at once they will sell me up and quite right too understand your choice there's mr goren has promised to have you in london a couple of months and teach you what he can he is a kind friend would any of your gentlemen acquaintance do the like for you understand your choice you will be a beggar the son of a rogue or an honest man who has cleared his father's name' during this strenuously uttered allocution mrs mel though her chest heaved but faintly against her crossed hands showed by the dilatation of her eyes and the light in them that she felt her words there is that in the aspect of a fine frame breathing hard facts which to a youth who has been tumbled headlong from his card castles and airy fabrics is masterful and like the pressure of a fate evan drooped his head 'now' said mrs mel 'you shall have some supper' evan told her he could not eat 'i insist upon your eating' said mrs mel 'empty stomachs are foul counsellors' 'mother do you want to drive me mad' cried evan she looked at him to see whether the string she held him by would bear the slight additional strain decided not to press a small point 'then go to bed and sleep on it' she said sure of him and gave her cheek for his kiss for she never performed the operation but kept her mouth as she remarked for food and speech and not for slobbering mummeries evan returned to his solitary room he sat on the bed and tried to think oppressed by horrible sensations of self contempt that caused whatever he touched to sicken him there were the douglas and the percy on the wall it was a happy and a glorious time was it not when men lent each other blows that killed outright when to be brave and cherish noble feelings brought honour when strength of arm and steadiness of heart won fortune when the fair stars of earth sweet women wakened and warmed the love of squires of low degree this legacy of the dead man's hand evan would have paid it with his blood but to be in bondage all his days to it through it to lose all that was dear to him to wear the length of a loathed existence we should pardon a young man's wretchedness at the prospect for it was in a time before our joyful era of universal equality yet he never cast a shade of blame upon his father
