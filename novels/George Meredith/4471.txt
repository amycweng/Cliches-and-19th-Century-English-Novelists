general man of the world and a professional viii some familiar guests ix an inspection of lakelands x skepsey in motion chapter i across london bridge a gentleman noteworthy for a lively countenance and a waistcoat to match it crossing london bridge at noon on a gusty april day was almost magically detached from his conflict with the gale by some sly strip of slipperiness abounding in that conduit of the markets which had more or less adroitly performed the trick upon preceding passengers and now laid this one flat amid the shuffle of feet peaceful for the moment as the uncomplaining who have gone to sabrina beneath the tides he was unhurt quite sound merely astonished he remarked in reply to the inquiries of the first kind helper at his elbow and it appeared an acceptable statement of his condition he laughed shook his coattails smoothed the back of his head rather thoughtfully thankfully received his runaway hat nodded bright beams to right and left and making light of the muddy stigmas imprinted by the pavement he scattered another shower of his nods and smiles around to signify that as his good friends would wish he thoroughly felt his legs and could walk unaided and he was in the act of doing it questioning his familiar behind the waistcoat amazedly to tell him how such a misadventure could have occurred to him of all men when a glance below his chin discomposed his outward face oh confound the fellow he said with simple frankness and was humorously ruffled having seen absurd blots of smutty knuckles distributed over the maiden waistcoat his outcry was no more than the confidential communication of a genial spirit with that distinctive article of his attire at the same time for these friendly people about him to share the fun of the annoyance he looked hastily brightly back seeming with the contraction of his brows to frown on the little band of observant samaritans in the centre of whom a man who knew himself honourably unclean perhaps consequently a bit of a political jewel hearing one of their number confounded for his pains and by the wearer of a superfine dashingwhite waistcoat was moved to take notice of the total deficiency of gratitude in this kind of gentlemans look and pocket if we ask for nothing for helping gentlemen to stand upright on their legs and get it we expect civility into the bargain moreover there are reasons in nature why we choose to give sign of a particular surliness when our wealthy superiors would have us think their condescending grins are cordials the gentlemans eyes were followed on a second hurried downward grimace the necessitated wrinkles of which could be stretched by malevolence to a semblance of haughty disgust reminding us through our readings in journals of the wicked overblown prince regent and his court together with the view taken of honest labour in the mind of supercilious luxury even if indebted to it freshly for a trifle and the hoarheaded nineteenthcentury billow of democratic ire craved the word to be set swelling am i the fellow you mean sir the man said he was answered not ungraciously all right my man but the balance of our public equanimity is prone to violent antic bobbings on occasions when for example an ostentatious garment shall appear disdainful our class and ourself and coin of the realm has not usurped command of one of the scales thus a fairly pleasant answer cast in persuasive features provoked the retort there youre wrong nor wouldnt be whats that was the gentlemans musical inquiry thats flat as you was half a minute ago the man rejoined ah well dont be impudent the gentleman said by way of amiable remonstrance before a parting and none of your dam punctilio said the man their exchange rattled smartly without a direct hostility and the gentleman stepped forward it was observed in the crowd that after a few paces he put two fingers on the back of his head they might suppose him to be condoling with his recent mishap but in fact a thing had occurred to vex him more than a descent upon the pavement or damage to his waistcoats whiteness he abominated the thought of an altercation with a member of the mob he found that enormous beat comprehensible only when it applauded him and besides he wished it warmly well all that was good for it plentiful dinners country excursions stout menagerie bars music a dance and to bed he was for patting stroking petting the mob for tossing it sops never for irritating it to show an eyetooth much less for causing it to exhibit the grinders and in endeavouring to get at the grounds of his dissension with that dirtyfisted fellow the recollection of the word punctilio shot a throb of pain to the spot where his mishap had rendered him susceptible headache threatenedand to him of all men but was there ever such a word for drumming on a cranium puzzles are presented to us now and then in the course of our days and the smaller they are the better for the purpose it would seem and they come in rattleboxes they are actually childrens toys for what they contain but not the less do they buzz at our understandings and insist that they break or we and in either case to show a mere foolish idle rattle in hollowness or does this happen to us only after a fall he tried a suspension of his mental efforts and the word was like the clapper of a disorderly bell striking through him with reverberations in the form of interrogations as to how he of all men living could by any chance have got into a wrangle in a thoroughfare on london bridge of all places in the worldhe so popular renowned for his affability his amiability having no dislike to common dirty dogs entirely the reverse liking them and doing his best for them and accustomed to receive their applause and in what way had he offered a hint to bring on him the charge of punctilio but i am treating it seriously he said and jerked a dead laugh while fixing a button of his coat that he should have treated it seriously furnished next the subject of cogitation and here it was plainly suggested that a degradation of his physical system owing to the shock of the fall must be seen and acknowledged for it had become a perverted engine to pull him down among the puerilities and very soon he was worrying at punctilio anew attempting to read the riddle of the application of it to himself angry that he had allowed it to be the final word and admitting it a famous word for the closing of a controversyit banged the door and rolled drumnotes it deafened reason and was it a london cockney crowword of the day or a word that had stuck in the fellows head from the perusal of his pothouse newspaper columns furthermore the plea of a fall and the plea of a shock from a fall required to account for the triviality of the mind were humiliating to him who had never hitherto missed a step or owned to the shortest of collapses this confession of deficiency in explosive reparteeusing a friends term for the ready giftwas an old and a rueful one with victor radnor his godmother fortune denied him that she bestowed it on his friend fenellan and little else simeon fenellan could clap the halter on a coltish mob he had positively caught the roar of cries and stilled it by capping the cries in turn until the people cheered him and the effect of the scene upon victor radnor disposed him to rank the gift of repartee higher than a certain rosily oratorical that he was permitted to tell himself he possessed in bottle if not on draught let it only be explosive repartee the wellfused bomb the bubble to the stone echo round the horn fenellan would have discharged an extinguisher on punctilio in emission victor radnor was unable to cope with it reflectively no but one doesnt like being beaten by anything he replied to an admonishment of his better mind as he touched his two fingers more significantly dubious than the whole hand at the back of his head and checked or stemmed the current of a fear for he was utterly unlike himself he was dwelling on a trifle on a matter discernibly the smallest an incident of the streets and although he refused to feel a bump or any responsive notification of a bruise he made a sacrifice of his native pride to his intellectual in granting that he must have been shaken so childishly did he continue thinking yes well and if a tumble distorts our ideas of life and an odd word engrosses our speculations we are poor creatures he addressed another friend from whom he stood constitutionally in dissent naming him colney and under pressure of the name reviving old wrangles between them upon mans present achievements and his probable destinies especially upon englands grandeur vitality stability her intelligent appreciation of her place in the universe not to speak of the historic dignity of london city colney had to be overcome afresh and he fled but managed with two or three of his bitter phrases to make a cuttlefish fight of it that oppressively shadowed his vanquisher the daniel lambert of cities the female annuitant of nationsand such like wretched stuff proper to colney durance easily dispersed and out laughed when we have our vigour we have as much as we need of it in summoning a contemptuous pooh to our lips with a shrug at venomous dyspepsia nevertheless a malignant sketch of colneys in the which hengist and horsa our fishy saxon originals in modern garb of liveryman and gaitered squire flatheaded paunchy assiduously servile are shown blacking benisraels boots and grooming the princely stud of the jew had come so near to victor radnors apprehensions of a possible if not an impending consummation that the ghastly vision of the jew dominant in london city over england over europe america the world a picture drawn in literary sepia by colney with our poor hang neck population uncertain about making a bellrope of the forelock to the satyrsnouty master and the norman lord de warenne handing him for a lump sum son and daughter both to be hebraized in their different ways fastened on the most mercurial of patriotic men and gave him a wholelength plunge into despondency it lasted nearly a minute his recovery was not in this instance due to the calling on himself for the rescue of an ancient and glorious country nor altogether to the spectacle of the shipping over the parapet to his right the hundreds of masts rising out of the merchant river londons unrivalled mezzotint and the city rhetoricians inexhaustible argument he gained it rather from the imperious demand of an animated and thirsty frame for novel impressions commonly he was too hot with his business and airy fancies above it when crossing the bridge to reflect in freshness on its wonders though a phrase could spring him alive to them a suggestion of the foreigner jealous condemned to admire in despair of outstripping like satan worsted or when a premiers fine inflation magnified the scene at city banquetsexciting while audible if a waggery in memory or when englands cherished bard the leading article blew bellows and wind primed the lieges that a phrase on any other subject was of much the same effect in relation to it may be owned he was lightly kindled the scene however had a sharp sparkle of attractiveness at the instant down went the twirling horizontal pillars of a strong tide from the arches of the bridge breaking to wild water at a remove and a reddish northern cheek of curdling pipeing east at shrilly puffs between the tower and the custom house encountered it to whip and ridge the flood against descending tug and long tail of sternajerk empty barges with a steamer slowly noseing round off the wharfcranes preparing to swirl the screw and halfbottomupward boats dancing harpooner beside their whale along an avenue not fabulously golden of the deputy masts of all nations a wintry woodland every rag aloft curling to volume and here the spouts and the mounds of steam and rolls of brown smoke there variously undulated curved to vanish cold blue sky ashift with the whirl and dash of a very tartar cavalry of cloud overhead surely a scene pretending to sublimity gazeing along that grand highway of the voyageing forest your london citizen of good estate has reproached his countrys poets for not pouring out succinctly and melodiously his multitudinous larvae of notions begotten by the scene for there are times when he would pay to have them sung and he feels them big he thinks them human in their bulk they are londinensian they want but form and fire to get them scored on the tablets of the quotable at festive boards this he can promise to his poets as for otherwhere than at the festive commerce invoked is a goddess that will have the reek of those boards to fill her nostrils and poet and alderman alike may be dedicate to the sublime she leads them after two sniffs of an idea concerning her for the dive into the turtle tureen heels up they go poet firsta plummet he and besides it is barely possible for our rounded citizen in the mood of meditation to direct his gaze off the bridge along the waterway north eastward without beholding as an eye the glow of whitebaits bowwindow by the riverside to the front of the summer sunset a league or so down stream where he sees in memory savours the elysian end of commerce frontispiece of a tale to fetch us up the outwearied spectre of old apicius yea and urge crispinus to wheel his purse into the market for the purchase of a costlier mullet but is the jew of the usury gold becoming our despotking of commerce in that case we do not ask our countrys poets to compose a single stanza of eulogys rhymesfar from it far to the contrary we bid ourselves remember the sons of whom we are instead of revelling in the fruits of commerce we shoot scornfully past those blazing bellied windows of the aromatic dinners and beyond thames away to the fishermens deeps old englands native element where the strenuous ancestry of a race yet and ever manful at the stress of trial are heard around and aloft whistling us back to the splendid strain of muscle and spray fringes cloud and strong heart rides the briny scoops and hillocks and death and man are at grip for the haul there we find our nationality our poetry no hebrew competing we do or there at least we left it whether to recover it when wanted is not so certain humpy hengist and dumpy horsa quitting ledger and coronet might recur to their sea bowlegs and redstubble chins might take to their tarpaulins again they might renew their manhood on the capture of cod headed by harald and hardiknut they might roll surges to whelm a dominant jew clean gone to the fleshpots and effeminacy aldermen of our ancient conception they may teach him that he has been backsliding once more and must repent in ashes as those who are for jewels titles essences banquets for wallowing in slimy spawn of lucre have ever to do they dispossess him of his greedy gettings and how of the law but the law is always and must ever be the law of the stronger ay but brain beats muscle and what if the jew should prove to have superior power of brain a dreaded hypothesis why then you see the insurgent saxon seamen of the names in two syllables with accent on the first and their danish captains and it may be but a remnant of high nosed old norman lord de warenne beside them in the criminal box and presently the jew smoking a giant regalia cigar on a balcony giving view of a gallowstree but we will try that on our side to back a native pugnacity is morality humanity fraternitynatures rights aha and who withstands them on his a troop of mercenaries and that lands me in red republicanism a hop and a skip from socialism said mr radnor and chuckled ironically at the natural declivity he had come to still there was an idea in it a short run or attempt at running after the idea ended in pain to his head near the spot where the haunting word punctilio caught at any excuse for clamouring yet we cannot relinquish an idea that was ours we are vowed to the pursuit of it mr radnor lighted on the tracks by dint of a thought flung at his partner mr inchlings dread of the jews inchling dreaded scotchmen as well and americans and armenians and greeks latterly germans hardly less but his dread of absorption in jewry signifying subjection had often precipitated a deplorable shrug in which victor radnor now perceived the skirts of his idea even to a fancy that something of the idea must have struck inchling when he shrugged the idea being he had lost it again definition seemed to be an extirpation enemy of this idea or she was by nature shy she was very feminine coming when she willed and flying when wanted not until nigh upon the close of his history did she return fullstatured and embraceable to victor radnor chapter ii through the vague to the infinitely little the fair dealing with readers demands of us that a narrative shall not proceed at slower pace than legs of a man in motion and we are still but little more than midway across london bridge but if a mans mind is to be taken as a part of him the likening of it at an introduction to an army on the opening march of a great campaign should plead excuses for tardy forward movements in consideration of the large amount of matter you have to review before you can at all imagine yourselves to have made his acquaintance this it is not necessary to do when you are set astride the enchanted horse of the tale which leaves the mans mind at home while he performs the deeds befitting him he can indeed be rapid whether more active is a question asking for your notions of the governing element in the composition of man and of hid present business here the tale inspirits ones earlier ardours when we sped without baggage when the impossible was wings to imagination and heroic sculpture the simplest act of the chisel it does not advance tis true it drives the whirligig circle round and round the single existing central point but it is enriched with applause of the boys and girls of both ages in this land and all the english critics heap their honours on its brave old simplicity our national literary flag which signalizes us while we float subsequently to flap above the shallows one may sigh for it an illfortuned minstrel who has by fateful direction been brought to see with distinctness that man is not as much comprised in external features as the monkey will be devoted to the task of the fuller portraiture after his ineffectual catching at the volatile idea mr radnor found repose in thoughts of his daughter and her dear mother they had begged him to put on an overcoat this day of bitter wind or a silken kerchief for the throat faithful to the spring it had been his habit since boyhood to show upon his person something of the hue of the vernal month the white of the daisied meadow and although he owned a light overcoat to dangle from shoulders at the opera crush he declined to wear it for protection his gesture of shaking and expanding whenever the tender request was urged on him signified a physical opposition to the control of garments mechanically now while doating in fancy over the couple beseeching him he loosened the button across his defaced waistcoat exposed a large measure of chest to flaws of a wind barbed on norwegian peaks by the brewers of cough and catarrhhorrid women of the whistling clouts in the pay of our doctors he braved them he starved the profession he was that man in fifty thousand who despises hostile elements and goes unpunished calmly erect among a sneezing and tumbled host as a lighthouse overhead of breezy fleets the coursing of his blood was by comparison electrical he had not the sensation of cold other than that of an effort of the elements to arouse him and so quick was he through this fine animation to feel think act that the three successive tributaries of conduct appeared as an irreflective flash and a gamesters daring in the vein to men who had no deep knowledge of him and his lightning arithmetic for measuring sounding and deciding naturally he was among the happiest of human creatures he willed it so with consent of circumstances a boisterous consent as when votes are reckoned for a favourite candidate excepting on the part of a small band of black dissentients in a corner a minute opaque body devilish in their irreconcilability who maintain their struggle to provoke discord with a cry disclosing the one error of his youth the sole bad step chargeable upon his antecedents but do we listen to them shall we not have them turned out he gives the sign for it and he leaves his buoying constituents to outroar them and he tells a friend that it was not as one may say an error although an erratic step but let us explain to our bosom friend it was a step quite unregretted gloried in a step deliberately marked to be done again were the time renewed it was a step necessitated emphatically by a false preceding step and having youth to plead for it in the first instance youth and ignorance and secondly and o how deeply truly love deep true love proved by years is the advocate he tells himself at the same time after lending ear to the advocates exordium and a favourite sentence that judged by the powers to them only can he expose the whole skeletoncupboard of the case judged by those clearsighted powers he is exonerated to be exonerated by those awful powers is to be approved as to that there is no doubt whom they allseeing discerning as they do acquit they justify whom they justify they compliment they seeing all the facts are not unintelligent of distinctions as the world is what to them is the spot of the erroradmitting it as an error they know it for a thing of convention not of nature we stand forth to plead it in proof of an adherence to natures laws we affirm that far from a defilement it is an illumination and stamp of nobility on the beloved who shares it with us it is a stamp of the highest nobility our world has many ways for signifying its displeasure but it cannot brand an angel this was another favourite sentence of loves grand oration for the defence so seductive was it to the powers who sat in judgement on the case that they all when the sentence came turned eyes upon the angel and they smiled they do not smile on the condemnable she then were he rebuked would have strength to uplift him and who calling her his own could be placed in second rank among the blissful mr radnor could rationally say that he was made for happiness he flew to it he breathed dispensed it how conceive the clearsighted celestial powers as opposing his claim to that estate not they he knew for he had them safe in the locked chamber of his breast to yield him subservient responses the world or puritanic members of it had pushed him to the trial once or twiceor had put on an air of doing so creating a temporary disturbance ending in a merry duet with his daughter nesta victoria a glorious trio when her mother natalia sweet lily that she was shook the rainwater from her cup and followed the good example to shine in the sun he had a secret for them nestas promising soprano and her mothers contralto and his baritone a true baritone not so well trained as their accurate notesshould be rising in spirited union with the curtain of that secret there was matter for song and concert triumph and gratulation in it and during the whole passage of the bridge he had not once cast thought on a secret so palpitating the cause of the mornings expedition and a long years prospect of the present day it seemed to have been knocked clean out of itpunctilioed out fenellan might say nor had any combinations upon the theme of business displaced it just before the fall the whole drama of the unfolding of that secret was brilliant to his eyes as a scene on a stage he refused to feel any sensible bruise on his head with the admission that he perhaps might think he felt one which was virtually no more than the feeling of a thoughtwhat his friend dr peter yatt would define as feeling a rotifer astir in the curative compartment of a homoeopathic globule and a playful fancy may do that or anything only sanity does not allow the infinitely little to disturb us mr radnor had a quaint experience of the effects of the infinitely little while threading his way to a haberdashers shop for new white waistcoats under the shadow of the representative statue of city corporations and londons majesty the figure of royalty worshipful in its marbled redundancy fronting the bridge on the slope where the seas of fish and fruit below throw up a thin line of their drift he stood contemplating the not unamiable reposefullyjolly guelphic countenance from the loose jowl to the bent knee as if it were a novelty to him unwilling to trust himself to the roadway he had often traversed equally careful that his hesitation should not be seen a trifle more impressible he might have imagined the smoky figure and magnum of pursiness barring the city against him he could have laughed aloud at the hypocrisy behind his quiet look of provincial wonderment at londons sculptors art and he was partly tickled as well by the singular fit of timidity enchaining him cart omnibus cab van barrow donkeytray went by in strings broken here and there and he could not induce his legs to take advantage of the gaps he listened to a warning that he would be down again if he tried it among those wheels and his nerves clutched him like a troop of household women to keep him from the hazard of an exposure to the horrid crunch pitiless as tigers teeth and we may say truly that once down or once out of the rutted line you are food for lion and jackalthe forces of the world will have you in their mandibles an idea was there too but it would not accept pursuit a pretty scud overheard said a voice at his ear for finetoday at least mr radnor affably replied to a stranger and gazing on the face of his friend fenellan knew the voice and laughed you he straightened his back immediately to cross the road dismissing nervousness as a vapour asking between a cab and a van anything doing in the city for mr fenellans proper station faced westward the reply was deferred until they had reached the pavement when mr fenellan said ill tell you and looked a dubious preface to his friends thinking but it was merely the mental inquiry following a glance at mudspots on the coat well lunch lunch with me i must eat tell me then said mr radnor adding within himself emptiness want of food to account for recent ejaculations and qualms he had not eaten for a good four hours fenellans tone signified to his feverish sensibility of the moment that the matter was personal and the intimation of a touch on domestic affairs caused sinkings in his vacuity much as though his heart were having a fall he mentioned the slip on the bridge to explain his need to visit a haberdashers shop and pointed at the waistcoat mr fenellan was compassionate over the poor virgin of the smoky city they have their readymade at these shopslast years perhaps never mind do for the day said mr radnor impatient for eating now that he had spoken of it a basin of turtle i cant wait a brush of the coat mud must be dry by this time clear turtle i think with a bottle of the old veuve not bad news to tell you like that old veuve too well to tell bad news of her said mr fenellan in a manner to reassure his friend as he intended you wouldnt credit it for the spring of the year without the spotless waistcoat something of that i suppose and so saying mr radnor entered the shop of his quest to be complimented by the shopkeeper while the attendants climbed the ladder to upper stages for whitewaistcoat boxes on his being the first bird of the season which it pleased him to hear for the smallest of our gratifications in life could give a happy tone to this brightlyconstituted gentleman chapter iii old veuve they were known at the house of the turtle and the attractive old veuve a champagne of a sobered sweetness of a great year a great age counting up to the extremer maturity attained by wines of stilly depths and their worthy comrade despite the wanton sparkles for the promoting of the state of reverential wonderment in rapture which an ancient wine will lead to well you wot the silly girly sugary crudity his given way to womanly suavity matronly composure with yet the sparkles they ascend but hue and flavour tell of a soul that has come to a lodgement there it conducts the youthful man to temples of dusky thought philosophers partaking of it are drawn by the arms of garlanded nymphs about their necks into the fathomless of inquiries it presents us with a sphere for the pursuit of the thing we covet most it bubbles over mellowness it has in the marriage with time extracted a spice of individuality from the saccharine by miracle one would say were it not for our knowledge of the right noble issue of time when he and good things unite there should be somewhere legends of him and the wine flask there must be meanings to that effect in the mythology awaiting unravelment for the subject opens to deeper than cellars and is a tree with vast ramifications of the roots and the spreading growth whereon half if not all the mythic gods inferior and superior infernal and celestial might be shown sitting in concord performing in concert harmoniously receiving sacrificial offerings of the black or the white and the black not extinguishing the fairer fellow tell us of a certainty that time has embraced the wineflask then may it be asserted assuming the great year for the wine ie combinations above that a speck of the white within us who drink will conquer to rise in main ascension over volumes of the black it may at a greater venture but confidently be said in plain speech that the bacchus of auspicious birth induces ever to the worship of the loftier deities think as you will forbear to come hauling up examples of malarious men in whom these pourings of the golden rays of life breed fogs and be moved since you are scarcely under an obligation to hunt the meaning in tolerance of some dithyrambic inebriety of narration quiverings of the reverent pen when we find ourselves entering the circle of a most magnetic polarity take it for not worse than accompanying choric flourishes in accord with mr victor radnor and mr simeon fenellan at their sipping of the venerable wine seated in a cosy corner near the grey city window edged with a sooty maze they praised the wine in the neuter and in the feminine that for the glass this for the widowbranded bottle not as poets hymning it was done in the city manner briefly part pensively like men travelling to the utmost bourne of flying flavour a dell in infinite nether and still masters of themselves and at home such a wine in its capturing permeation of us insists on being for a time a theme i wonder said mr radnor completely restored eyeing his halfemptied second glass and his boonfellow low mr fenellan shook his head half a dozen dozen left nearer the half of that and whos the culprit old days they wont let me have another dozen out of the house now theyll never hit on such another discovery in their cellar unless they unearth a fifth corner i dont blame them for making the price prohibitive and sound as ever mr radnor watched the deliberate constant ascent of bubbles through their rosetopaz transparency he drank that notion of the dish of turtle was an inspiration of the right he ought always to know it for the want of replenishment when such a man as he went quaking his latest experiences of himself were incredible but they passed as the dimples of the stream he finished his third glass the bottle like the cellarwine was at ebb unlike the cellarwine it could be set flowing again he prattled in the happy ignorance of compulsion fenellan remember i had a sort of right to the wineto the best i could get and this old veuve more than any other is a bridal wine we heard of giulia sanfredinis marriage to come off with the spanish duke and drank it to the toast of our little nestas godmother i ve told you we took the girl to the opera when quite a little onethat highand i declare to you it was marvellous next morning after breakfast she plants herself in the middle of the room and strikes her attitude for song and positively almost with the sanfredinis voice illusion of it you knowtrills us out more than i could have believed credible to be recollected by a child but ive told you the story we called her fredi from that day i sent the diva with excuses and compliments a nuptial presentnecklace roman goldwork locketpendant containing sunny curl and below a fine pearl really pretty telling her our grounds for the liberty she replied accepting the responsible office touching letterwe found it so framed in fredis room under her godmothers photograph fredi has another heroine now though she worships her old one still she never abandons her old ones youve heard the story over and over mr fenellan nodded he had a tenderness for the garrulity of old veuve and for the damsel chatter on that subject ran pleasantly with their entertainment mr radnor meanwhile scribbled and despatched a strip of his notebook bearing a scrawl of orders to his office he was now fully himself benevolent combative gay alert for amusement or the probeing of schemes to the quick weighing the good and the bad in them with his fine touch on proportion city dead flat a monotonous key but its about the same as fetching a breath after a run only true it lasts too longnot healthy skepsey will bring me my letters i was down in the country early this morning looking over the house with taplow my architect and he speaks fairly well of the contractors yes down at lakelands and saw my first lemon butterfly in a dell of sunshine out of the wind and had half a mind to catch it for frediand should have caught it myself if i had the truth is we three are country born and bred we pine in london good for a season you know my old feeling they are to learn the secret of lakelands tomorrow it s great fun they think i dont see theyve had their suspicion for some time you saidsomebody saidthe eye of a needle for what they let slip of their secrets and the point of it for penetrating yourswomen but no my dear souls didnt prick and bother and they dealt with a man in armour i carry them down to lakelands tomorrow if the citys flat keeping a secrets the lid on a boiling pot with you mr fenellan said and he mused on the profoundness of the flavour at his lips i do it you do up to bursting at the breast i keep it from colney as vesuvius keeps it from palmieri when shaking him has old colney an idea of it he has been foretelling an eruption of an edifice the laugh between them subsided to pensiveness mr fenellans delay in the delivery of his news was eloquent to reveal the one hateful topic and this being seen it waxed to such increase of size with the passing seconds that prudence called for it come said mr radnor the appeal was understood nothing very particular i came into the city to look at a warehouse they want to mount double guard on your idea of the firemans night patrol and wires has done wonders for the office i guarantee the city if all my directions are followed mr fenellans remark that he had nothing very particular to tell reduced it to the mere touch upon a vexatious matter which one has to endure in the ears at times but it may be postponed so mr radnor encouraged him to talk of an insurance office investment where it is all bog and mist as in the city today the maxim is not to take a step they agreed whether it was attributable to an unconsumed glut of the markets or apprehension of a panic had to be considered both gentlemen were angry with the birds on the flags of foreign nations which would not imitate a sawdust lion to couch reposefully incessantly they scream and sharpen talons they crack the city bubbles and bladders at all events mr fenellan said but if we let our journals go on making use of them in the shape of sham hawks overhead we shall pay for their one good day of the game with our loss of the covey an unstable londons no worlds market place no no its a niggardly national purse not the journals mr radnor said the journals are trading engines panics are grist to them so are wars but they do their duty in warning the taxpayer and rousing parliament dr schlesiens right we go on believing that our god neptune will do everything for us and wont see that steam has paralyzed his trident good you and colney are hard on schlesienor at him i should say hes right if we wont learn that we have become continentals we shall be marched over laziness cowardice he says oh be hanged interrupted fenellan as much of the former as you like he s right about our individualismus being another name for selfishness and showing the usual deficiency in external features its an individualism of all of a pattern as when a mob cuts its lucky each fellow his own way well then conscript them and theyll be all of a better pattern the only thing to do and the cheapest by heaven its the only honourable thing to do mr radnor disapproved no conscription here not till youve got the drop of poison in your blood in the form of an army landed that will teach you to catch at the drug no fenellan besides theyve got to land i guarantee a trusty army and navy under a contract at twothirds of the present cost well start a national defence insurance company after the next panic during said mr fenellan and there was a flutter of laughter at the unobtrusive hint for seizing dame england in the mood both dropped a sigh but you must try and run down with us to lakelands tomorrow mr radnor resumed on a cheerfuller theme you have not yet seen all i ve done there and it s a castle with a drawbridge no exchangeing of visits as we did at craye farm and at creckholt we are there for country air we dont court neighbours at allperhaps the elect it will depend on natalys wishes we can accommodate our concertset and about thirty or forty more for as long as they like you see that was my intentionto be independent of neighbouring society madame callet guarantees dinners or hot suppers for eightyand armandine is the last person to be recklessly boastingwhen was it i was thinking last of armandine he asked himself that as he rubbed at the back of his head mr fenellan was reading his friends character by the light of his remarks and in opposition to them after the critical fashion of intimates who know as well as hear but it was amiably and trippingly on the dance of the wine in his veins his look however was one that reminded and mr radnor cried now whatever it is i had an interview i assure you mr fenellan interposed to pacify the smallest of trifles and to be expected i thought you ought to know itan interview with her lawyer office business increase of insurance on one of her city warehouses speak her name speak the womans name were talking like a pair of conspirators exclaimed mr radnor he informed me that mrs burman has heard of the new mansion my place at lakelands mr radnors clearwater eyes hardened to stony as their vision ran along the consequences of her having heard it earlier this time he added thrummed on the table and thumped with knuckles i make my stand at lakelands for good nothing mortal moves me that butler of hers jarniman you mean hes her butler yes the scoundrelhmpah heaven forgive me shes an honest woman at least i wouldnt rob her of her little fiftynine or sixty next september fifteenth of the month with the constitution of a broken drugbottle poor soul she hears everything from jarniman he catches wind of everything all foreseen fenellan foreseen i have made my stand at lakelands and theres my flag till its hauled down over victor radnor london kills nataly as well as frediand me that isi can use the words to youi get back to primal innocence in the country we all three have the feeling youre a man to understand my beasts and the wild flowers hedgebanks and stars fredis poetess will tell you quiet waters reflecting i should feel it in paris as well though they have nightingales in their bois its the rustic i want to bathe me and i had the feeling at school biting at horace well this is my sabine farm rather on a larger scale for the sake of friends come and pure air water from the springs walks and rides in lanes high sandlanes nataly loves them fredi worships the old roots of trees she calls them the faces of those weedy sandy lanes and the two dear souls on their own estate fenellan and their poultry cows cream and a certain influence one has in the country socially i make my stand on a homenot empty punctilio mr fenellan repeated in a pause punctilio and not emphatically dont bawl the word said mr radnor at the drum of whose ears it rang and sang here in the city the womans harmless and here he struck his breast but she can shoot and hit another through me ah the witchpoor wretch poor soul only shes malignant i could swear but colney s right for once in something he says about oathsdropping empty buckets or something empty buckets to haul up impotent demons whom we have to pay as heavily as the ready devil himself mr fenellan supplied the phrase only the moment old colney moralizes hes what the critics call sententious weve all a parlous lot too much pulpit in us come fenellan i dont think oh yes but its true of me too you reserve it for your enemies i d like to distract it a bit from the biggest of em he pointed finger at the region of the heart here we have skepsey said mr radnor observing the rapid approach of a lean small figure that in about the time of a straightaimed javelins cast shot from the doorway to the table chapter iv the second bottle this little dart of a man came to a stop at a respectful distance from his master having the look of an arrested needle in mechanism his lean slip of face was an illumination of vivacious grey from the quickest of prominent large eyes he placed his masters letters legibly on the table and fell to his posture of attention alert on stiff legs the hands like suckingcubs at play with one another skepsey waited for mr fenellan to notice him how about the schools for boxing that gentleman said deploring in motion the announcement he had to make skepsey replied i have a difficulty in getting the plan treated seriously a person of no stationit does not appear of national importance ladies are against they decline their signatures and ladies have great influence because of the blood which we know is very slight rather healthy than not and it could be proved for the advantage of the frailer sex they seem to be unaware of their own interestsladies the contention all around us is with ignorance my plan is written i have shown it and signatures of gentlemen to many of our city notables favourable in most cases gentlemen of the stock exchange highly the clergy and the medical profession are quite with me the surgical perhaps you mean also sir the clergy strongly on the grounds ofwhat skepsey morality i have fully explained to themafter his work at the desk all day the young city clerk wants refreshment he needs it must have it i propose to catch him on his way to his musichalls and other places and take him to one of our establishments a short term of instruction and he would find a pleasure in the gloves it would delight him more than excessesbeer and tobacco the female in her right place certainly skepsey supplicated honest interpretation of his hearer and pursued it would improve his physical strength at the same time add to his sense of personal dignity would you teach females as wellto divert them from their frivolities that would have to be thought over sir it would be better for them than using their nails i dont know skepsey im rather a conservative there yes with regard to the female sir i confess my scheme does not include them they dance that is a healthy exercise one has only to say that it does not add to the national force in case of emergency i look to that and i am particular in proposing an exercise independent ofi have to saysex not that there is harm in sex but we are for training i hope my meaning is clear quite you would have boxing with the gloves to be a kind of monastic recreation recreation is the word sir i have often admired it said skepsey blinking unsure of the signification of monastic i was a bit of a boxer once mr fenellan said conscious of height and breadth in measuring the wisp of a figure before him something might be done with you still sir skepsey paid him the encomium after a respectful summary of his gifts in a glimpse mr fenellan bowed to him mr radnor raised head from the notes he was pencilling upon letters perused skepseys craze regeneration of the english race by boxingnucleus of a national army to face an enemy at close quartersit teaches that sir i have always been of opinion that courage may be taught i do not say heroism and setting aside for a moment thoughts of an army we create more valuable citizens protection to the weak in streets and byplacesshocking examples of ruffians maltreating women in view of a crowd one strong man is an overmatch for your mob said mr fenellan skepsey toned his assent to the diminishing thinness where a suspicion of the negative begins to wind upon a distant horn knowing his own intentions and before an ignorant mobstrong you say sir i venture my word that a decent lad with science would beat him it is a question of the study and practice of first principles if you were to see a rascal giant mishandling a woman skepsey conjured the scene by bending his head and peering abstractedly as if over spectacles i would beg him to abstain for his own sake mr fenellan knew that the little fellow was not boasting my brother dartrey had a lesson or two from you in the first principles i think captain dartrey is an athlete sir exceedingly quick and clever a hard boxer to beat you will not call him captain when you see him he has dismissed the army i much regret it sir much that we have lost him captain dartrey fenellan was a beautiful fencer he gave me some instruction unhappily i have to acknowledge too late it is a beautiful art captain dartrey says the french excel at it but it asks for a weapon which nature has not given whereas the fists so mr radnor handed notes and papers to skepsey no sign of life it is not yet seen in the city sir the first principles of commercial activity have retreated to earths maziest penetralia where no tides are is it not so skepsey said mr fenellan whose initiative and exuberance in loquency had been restrained by a slight oppression known to guests especially to the guest in the earlier process of his magnification and illumination by virtue of a grand old wine and also when the news he has to communicate may be a stir to unpleasant heaps the shining lips and eyes of his florid face now proclaimed speech with his puckish fancy jackolanterning over it business hangs to swing at every city door like a ragshop doll on the gallows of overproduction stocks and shares are hollow nuts not a squirrel of the lot would stop to crack for sight of the milky kernel mouldered to beard percentage like a cabman without a fare has gone to sleep inside his vehicle dividend may just be seen by tiptoe stockholders twinkling heels over the far horizon too trueand our merchants brokers bankers projectors of companies parade our city to remind us of the poor steamed fellows trooping out of the burstboilerroom of the big ship leviathan in old years a shade or two paler than the crowd o the passengers apparently alive and conversible but corpses all of them to lie their length in fifteen minutes and you fenellan cried his host inspired for a second bottle by the lovely nonsense of a voluble friend wound up to the mark doctor of the ship with this prescription mr fenellan held up his glass empty mr fenellan made it completely so confident he affirmed an order was tossed to the waiter and both gentlemen screwed their lips in relish of his heavy consent to score off another bottle from the narrow list at the office in forty minutes skepseys master nodded to him and shot him forth calling him back by the way in case a man named jarniman should ask to see me you turn him to the rightabout skepsey repeated jarniman and flew a good servant mr radnor said few of us think of our country so much whatever may be said of the specific he offers colney has impressed him somehow immensely he studies to write too pushes to improve himself altogether a worthy creature the second bottle appeared the waiter in sincerity a reluctant executioner heightened his part for the edification of the admiring couple take heart benjamin said mr fenellan its only the bottle dies and we are the angels above to receive the spirit im thinking of the house benjamin replied he told them that again it s the loss of the fame of having the wine that he mourns but benjamin said mr fenellan the fame enters into the partakers of it and we spread it and perpetuate it for you that dont keep a house upright returned benjamin mr fenellan murmured to himself true enough it s elegythough we perform it through a trumpet and theres not a doubt of our being down or having knocked the world down if were loudly praised benjamin waited to hear approval sounded on the lips uncertain as a woman is a wine of ticklish age the gentlemen nodded and he retired a second bottle just as good as the first should one thoughtlessly supposes procure us a similar reposeful and excursive enjoyment as of men lying on their backs and flying imagination like a kite the effect was quite other mr radnor drank hastily and spoke with heat you told me all tell me that mr fenellan gathered himself together he sipped and relaxed his bracing but there really was a bit more to tell not much was it not likely to puff a gale on the voluptuous indolence of a man drawn along by nereids over sunny seawaves to behold the birth of the foamgoddess according to carling her lawyer that is he hints she meditates a blow mrs burman means to strike a blow the lady does he think i fear anydoes he mean a blow with a weapon is it a legal at last fenellan so i fancied i understood but can the good woman dream of that as a blow to strike and hurt for a punishmentthats her one aim she may have her hallucinations but a blowwhat a word for it but its life to us life its the blow weve prayed for why you know it let her strike we bless her weve never had an ill feeling to the woman utterly the contrarypity pity pity let her do that were at her feet my nataly and i if you knew what my poor girl suffers she s a saint at the stake chiefly on behalf of her family fenellan you may have a sort of guess at my fortune ill own to luck i put in a claim to courage and calculation youve been a bulwark to your friends all fenellan allstocks shares mines companies industries at home andabroadall at a sweep to have the woman strike that blow cheerfully would i begin to build a fortune over againsinging ha the woman has threatened it before its probably feline play with us his chin took support he frowned you may have touched her she wont be touched and she wont be driven what s the secret of her i cant guess i never could shes a riddle riddles with wigs and false teeth have to be taken and shaken for the ardently sought secret to reveal itself said mr fenellan his picture with the skeleton issue of any shaking smote mr radnors eyes they turned over ohher charms she had a desperate belief in her beauty the woman s undoubtedly charitable shes not without a mindsort of mind well it shows no crack till its put to use heart yes against me she has plenty of it they say she used to be courted she talked of it my courtiers mr victor there heaven forgive me i wouldnt mock at her to another it looks as if she were only inexorably human said mr fenellan crushing a delicious gulp of the wine that foamed along the channel to flavour we read of the tester of a banditbed and it flattened unwary recumbents to pancakes an escape from the like of that seems pleadable should be none but the drowsy would fail to jump out and run or the insane mr radnor was taken with the illustration of his case for the sake of my sanity it was to preserve my but any word makes nonsense of it couldi must ask youcould any sane manyou were abroad in those days horrible days and never met her i say could you consent to be tiedi admit the vow ceremony so forthtied toi was barely twenty one i put it to you fenellan was it in reason an engagementwhich is i take it a mutual plight of faith in good faith that is with capacity on both sides to keep the engagement between the man you know i was in youth and a more than middleaged woman crazy up to the edge of the cliffas colney says half the world is and she positively is when her spite is roused no fenellan i have nothing on my conscience with regard to the woman she had wealth i left her not one penny the worse forbut she was not one to reckon it i own she could be generous was with her money if she had struck this blowi know she thought of it or if she would strike it now i could not only forgive her i could beg forgiveness a sight of that extremity fetched prickles to his forehead youve borne your part bravely my friend i mr radnor shrugged at mention of his personal burdens praise my nataly if you like made for one another if ever two in this world you know us both and do you doubt it the sin would have been for us two to meet andbut enough when i say that i am she she me till death and beyond it thats my firm faith nataly teaches me the religion of life and you may learn what that is when you fall in love with a woman eighteennineteentwenty years tears fell from him two drops he blinked bugled in his throat eyed his watch and smiled the finishing glass we should have had to put colney to bed few men stand their wine you and i are not lamed by it we can drink and do business my first experience in the city was that the power to drinkkeeping a sound headconduces to the doing of business its a pleasant way of instructing men to submit to their conqueror if it doubles the energies mind not if it fiddles inside i confess to that effect upon me ive a waltz going on like the snake with the tail in his mouth eternal and it wont allow of a thought upon investments consult me tomorrow said mr radnor somewhat pained for having inconsiderately misled the man he had hitherto helpfully guided youve looked at the warehouse thats performed make a practice of getting over as much of your business in the early morning as you well can mr radnor added hints of advice to a frail humanity he was indulgent the giant spoke in good fellowship it would have been to have strained his meaning for purposes of sarcasm upon him if one had taken him to boast of a personal exemption from our common weakness he stopped and laughed now i m pumping my pulpiteh you come with us to lakelands i drive the ladies down to my office ten am if its fine train halfpast we take a basket by the way i had no letter from dartrey last mail he has buried his wife it happens to some men mr radnor stood gazing he asked for the name of the place of the burial he heard without seizing it a simulacrum spectrespark of hopefulness shot up in his imagination glowed and quivered darkening at the utterance of the dutch syllables leaving a tinge of witless envy dartreyfenellan had buried the wife whose behaviour vexed and dishonoured him and it was in africa one would have to go to africa to be free of the galling but dartrey had gone and he was freethe strange faint freaks of our sensations when struck to leap and throw off their load after a long affliction play these disorderly pranks on the brain and they are faint but they come in numbers they are recurring always in ambush we do not speak of them we have not words to stamp the indefinite things generally we should leave them unspoken if we had the words we know them as out of reason they haunt us pluck at us fret us nevertheless dartrey free he was relieved of the murderous drama incessantly in the mind of shackled men it seemed like one of the miracles of a divine intervention that dartrey should be free suddenly free and free while still a youngish man he was in himself a wonderful fellow the pick of his country for vigour gallantry trustiness highmindedness his heavenly good fortune decked him as a prodigy no harm to the head from that fall of yours mr fenellan said none mr radnor withdrew his hand from head to hat clapped it on and cried cheerily now to business as men may who have confidence in their ability to concentrate an instant attention upon the substantial you dine with us the usual quartet peridon pempton colney yatt or catkin priscilla graves and natalythe rev septimus cormyn and his wife young dudley sowerby and iflutes he has precision as naughty fredi said when some one spoke of expression in the course of the evening lady grace perhaps you like her human nature in the upper circle is particularly likeable fenellan said mr radnor emboldened to judge hopefully of his fortunes by mere pressure of the thought of dartreys i put it to you would you say that there is anything this time behind your friend carlings report although it had not been phrased as a report mr fenellans answering look and gesture and a run of indiscriminate words enrolled it in that form greatly to the inspiriting of mr radnor old veuve in one to the soul of old veuve in the other they recalled a past day or two touched the skies and merriment or happiness in the times behind them held a mirror to the present or the hour of the reverse of happiness worked the same effect by contrast so that notions of the singular election of us by dame fortune sprang like vinous bubbles for it is written that however powerful you be you shall not take the winegod on board to entertain him as a simple passenger and you may captain your vessel you may pilot it and keep to your reckonings and steer for all the ports you have a mind to even to doing profitable exchange with armenian and jew and still you shall do the something more which proves that the winegod is on board he is the pilot of your blood if not the captain of your thoughts mr fenellan was unused to the copious outpouring of victor radnors confidences upon his domestic affairs and the unwonted excitement of victors manner of speech would have perplexed him had there not been such a fiddling of the waltz inside him payment for the turtle and the bottles of old veuve was performed apart with benjamin while simeon fenellan strolled out of the house questioning a tumbled mind as to what description of suitable entertainment which would be dancing and flirting and fallallery in the season of youth london city could provide near meridian hours for a man of middle age carrying his bottle of champagne like a guest of an old fashioned weddingbreakfast for although he could stand his wine as well as his friend his friends potent capacity martially after the feast to buckle to business at a sign of the clock was beyond him it pointed to one of the embodied elements hot from natures workshop it told of the endurance of powers that partly explained the successful astonishing career of his friend among a people making urgent if unequal demands perpetually upon stomach and head chapter v the london walk westward in that nationally interesting poem or dramatic satire once famous the rajah in london london limbo and sons now obliterated under the long wash of pressmatter the reflectionnot unknown to philosophical observers and natural perhaps in the mind of an oriental princeproduced by his observation of the march of london citizens eastward at morn westward at eve attributes their practice to a survival of the zoroastrian form of worship his minister favourable to the people or for the sake of fostering an idea in his masters head remarks that they show more than the fidelity of the sunflower to her god the rajah it would appear frowns interrogatively in the princely fashion accusing him of obscureness of speechprinces and the louder members of the grey public are fraternally instant to spurn at the whip of that which they do not immediately comprehend it is explained by the minister not even the flower he says would hold constant as they to the constantly unseena trebly cataphractic invisible the rajah professes curiosity to know how it is that the singular people nourish their loyalty since they cannot attest to the continued being of the object in which they put their faith he is informed by his prostrate servant of a settled habit they have of diligently seeking their divinity hidden above below and of copiously taking inside them doses of what is denied to their external vision thus they fortify credence chemically on an abundance of meats and liquors fire they eat and they drink fire they become consequently instinct with fire necessarily therefore they believe in fire believing they worship worshipping they march eastward at morn westward at eve for that way lies the key this way the cupboard of the supplies their fuel according to stage directions the rajah and his minister enter a gin palaceit is to witness a service that they have learnt to appreciate as anglicanly religious on the step of the return to their indian clime they speak of the hatted sect which is most or most commercially succoured and fattened by our rule there they wave adieu to the conquering islanders as to parsees beneath a cloud the two are seen last on the deck of the vessel in perusal of a medical pamphlet composed of statistics and sketches traceries horrid blots diagrams with numbers referring to notes of the various maladies caused by the prolonged prosecution of that form of worship but can they suffer so and live exclaims the rajah vexed by the physical sympathetic twinges which set him wincing science his minister answers took them up where nature in pity of their martyrdom dropped them they do not live they are engines insensible things of repairs and patches insteamed to pursue their infuriate course to the one end of exhausting supplies for the renewing of them on peril of an instant suspension if they deviate a step or stop nor do they the rajah is of opinion that he sails home with the key of the riddle of their power to vanquish in some apparent allusion to an indian story of a married couple who successfully made their way he accounts for their solid and resistless advance resembling that of the doublywedded man and wife pledged to each other and against the world with mutual union one would like to think of the lengthened tideflux of pedestrian citizens facing southwestward as being drawn by devout attraction to our nourishing luminary at the hour mark when the norland cloudking after a day of wild invasion sits him on his restful bank of bluefish smackocheek red above whitechapel to spy where his last puff of icy javelins pierces and dismembers the vapoury masses in cluster about the circle of flame descending upon the greatest and most elevated of admirals at the head of the strand with illumination of smokeplumed chimneys houseroofs windowpanes weathervanes monument and pedimental monsters and omnibus umbrella one would fair believe that they advance admireing they are assuredly made handsome by the beams no longer mere concurrent atoms of the furnace of business from coal dust to sparks rushing as it were on respiratory blasts of an enormous engines centripetal and centrifugal energy their step is leisurely to meet the rosy dinner which is ever a seesaw with the god of light in his fall the mask of the noble human visage upon them is not roughened as at midday by those knotted hard ridges of the scramblers hand seen from forehead down to jaw when indeed they have all the appearance of sour scientific productions and unhappily for the national portrait in the poem quoted the rajahs minister chose an hour between morning and meridian or at least before an astonished luncheon had come to composure inside their persons for drawing his masters attention to the quaint similarity of feature in the units of the busy antish congregates they had travelled so far to visit and to study these britons wear the driven and perplexed look of men begotten hastily twixt business hours it could not have been late afternoon these orientals should have seen them with victor radnor among them fronting the smoky splendours of the sunset in april the month of piled and hurried cloud it is a rape of the sabines overhead from all quarters either one of the winds brawnily larcenous and london smoking royally to the open skies builds images of a dusty epic fray for possession of the portly dames there is immensity swinging motion collision dusky richness of colouring to the sight and to the mind idea london presents it if we can allow ourselves a moment for not inquireing scrupulously you will do it by inhaling the aroma of the ripe kitchen hour here is a noble harmony of heaven and the earth of the works of man speaking a grander tongue than barren sea or wood or wilderness just a moment it goes as when a wellattuned barrelorgan in a street has drawn us to recollections of the opera or italy another harshly crashes and the postman knocks at doors and perchance a costermonger cries his mash of fruit a beggar woman wails her hymn for the pinched are here the dinnerless the weedy the guttergrowths the forces repressing them that grand tongue of the giant city inspires none human to bardic eulogy while we let those discords be an embittered muse of reason prompts her victims to the composition of the adulatory essay and of the leading article that she may satiate an angry irony upon those who pay fee for their filling with the stuff song of praise she does not permit a moment of satisfaction in a striking picture is accorded and no more for this london this england europe world but especially this london is rather a thing for hospital operations than for poetic rhapsody in aspect too streaked scarlet and pockpitted under the most cumbrous of jewelled tiaras a titanic work of longtolerated pygmies of whom the leaders until sorely discomforted in body and doubtful in soul will give gold and labour will impose restrictions upon activity to maintain a conservatism of diseases mind is absent or somewhere so low down beneath material accumulations that it is inexpressive powerless to drive the ponderous bulk to such excisings purgeings purifyings as mightas may we will suppose render it acceptable for a theme of panegyric to the muse of reason ultimately with her consent to the spirit of song but first there must be the cleansing when night has fallen upon london the rajah remarks monogamic societies present a decent visage and a hideous rear his minister satirically or in sympathetic conservatism would have them not to move on that they may preserve among beholders the impression of their handsome frontage night however will come and they adoreing the decent face are moved on made to expose what the rajah sees behind his courteousness he is an antagonistic observer of his conquerors he pushes his questions farther than the need for them his minister the same apparently to retain the discountenanced people in their state of exposure up to the time of the explanation of the puzzle on board the departing vessel on the road to windsor at the premiers reception in the cell of the police in the presence of the magistrate whose crack of a totally inverse decision upon their case when he becomes acquainted with the titles and station of these imputedly peccant refreshes them they hold debates over the mysterious contrarieties of a people professing in one street what they confound in the next and practising by day a demureness that yells with the cat of the tiles at night granting all that it being a transient novelists business to please the lightwinged hosts which live for the hour and give him his only chance of half of it let him identify himself with them in keeping to the quadrille on the surface and shirking the disagreeable clouds of high colour above london city are as the light of the goddess to lift the angry heroic head over human they gloriously transfigure a murillo beggar is not more precious than sight of london in any of the streets admitting coloured cloudscenes the cunning of the suns hand so speaks to us and if haply down an alley some olive mechanic of street organs has quickened little childrens legs to rhythmic footing they strike on thoughts braver than pastoral victor radnor lover of the country though he was would have been the first to say it he would indeed have said it too emphatically open london as a theme to a citizen of london ardent for the clear air out of it you have roused an orator you have certainly fired a magazine and must listen to his reminiscences of one of its paragraphs or pages the figures of the hurtled fair ones in sky were wreathing nelsons cocked hat when victor distinguishably brightfaced amid a crowd of the irradiated emerged from the tideway to cross the square having thoughts upon art which were due rather to the suggestive proximity of the national gallery than to the flemish mouldings of cloudforms under venetian brushes his purchases of pictures had been his unhappiest ventures he had relied and reposed on the dicta of newspaper critics who are sometimes unanimous and are then taken for guides and are fatal he was led to the conclusion that our modernlauded pictures do not ripen they have a chance of it if abused but who thinks of buying the abused exalted by the critics they have during the days of exhibition a glow a significance or a fun abandoning them where examination is close and constant and the critics trumpetnote dispersed to the thinness of the fee for his blowing as to foreign pictures classic pictures victor had known his purse to leap for a raphael with a history in stages of descent from the master and critics to swarm a raphael of the dealers exposed to be condemned by the critics universally derided a real raphael in your house is aristocracy to the rooftree but the wealthy trader will reach to title before he may hope to get the real raphael or a titian yet he is the one who would it may be after enjoyment of his prize bequeath it to the nationpresented to the nation by victor montgomery radnor there stood the letters in gilt and he had a thrill of his generosity for few were the generous acts he could not perform and if an object haunted the deed it came of his traders habit of mind he revelled in benevolent projects of gifts to the nation which would coat a sensitive name say an ornamental city square flowers fountains afternoon bands of musiccomfortable seats in it and a shelter and a ready supply of good cheap coffee or tea tobacco why not rolls of honest tobacco nothing so much soothes the labourer a volume of plans for the benefit of london smoked out of each ascending pile in his brain london is at night a moaning outcast round the policemans legs what of an allnightlong cosy brightly lighted odoriferous coffeesaloon for rich or poor on the model of the hospitable paduan owner of a penny no soul among us shall be rightly an outcast dreams of this kind are taken at times by wealthy people as a cordial at the bar of benevolent intentions but victor was not the man to steal his refreshments in that known style he meant to make deeds of them as far as he could considering their immense extension and except for the sensitive social name he was of singleminded purpose turning to the steps of a chemists shop to get a prescription made up for his natalys doctoring of her domestics he was arrested by a rap on his elbow and no one was near and there could not be a doubt of the blowa sharp hard stroke sparing the funnybone but ringing his head at the punctilio bump throbbed responsivelyowing to which or indifference to the prescription as of no instant requirement he pursued his course resembling mentally the wanderer along a misty beach who hears cannon across the waters he certainly had felt it he remembered the shock he could not remember much of pain how about intimations his asking caused a smile very soon the riddle answered itself he had come into view of the diminutive marble cavalier of the infantile cerebellum recollecting a couplet from the pen of the disrespectful satirist peter he thought of a fall his head and his elbow responded simultaneously to the thought all was explained save his consequent rightabout from the chemists shop and that belongs to the minor involutions of circumstances and the will it passed like a givers wrinkle he read the placards of the opera reminding himself of the day when it was the single operahouse and now we have twoor three we have also a distracting couple of clowns and pantaloons in our pantomimes though colney says that the multiplication of the pantaloon is a distinct advance to representative truthand bother colney two columbines also we forbear to speak of men but where is the boy who can set his young heart upon two columbines at once victor felt the boy within him cold to both and in his youth he had doated on the solitary twirling spangled lovely fairy the tale of a delicate lady dancer leaping as the kernel out of a nut from the arms of harlequin to the legalized embrace of a wealthy brewer and thenceforth living by repute with unagitated legs as holy a matron despite her starry past as any to be shown in a country breeding the like abundantly had always delighted him it seemed a reconcilement of opposing stations a defeat of puritanism ay and poor womenwomen in the worser plight under the puritans eye they may be erring and good yes finding the man to lift them the one step up read the history of the error but presently we shall teach the puritan to act by the standards of his religion all is coming rightmust come right colney shall be confounded hereupon victor hopped on to fenellans hint regarding the designs of mrs burman his nataly might have to go through a short sharp term of scorching godiva to the gossips she would come out of it glorified she would be reconciled with her family with her story of her devotion to the man loving her the world would know her for the heroine she was a born lady in appearance and manner an empress among women it was a story to be pleaded in any court before the sternest public mrs burman had thrown her into temptations way it was a story to touch the heart as none other ever written of over all the earth was there a woman equalling his nataly and their nesta would have a dowry to make princesses enviousshe would inherit he ran up an arithmetical column down to a line of figures in addition during three paces of his feet dartrey fenellan had said of little nesta once that she had a

accomplish the feat whether she had an ideal of a youth in her feminine head was beyond his guessing she was not the damsel to weave a fairy waistcoat for the identical prince and try it upon all comers to discover him as is done by some excuseably if we would be just nesta was of the elect for whom excuses have not to be made she would probably like a fluteplayer best because her father

mansions offers prospect of the sweep of greensward all but touching up to the sunset to draw it to the dance formerly in his very early youth he clasped a dream of gaining way to an alliance with one of these great surrounding houses and he had a passion for the acquisition of money as a means and it has to be confessed he had sacrificed in youth a slice of his youth to gain it without labourusually a costly purchase it had ended disastrously or say a running of the engine off the rails and a speedy reestablishment of traffic could it be a loss that had led to the winning of his

our drug and so we are in spite of natures wry face and shiver at a mention of what we went through during those days those horrible days hide them the smothering of them from sight set them sounding he had to listen colney durance accused him of entering into bonds with somebodys grandmother for the simple sake of browsing on her thousands a picture of himself too abhorrent to victor to permit of any sort of acceptance consequently he struck away to the other extreme of those who have a choice in mixed motives he protested that compassion had been the cause of it looking at the circumstance now he could see allowing for human frailtyperhaps a wish to join the ranks of the wealthy compassion for the woman as the principal motive how often had she not in those old days praised his generosity for allying his golden youth to her withered agemrs burmans very words and she was a generous woman or had been she was generous in saying that well and she was generous in having a wellborn wellbred beautiful young creature like nataly for her companion when it was a case of need for the dear girl and compassionately insisting against remonstrances they were spoken by him though they were but partial how then had she becomeat least how was it that she could continue to behave as the vindictive fury who persecuted remorselessly would give no peace poisoned the wells round every place where he and his dear one pitched their tent but at last she had come to charity as he could well believe not too late victors feeling of gratitude to mrs burman assured him it was genuine because of his genuine conviction that she had determined to end her incomprehensibly lengthened days in reconcilement with him and he had always been ready to forget and forgive a truly beautiful old phrase it thrilled off the most susceptible of men his wellkept secret of the spacious countryhouse danced him behind a sober demeanour from one park to another and along beside the drive to view of his townhouseunbeloved of the inhabitants although by acknowledgement it had as fredi funnily drawled to express her sense of justice in depreciation good accommodation nataly was at home he was sure time to be dressing sun sets at sixforty he said and glanced at the stained west with an accompanying vision of outspread primroses flooding banks of shadowy fields near lakelands he crossed the road and rang upon the opening of the door there was a cascade of muslin downstairs his darling fredi stood out of it a dramatic undine chapter vi nataly il segreto the girl cried commandingly with a forefinger at his breast he crossed arms toning in similar recitative with anguish dove volare they joined in half a dozen bars of operatic duet she flew to him embraced and kissed i must have it my papa unlock ive been spying the bird on its hedgerow nest so long and this morning my own dear cunning papa werent you as bare as winter twigs tomorrow perhaps we will have a day in the country to go

bathingshed the naiads bower pretty water to see ah and has the house a name lakelands i like the name papa gave it the name theres nothing he can conceal from his girl only now and then a little surprise and his girl is off her head with astonishment but tell me who has been sharing the secret with you fredi strikes home and it is true you dear i must have a confidant simeon fenellan not mr durance he shook out a positive negative i leave col to his guesses hed have been prophesying fire the works before the completion then it is not a dear old house like craye and creckholt wait and see tomorrow he spoke of the customary guests for concert practice the music instrumental and vocal quartet duet solo and advising the girl to be quick as she had but twentyfive minutes he went humming and trilling into his dressingroom nesta signalled at her mothers door for permission to enter she slipped in saw that the maid was absent and said yes mama and prepare i feared it i was sure her mother breathed a little moan not a cottage he has not mentioned it to mr durance why not mr fenellan has been his confidant my darling we did wrong to let it go on without speaking you dont know for certain yet its a large estate mama and a big new house natalys bosom sank ah me heres misery i ought to have known and too late now it has gone so far but i never imagined he would be building she caught herself languishing at her toiletteglass as if her beauty were at stake and shut her eyelids angrily to be looking in that manner for a mere suspicion was too foolish but nestas divinations were targetarrows they flew to the mark could it have been expected that victor would ever do anything on a small scale o the dear little lost lost cottage she thought of it with a strain of the arms of womanhoods longing in the unblessed wife for a babe for the secluded modest cottage would not rack her with the old anxieties beset her with suspicions my child you wont possibly have time before the dinnerhour she said to nesta dismissing her and taking her kiss of comfort with a short and straining look out of the depths those bitter doubts of the sentiments of neighbours are an incipient dislike when ones own feelings to the neighbours are kind could be affectionate we are distracted perverted made strangers to ourselves by a false position she heard his voice on a carol men do not feel this doubtful position as women must they have not the same to endure the world gives them land to tread where women are on breaking seas her nesta knew no more than the pain of being torn from a home she loved but now the girl was older and if once she had her imagination awakened her fearful directness would touch the spot question bring on the scene tocome necessarily to come dreaded much more than death by her mother but if it might be postponed till the girl was nearer to an age of grave understanding with some knowledge of our world some comprehension of a case that could be pleaded he sang he never acknowledged a trouble he dispersed it and in her present wrestle with the scheme of a large country estate involving new intimacies anxieties the courtship of rival magnates followed by the wretched old cloud and the imposition upon them to bear it in silence though they knew they could plead a case at least before charitable and discerning creatures or before heaven the despondent lady could have asked whether he was perfectly sane who half so brilliantlydepreciation of him fetched up at a stroke the glittering armies of her enthusiasm he had proved it he proved it daily in conflicts and in victories that dwarfed emotional troubles like hers yet they were something to bear hard to bear at times unbearable but those were times of weakness let anything be doubted rather than the good guidance of the man who was her breath of life whither he led let her go not only submissively exultingly thus she thought under pressure of the knowledge that unless rushing into conflicts bigger than conceivable she had to do it and should therefore think it this was the prudent womans clear deduction from the state wherein she found herself created by the one first great step of the mad woman her surrender then might be likened to the detachment of a flower on the rivers bank by swell of flood she had no longer root of her own away she sailed through beautiful scenery with occasionally a crashing fall a turmoil emergence from a vortex and once more the sunny whirling surface strange to think she had not since then power to grasp in her abstract mind a notion of stedfastness without or within but say not the mad say the enamoured woman love is a madness having heavens wisdom in ita spark but even when it is driving us on the breakers call it love and be not unworthy of it hold to it she and victor had drunk of a cup the philtre was in her veins whatever the directions of the rational mind exulting or regretting she had to do it as one in the car with a racing charioteer or up beside a more than titanically audacious balloonist for the charioteer is bent on a goal and victors course was an ascension from heights to heights he had ideas he mastered fortune he conquered nataly and held her subject in being above his ambition which was now but an occupation for his powers while the aim of his life was at the giving and taking of simple enjoyment in spite of his fits of unreasonableness in the meansand the woman loving him could trace them to a breath of naturehis gentle good friendly innocent aim in life was of this very simplest so wonderful by contrast with his powers that she assured of it as she was by experience of him was touched in a transfusion of her feelings through lucent globes of admiration and of tenderness to reverence there had been occasions when her wish for the whole world to have proof and exhibition of his greatness goodness and simplicity amid his gifts prompted her incitement of him to stand forth eminently lead a kingdom was the phrase behind the curtain within her shy bosom and it revealed her to herself upon reflection as being still the nataly who drank the cup with him to join her fate with his and why not was that regretted far from it in her maturity the woman was unable to send forth any dwelling thought or more than a flight of twilight fancy that cancelled the deed of her youth and therewith seemed to expunge near upon the halfof her term of years if it came to consideration of her family and the familys opinion of her conduct her judgement did not side with them or with herself it whirled swam to a giddiness and subsided of course if she and victor were to inhabit a large countryhouse they might as well have remained at craye farm or at creckholt both places dear to them in turn such was the plain sense of the surface question and how strange it was to her that he of the most quivering sensitiveness on her behalf could not see that he threw her into situations where hard words of men and women threatened about her head where one or two might on a day some day be heard and where in the recollection of two years back the word impostor had smacked her on both cheeks from her own mouth now once more they were to run the same round of alarms undergo the love of the place with perpetual apprehensions of having to leave it alarms throbbing suspicions like those of old travellers through the haunted forest where whispers have intensity of meaning and unseeing we are seen and unaware awaited nataly shook the rolls of her thick brown hair from her forehead she took strength from a handsome look of resolution in the glass she could always honestly say that her courage would not fail him victor tapped at the door he stepped into the room wearing his evening white flower over a more open white waistcoat and she was composed and uninquiring their nesta was heard on the descent of the stairs with a rattle of donizettis il segreto to the skylights he performed his neveromitted lovers homage nataly enfolded him in a homely smile a countryhouse we go and see it tomorrow and youve been pining for a country home my dear soul after the summer six weeks the house in london does not seem a home to return to and next day nataly draws five thousand pounds for the first sketch of the furniture there is the creckholt she had a difficulty in saying part of it may do lakelands requiresbut you will see tomorrow after a close shutting of her eyes she rejoined it is not a cottage well dear no when the slave of the lamp takes to building he does not run up cottages and we did it without magic all in a year which is quite as good as a magical trick in a night he drew her close to him when was it my dear girl guessed me at work it was the other dear girl nesta is the guesser you were two best of souls to keep from bothering me and i might have had to fib and we neither of us like that he noticed a sidling of her look more than the circumstances obligeto be frank but now we can speak of them waitand the change comes and opportunely i have found its true we have waited long my darling has had her worries however it s here at last prepare yourself i speak positively you have to brace up for one sharp twitchthe womans portion as natata saysand its over he looked into her eyes for comprehension and not finding inquiry resumed just in time for the entry into lakelands with the pronouncement of the decree we present the licence at an altar weve stood before in spirit one of the ladies of your family to support youwhy not not even then no victor they have cast me off count on my cousins the duvidney ladies then we can say that those two good old spinsters are less narrow than the dreightons i have to confess i rather think i was to blame for leaving creckholt only if i see my girl wounded i hate the place that did the mischief you and fredi will clap hands for the country about lakelands have you heard from her of her is it anything victor nataly asked him shyly with not much of hope but some readiness to be inflated the prospect of an entry into the big new house among a new society begirt by the old nightmares and fretting devils drew her into staring daylight or furnacelight he answered mrs burman has definitely decided in pity of usto be free herselfwho can say she s a woman with a conscienceof a kind slow but it brings her to the point at last you know her know her well fenellan has it from her lawyerher lawyer a mr carting a thoroughly trustworthy man fenellan as a reporter thoroughly to be trusted on serious matters i understand that mrs burmanher health is awful yes yes poor woman poor woman we feel for hershe has come to perceive her duty to those she leaves behind consider she has used the rod she must be tired outif human and she is one remembers traits victor sketched one or two of the traits allusively to the hearer acquainted with them they received strong colouring from middays old veuve in his blood his voice and words had a swing of conviction they imparted vinousness to a heart athirst the histrionic selfdeceiver may be a persuasive deceiver of another who is again though not ignorant of his character tempted to swallow the nostrums which have made so gallant a man of him his imperceptible sensible playing of the part on a substratum of sincereness induces fascinatingly to the like performance on our side that we may be armed as he is for enjoying the coveted reality through the partial simulation of possessing it and this is not a task to us when we have looked our actor in the face and seen him bear the look knowing that he is not intentionally untruthful and when we incline to be captivated by his rare theatrical air of confidence when it seems as an outside thought striking us that he may not be altogether deceived in the present instance when suddenly an expectation of the thing desired is born and swims in a credible featureless vagueness on a misty scene and when we are being kissed and the blood is warmed in fine here as everywhere along our history when the sensations are spirited up to drown the mind we become driftmatter of tides metal to magnets and if we are women who commonly allow the lead to men getting it for themselves only by snaky cunning or desperate adventure credulitythe continued trust in the manis the alternative of despair but victor i must ask nataly said you have it through simeon fenellan you have not yourself received the letter from her lawyer my knowledge of what she would do near the gravepoor soul yes i shall soon be hearing you do not propose to enter this place untiluntil it is over we enter this place my love without any sort of ceremony we live there independently and we can we have quarters there for our friends our one neighbour is londonthere and at lakelands we are able to entertain london and wifeour friends in short with some what we have to call satellites you inspect the house and grounds tomorrow sure to be fair put aside all but the pleasant recollections of craye and creckholt we start on a different footing really nothing can be simpler keeping your townhouse you are now and then in residence at lakelands where you entertain your set teach them to feel the charm of country life we have everything about us could have had our own milk and cream up to london the last two months was it very naughty i should have exploded my surprise you will see you will see tomorrow nataly nodded as required good news from the mines she said he answered dartrey isyes poor fellow dartrey is confident from the yield of stones that the value of our claim counts in a number of millions the same with the gold but goldmines are lodgeings not homes oh victor if money but why did you say poor fellow of dartrey fenellan you know how hes yes yes she said hastily but has that woman been causing fresh anxiety and natatas chief hero on earth is not to be named a poor fellow said he after a negative of the head on a subject they neither of them liked to touch then he remembered that dartrey fenellan was actually a lucky fellow and he would have mentioned the circumstance confided to him by simeon but for a downright dread of renewing his painful fit of envy he had also another more distant very faint idea that it had better not be mentioned just yet for a reason entirely undefined he consulted his watch the maid had come in for the robeing of her mistress natalys mind had turned to the little country cottage which would have given her such great happiness she raised her eyes to him she could not check their filling they were like a river carrying moonlight on the smooth roll of a fall he loved the eyes disliked the water in them with an impatient there there and a smart affectionate look he retired thinking in our old satirical vein of the hopeless endeavour to satisfy a womans mind without the intrusion of hard material statements facts even the best of women even the most beautiful and in their moments of supremest beauty have this gross ravenousness for facts you must not expect to appease them unless you administer solids it would almost appear that man is exclusively imaginative and poetical and that his mate the fair the graceful the bewitching with the sweetest and purest of natures cannot help being something of a groveller nataly had likewise her thoughts chapter vii between a general man of thin world and a professional rather earlier in the afternoon of that day simeon fenellan thinking of the many things which are nothing and so melancholy for lack of amusements properly to follow old veuve that he could ask himself whether he had not done a deed of night to be blinking at his fellowmen like an owl all mad for the revellers hoots and flights and mice and moony roundels behind his hypocritical judex air of moping composure chanced on mr carling the solicitor where lincolns inn pumps lawyers into fleet street through the drainpipe of chancery lane he was in the state of the wine when a shake will rouse the sluggish sparkles to foam sight of mrs burmans legal adviser had instantly this effect upon him his bubbling friendliness for victor radnor and the desire of the voice in his bosom for ears to hear combined like the rush of two waves together upon which he may be figured as the boat he caught at mr carlings hand more heartily than their acquaintanceship quite sanctioned but his grasp and his look of overflowing were immediately privileged mr carling enjoying this anecdotal gentlemans conversation as he did liked the warmth and was flattered during the squeeze with a prospect of his wife and friends partaking of the fun from time to time i was telling my wife yesterday your story of the lady contrabandist i dont think she has done laughing since mr calling said fenellan fluted ah he had scent in the eulogy of a story grown flat as election hats of a good sort of man in the way of men a step or two behind the man of the world he expressed profound regret at not having heard the silvery ring of the ladys laughter carling genially conceived a real gratification to be conferred on his wife perhaps you will some day honour us you spread goldleaf over the days to come sir now if i might name the day you lump the gold and make it current coinsays the blushing bride who ought not to have delivered herself so boldly but she had forgotten her bashful part and spoilt the scene though luckily for the damsel her swain was a lover of nature and finding her at full charge named the very next day of the year and held her to it like the complimentary tyrant he was tomorrow then said carling intrepidly on a dash of enthusiasm through a haggard thought of his wife and the cook and the netting of friends at short notice he urged his eagerness to ask whether he might indeed have the satisfaction of naming tomorrow with happiness fenellan responded mrs carling was therefore in for it tomorrow halfpast seven as for company to meet you we will do what we can you go westward to bed with the sun said the reveller perhaps by covent garden i must give orders there orders given in covent garden paint a picture for bachelors of the domestic paradise an angel must help them to enter ah dear me is there anything on earth to compare with the pride of a virtuous life i was married at four and twenty said carling as one taking up the expository second verse of a poem plain facts but weighty and necessary my wife was in her twentieth year we have five children two sons three daughters one married with a baby so we are grandfather and mother and have never regretted the first step i may say for both of us think of it good luck and sagacity joined hands overhead on the day you proposed to the lady and id say that all the credit is with her but that it would seem to be at the expense of her sex she would be the last to wish it i assure you true of all good women you encourage me touching a matter of deep interest not unknown to you the ladys warm heart will be with us probably she sees mrs burman mrs burman radnor receives no one a comic severity in the tone of the correction was deferentially accepted by fenellan pardon she flies her flag with her captain wanting and she has queerly the right so then the worthy dame who receives no one might be treated it struck us conversationally as a respectable harbour hulk with more history than tophonours but she has the indubitable legal right to fly themto proclaim it for it means little else you would have her if i follow you divest herself of the name pin me to no significations if you please o shrewdest of the legal sort i have wit enough to escape you there she is no doubt an estimable person well she is she is in her way a very good woman ah you see mr carling i cannot bring myself to rank her beside another lady who has already claimed the title of me and you will forgive me if i say that your word good has a look of being stuck upon the features we know of her like a coquettes naughty patch or its a jewel of an eye in an ebony idol though ive heard tell she performs her charities i believe she gives away three parts of her income and that is large leaving the good lady a fine fat fourth compare her with other wealthy people and does she outshine the majority still with her personal attractions carling was instigated by the praise he had bestowed on his wife to separate himself from a female pretender so ludicrous he sought fenellans nearest ear emitting the sound of hum in other respects unimpeachable oh quite there was a fishfag of classic billingsgate who had broken her husbands nose with a sledgehammer fist and swore before the magistrate that the man hadnt a crease to complain of in her character we are condemned mr carling sometimes to suffer in the flesh for the assurance we receive of the inviolability of those moral fortifications character yes valuablei do wish you had named tonight for doing me the honour of dining with me said the lawyer impulsively in a rapture of the appetite for anecdotes i have a ripe pichon longueville a fine wine seductive to hear of i dine with my friend victor radnor and he knows winethere are good women in the world mr carling whose characters of courseof course there are and i could name you some we lawyers you encounter all sorts between ourselves carling sank his tones to the indiscriminate where it mingled with the roar of london you do fenellan hazarded a guess at having heard enlightened liberal opinions regarding the sex right many i back you mr carling the lawyer pushed to yet more confidential communication up to the verge of the clearly audible he spoke of examples experiences fenellan backed him further acting on behalf of clients you understand mr fenellan professional but charitable i am with you poor things weif we have to condemnwe owe them something a kind word for poor polly venus with all the world against her she doesnt hear it often a real service carlings voice deepened to the legal without prejudicei am bound to say ita service to society ah poor wench and the kind of reward she gets we can hardly examine mysterious dispensations here we are to make the best we can of it for the creature societys indebted to true and am i to think theres a body of legal gentlemen to join with you my friend in founding an institution to distribute funds to preach charity over the country and win compassion for her as one of the principal persons of her time that societys indebted to for whatever its indebted for scarcely that said carling contracting but you re for great reforms gradual then its for reformatories mayhap they would hardly be a cure you re in search of a cure it would be a blessed discovery but whats to become of society its a puzzle to the cleverest all through history my dear mr carling we see that establishments must have their sacrifices beware of interfering eh by degrees we may hope society prudently shuns the topic and so ll we for we might tell of one another in a fit of distraction that t other one talked of it and we should be banished for an offence against propriety you should read my friend durances essay on society lawyers are a buttress of society but come i wager they dont know what they support until they read that essay carling had a pleasant sense of escape in not being personally asked to read the essay and not hearing that a copy of it should be forwarded to him he said mr radnor is a very old friend our fathers were friends they served in the same regiment for years i was in india when victor radnor took the fatal followed by a second not less in the interpretation of a rigid morality arming you legal gentlemen to make it so the law must be vindicated the law is a clumsy bludgeon we think it the highest effort of human reasonthe practical instrument you may compare it to a rustics finger on a fiddlestring for the murdered notes you get out of the practical instrument i am bound to defend it clumsy bludgeon or not you are one of the giants to wield it and feel humanly when by chance down it comes on the foot an inch off the lineheres a peep of old london if the habit of old was not to wash windows i like these old streets hum carling hesitated i can remember when the dirt at the windows was appalling appealing to the same kind of stuff in the passing youngsters green scum eye it was and there your law did good workyoure for bordeaux what is your word on burgundy our falernian victor radnor has the oldest in the kingdom but he will have the best of everything a romanee a musigny sip my friend you embrace the goddess of your choice above you are up beside her at a sniff of that wineand lo venerable drury we duck through the court reminded a bit by our feelings of our first love who hadnt the cleanest of faces or nicest of manners but she takes her station in memory because we were boys then and the golden halo of youth is upon her carling as a man of the world acquiesced in souvenirs he did not share he said urgently understand me you speak of mr radnor pray believe i have the greatest respect for mr radnors abilities he is one of our foremost men proud of him mr radnor has genius i have watched him it is genius he shows it in all he does one of the memorable men of our times i can admire him independent ofwell misfortune of that kind a mistaken early step misfortune it is to be named between ourselveswe are men of the worldif one could see the way she occasionally as i have told you i have ventured suggestions as i have mentioned i have received an impression but still mr carling if the lady doesnt release him and will keep his name she might stop her cowardly persecutions can you trace them undisguised mrs burman radnor is devout i should not exactly say revengeful we have to discriminate i gather that her animus is in all honesty directed at thei quotestate of sin we are mixed you know the winegod in the blood of fenellan gave a leap but fifty thousand times more mixed she might any moment stop the state of sin as she calls it if it pleased her she might try our judges look suspiciously on long delayed actions and there are too women who regard the marriagetie as indissoluble she has had to combat that scruple believer in the renewing of the engagement overheadwell but put a byword to mother nature about the state of sin where do you imagine she would lay it youll say that nature and law never agreed they ought the latter deferring to the former moulding itself on her swelling proportions my dear dear sir the state of sin was the continuing to live in defiance of in contempt of in violation of in the total degradation of nature he was under no enforcement to take the oath at the altar he was a small boy tempted by a varnished widow with pounds of barley sugar in her pocketsand she already serving as a testvessel or mortar for awful combinations in druggery gilt widows are equal to decrees of fate to us young ones upon my word the cleric who unites and the law that sanctions theyre the criminals victor radnor is the noblest of fellows the very best friend a man can have i will tell you he saved me after i left the army from living on the produce of my penwhich means if there is to be any produce the prostrating of yourself to the level of the round middle of the public saved me from that yes mr carling i have trotted our thoroughfares a poor polly of the pen and it is owing to victor radnor that i can order my thoughts as an individual man again before i blacken paper owing to him i have a tenderness for mercenaries having been one of them and knowing how little we can help it he is an olympianwho thinks of them below the lady also is an admirable woman at all points the pair are a mated couple such as you wont find in ten households over christendom are you aware of the story carling replied a story under shadow of the law has generally two very distinct versions hear mineand by jove a runaway cab no all right but a crazy cab it is and fit to do mischief in narrow drury except that its sheer riffraff here to knock over hulloacome quoth the wary lawyer theres the heart i wanted to rouse to hear me one may be sure that the man for old burgundy has it big and sound in spite of his legal practices a dear good spherical fellow some day well hope you will be sitting with us over a magnum of victor radnors romance conti aged thirtyone a wine youll say at the second glass high priest for the celebration of the uncommon nuptials between the body and the soul of man you hit me rightlysaid carting tickled and touched sensually excited by the bouquet of victor radnors hospitality and companionship which added flavour to fenellans compliments these came home to him through his desire to be the good spherical fellow for he like modern diplomatists in the track of their eminent berlinese new type of the time put on frankness as an armour over wariness holding craft in reserve his aim was at the refreshment of honest fellowship by no means to discover that the coupling of his native bias with his professional duty was unprofitable nowadays wariness however was not somnolent even when he said you know i am never the lawyer out of my office man of the world to men of the world and i have not lost by it i am mrs barman radnors legal adviser you are mr victor radnors friend they are as we see them not on the best of terms i would ratherat its lowest as a matter of businessbe known for having helped them to some kind of footing than send in a round bill to my clientor another i gain more in the end frankly i mean to prove that its a lawyers interest to be human because now see said fenellan heres the case miss natalia dreighton of a good yorkshire familya large one reads an advertisement for the post of companion to a lady and answers it and engages herself previous to the appearance of the young husband miss dreighton is one of the finest young women alive she has a glorious contralto voice victor and she are encouraged by mrs barman to sing duets together well why euclid would have theoremd it out for you at a glance at the trio you have only to look on them you chatter out your three acts of a drama without a stop if mrs barman cares to practise charity she has only to hold in her furyforked tongue or her jarniman i think s the name carting shrugged let her keep from striking if shes christian pursued fenetlan and if kind let her resume the name of her first lord who did a better thing for himself than for her when he shook off his bars of bullion to rise the lighter and left a wretched female soul below with the devils own testimony to her attractionsthousands in the funds houses in the city she threw the young couple together and my friend victor radnor is of a particularly inflammable nature imagine one of us in such a situation mr carting trying said the lawyer the dear fellow was as nigh death as a man can be and know the sweetness of a womans call to him to live and heres londons garden of pines bananas oranges all the droppings of the hesperides here we dont reflect on it mr carling not enough not enough i feel such a spout of platitudes that i could out with a leading article on a sheet of paper on your back while youre bending over the baskets i seem to have got circularly round again to eden when i enter a garden only here we have to pay for the fruits we pluck well and just the same there and no end to the payment either were always paying by the way mrs victor radnors dinnertables a spectacle her taste in flowers equals her lords in wine but age improves the wine and spoils the flowers youll say maybe youre for arguing that lovely women show us more of the flower than the grape in relation to the course of time i pray you not to forget the terrible intoxicant she is we reconcile it mr carling with the notion that the grapes her spirit the flower her body or is it the reverse perhaps an intertwining but look upon bouquets and clusters and the idea of woman springs up at once proving shes composed of them i was about to remark that with deference to the influence of mrs burmans legal adviser an impenitent or penitent sinners pastor the reverend gentleman ministering to her spiritual needs would presumptively exercise it in this instance in a superior degree carling murmured the rev groseman buttermore and did so for something of a cover to continue a run of internal reflections as that he was assuredly listening to vinous talk in the streets by day which impression placed him on a decorous platform above the amusing gentleman to whom however he grew cordial in recognizing consequently that his exuberant flow could hardly be a mask and that an indication here and there of a trap in his talk must have been due rather to excess of wariness habitual in the mind of a longheaded man whose incorrigibly impulsive fits had necessarily to be rectified by a vigilant dexterity buttermore ejaculated fenellan groseman buttermore mrs victors father confessor is the rev septimus barmby groseman buttermore septimus barmby is there anything in names truly unless these clerical gentlemen take them up at the crossing of the roads long after birth the names would appear the active parts of them and themselves mere marching supports like the bearers of street placard advertisements now i know a septimus barmby and you a groseman buttermore and beyond the fact that reverend starts up before their names without mention i wager its about all we do know of them theyre societys trusty rocklimpets no doubt my respect for the cloth is extreme carlings short cough prepared the way for deductions between ourselves they are men of the world fenellan eyed benevolently the worthy attorney whose innermost imp burst out periodically like a dutch clocksentry to trot on his own small grounds for thinking himself of the community of the man of the world you lawyers dress in another closet he said the rev groseman has the ear of the lady he hasone ear ah she has the other open for a man of the world perhaps listens to him listens to me listens to jarniman and we neither of us guide her shes very curiousa study you think you know hernext day she has eluded you shes emotional shes hard shes a woman shes a stone anything you like but dont count on her and another thingim bound to say it of myself carling claimed close hearing of fenellan over a shelf of saladstuff no one who comes near her has any real weight with her in this matter probably you mix cream in your salad of the vinegar and oil said fenellan try jelly of muttonyou give me a new idea latterly fond as i am of salads ive had rueful qualms well try it you should dine with victor radnor french cook of course cordon bleu i like to be sure of my cutlet i like to be sure of a tastiness in my vegetables and good sauces and pretty pastry i said cordon bleu the miracle is it s a woman that victor radnor has trained french but a woman devoted to him as all who serve him are do i say but a woman theres not a frenchman alive to match her vatel awaits her in paradise with his arms extended and may he wait long carling indulged his passion for the genuine by letting a flutter of real envy be seen my wife would like to meet such a frenchwoman it must be a privilege to dine with himto know him i know what he has done for english commerce and to build a colossal fortune genius as i said and his donations to institutions odd to read his name and mrs burman radnors at separate places in the lists well well hope its a case for a compromise of sentiments and claims a friend of mine spiced with cynic declares that theres always an amicable way out of a dissension if we get rid of lupus and vulpus carling spied for a trap in the citation of lupus and vulpus he saw none and named the square of his residence on the great russell property and the number of the house the hour of dinner next day he then hung silent breaking the pause with his hand out and a sharp well that rattled a whirligig sound in his head upward his leave of people was taken in this laughing falsetto as of one affected by the curious end things come to fenellan thought of him for a moment or two that he was a better than the common kind of lawyer who doubtless knew as much of the wrong side of the world as lawyers do and held his knowledge for the being a man of the worldas all do that have not alpine heights in the mind to mount for a look out over their own and the worlds pedestrian tracks i could spot the lawyer in your composition my friend to the exclusion of the man he mused but youre right in what you mean to say of yourself youre a good fellow for a lawyer and together we may manage somehow to score a point of service to victor radnor chapter viii some familiar guests nesta read her mothers face when mrs victor entered the drawingroom to receive the guests she saw a smooth fair surface of the kind as much required by her fathers eyes as innocuous air by his nostrils and it was honest skin not the deceptive feminine veiling to make a dear man happy over his volcano mrs victor was to meet the friends with whom her feelings were at home among whom her musical gifts gave her station they liked her for herself they helped her to feel at home with herself and be herself a rarer condition with us all than is generally supposed so she could determine to be cheerful in the anticipation of an evening that would at least be restful to the outworn sentinel nerve of her heart which was perpetually alert and signalling to the great organ often colouring the shows and seems of adverse things for an apeing of reality with too cruel a resemblance one of the scraps of practical wisdom gained by hardened sufferers is to keep from spying at horizons when they drop into a pleasant dingle such is the comfort of it that we can dream and lull our fears and half think what we wish and it is a heavenly truce with the fretful mind divided from our wishes nesta wondered at her mothers complacent questions concerning this lakelands the house the county the kind of people about the features of the country physically unable herself to be regretful under a burden three parts enrapturing her the girl expected her mother to display a shadowy vexation with a proud word or two that would summon her thrilling sympathy in regard to the fourth part namely the aristocratic iciness of country magnates who took them up and cast them off as they had done she thought at craye farm and at creckholt she remembered it of the latter place wincingly insurgently having loved the dear home she had been expelled from by her pride of the frosty surrounding people or no not all but some of them and what had roused their pride striking for a reason her inexperience of our modern england supplemented by readings in the england of a preceding generation had hit on her fathers profession of merchant it accounted to her for the behaviour of the haughty territorial and titled families but certain of the minor titles headed city firms she had heard certain of the families were avowedly commercial they follow suit her father said at creckholt after he had found her mother weeping and decided instantly to quit and fly once more but if they followed suit in such a way then mr durance must be right when he called the social english the most sheepy of sheepand nesta could not consent to the cruel verdict she adored her compatriots incongruities were pacified for her by the suggestion of her quick wits that her father besides being a merchant was a successful speculator and perhaps the speculator is not liked by merchants or they were jealous of him or they did not like his being both she pardoned them with some tenderness on a suspicion that a quaint old highfrilled bleached and puckered puritanical rectitude her thoughts rose in pictures possibly condemned the speculator as a description of gambler an erratic severity in ethics is easily overlooked by the enthusiast for things old english she was consciously ahead of them in the knowledge that her father had been without the taint of gambling a beneficent speculator the montgomery colony in south africa and his dealings with the natives in india and his railways in south america his establishment of insurance offices which were savings banks and the stores for the dispensing of sound goods to the poor attested it o and he was hospitable the kindest helpfullest of friends the dearest the very brightest of parents he was his girls playmate she could be critic of him for an induction to the loving of him more justly yet if he had an excessive desire to win the esteem of people as these keen young optics perceived in him he strove to deserve it and no one could accuse him of laying stress on the benefits he conferred designedly frigidly to wound a man so benevolent appeared to her as an incomprehensible baseness the dropping of acquaintanceship with him after the taste of its privileges she ascribed in the void of any better elucidation to a mania of aristocratic conceit it drove her despite her youthful contempt of politics into a radicalism that could find food in the epigrams of mr colney durance even when they passed her understanding or when he was not too distinctly seen by her to be shooting at all the parties of her beloved england beneath the wicked semblance of shielding each by turns the young gentleman introduced to the radnor concertparties by lady grace halley as the hon dudley sowerby had to bear the sins of his class though he was tall straightfeatured correct in costume appearance deportment second son of a religious earl and no scandal to the parentage he was less noticed by nesta than the elderly and the commoners her father accused her of snubbing him she reproduced her famous copy of the sugared acid of mr dudley sowerbys closed mouth a sort of sneer in meekness as of humility under legitimate compulsion deploring christianly a pride of race that stamped it for this cowled exhibition the wonderful mimicry was a flash thrown out by a born mistress of the art and her mother was constrained to laugh and so was her father but he wilfully denied the likeness he charged her with encouraging colney durance to drag forth the sprig of nobility in the nakedness of evicted shellfish on themes of the peril to england possibly ruin through the loss of that ruling initiative formerly possessed in the days of our glory by the titular nobles of the land colney spoke it effectively and the hon dudleys expressive lineaments showed print of the heaving word alas as when a target is penetrated centrally and he was not a particularly dull fellow for his class and country colney admitted adding i hit his thought and out he came one has reluctantly with victor radnor to grant that when a mans topmost unspoken thought is hit he must be sharp on his guard to keep from coming outwe have won a right to him only its too bad it s a breach of hospitality victor said both to nesta and to nataly alluding to several instances of colneys ironic handling of their guests especially of this one whom nesta would attack and nataly would not defend they were alive at a signal to protect the others miss priscilla graves an eater of meat was ridiculous in her antalcoholic exclusiveness and scorn mr pempton a drinker of wine would laud extravagantly the more transparent purity of vegetarianism dr peter yatt jeered at globules dr john cormyn mourned over human creatures treated as cattle by big doses the rev septimus barmby satisfactorily smoked mr peridon traced mortal evil to that act dr schlesien had his german views colney durance his ironic fenellan his fanciful and freelance and here was an optimist there a pessimist and the rank radical the rigid conservative were not wanting all of them were pointedly opposed extraordinarily for so small an assembly absurdly it might be thought but these provoked a kind warm smile with the exclamation they are dears they were the dearer for their fads and foibles music harmonized them music strangely put the spell on colney durance the sayer of bitter things manufacturer of prickly balls in the form of discords apples of whom fenellan remarked that he took to his music like an angry little boy to his barleysugar with a growl and a grunt all these diverse friends could meet and mix in victors concertroom with an easy homely recognition of one anothers musical qualities at times enthusiastic and their natural divergencies and occasional clashes added a salient tastiness to the group of whom nesta could say mama was there ever such a collection of dear good souls with such contrary minds her mother had the deepest of reasons for loving them so as not to wish to see the slightest change in their minds that the accustomed features making her nest of homeliness and real peace might be retained with the humour of their funny silly antagonisms and the subsequent march in concord excepting solely as regarded the perverseness of priscilla graves in her open contempt of mr pemptons innocent two or three wineglasses the vegetarian gentlemans politeness forbore to direct attention to the gobbets of meat priscilla consumed though he could express disapproval in general terms but he entertained sentiments as warlike to the ladys habit of drinking the blood of animals the mockery of it was that priscilla liked mr pempton and admired his violoncelloplaying and he was unreserved in eulogy of her person and her pure soprano tones nataly was a poetic matchmaker mr peridon was intended for mademoiselle de seilles nestas young french governess a lady of a courtly bearing with placid speculation in the eyes she cast on a foreign people and a voluble muteness shadowing at intervals along the line of her closed lips the one person among them a little out of tune with most was lady grace halley natalys provincial gentlewomans traditions of the manners indicating conduct reproved unwonted licences assumed by lady grace who in allusion to hymens weaving of a cousinship between the earldom of southweare and that of cantor of which mr sowerby sprang set her mouth and fan at work to delineate total distinctions as it were from the egg to the empyrean her stature was rather short all of it conversational at the eyebrows the shoulders the fingertips the twisting shape a ballerinas expressiveness and her tongue dashed half sentences through and among these hieroglyphs loosely and funnily candid anybody might hear that she had gone gambling into the city and that she had got herself into a mess and that by great good luck she had come across victor radnor who with two turns of the wrist had plucked her out of the mire the miraculous man and she had vowed to him never again to run doing the like without his approval the cause of her having done it was related with the accompaniments brows twitching flitting smiles shrugs pouts shifts of posture she was married to a centaur out of the saddle a man of wood an excellent man for the not colloquial do not commit themselves but one wants a little animation in a husband she called on bellmotion of the head to toll forth the utter nightcap negative he had not any out of the saddle he was asleepnext door to the last trump colney durance assisted her to describe the soundest of sleep in a husband after wooing her to unbosom herself she was awake to his guileful arts and sailed along with him hailing his phrases if he shot a good one prankishly exposing a flexible nature that took its holiday thus in a grinding world among maskers to the horrification of the prim so to refresh ourselves by having publicly a hipbath in the truth while we shock our hearers enough to be discredited for what we reveal was a dexterous merry twist amusing to her but it was less a cynical malice than her nature that she indulged a woman must have some excitement the most innocent appeared to her the stock exchange the opinions of husbands who are not summoned to pay are hardly important they vary colney helped her now and then to step the trifle beyond her stride but if he was humorous she forgave and if together they appalled the decorous it was great gain her supple person pretty lips the style she had gave a pass to the wondrous confidings which were for masculine ears whatever the sex nataly might share in them but women did not lead her to expansiveness or not the women of the contracted class miss graves mrs cormyn and others at the radnor concerts she had a special consideration for mademoiselle de seilles owing to her exquisite french as she said and she may have liked it but it was the young frenchwomans air of high breeding that won her esteem girls were spring frosts to her fronting nesta she put on her noted smile or woodcut of a smile with its label of indulgence except when the girl sang music she loved she said it was the saving of poor dudley it distinguished him in the group of the noble evangelical cantor family and it gave him a subject of assured discourse in company and oddly it contributed to his comelier air flute this would be the german blockeflute or our recorder dw in hand his mouth at the blowstop was relieved of its pained updraw by the form for puffing he preserved a gentlemanly high figure in his exercises on the instrument out of ken of all likeness to the urgent insistency of victor radnors punctuating trunk of the puffing frame at almost every baran apollo brilliancy in energetic pursuit of the nymph of sweet sound too methodical one too fiery the other in duets of hauptmanns with nesta at the piano the contrast of dull smoothness and overstressed significance was very noticeable beside the fervent accuracy of her balanced fingering and as she could also flute she could criticize though latterly the flute was boxed away from lips that had devoted themselves wholly to song song being one of the damsels present pressing ambitions she found nothing to correct in mr sowerby and her father was open to all the censures but her father could plead vitality passion he held his performances cheap after the vehement display he was a happy listener whether to the babble of his dear old corelli or to the majesty of the rattling heavens and swaying forests of beethoven his air of listening was a thing to see it had a look of disembodiment the sparkle conjured up from deeps and the life in the sparkle as of a soul at holiday eyes had been given this man to spy the pleasures and reveal the joy of his pasture on them gateways to the sunny within issues to all the outer edens few of us possess that double significance of the pure sparkle it captivated lady grace she said a word of it to fenellan there is a man who can feel rapture he had not to follow the line of her sight she said so on a previous evening in a similar tone and for a woman to repeat herself using the very emphasis was quaint she could feel rapture but her features and limbs were in motion to designate it between simply and wilfully she had the instinct to be dimpling and would not for a moment control it and delighted in its effectiveness only when observing that winged sparkle of eyes did an idea of envy hardly a consciousness inform her of being surpassed and it might be in the capacity to feel besides the gift to express such a reflection relating to a man will make women mortally sensible that they are the feminine of him his girl has the look fenellan said in answer she cast a glance at nesta then at nataly and it was true that the figure of a mother not pretending to the fathers vividness eclipsed it somewhat in their child the mother gave richness of tones hues and voice and stature likewise and the thick brown locks which in her own were threads of gold along the brush from the temples she gave the girl a certain degree of the composure of manner which victor could not have bestowed she gave nothing to clash with his genial temper she might be supposed to have given various qualities moral if you like but vividness was lady graces admirable meteor of the hour she was unable to perceive so as to compute the value of obscurer lights under the charm of natalys rich contralto during a duet with priscilla graves she gesticulated ecstasies and uttered them and genuinely and still when reduced to meditations they would have had no weight they would hardly have seemed an apology for language beside victors gaze of pleasure in the noble forthroll of the notes nataly heard the invitation of the guests of the evening to lakelands next day her anxieties were at once running about to gather provisions for the baskets she spoke of them at night but victor had already put the matter in the hands of madame callet and all that could be done would be done by armandine he knew if she cant muster enough at home shell be off to her piccadilly shop by seven am count on plenty for twice the number nataly was reposing on the thought that they were her friends when victor mentioned his having in the afternoon despatched a note to his relatives the duvidney ladies inviting them to join him at the station tomorrow for a visit of inspection to the house of his building on his new estate he startled her the duvidney ladies were to his knowledge of the order of the fragile minds which hold together by the cement of a common trepidation for the support of things established and have it not in them to be able to recognize the unsanctioned good women unworldly of the world they were perforce harder than the world from being narrower and more timorous but victor you were sure they would refuse he answered they may have gone back to tunbridge wells by the way they have a society down there i want for fredi sure do you say my dear perfectly sure but the accumulation of invitations and refusals in the end softens them you will see we shall and must have them for fredi she was used to the long reaches of his forecasts his burning activity on a project she found it idle to speak her thought that his ingenuity would have been needless in a position dictated by plain prudence and so much happier for them they talked of mrs burman until she had to lift a prayer to be saved from darker thoughts dreadfully prolific not to be faced part of her prayer was on behalf of mrs burman for life to be extended to her if the poor lady clung to lifeif it was really humane to wish it for her and heaven would know heaven had mercy on the afflicted nataly heard the snuffle of hypocrisy in her prayer she had to cease to pray chapter ix an inspection of lakelands one may not have an intention to flourish and may be pardoned for a semblance of it in exclaiming somewhat royally as creator and owner of the place there you see lakelands the conveyances from the railway station drew up on a rise of road fronting an undulation where our modern english architects fantasia in crimson brick swept from central gables to flying wings over pents crooks curves peaks cowled porches balconies recesses projections away to a red village of stables and dependent cottages harmonious in irregularity and coloured homely with the greensward about it the pines beside it the clouds above it not many palaces would be reckoned as larger the folds and swells and stream of the building along the roll of ground had an appearance of an enormous banner on the wind nataly looked her next look was at colney durance she sent the expected nods to victors carriage she would have given the whole prospect for the covering solitariness of her chamber a multitude of clashing sensations and a throatthickening hateful to her compelled her to summon so as to force herself to feel a groundless anger directed against none against nothing perfectly crazy but her only resource for keeping down the great wave surgent at her eyes victor was like a swimmer in morning sea amid the exclamations encircling him he led through the straight passage of the galleried hall offering two fair landscapes at front door and at back down to the lake fredis lake a good oblong of water notable in a district not abounding in the commodity he would have it a feature of the district and it had been deepened and extended up rose the springs many ran the ducts fredis pretty little bathshed or bower had a space of marble on the threefeet shallow it overhung with a shade of carved woodwork it had a diving board for an eightfeet plunge a punt and small rowboat of elegant build hard by green ran the banks about and a beechwood fringed with birches curtained the northward length morning sun and evening had a fair face of water to paint saw man ever the like for pleasing a poetical damsel so was miss fredi the coldest of the party hitherto and dreaming a preference of old places like creckholt and craye farm captured to be enraptured quite according to mans ideal of his beneficence to the sex she pressed the hand of her young french governess louise de seilles as in everything he did for his girl victor pointed boastfully to his forethought of her convenience and her tastes the pinepanels of the interior the shelves for her books pegs to hang her favourite drawings and the couchbunk under a window to conceal the summerly recliner while throwing full light on her book and the hearthsquare for logs when she wanted fire because fredi bathed in any weather the oaken towelcoffer the woodcarvings of doves tits fishes the rod for the flowered silken hangings she was to choose and have shy odalisque peeps of sunny water from her couch fredis naiad retreat when she wishes to escape herr strauscher or signor ruderi said victor having his grateful girl warm in an arm and if they head after her into the water i back her to leave them puffing shes a dolphin that water has three springs and gets all the drainage of the upland round us i chose the place chiefly on account of it and the pines i do love pines but excellent man what do you not love said lady grace with the timely hit upon the obvious which rings it saves him from accumulation of tissue said colney what does was eagerly asked by the wife of the homoeopathic dr john cormyn a sentimental lady beset with fears of stoutness victor cried tush dont listen to colney pray but she heard colney speak of a positive remedy more immediately effective than an abjuration of potatoes and sugar she was obliged by her malady to listen although detesting the irreverent ruthless man who could direct expanding frames in a serious tone to love love everybody everything violently and universally love and so without intermission pay out the fat created by a rapid assimilation of nutriment obeseness is the most sensitive of our ailments probably as being aware that its legitimate appeal to pathos is ever smothered in its puddingbed of the grotesque she was pained and showed it and was ashamed of herself for showing it and that very nearly fetched the tear our host is an instance in proof colney said he waved hand at the house his meaning was hidden evidently he wanted victims sight of lakelands had gripped him with the fell satiric itch and it is a passion to sting and tear on rational grounds his face meanwhile which had points of the handsome signified a smile asleep as if beneath a cloth only those who knew him well were aware of the clawlike alertness under the droop of eyelids admiration was the common note in the various keys the station selected for the southeastward aspect of the darkred gabled pile on its white shellterrace backed by a plantation of tall pines a mounded and fullplumed company above the left wing was admired in files and in volleys marvellous effectively miraculous was the tale of the vow to have the great edifice finished within one year and the strike of workmen and the friendly colloquy with them the good reasoning the unanimous return to duty and the doubling the trebling of the number of them and the most glorious of sightsthe grand old english working with a will as englishmen do when they come at last to heat and they conquer there is then nothing that they cannot conquer so the conqueror saidand admirable were the conservatories running three long lines one from the drawingroom to a central dome for tropical growths and the parterres were admired also the newlyplanted irish junipers bounding the westwalk and the three tiers of stately descent from the three green terrace banks to the grassy slopes over the lake again the lake was admired the house admired admiration was evoked for great orchidhouses over yonder soon to be set up off we go to the kitchengarden there the admiration is genial practical we admire the extent of the beds marked out for asparagus and the french disposition of the planting at wide intervals and the french system of training peach pear and plum trees on the walls to win length and catch sun we much admire we admire the gardener we are induced temporarily to admire the french people they are sagacious in fruitgardens they have not the english constitution you think rightly but in fruitgardens they grow for fruit and not as victor quotes a friend for wood which the valiant english achieve we hear and we see examples of sagacity and we are further brought round to the old confession that we cannot cook colney durance has us there we have not studied herbs and savours and so we are shocked backward step by step until we retreat precipitately into the nooks where waxen tapers carefully tended by writers on the press lightup mysterious images of our national selves for admiration something surely we do or we should not be where we are but what is it we do excepting cricket of course which others cannot do colney asks and he excludes cricket and football an acutely satiric man in an english circle that does not resort to the fist for a reply to him may almost satiate the excessive fury roused in his mind by an illogical people of a provocative prosperity mainly tongueless or of leaden tongue above the pressure of their necessities as he takes them to be they give him so many opportunities they are angry and helpless as the log hissing to the saw their instinct to make use of the downright in retort restrained as it is by a buttoned coat of civilization is amusing inviting colney durance allured them to the quags edge and plunged them in it to writhe patriotically and although it may be said that they felt their situation less than did he the venom they sprang in his blood he was cruel he caused discomfort but these good friends about him stood for the country an illogical country and as he could not well attack his host victor radnor an irrational man he selected the abstract entity for the discharge of his honest spite the irrational friend was deeper at the source of his irritation than the illogical old motherland this house of lakelands the senselessness of his friend in building it and designing to live in it after experiences of an incapacity to stand in a serene contention with the world he challenged excited colneys wasp he was punished half way to frenzy behind his placable demeanour by having dr schlesien for chorus and here again it was the unbefitting not the person which stirred his wrath a german on english soil should remember the dues of a guest at the same time colney said things to snare the acclamation of an observant gentleman of that race who is no longer in his first enthusiasm for english beef and the complexion of the women ah ya it is true what you say the english grow as fast as odders but they grow to corns instead of brains they are bull quaat true he bellowed on a laugh the last half of the quotation colney marked him his encounters with fenellan were enlivening engagements and left no malice only a regret when the fencing passed his guard that fenellan should prefer to flash for the minute he would have met a pert defender of england in the person of miss priscilla graves if she had not been occupied with observation of the bearing of lady grace halley toward mr victor radnor which displeased her on behalf of mrs victor she was besides hostile by race and class to an aristocratic assumption of licence sparing colney she with some scorn condemned mr pempton for allowing his country to be ridiculed without a word mr pempton believed that the vegetarian movement was more progressive in england than in other lands but he was at the disadvantage with the fair priscilla that eulogy of his compatriots on this account would win her coldest approval satire was never an argument he said too evasively the rev septimus barmby received the meed of her smile for saying in his manyfathom bass with an eye on victor at least we may boast of breeding men who are leaders of men the announcement of luncheon by victors butler arlington opportunely followed and freighted the remark with a happy recognition of that which comes to us from the hands of conquerors dr schlesien himself no antagonist to england but like colney durance a critic speculated in view of the spread of picnic provision beneath the great glass dome as to whether it might be that these english were on another start out of the dust in vigorous commercial enterprise under leadership of one of their chance masterly mindsmerchant in this instance and be debated within whether genius occasionally developed in a surprising superior manner by these haphazard english may not sometimes wrest the prize from method albeit we count for the long run that method has assurance of success however late in the race to set forth luncheon was a merry meal with victor and nataly for host and hostess fenellan colney durance and lady grace halley for the talkers a gusty bosom of sleet overhung the dome rattled on it and rolling westward became a radiant mountainland partly worthy of victors phrase a range of swiss alps in air with periwigs louis quatorze for peaks colney added and fenellan improved on him or a magnified bench of judges at the trial of your caerulean phryne the strip of white cloud flew on a whirl from the blue to confirm it but victor and lady grace rejected any play of conceits upon nature violent and horrid interventions of the counterfeit such mad similes appeared to them when pure coin was offered they loathed the rev septimus barmby for proclaiming that he had seen chapters of hebrew history in the grouping of clouds his gaze was any one of the chapters upon nesta the clerical gentlemans voice was of a depth to claim for it the profoundest which can be thought or uttered and nestas tender youth had taken so strong an impression of sacredness from what fenellan called his chafer tones that her looks were often given him in gratitude for the mere sound nataly also had her sense of safety in acquiescing to such a voice coming from such a garb consequently whenever fenellan and colney were at him drawing him this way and that for utterances cathedral in sentiment and sonorousness these ladies shed protecting beams insomuch that he was inspired to the agreeable conceptions whereof frequently rash projects are an issue touching the neighbours of lakelands they were principally enriched merchants it appeared a snippet or two of the fringe of aristocracy lay here and there among them and one racyofthesoil old son of thames having the manners proper to last centurys yeoman mr pempton knew something of this quaint squire of hefferstone beaves urmsing by name a ruddy man right heartily saxon a still glowing brand amid the ashes of the heptarchy hearthstone who had a song the marigolds which he would troll out for you anywhere on any occasion to have so near to the metropolis one from the centre of the venerable rotundity of the country was rare victor exclaimed come in ravishment over the picturesqueness of a neighbour carrying imagination away to the founts of england and his look at nataly proposed her countenance was inapprehensive he perceived resistance and said i have met two or three of them in the train agreeable men gladding the banker a general fanning that man blathenoy great billbroker but the fact is close on london were independent of neighbours we mean to be lakelands and london practically join the mother city becoming the suburb murmured colney in report of the union you must expect to be invaded sir said mr sowerby and victor shrugged we are pretty safe the lock of a door seems a potent security until some one outside is heard fingering the handle nigh midnight fenellan threw out his airy nothing of a remark it struck on natalys heart so you will not let us be lonely here she said to her guests the rev septimus barmby was mouthpiece for congregations sound of a subterranean roar with a blast at the orifice informed her of their very deep happiness in the privilege he comforted her nesta smiled on him thankfully dont imagine mrs victor that you can be shut off from neighbours in a house like this and they have a claim said lady grace quitting the table fenellan and colney thought so like mice at a cupboard beetles in a kitchen no nono no victor shook head pitiful over the good people likened to things unclean and royally upraising them in doing which he scattered to vapour the leaden incubi they had been upon his flatter moods of late no but its a rapture to breathe the air here his lifted chest and nostrils were for the encouragement of nataly to soar beside him she summoned her smile and nodded he spoke aside to lady grace the dear soul wants time to compose herself after a grand surprise she replied i think i could soon be reconciled how much land in treaty for some hundred and eighty or ninety acres in all at present three hundred and seventy including plantations lake outhouses large enough land paying as it doesthat is not paying we shall be having to gamble in the city systematically for subsistence you will not so much as jest on the subject coming from such a man that was clear sky thunder the lady played it off in a shadowy pout and shrug while taking a stamp of his masterfulness not so volatile she said to nataly our place in worcestershire is about half the size if as much large enough when were not crowded out with gout and can open to no one some day you will visit us i hope you we count on here lady grace it was an overaccentuated response unusual with this wellbred woman and a bit of speech that does not flow causes us to speculate the lady resumed i value the favour were in a horseydoggyfoxy circle down there we want enlivening if we had your set of musicians and talkers nataly smiled in vacuous kindness at a loss for the retort of a compliment to a person she measured lady grace also was an amiable hostile reviewer each could see to have cited in the other defects common to the lower species of the race admitting a superior personal quality or two which might be pleaded in extenuation and if the apology proved too effective could be dispersed by insistence upon it under an implied appeal to benevolence when we have not a liking for the creature whom we have no plain cause to dislike we are minutely just during the admiratory stroll along the groundfloor rooms colney durance found himself beside dr schlesien the latter smoking striding emphasizing but bearable as the one of the party who was not perpetually at the gape in laudation colney was heard to say no doubt the german is the race the least mixed in europe it might challenge aboriginals for that oddly it has invented the cyclopaedia for knowledge the sausage for nutrition how would you explain it dr schlesien replied with an atlas shrug under fleabite to the insensately infantile interrogation he in turn was presently heard but my good sir you quote me your english latin i must beg of you you write it down it is orally incomprehensible to continentals we are islanders colney shrugged in languishment oh you do great things dr schlesien rejoined in kindness making his voice a musical intimation of the smallness of the things we build great houses to employ our bricks no colney to live in said victor scarcely long enough to warm them what do you fiddle they are not hohenzollerns it is true dr schlesien called no but you learn discipline you build i say wid you not hohenzollerns you build but you shall look above eyes up ire necesse est good but mount you come to something have ideas good but when do we reach your level sir i do not say more than that we do not want instruction from foreigners pupil to paedagogue indeed you have the wreath in music in jurisprudence chemistry scholarship beer arms manners dr schlesien puffed a tempest of tobacco and strode he is chiselling for wit in the teutonic block colney said falling back to fenellan fenellan observed you might have credited him with the finished sculpture theyre ahead of us in sticking at the charge of wit theyve a widening of their swallow since versailles manners well thats a tight cravat for the teutonic thrapple but hes off by himself to loosen it victor came on the couple testily what are you two concocting i say do keep the peace please an excellent good fellow better up in politics than any man i know understands music means well you can see you two hate a man at all serious and he doesnt bore with his knowledge a scholar too if hell bring us the atmosphere of the groves of academe he may swing his ferule pickled in himself and welcome said fenellan yes victor nodded at a recognized antagonism in fenellan but colneys always lifting the germans high above us its to exercise his muscles victor headed to the other apartments thinking that the rev septimus and young sowerby old england herself were spared by the diversion of these light skirmishing shots from their accustomed victims to the masculine people of our time his friends would want a drilling to be of aid to him in his campaign to come for it was one and a great one he remembered his complete perception of the plan all the elements of it the forward whirling of it just before the fall on london bridge the greatness of his enterprise laid such hold of him that the smallest of obstacles had a villanous aspect and when as anticipated colney and fenellan were sultry flies for whomsoever they could fret he was blind to the reading of absurdities which caused fredis eyes to stream and lady grace beside him to stand awhile and laugh out her fit young sowerby appeared forgiving enoughhe was a perfect gentleman but fredis appalling sense of fun must try him hard and those young fellows are often more wounded by a girls thoughtless laughter than by a mans contempt nataly should have protected him her face had the air of a smiling general satisfaction sign of a pleasure below the mark required sign too of a sleepy partner for a battle even in the wonderful kitchen arched and pillared where the explanation came to nesta of madame callets frequent leave of absence of late when an inferior dinner troubled her father in no degree even there his nataly listened to the transports of the guests with benign indulgence mama said nesta ready to be entranced by kitchens in her bubbling animation she meant the recalling of instances of the conspirator her father had been you none of you guessed armandines business victor cried in a glee that pushed to make the utmost of this matter and count against chagrin she was off to paris went to test the last inventionsfrench brains are always alertand in fact those kitchenranges gas and coal and the apparatus for warming plates and dishes the whole of the battery is on the model of the duc darianesfinest in europe well he agreed with colney to say france is enough mr pempton spoke to miss graves of the task for a woman to conduct a command so extensive and as when an inoffensive wayfarer has chanced to set foot near a wasps nest out on him came woman and her champions the worthy and the sham like a blast of powder victor ejaculated armandine whoever doubted her capacity knew not armandine or not knowing armandine knew not the capacity in women with that utterance of her name he saw the orangey spot on london bridge and the sinking tower and masts and funnels and the rising of them on his return to his legs he recollected that at the very edge of the fall he had armandine strongly in his mind she was to do her part fenellan and colney on the surface she below and hospitality was to do its part and music was impressedthe innocent concerts his wealth all his inventiveness were to serveand merely to attract and win the tastes of people for a social support to lakelands merely that much moreif natalys coldness to the place would but allow him to form an estimate of how much at the same time being in the grasp of his present disappointment he perceived a meanness in the result that was astonishing and afflicting he had not ever previously felt imagination starving at the vision of success victor had yet to learn that the man with a material object in aim is the man of his object and the nearer to his mark often the farther is he from a sober self he is more the arrow of his bow than bow to his arrow this we pay for scheming and success is costly we find we have pledged the better half of ourselves to clutch it not to be redeemed with the whole handful of our prize he was however learning after his leaping fashion natalys defective sympathy made him look at things through the feelings she depressed a shadow of his missed idea on london bridge seemed to cross him from the close flapping of a wing within reach he could say only that it would if caught have been an answer to the thought disturbing him nataly drew colney durance with her eyes to step beside her on the descent to the terrace little skepsey hove in sight coming swift as the point of an outrigger over the flood chapter x skepsey in motion the bearer of his masters midday letters from london shot beyond nataly as soon as seen with an apparent snap of his body in passing he steamed to the end of the terrace and delivered the packet returning at the same rate of speed to do proper homage to the lady he so much respected he had left the railwaystation on foot instead of taking a fly because of a calculation that he would save three minutes which he had not lost for having to come through the raincloud perhaps the contrary skepsey said it might be judged to have accelerated his course and his hat dripped and his coat shone and he soaped his hands cheerful as an ouzelcock when the sun is out again many cracked crowns lately in the manly art colney inquired of him and skepsey answered with precision of statement crowns no sir the nose it may happen but it cannot be said to be the rule you are of opinion that the practice of scientific pugilism offers us compensation for the broken bridge of a nose in an increase of manly selfesteem i do sir yes skepsey was shy of this gentlemans bite and he fancied his defence had been correct perceiving a crumple of the lips of mr durance he took the attitude of a watchful dubiety but my goodness you are wet through cried nataly reproaching herself for the tardy compassion and nesta ran up to them and heaped a thousand pities on her poor dear skip and drove him in beneath the glassdome to the fragments of picnic and poured champagne for him lest his wife should have to doctor him for a cold and poured afresh when he had obeyed her for the toasting of lakelands dear skepsey impossible to resist so he drank and blinked and was then told that before using his knife and fork he must betake himself to some fire of shavings and chips where coffee was being made for the purpose of drying his clothes but this he would not hear of he was pledged to business to convey his masters letters and he might have to catch a train by the last quarterminute unless it was behind the timetables he must hold himself ready to start entreated adjured commanded skepsey commiseratingly observed to colney durance the ladies do not understand sir for turk of constantinople had never a more haremed opinion of the unfitness of women in the brave world of action the persistence of these ladies endeavouring to obstruct him in the course of his duty must have succeeded save that for one word of theirs he had two and twice the promptitude of motion he explained to them as to good children that the loss of five minutes might be the loss of a post the loss of thousands of pounds the loss of the character of a firm and he was away to the terrace nesta headed him and waved him back she and her mother rebuked him they called him unreasonable wherein they resembled the chief example of the sex to him in a wife he had at home who levelled that charge against her husband when most she needed discipline the woman laid hand on the very word legitimately his own for the justification of his process with her but skips if you are ill and we have to nurse you said nesta she forgot the hospital he told her cordially and laughed at the notion of a ducking producing a cold or a cold a fever or anything consumption with him so the ladies had to keep down their anxious minds and allow him to stand in wet clothing to eat his cold pie and salad miss priscilla graves entering to them became a witness that they were seductresses for inducing him to drink wineand a sparkling wine it is to warm him they pleaded and she said he must be warm from his walk and they said but he is wet and said she without a show of feeling warm water then and skepsey writhed as if in the grasp of anatomists at being the subject of female contention or humane consideration miss graves caught signs of the possible proselyte in him she remarked encouragingly i am sure he does not like it he still has a natural taste she distressed his native politeness for the glass was in his hand and he was fully aware of her highprincipled aversion and he profoundly bowed to principles believing his england to be pillared on them and the lady looked like one who bore the standard of a principle and if we slap and pinch and starve our appetites the idea of a principle seems entering us to support subscribing to a principle our energies are refreshed we have a faith in the country that was not with us before the act and of a real wellfounded faith come the glowing thoughts which we have at times thoughts of england heading the nations when the smell of an english lane under showers challenges eden and the threading of a london crowd tunes discords to the swell of a cathedral organ it may be that by the renunciation of any description of alcohol a man will stand clearerheaded to serve his country he may expect to have a clearer memory for certain he will not be asking himself unable to decide whether his master named a mr journeyman or a mr jarniman as the person he declined to receive either of the two is repulsed upon his application owing to the guilty similarity of sounds but what we are to think of is our own sad state of inefficiency in failing to remember which accuses our physical condition therefore our habitsthus the little man debated scarcely requiring more than to hear the right word to be a convert and make him a garland of the proselytes fetters destructively for the cause she advocated miss priscilla gestured the putting forth of an abjuring hand with the recommendation to him so to put aside temptation that instant and she signified in a very ugly jerk of her features the vilely filthy stuff morality thought it however pleasing it might be to a palate corrupted by indulgence of the sensual appetites but the glass had been handed to him by the lady he respected who looked angelical in offering it divinely other than ugly and to her he could not be discourteous not even to pay his homage to the representative of a principle he bowed to miss graves and drank and rushed forth hearing shouts behind him his master had a packet of papers ready easy for the pocket by the way skepsey he said if a man named jarniman should call at the office i will see him skepseys grey eyes came out or was it journeyman that his master would not see and jarniman that he would his habit of obedience pride of apprehension and the time to catch the train forbade inquiry besides he knew of himself of old that his puzzles were best unriddled running the quick of pace are soon in the quick of thoughts jarniman then was a man whom his master not wanting to see one day and wanting to see on another day might wish to conciliate a case of policy let jarniman go journeyman on the other hand was nobody at all a ghost of the fancy yet this journeyman was as important an individual he was a dread reality more important to skepsey in the light of patriot and only in that light was he permitted of a scrupulous conscience and modest mind to think upon himself when the immediate subject was his masters interests for this journeyman had not an excuse for existence in mr radnors pronunciation he was born of the buzz of a troubled ear coming of a disordered brain consequent necessarily upon a disorderly stomach that might protest a degree of comparative innocence but would be shamed utterly under inspection of the eye of a lady of principle what then was the value to his country of a servant who could not accurately recollect his masters words miss graves within him asked the rapid little man whether indeed his ideas were his own after draughts of champagne the ideas excited to an urgent animation by his racing trot were a quiverful in flight over an england terrible to the foe and dancing on the green right so but would we keep up the dance we must be red iron to touch and the fighter for conquering is the one who can last and has the open brainand there you have a point against alcohol yes and miss graves if she would press it with her natural face could be pleasant and persuasive and she ought to be told she ought to marry for the good of the country women taking liquor skepsey had a vision of his wife with rheumy peepers and miauly mouth as he had once beheld the creatureoh they need discipline not such would we have for the mothers of our english young decidedly the women of principle are bound to enter wedlock they should be bound by law whereas in the opposing casethe binding of the unprincipled to a celibate statesuch a law would have saved skepsey from the necessitated commission of deeds of discipline with one of the female sex and have rescued his progeny from a likeness to the cornstalk reverting to weed he had but a son for englands defence and the frame of his boy might be set quaking by a thump on the wind of a drum the courage of william barlow skepsey would not stand against a sheep it would windup hares to have a run at him out in the field offspring of a woman of principle but there is no rubbing out in life why dream of it only that one would not have ones country the loser dwell a moment on the reverseand first remember the lesson of the captivity of the jews and the outcry of their backsliding and repentancesee a nation of the honourably begotten muscular men disdaining the luxuries they will occasionally condescend to taste like some tribe in greece boxers rowers runners climbers braced indomitable magnanimous as only the strong can be an army at word winning at a stroke the double battle of the hand and the heart men who can walk the paths through the garden of the pleasures they receive fitting mates of a build to promise or aid in ensuring depth of chest and long reach of arm for their progeny down goes the world before them and we see how much would be due for this to a corps of ladies like miss graves not allowed to remain too long on the stalk of spinsterhood her age might count twentyeight too long she should be taught that men can though truly ordinary women cannot walk these orderly paths through the garden an admission to women hinting restrictions on a ticket marked in moderation meaning that they may pluck a flower or fruit along the pathway border to which they are confined speedily alas exhibits them at a mad scramble across the pleasurebeds they know not moderation neither for their own sakes nor for the sakes of posterity will they hold from excess when they are not pledged to shun it the reason is that their minds cannot conceive the abstract as men do but there are grounds for supposing that the example before them of a sex exercising selfcontrol in freedom would induce women to pledge themselves to a similar abnegation until they gain some sense of touch upon the impalpable duty to the generations coming after us thanks to the voluntary example we set them the stupendous task which had hitherto baffled skepsey in the course of conversational remonstrances with his wifethat of getting the idea of posterity into the understanding of its principal agent might then be mastered therefore clearly men have to begin the salutary movement it manifestly devolves upon them let them at once take to rigorous physical training women under compulsion as vessels men in their magnanimity patriotically voluntarily miss graves must have had an intimation for him he guessed it and it plunged him into a conflict with her that did not suffer him to escape without ruefully feeling the feebleness of his vocabulary and consequently he made a reluctant appeal to figures and it hung upon the bolder exhibition of lists and tables as to whether he was beaten and if beaten he was morally her captive and this being the case nothing could be more repulsive to skepsey seeing that he unable of his nature passively or partially to undertake a line of conduct beheld himself wearing a detestable ribbon for sign of an oath quite needlessly sworn simply to satisfy the lady overcoming him with nimbler tongue and blocking the streets marching in bands beneath banners howling hymns statistics upon which his master and friends after exchanging opinions in argument always fell back frightened him as long as they had no opponents of their own kind they swept the field they were intelligible as the word principle had become but the appearance of one body of statistics invariably brought up another and the strokes and counterstrokes were like a play of quarterstaff on the sconce to knock all comprehension out of skepsey otherwise he would not unwillingly have inquired tomorrow into the statistics of the controversy between the waters of the wells and of the casks prepared to walk over to the victorious however objectionable that proceeding he hoped to question his master some day except that his master would very naturally have a tendency to sumup in favour of winegood wine in moderation just as miss graves for the cup of teanot so thoughtfully stipulating that it should be good and not too copious statistics are according to their conjurors they are not independent bodies with native colours they needs must be painted by the different hands they pass through and they may be multiplied a nought or so counts for nothing with the teller skepsey saw that yet they can overcome even as fictitious battalions they can overcome he shrank from the results of a ciphering match having him for object and was ashamed of feeling to statistics as women to giants nevertheless he acknowledged that the badge was upon him if miss graves should beat her master in her array of figures to insist on his wearing it as she would she certainly would and against his internal conviction perhaps with the knowledge that the figures were an unfortified display and his oath of bondage an unmanly servility the silliest of ceremonies he was shockingly feminine to statistics mr durance despised them he called them arguing against mr radnor those emotional things not comprehensibly to skepsey but mr durance a very clever gentleman could not be right in everything he made strange remarks upon his country dr yatt attributed them to the state of his digestion and mr fenellan had said of mr durance that as a barrister wanting briefs the speech in him had been bottled too long and was an overripe wine dripping sour drops through the rotten cork mr fenellan said it laughing he meant no harm skepsey was sure he had the words he heard no more than other people hear he remembered whole sentences and many on one of his runs this active little machine quickened by motion to fire revived the audible of years back whatever suited his turn of mind at the moment rushed to the rapid wheels within him his masters business and friends his countrys welfare and advancement these with records items anticipations of the manlier sports to decorate were his current themes all being chopped and tossed and mixed in salad accordance by his fervour of velocity and if you would like a further definition of genius think of it as a form of swiftness it is the lively young greatgrandson in the brain of the travelling force which mathematicians put to paper in a row of astounding ciphers for the motion of earth through space to the generating of heat whereof is multiplication whereof deposited matter and so your chaos your half lighted labyrinth your ceaseless pressure to evolvement and then light and so creation order the work of genius what do you say without having a great brain the measure of it possessed by skepsey was alive under strong illumination in his heart while doing penance for his presumptuousness he believed that he could lead regiments of men he was not the armys general he was the generals lieutenant now and then venturing to suggest a piece of counsel to his chief on his own particular drilled regiments his chief may rely and on his knowledge of the country of the campaign roads morasses masking hills dividing rivers he had mapped for himself mentally the battles of conquerors in his favourite historic reading and he understood the value of a plan and the danger of sticking to it and the advantage of a big army for flanking and he manoeuvred a small one cunningly to make it a bolt at the telling instant dartrey fenellan had explained to him fredericks oblique attack napoleons employment of the artillery arm preparatory to the hurling of the cataract on the spot of weakness wellingtons parallel march with marmont up to the hour of the decisive cut through the latter at salamanca and skepsey treated his enemy to the like deferentially reporting the engagement to a chief whom his modesty kept in eminence for the receiving of the principal honours as to his men of all classes and sorts they are so supple with training that they sustain a defeat like the sturdy pugilist a knock off his legs and up smiling a minute afterone of the truly beautiful sights on this earth they go at the double half a day never sounding a single pair of bellows among them they have their appetites in full control to eat when they can or cheerfully fast they have healthy frames you see and as the healthy frame is not artificially heated it ensues that under any title you like they profess the principlesinto the bog we go we have got round to itthe principles of those horrible marching and chanting people then must our england to be redoubtable to the enemy be a detestable country for habitation here was a knot skepseys head dropped lower he went as a ram the sayings of mr durance about his dear england that her remainder of life is in the activity of her diseasesthat she has so fed upon pap of compromise as to be unable any longer to conceive a muscular resolution that she is animated only as the carcase to the blowfly and so forth charged on him during his wrestle with his problem and the gentlemen had said had permitted himself to say that our englands recent history was a provincial apothecarys exhibition of the battle of bane and antidote mr durance could hardly mean it but how could one answer him when he spoke of the torpor of the people and of the succeeding governments as a change of lacqueysor the pursestrings lacqueys he said that old england has taken to the armchair for good and thinks it her whole business to pronounce opinions and listen to herself and that in the face of an armed europe this great nation is living on sufferance oh skepsey had uttered the repudiating exclamation feel quite up to it he was asked by his neighbour the mover of armed hosts for the defence of the country sat in a third class carriage of the train approaching the first of the stations on the way to town he was instantly up to the level of an external world and fell into give and take with a burly broad communicative man located in london but born in the north in view of durham cathedral as he thanked his lord who was of the order of porkbutcher which succulent calling had carried him down to near upon the borders of surrey and sussex some miles beyond the new big house of a mister whose name he had forgotten though he had heard it mentioned by an acquaintance interested in the gentlemans doings but his object was to have a look at a rare breed of swine worth the journey that didnt run to fat so much as to flavour had longer legs sharp snouts to plump their hams over from spain it seemed and the gentleman owning them was for selling them finding them wild past correction but the acquaintance mentioned who was down to visit t other gentlemans big new edifice in workmens hands had a mother who had been cook to a family and was now widow of a cooks shop ham beef and sausages prime pies to order and a good specimen herself and if ever her son saw her spirit at his bedside there wouldnt be room for much else in that chambersupposing us to keep our shapes but he was the right sort of son anxious to push his mothers shop where he saw a chance and do it cheap and those foreign pigs after a disappointment to their importer might be had pretty cheap and were accounted tasty skepseys main thought was upon war the man had discoursed of pigs he informed the man of his having heard from a scholar that pigs had been the cause of more bloody battles than any other animal how so the porkbutcher asked and said he was not much of a scholar and pigs might be provoking but he had not heard they were a cause of strife between man and man for possession of them skepsey explained oh possession why weve heard of bloody battles for the possession of women men will fight for almost anything they care to get or call their own the porkbutcher said and he praised old england for avoiding war skepsey nodded how if war is forced on us then we fight suppose we are not preparedwe soon get that up skepsey requested him to state the degree of resistance he might think he could bring against a pair of skilful fists in a place out of hearing of the police say you said the porkbutcher and sharply smiled for he was a man of size i would give you two minutes rejoined skepsey eyeing him intently and kindly insomuch that it could be seen he was not in the conundrum vein rather short allowance eh master said the bigger man feel here he straightened out his arm and doubled it raising a proud bridge of muscle skepsey performed the national homage to muscle twice that would not help without the science he remarked and let his arm be gripped in turn the porkbutchers throat sounded as it were commas and colons punctuations in his reflections while he tightened fingers along the iron lump stringy youre a wiry one no mistake it was encomium with the ingrained contempt of size for a smallness that has not yet taught it the prostrating lesson he said weight tells in a wrestle skepsey admitted allow me to say you would not touch me and how do you know im not a trifle handy with the maulers myself you will pardon me for saying it would be worse for you if you were the porkbutcher was flung backward are you a professor may i inquire skepsey rejected the title i can engage to teach young men upon a proper observance of first principles they be hanged cried the ruffled porkbutcher our best men never got it out of books now you tell meyouve got a spiflicating style of talk about youno brag you tell mecourse the best man wins if you mean that now if i was one of em and i fetches you a bit of a flick how then would you be ready to step out with a real professor i should claim a fair field was the answer made in modesty and youd expect to whop me with they there principles of yours i should expect to bang me was roared after a stare at the mild little figure with the fitfully deadlevelled large grey eyes in front of him the porkbutcher resumed take you for the man you say you be youre just the man for my friend jam and me he dearly loves to see a setto self the same what prettier and if you would be so obliging some day as to favour us with a display wed head a cap conformably whether youd the best of it according to your expectations or t other wayfor there never was shame in a jolly good licking as the song says that is if you take it and make it appear jolly good and find you an opponent meet and fit never doubt ever had the worse of an encounter sir often sir well thats good and it didnt destroy your confidence added to it i hope at this point it became a crying necessity for skepsey to escape from an area of boastfulness into which he had fallen inadvertently and he hastened to apologize for his personal reference that was intended for an illustration of our country caught unawares by a highly trained picked soldiery inferior in numbers to the patriotic levies but sharp at the edge and knowing how to strike measure the axe measure the tree and which goes down first invasion is itand you mean were not to hit back the porkbutcher bellowed and presently secured a murmured approbation from an audience of three that had begun to comprehend the dialogue and strengthened him in a manner to teach skepsey the foolishness of ever urging analogies of too extended a circle to close sharply on the mark he had no longer a chance he was overborne identified with the fated invader rolled away into the chops of the channel to be swallowed up entire and not a rag left of him but john bull tucking up his shirtsleeves on the shingle beach ready for a second or a third crying to them to come on warmed by his bullish victory and friendly to the vanquished the pork butcher told skepsey he should like to see more of him and introduced himself on a card benjamin shaplow not far from the bank they parted at the terminus where three shrieks of an engine sounding like merry messages of the damned to their congeners in the anticipatory stench of the cabdroppings above disconnected sane hearing perverted it no doubt or else it was the stamp of a particular name on his mind which impressed skepsey as he bored down the street and across the bridge to fancy in recollection that mr shaplow when reiterating the wish for self and friend to witness a display of his cunning with the fists had spoken the name of jarniman an unusual name yet more than one jarniman might well exist and unlikely that a friend of the pork butcher would be the person whom mr radnor first prohibited and then desired to receive it hardly matteredconsidering that the dutch navy did really incredible as it seems now come sailing a good way up the river thames into the very main artery of old england and what thought the tower of it skepsey looked at the tower in sympathy wondering whether the tower had seen those impudent dutch a nice people at home he had heard mr shaplows jarniman might actually be mr radnors he inclined to think at any rate he was now sure of the name chapter xi wherein we behold the couple justified of love having sight of their scourge fenellan in a musing exclamation that was quite spontaneous had put a picture on the departing skepsey as observed from an end of the lakelands upper terracewalk queer little waterwagtail it is and lady grace halley and miss graves and mrs cormyn snugly silken dry ones were so taken with the pretty likeness after hearing victor call the tripping dripping creature the happiest man in england that they nursed it in their minds for a bewick tailpiece to the chapter of a pleasant rural day it imbedded the day in an idea that it had been rural we are indebted almost for construction to those who will define us briefly we are but scattered leaves to the general comprehension of us until such a work of binding and labelling is done and should the definition be not so correct as brevity pretends to make it at one stroke we are at least rendered portable thus we pass into the conceptions of our fellows into the records down to posterity anecdotes of englands happiest man were related outlines of his personal history requested his nomination in chief among the traditionally very merry islanders was hardly borne out by the tale of his enchainment with a drunken yokefellowunless upon the durance version of the felicity of his countrymen still the waterwagtail carried it skepsey trotted into memories heroes conducted up fames templesteps by ceremonious historians who are studious when the platform is reached of the art of setting them beneath the flambeau of a final image before thrusting them inside to be rivetted on their pedestals have an excellent chance of doing the same let but the provident narrators direct that image to paint the thing a mothlike humanity desires in the thing it shrinks from miss priscilla graves now fastened her meditations upon skepsey and it was important to him tobacco withdrew the haunting shadow of the rev septimus barmby from nesta she strolled beside louise de seilles to breathe sweetsweet in the dear friends ear and tell her she loved her the presence of the german had without rousing animosity damped the young frenchwoman even to a revulsion when her feelings had been touched by hearing praise of her france and wounded by the subjects of the praise she bore the national scar which is barely skinclothing of a gash that will not heal since her country was overthrown and dismembered colney durance could excuse the unreasonableness in her for it had a dignity and she controlled it and quietly suffered trusting to the steady tireless concentrated aim of her france in the gallic mind of our time france appears as a prematurely buried glory that heaves the mound oppressing breath and cannot cease and calls hourly at times keenly to be remembered rescued from the pain and the mouldspots of that foul sepulture mademoiselle and colney were friends partly divided by her speaking once of revanche whereupon he assumed the chair of the moralist with its right to lecture and went over to the enemy his talk savoured of a german our holding of the balance taking two sides is incomprehensible to a people quivering with the double wound to body and soul she was of breton blood cymric enough was in nesta to catch any thrill from her and join to her mood if it hung out a colour sad or gay and was noble as any mood of this dear louise would surely be nataly was not so sympathetic only the welsh and pure irish are quick at the feelings of the celtic french nataly came of a yorkshire stock she had the bravery humaneness and generous temper of our civilized north and a taste for mademoiselles fine breeding with a distaste for the singular air of superiority in composure which it was granted to mademoiselle to wear with an unassailable reserve when the roughness of the commercial boor was obtrusive she said of her to colney as they watched the couple strolling by the lake below nesta brings her out of her frosts i suppose its the presence of dr schlesien i have known it the same after an evening of wagners music richard wagner germanized ridicule of the french when they were down said colney she comes of a blood that never forgives never forgives is horrible to think of i fancied you liked your kelts as you call them colney seized on a topic that shelved a less agreeable one that he saw coming you english wont descend to understand what does not resemble you the french are in a state of feverish patriotism you refuse to treat them for a case of fever they are lopped of a limb you tell them to be at rest you know i am fond of them and the kelts as they are called cant and wont forgive injuries look at ireland look at wales and the keltic scot have you heard them talk it happened in the year its alive to them as if it were yesterday old history is as dead to the english as their first father they beg for the privilege of pulling the forelock to the bearers of the titles of the men who took their lands from them and turn them to the uses of cattle the saxon english had no doubt a heavier thrashing than any people allowed to subsist ever received you see it to this day the crick of the neck at the name of a lord is now concealed and denied but they have it and betray the effects and its patent in their journals all over their literature where its not seen another bloods at work the kelt wont accept the form of slavery let him be servile supple cunning treacherous and to appearance timeserving he will always remember his day of manly independence and who robbed him he is the poetic animal of the races of modern men you give him pagan colours natural colours he does not offer the other cheek or turn his back to be kicked after a knock to the ground instead of asking him to forgive which he cannot do you must teach him to admire a mercantile community guided by political economy from the ledger to the banquet presided over by its dagon capital finds that difficult however there s the secret of him that i respect in him his admiration of an enemy or oppressor doing great deeds wins him entirely he is an active spirit not your negative passive letterofscripture insensible and his faults short of ferocity are amusing but the fits of ferocity they are inconscient real fits they come of a hot nerve he is manageable sober too when his mind is charged as to the french people they are the most mixed of any european nation so they are packed with contrasts they are full of sentiment they are sharply logical freethinkers devotees affectionate ferocious frivolous tenacious the passion of the season operating like sun or moon on these qualities and they can reach to ideality out of sensualism below your level theyre above it a paradox is at home with them my friend you speak seriouslyan unusual compliment nataly said and ungratefully continued you know what is occupying me i want your opinion i guess it i want to heara mean thirst perhaps and you would pay me any number of compliments to avoid the subject but let me hearthis house colney shrugged in resignation victor works himself out he replied we are to go through it all again if you have not the force to contain him how contain him up went colneys shoulders you may see it all before you he said straight as the seine chaussee from the hill of la roche guyon he looked for her recollection of the scene ah the happy ramble that year she cried and my nesta just seven we had been six months at craye every day of our life together looks happy to me looking back though i know that every day had the same troubles i dont think im deficient in courage i think i could meet but the false position so cruelly weakens me i am no womans equal when i have to receive or visit it seems easier to meet the worst in lifedanger death anything pardon me for talking so perhaps we need not have left craye or creckholt she hinted an interrogation though i am not sorry it is not good to be where one tastes poison here it may be as deadly worse dear friend i am so glad you remember la roche guyon he was popular with the dear french people in spite of his accent it is not so bad and that youll defend consider these neighbours we come among they may have heard act on the assumption you forget the principal character victor promises he may have learnt a lesson at creckholt but look at this house he has built how can i any womancontain him he must have society paraitre he must be in the front he has talked of parliament colneys liver took the thrust of a skewer through it he spoke as in meditative encomium his entry into parliament would promote himself and family to a station of eminence naked over the clock tower of the house she moaned at the vilest i cannot regret my conductbear what i may i can bear real pain what kills me is the suspicion and i feel it like a guilty wretch and i do not feel the guilt i should do the same again on reflection i do believe it saved him i do oh i do i do i cannot expect my family to see with my eyes you know themmy brother and sisters think i have disgraced them they put no value on my saving him it sounds childish it is true he had fallen into a terrible black mood he had an hour of gloom an hour but an hour with him it means a good deal ah friend i take your words he sinks terribly when he sinks at all spare us a little whilewe have to judge of what is good in the circumstances i hear your reply but the principal for me to study is victor you have accused me of being the voice of the enamoured woman i follow him i know i try to advise i find it is wisdom to submit my people regard my behaviour as a wickedness or a madness i did save him i joined my fate with his i am his mate to help and i cannot oppose him to distract him i do my utmost for privacy he must entertain believe me i feel for themsisters and brother and now that my sisters are married my brother has a mans hardness colonel dreighton did not speak harshly at our last meeting he spoke of me he spoke in the tone of a brother victor promisesi wont repeat it yes i see the house there appears to be a prospect a hopei cannot allude to it craye and creckholt may have been some lesson to him selwyn spoke of me kindly ah yes it is the way with my people to pretend that victor has been the ruin of me that they may come round to family sentiments in the same way his relatives the duvidney ladies have their picture of the woman misleading him imagine me the naughty adventuressnataly falsified the thought insurgent at her heart in adding i do not say i am blameless it was a concession to the circumambient enemy of whom even a good friend was apart and not better than a respectful emissary the dearest of her friends belonged to that hostile world only victor no other stood with her against the world her child yes the love of her child she had but the childs destiny was an alien phantom looking at her with harder eyes than she had vision of in her family she did not say she was blameless did not affect the thought she would have wished to say for small encouragement she would have said that her case could be pleaded colneys features were not inviting though the expression was not repellent she sighed deeply and to count on something helpful by mentioning it reverted to the prospect which there appeared to be victor speaks of the certainty of his release his release her language pricked a satirists gallbladder colney refrained from speaking to wound and enjoyed a silence that did it do you see any possibilityyou knew her she said coldly counting the number of times he has been expecting the release he is bound to believe it near at hand you dont she asked her bosom was up in a crisis of expectation for the answer and on a pause of halfaminute she could have uttered the answer herself he perceived the insane eagerness through her mask and despised it pitying the woman and you dont he said you catch at delusions to excuse the steps you consent to take or you want me to wear the blinkers the better to hoodwink your own eyes you see it as well as i if you enter that house you have to go through the same as at creckholtand hell be the first to take fright he finds you in tears he is immensely devoted he flings up all to protect his nataly no you are unjust to him he would fling up all but his nataly prefers to be dragged through fire as you please she bowed to her chastisement one motive in her consultation with him came of the knowledge of his capacity to inflict it and his honesty in the act and a thirst she had to hear the truth loudtongued from him together with a feeling that he was excessive and satiric not to be read by the letter of his words and in consequence she could bear the lash from him and tell her soul that he overdid it and have an unjustly treated self to cherishbut in very truth she was a woman who loved to hear the truth she was formed to love the truth her position reduced her to violate she esteemed the hearing it as medical to her she selected for counsellor him who would apply it so far she went on the straight way and the desire for a sustaining deception from the mouth of a trustworthy man set her hanging on his utterances with an anxious hope of the reverse of what was to come and what she herself apprehended such as checked her pulses and iced her feet and fingers the reason being not that she was craven or absurd or paradoxical but that living at an intenser strain upon her nature than she or any around her knew her strength snapped she broke down by chance there where colney was rendered spiteful in beholding the display of her inconsequent if not puling sex she might have sought his counsel on another subject if a paralyzing chill of her frame in the foreview of it had allowed her to speak she felt grave alarms in one direction where nesta stood in the eye of her father besides an unformed dread that the simplicity in generosity of victors nature was doomed to show signs of dross ultimately under the necessity he imposed upon himself to run out his forecasts and scheme and defensively compel the world to serve his ends for the protection of those dear to him at night he was particularly urgent with her for the harmonious duet in praise of lakelands and plied her with questions all round and about it to bring out the dulcet accord he dwelt on his choice of costly marbles his fireplace and mantelpiece designs the great hall and suggestions for imposing and beautiful furniture concordantly enough for the large the lofty and rich of colour won her enthusiasm but overwhelmingly to any mood of resistance and strangely in a man who had of late been adopting as if his own a modern tone or the social and literary hints of it relating to the right uses of wealth and the duty as well as the delight of living simply fredi was pleased yes she was dear she is our girl my love i could live and die here live she may theres room enough nataly saw the door of a covert communication pointed at in that remark she gathered herself for an effort to do battle shes quite a child victor the time begins to run we have to look forward nowi declare its i who seem the provident mother for fredi let our girl wait dont hurry her mind to she is happy with her father and mother she is in the happiest time of her life before those feelings distract if we see good fortune for her we cant let it pass her a pang of the resolution now to debate the case with victor which would be of necessity to do the avoided thing and roll up the forbidden curtain opening on their whole history past and prospective was met in natalys bosom by the more bitter immediate confession that she was not his match to speak would be to succumb and shamefully after the effort and hopelessly after being overborne by him there was not the anticipation of a set contest to animate the womans naturally valiant heart he was too strong and his vividness in urgency overcame her in advance fascinated her sensibility through recollection he fanned an inclination lighted it to make it a passion a frenzied resolveshe remembered how and when she had quivering cause to remember the fateful day of her step in a letter received that morning from a married sister containing no word of endearment or proposal for a meeting an unregretted day if victor would think of the dues to others that is would take station with the world to see his reflected position instead of seeing it through their selfjustifying knowledge of the honourable truth of their love and pressing to claim and snatch at whatsoever the world bestows on its orderly subjects they had done evil to no one as yet nataly thought that not withstanding the outcry of the ancient and withered woman who bore victor radnors name for whom in consequence of the rod the woman had used this tenderest of hearts could summon no emotion if she had it the thing was not to be hauled up to consciousness her feeling was that she forgave the wrinkled malignity pity and contrition dissolving in the effort to produce the placable forgiveness she was frigid because she knew rightly of herself that she in the place of power would never have struck so meanly but the mainspring of the feeling in an almost remorseless bosom drew from certain chance expressions of retrospective physical distaste on victors parthard to keep from a short utterance between the nuptial two of whom the unshamed exuberant male has found the sweet reverse in his mate a haven of heavenliness to delight inthese conjoined with a womans unspoken pleading ideas of her own on her own behalf had armed her jealously in vindication of nature now as long as they did no palpable wrong about them nataly could argue her case in her consciencedeep down and out of hearing where women under scourge of the laws they have not helped decree may and do deliver their minds she stood in that subterranean recess for nature against the institutions of man a woman little adapted for the post of revel but to this by the agency of circumstances it had come she who was designed by nature to be an ornament of those institutions opposed them and when thinking of the rights and the conduct of the decrepit legitimatevirulent in a heathen vindictiveness declaring itself holy she had natures logic natures voice for selfdefence it was eloquent with her to the deafening of other voices in herself even to the convincing of herself when she was wrought by the fires within to feel elementally the other voices within her issued of the acknowledged dues to her family and to the worldthe civilization protecting women sentences thereanent in modern books and journals but the remembrance of moods of fiery exaltation when the nature she called by name of love raised the chorus within to stop all outer buzzing was in a perpetual struggle with a whirlpool a constant support while she and victor were one at heart the sense of her standing alone made her sway and a thought of differences with him caused frightful apprehensions of the abyss luxuriously she applied to his public life for witness that he had governed wisely as well as affectionately so long and he might therefore with the chorussing of the world of public men expect a woman blindfold to follow his lead but no we may be rebels against our time and its laws if we are really for nature we are not lawless natalys untutored scruples which came side by side with her ability to plead for her acts restrained her from complicity in the ensnaring of a young man of social rank to espouse the daughter of a couple socially insurgent stained to common thinking should denunciation come the nature upholding her fled at a vision of a stranger entangled pitiable to reflect that he was not one of the adventurerlords of prey who hunt and run down shadowed heiresses and are congratulated on their luck in a tolerating country how was the young man to be warned how under the happiest of suppositions propitiate his family and such a family if consenting with knowledge would consent only for the love of money it was angling with as vile a bait as the rascal lords humiliation hung on the scheme it struck to scorching in the contemplation of it and it darkened her reading of victors character she did not ask for the specification of a good fortune that might pass wishing to save him from his wonted twists of elusiveness and herself with him from the dread discussion it involved upon one point the day was pleasant to all except perhaps poor mademoiselle she said peridon should have come present or absent his chances are not brilliant i fear and pempton and priscy they are growing cooler with their grotesque objections to one anothers habits at table can we ever hope to get them over it when priscy drinks port and pempton munches beef colney says i should say when they feel warmly enough to think little of their differences fire smoothes the creases yes and fire is what theyre both wanting in though priscy has concertpathos in her voicecouldnt act a bit and pemptons
